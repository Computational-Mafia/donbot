His constant attacking seems kinda forced.<br><br>and to be honest My gut is not feeling frozen angel as well at the moment.</div></blockquote><br>I'm sorry was your 3rd sentence directed to me, since I didn't really understand it.</div></blockquote><br><br>Post 74 I comment How your post early game seem a little superficial not to deep with analysis. Two reasoning I give why it might be that way is that your newish (I didn't call you a noob) and it's early game.</div></blockquote><br>I actually completely missed your post, so sorry about that. I am admittedly newer to the more competitive ,shaw I say, forum mafia, but me not going deep into anything at the time of you making that post and even now is due to the fact I'm still forming opinions and also I am waiting on everybody to come in and catch up to the couple pages of hit and miss arguments. This is still pretty early game and we do have 2 weeks so I see no reason to rush into any non well though wagons and fire accusations with no real evidence to back it up.</div></blockquote><br>I like this answer I'm generally saying what's in my head at this time. Still through I do have a slight paranoia about you but I can't find anything to justify it.</div></blockquote><br>Honestly I belive its normal to have a slight paranoia. This actually gives me a good slight town-read. We are early game and very little things may seem scummy. That's why I love having long days since it really helps you get beyond that paranoia and follow people's though process to get good reads and form strong arguments."}

My point was you pretty much said he was town and solid points but that changed quickly when he voted you. You started pushing him for vote hopping. You never did counter his point you gave two bull shit copy and paste examples after being pushed like twice. -grey- might of accepted it but I don't. Also you when he backed off you said it was the scummiest thing to do despite claiming to counter his points on you. If he really was countered why is it scummy to go back to his primary scum read? Because the alternative is you feel like you didn't counter his points adequately and if so you would of mentioned it instead of claiming you won.<br><br>So basically you have thrown mud on your town read grey twice in a short span, One for vote hopping and one for getting off you.<br>If"}

That's a first. I am active but I'm not really going ham for reasons already explained. I would like to wait for everybody to post there first posts, so I can get my reads up. You can't start a disscussion when there are people who haven't even gotten into the game. We have 2 weeks to form opinion and to execute our game plans. Why should I rush something like that? You know if I was scum I would I want long days? I might be newish, but I'm not stupid. I want to prevent fast and unnecessary wagons until we have everybody up and running. I am getting into discussions and provoking reactions. Please reread the situation of Grey, since if you take anything in those posts seriously I think you need a doctor. As I said, if I was serious for a second about the Grey slip I would've started making a case on him and ultimately going for a lynch. In the light of that I don't see how this argument is valid. Why is post #268 so bad? And no, I won't vote you for something so little. What you did is gave you a slight scum read but this doesn't mean I would lynch you. When I see a target I am sure about you will see me attacking with full strength. I belive that lynching people is not always a good thing. It is a way of pressuring and a way of starting/continuing/finishing the action of killing. But it's also a tool that if placed wrong could get you lynched without doing anything. I belive we should deduce what people do and have discussions about it and then starting to throw pressure lynches and straight up wagon lynches. My vote on Screenplay was a RVS vote and I also have commented on the Screenplay situation. <br><br>While I say your post is good, you really don't give much on the other players exect pluses and minuses. Why would you even bother to comment on them if you are gonna point out how active they are."}

After this she is just defending herself from firebringers weak push (no offense buddy but your push on frozen seems kinda weak). Frozen angel to my memory is a paranoid player who is quick to push for reasons that puzzle me sometimes. She is not that she is not parinoid she is content with the situation she is in despite actually not hunting or anything.

I always have so many posts - thats just a part of me always being around because of my state!<br>- I made multiple stances! I have sirious reasons for voting you but you never tried to engage about it with me yet. You shipped FB's paranoia on me when it shaped, You're early game posting seems incredibly fake and your RVS seems really forced. You didn't try to reach out to anyone - but you're trying to stablish solid reasonable reads on people (It's like you want to have the \"reads\" without actually doing the scumhunting.)<br>- I always poke smelly things and make conversations out of them. I was trying to make anotora and grey engage each other to see what they make out of each other. I beleive Grey is town and there is still chnace for Anotora to be scum - though if they were a newbie I would count that slot town without hesitation.<br>and I'm practically observing pacho and screen atm<br><br>I always say! \"I won't vomit reads\"<br><br>no what do you mean when you say I didn't stablish solid reads less than 24 hours into game?<br>- I ask players opinions about the actions players took (and when I asked RC and Grey there wasn't more than one action to comment on anyway) I was thinking Anotora is more likly town for being so creamy - but there were contardictions on their post that I highlighted. what is the thing you're accusing me that I didn't do with that information? <br>- I am the same frozen - not preg - nor depressed. I'm calm and I want to do this in a more subtle manner. Don't say my scum games were less noisy as my town games - cause thats a really creepy bad lie.<br><br>and yeah this is town me.

I wrote this off as understandable through wrong in my head because it was early game. I responded with a light heart joke you joked back. You made no future attempt to justify your vote on me after the wagon and ignored me until you were brought into the spotlight. <br><br>2b- You accuse me trying to have reads with out doing the scum hunting? But it's pretty obvious I have been doing scum hunting and pushing my case. I have interacted with multiple players and developed reads from my interactions. This sounds like you are trying to make a excuse to stay on me but can't find a real adequate one.<br><br>3a. You find grey town ok that's fine but you find anotora scummy and you ignore the fact that I'm pretty much the one who started drove the wagon on anotora.

By the times you have posted a lot has happened I would expect better reads from you. You are the type of player who gets paranoid and with this amount of content I could see you actually get stuck into a player.

You ask opinions on what players think and don't follow up and you expect me to town read you because? You also expect to be town read for asking questions as well and not actually scum hunting because?<br><br>5-no i'm not saying they are less noisy. I'm saying your less noisyness here shows your are content with the game state and I don't think a town frozen would be content with her scum position in this particular scenario. Finally why did you even bring up anything about pregnant or depressed frozen I wasn't implying any of that or even thinking about it. So please don't bring your personal life into the game to try and try to make me look like a villain. I will accept a apology and move on with the game."}

I was waiting it to be brought to spotlight by you. You brought it up and used it to apeal to Fire and RC who knows me better - just to make them paranoid about me. Why me vote parking on you is scummy again in the first place? You know I was sleep when the game mostly progressed cause I'm in eurpe so - you obviously knew I couldn't change my vote during sleep and I never change my vote that fast even an RVS one unless if I feel its neccessary. Thats a fact about my vote in every single game.<br><br>so no. all you're points are practically - and generally false. and the fact you're saying I had no reason to keep my vote on you is also false (cause I just told the reasons) but you couldn't know my reasons cause I didn't told them publickly<br><br>so instead of asking the reasons if you were wondering about it why you think that was scummy?</div></blockquote><br>Great you don't say everything on your mind that's ok in theory but do you really expect me to believe that when you ask a question and don't follow up on it you are town?

I felt the same thing when you practically gathered what I forced antoro to tell in game to make a case against her which made you look townier. and then you make a case against me and you ask RC how he feels about that after stating you're townreading him without explaining your reasons.<br><br>thats what triggered my gut and why you deserve more pressure</div></blockquote><br><br>So you admit your accusation is baseless congrats. It's easy to see that your contentness to stay on a none serious vote is not town.<br><br>Oh look another bullshit reason you just made up.<br>You can see through out my posts that I thought rc was town. You even highlighted one of my posts and used it as a example to explain why it's obvious rc is town.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8681126#p8681126\" class=\"postlink\">post 88</a>, Frozen Angel wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8681107#p8681107\" class=\"postlink\">post 79</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">What scum would want to counterclaim miller especially this early in the game</span>.

I did prove that. You're saying I didn't take any stances while I did - You're argument is that I didn't announce them completly in thread before being spotlighted which is half false anyone who can Iso me can see where I explained how I feel about the stuff I detected. I didn;t follow them to a complete convo last night cause I had to sleep and I didn't follow them earlier today cause I was busy. You're saying this is not what you expect of frozen as she would made hard stances and push them down. I said I'm no longer that frozen and that frozen would do that as town or scum so not doing that is not practically proving anything. You're saying my case on you is crap cause I have no substantial point to follow it up, well I had and I explained them. You just clarified one of my points which is actually bugging but believable (regarding you're townread on RC)<br><br>there were some other arguments - I beleive you're accusing me of vote parking on you since last night and I answered its less than 24 hours in game and as I said I was busy to think and I didn't got any better hunches to follow. well be happy I want to change my vote atm cause i don't think my concerns about you are matching up atm.<br><br>the only other person I like to push right now is Anotora which I have a complicated feeling about. The points they make are scummy as their contradicting but their too consistent in what their doing which is as I said earlier make me feel their naive attitude regarding stuff is NAI. Because of that I like to see how will they react to other people pushing them.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Anotora</span>"}

I've had experience with players asking too many questions but not doing anything with the information. It is (as I think was stated by somebody) the best way for scum to look productive and fit in with town. But honestly this is the only good point I find in her, that I fully understood from her posts and the conversation with Garmr. <br><br>One thing I agree with on Angel is that it is too early for us to be pushing for a real lynch. Applying pressure and pushing buttons to get reactions and from the get answer to create reads and opinions - yes. Going for a full on hammer is definitely something we should not. <br><br>Really tho, after reading there argument I cannot stop myself thinking it looks like a TvT scenario. Angel can't really explain her case on Garmr, but her reaction and posts just don't really seem scummy. (Maybe because she is a female and this is actually not helping me get her character) ((I mean is she a female?) Garmr has a good read in my mind and his activeness and overall wanting to scumhunt and go after his targets and create good cases is signs of good town.

I really haven't engaged much yet directly with people like Frozen Angel and RadiantCowbells, but if you learn something from Pepcho's flip, you end up learning something about pretty much every other player in the game except kentofan.  And if Srceenplay winds up being scum, which is very likely, then you will learn a *heck of a lot* based on who was willing to defend his scummy activity and who wasn't.

I don't see your evidence, your quotes. As a whole I just see a try to make people belive in the same theory you have presented without any real evidence. And please stop says I defended someone I've had my lynch pn for almost the entire game and have persued to be scum in the past couple pages. It just doesn't fit in."}

I don't really care if he claims. Because I don't belive that claims really make that big of a difference. As I said scum will never say they are scum, so there is a 99% chance he is going to claim town. This doesn't explain his behavior. If anything if he claims it will seem more that he would like to cooperate. Combine this with him actually making a case on somebody and yes, he might escape the lynch. Him refusing to acknowledge people asking him to reveal his role just seems more scummy."}

I am not lynching nor am I going to vote for Grey today based off him being a jerk. I'm still on Srceenplay. When it is this early in the game and with no flip to analyze you go off what you have. What I have is knowledge of other games Srceenplay has played as town and this isn't it."}

I really haven't engaged much yet directly with people like Frozen Angel and RadiantCowbells, but if you learn something from Pepcho's flip, you end up learning something about pretty much every other player in the game except kentofan.  And if Srceenplay winds up being scum, which is very likely, then you will learn a *heck of a lot* based on who was willing to defend his scummy activity and who wasn't.  To be explicit about it, if Srceenplay flips scum, we can pretty much proceed to wagon Pepcho D2 unless/until new information comes up.<br><br>- I am an active poster, and that alone makes me worth keeping around.  At least I don't try to obstruct others from reading me the way Srceenplay has the whole game (and Pepcho has done on occasion with meaningless posts).  I'd much rather the town doesn't carry dead weight like Srceenplay on its back.  Even if I'm scum, which I'm not, wouldn't you rather have me be an obvious suspect later on, than be stuck with Srceenplay or Pepcho clouding the waters?<br><br>- Pepcho and Srceenplay are, in fact, scummier than I am.  Maybe I still have a long way to go, convincing people of this, but it's true.  All game long, Srceenplay's posts have been just terrible, and he's only improved them in hopes of warding off his newfound wagon.  Pepcho's gameplay, to me, absolutely screams out bussing.  Peeps like Garmr and Grey have been on my case for what feels like the lion's share of the day now, but my posting has wavered little.  You can't say that about either of them, and it's really suspicious.<br><br>I realize this post might make it sound like I favor a Srceenplay lynch moreso than a Pepcho lynch.  That isn't true.  I think Pepcho is a lot worse than Srceenplay because Pepcho has gone out of his way to defend another scummy player, while the reverse is not true.  But it seems like the rest of the playerlist sees Srceenplay as the main alternative to lynching me.  I'm okay with that, though not thrilled.</div></blockquote><br><br>What will you learn from a pep lynch if he is town?  What if he is scum?"}

Yeah.  Let's \"get the whole sentence.\"  I've got it right here:<br><br>\"He [Anotora] made some cocky remarks and this is something that is really suspicious to me.\"<br><br>That's the whole sentence.  Which you wrote.  There is exactly one noun in the sentence: remarks.  Specifically my remarks, which you modified with the adjective \"cocky\".  There are no other nouns in the sentence.  So clearly, when you used the pronoun \"this\", you must have been referring to the remarks, which you mentioned earlier in the sentence.  Therefore, we can take the pronoun \"this\", and we can replace it with its antecedent, \"some cocky remarks\".  Thus, the second independent clause in your sentence would read,<br><br>\"Some cocky remarks [by Anotora] [are] really suspicious to me.\"<br><br>But now you're trying to distance yourself from the fact that you said this.  Which is *scummy*.  This is my best shot at getting through to you why you deserve to be at L-2 or worse right now.  I don't know if it'll work."}

He is sometimes rude and even disrespectful. It's a thing that annoys some players and should be kept to a minimum imo. But this is besides the point. <br><br>First thing I find obviously suspicious is how inconsistent his read on the game has been till he latched on to me. He moved from null-town to null-scum all the time and overall didn't give any explanation for his actions. <br><br>The previous is further seen when he gives his reads. In the span of a couple of pages he changes them almost drastically and again WITHOUT explaining almost any of the changes made. This is inconsistent and strange. <br><br>Another thing is he is obviously very cocky and likes the use of sarcasm. This doesn't necessarily make someone look scim, but when you use it too much like in Grey's situation it's certainly fishy and annoying. <br><br>Let's not talk about his pretty disrespectful behavior in the argument against Frozen Angel. It seemed that he really just wanted to discourage her and provoke her. Wether she is town or scum it worked. And honestly Grey seemed to enjoy it. Again I saw traits in this segment that are not town like. <br><br>Lastly let's take a look at when he put my vote up. He apparently did it after I asked would Ano claim and if he would, will he. This would be ok, if he actually got on the make a bigger case after the lynch. When asked for one I got the same cocky remarks and more sarcasm. He purposely has ignored some of my questions and this has been confirmed by him (I will provide a quote if needed) and this again isn't town like. Why would he do that? Well in my mind I just see it as that he doesn't really have a good case on me on seems to not want to try and create one. <br><br>The vote he so desperately promotes to be lynched is one he can't or doesn't want to justify. This for me is disrespectful even. Even if you are right, whe. You lynch someone at least try to look convincing. But maybe you are. After you I'm at L-1 and only person that has tryid to get something from is someone who wasn't voted me yet."}

It might be to delude town and make sure they don't for solid discussions and in turn good targets. You also seem to be able to get people on stupid wagons with nothing to back them up, so there's that too. What you've done have a lot of scum motives imo. And all of that is feed up with fact that you ignore questions and even admit it, mock everybody, don't give a single good explanation and change your read on the game every page. <br><br>For me the better question is - What's the town motive in all that?"}

I've periodically expressed point on why I don't belive his playing style and dislike him as a whole. It's not something that came completely out of nowhere. Also my point were from the last like 2 days (since the game started) so I don't see how my points are old.

You cannot judge somebody's playing style of another game they have played. People change there metas and also they sometimes experiment. So it doesn't really matter if you know the people here that well. All you really need to do is read people's actions and create opinions. Then persue those opinions. <br><br>Honestly you won't know anyone better if you don't start being more active in the discussion. I doubt that the lynch we end up having today and the night kill will help you understand people."}

You cannot judge somebody's playing style of another game they have played. People change there metas and also they sometimes experiment. So it doesn't really matter if you know the people here that well. All you really need to do is read people's actions and create opinions. Then persue those opinions. <br><br>Honestly you won't know anyone better if you don't start being more active in the discussion. I doubt that the lynch we end up having today and the night kill will help you understand people.</div></blockquote><br><br>Actually the way I play mafia isn't as much on reactions, at least not in the first 'day'. I get a feel for everyone day one and then I use the lynch, flip, night kill, and wagons to deduce things. I have only played part of a game on this site but I have played a lot of games on other sites. You get so much info from a flip, well I do. Once I get that initial info I can start putting people to real reads. I promise if we could get to day two you will see more interaction from me. Right now it just seems to be arguing over the same stuff. We have nothing real to go on. I'm under the thought that with how many we have in this game we can mislynch one townie day one which is why I'm not too upset over who we lynch.<br><br>It's all about the wagons and how they form. If the person flips red the first ones and the last ones are more than likely town. The scum tends to lay in the middle. They don't want to be the one to start the finger pointing at their own people this early in the game but they also don't want to be the deciding vote for them to go unless it's the only way for them to look town. <br><br>The more we chit chat and attack each other for he said she said the more things get lost in the thread. If we have shorter days we get easier to read reactions. I know this is just my way of thinking so I'm not saying the long days are wrong they just feel very drawn out and broken record to me. Anywho we know there is scum in the most active players and someone is pushing the buttons."}

He is sometimes rude and even disrespectful. It's a thing that annoys some players and should be kept to a minimum imo. But this is besides the point. <br><br>First thing I find obviously suspicious is how inconsistent his read on the game has been till he latched on to me. He moved from null-town to null-scum all the time and overall didn't give any explanation for his actions. <br><br>The previous is further seen when he gives his reads. In the span of a couple of pages he changes them almost drastically and again WITHOUT explaining almost any of the changes made. This is inconsistent and strange. <br><br>Another thing is he is obviously very cocky and likes the use of sarcasm. This doesn't necessarily make someone look scim, but when you use it too much like in Grey's situation it's certainly fishy and annoying. <br><br>Let's not talk about his pretty disrespectful behavior in the argument against Frozen Angel. It seemed that he really just wanted to discourage her and provoke her. Wether she is town or scum it worked. And honestly Grey seemed to enjoy it. Again I saw traits in this segment that are not town like. <br><br>Lastly let's take a look at when he put my vote up. He apparently did it after I asked would Ano claim and if he would, will he. This would be ok, if he actually got on the make a bigger case after the lynch. When asked for one I got the same cocky remarks and more sarcasm. He purposely has ignored some of my questions and this has been confirmed by him (I will provide a quote if needed) and this again isn't town like. Why would he do that? Well in my mind I just see it as that he doesn't really have a good case on me on seems to not want to try and create one. <br><br>The vote he so desperately promotes to be lynched is one he can't or doesn't want to justify. This for me is disrespectful even. Even if you are right, whe. You lynch someone at least try to look convincing. But maybe you are. After you I'm at L-1 and only person that has tryid to get something from is someone who wasn't voted me yet.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8690017#p8690017\" class=\"postlink\">post 1127</a>, Frozen Angel wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8690005#p8690005\" class=\"postlink\">post 1124</a>, Pepchoninga wrote:</cite>I've don't belive I said Grey is misguided town.

In each of these scenarios, scum believe -Grey-'s claim at face value.  I feel that's likely.<br><br>IF RC IS SCUM:  -Grey- is going to die.  Scum is under significant pressure to protect RC from being confirmed scum by the -Grey-/FA role combo.  Their best shot at that is to frame FA as scum who killed -Grey-.  In this case, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">their optimal move is to no-kill and let -Grey- die from his weakness</span>.  If they killed someone besides -Grey-, the resulting two night deaths would confirm that -Grey- had a guilty investigative result on RC.  This is an unacceptable outcome for scum.<br><br>IF FA IS SCUM:  Since -Grey- will not die of weakness, there may only be one night death (a scum kill) or none.  -Grey- is not made bulletproof ascetic, because FA claiming rolestopper was a lie.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">If scum is going to kill N1, they should obviously kill -Grey-</span>, as they would rather the night result in a town death (-Grey-'s) and WIFOM over whether RC is scum or not, not some other town death and a living -Grey- who has innocent result on RC.<br><br>IF BOTH ARE SCUM:  -Grey- is going to die.  Scum gets to decide whether they want to kill someone else.  As we said earlier, two town deaths (-Grey- and someone else) would be tantamount to confirming RC as scum.  As in the first two cases, best to just let -Grey- die and thereby obfuscate who caused his death.<br><br>IF NEITHER ARE SCUM:  -Grey- is a bulletproof ascetic targeting town, so there is no way for him to die.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">This is impossible.  He died.  Therefore at least one of FA and RC is scum.</span><br><br>Let me repeat that.  If neither FA or RC is scum, then last night -Grey- would have been made a bulletproof ascetic who was, at the time, targeting town.  We know that this is not the case because he died.<br><br>We know <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">for a certain fact</span> that one of FA or RC is scum.

I did a very good job claiming it day 1 and I'm totally happy about it imo.<br>6. You are proposing a theory which is highly unlikly in my opinion. and no I'm proposing a 1 v 0 here (that I push you and you die) <br>7. I want to work with you if your town. You just need to resolve my concerns. and stop trying to manipulate my emotions. I'm really getting sick of this atm and I hate this game and I hate you for doing this to me.

Speaking of his srceenplay vote, he hasn't said a single word about it since that wagon turned serious.  Suspicious.<br><br>RadiantCowbells<br>+ Independent of others<br>+ Productive activity<br><br>Srceenplay<br>- Lurking with non-substantial activity<br>- Does nothing when called out on this<br>- Sheeps onto wagons<br><br><br>I didn't realize how strong of a read I would get going through Pepchoninga's ISO, but now I find him real scummy.  I think his strategy is to wait for a wagon that has a solid chance of resulting in a lynch.  In the meantime, he talks a lot but really says nothing.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Pepchoninga</span></div></blockquote><br>Good post, with actual opinion. That's a first. I am active but I'm not really going ham for reasons already explained. I would like to wait for everybody to post there first posts, so I can get my reads up. You can't start a disscussion when there are people who haven't even gotten into the game. We have 2 weeks to form opinion and to execute our game plans. Why should I rush something like that? You know if I was scum I would I want long days? I might be newish, but I'm not stupid. I want to prevent fast and unnecessary wagons until we have everybody up and running. I am getting into discussions and provoking reactions. Please reread the situation of Grey, since if you take anything in those posts seriously I think you need a doctor. As I said, if I was serious for a second about the Grey slip I would've started making a case on him and ultimately going for a lynch. In the light of that I don't see how this argument is valid. Why is post #268 so bad? And no, I won't vote you for something so little. What you did is gave you a slight scum read but this doesn't mean I would lynch you. When I see a target I am sure about you will see me attacking with full strength. I belive that lynching people is not always a good thing. It is a way of pressuring and a way of starting/continuing/finishing the action of killing. But it's also a tool that if placed wrong could get you lynched without doing anything. I belive we should deduce what people do and have discussions about it and then starting to throw pressure lynches and straight up wagon lynches. My vote on Screenplay was a RVS vote and I also have commented on the Screenplay situation. <br><br>While I say your post is good, you really don't give much on the other players exect pluses and minuses. Why would you even bother to comment on them if you are gonna point out how active they are.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>This is something though :/"}

You can stop signing up in the games I'm playing if my pressence is hurting you and again I'm not a jerk who is asking you to actually read the fucking game before repeatedly making absurd comments.<br><br>sorry if I hurt your feelings<br><br>I'm not that perfect person you imagined. I actually suck when it comes to manner and personality. Is this discussion over?</div></blockquote><br><br>Pep lynch does give information either way he flips. If you lead town on a mislynch today we get about as much info as we got from yesterday's ML. <br><br>I suppose it could be possible that you are mafia mastermind who ordered Pep to got kill. I think it was you who said \"oh looks like mafia went with the no kill gambit.\"  You completely understand the setup of the game but don't understand the functionality of your own role. Pep gets caught, \"ya we will get to him later.\"<br><br>Just spitballing ideas here."}

I know practically all the roles which were used in past 4 years on mafia scum. I am the designer of DotA mafia (its a moba open setup). Trust me I know how to make a setup and how to deduce one.

The only way for him being town is that there is someone else which is ninja (cause mandy - RC - Grey are not scum together - I bet my whole mafia career in this) So either way the best thing we can do is to get the scums out of pep - as we are NOT in danger of lylo and WE already have a decent town block"}

And if Srceenplay winds up being scum, which is very likely, then you will learn a *heck of a lot* based on who was willing to defend his scummy activity and who wasn't.  To be explicit about it, if Srceenplay flips scum, we can pretty much proceed to wagon Pepcho D2 unless/until new information comes up.</span></span><br><br>- I am an active poster, and that alone makes me worth keeping around.  At least I don't try to obstruct others from reading me the way Srceenplay has the whole game (and Pepcho has done on occasion with meaningless posts).  I'd much rather the town doesn't carry dead weight like Srceenplay on its back.  Even if I'm scum, which I'm not, wouldn't you rather have me be an obvious suspect later on, than be stuck with Srceenplay or Pepcho clouding the waters?<br><br>- Pepcho and Srceenplay are, in fact, scummier than I am.  Maybe I still have a long way to go, convincing people of this, but it's true.  All game long, Srceenplay's posts have been just terrible, and he's only improved them in hopes of warding off his newfound wagon.  Pepcho's gameplay, to me, absolutely screams out bussing.  Peeps like Garmr and Grey have been on my case for what feels like the lion's share of the day now, but my posting has wavered little.  You can't say that about either of them, and it's really suspicious.<br><br>I realize this post might make it sound like I favor a Srceenplay lynch moreso than a Pepcho lynch.  That isn't true.  I think Pepcho is a lot worse than Srceenplay because Pepcho has gone out of his way to defend another scummy player, while the reverse is not true.  But it seems like the rest of the playerlist sees Srceenplay as the main alternative to lynching me.  I'm okay with that, though not thrilled.</div></blockquote>"}

This means that he is usually constantly moving from slight town to slight scum leans. Atm tho he is a solid null. Frozen seems very shaky in her defense but I also belive she is town from her response and reactions. Fire's claim was beliveable enough and also while he isn't very active what he has done seems pro-town at least for now.

What I say is that I see a lust for a fast lynch in some people. That doesn't necessarily make them scum, but going for not well though lynch increases the chance of a misslynch. Pressure is made to force reactions which inturn help you to get a good case. And you should not feel rushed to do that. That is what I'm saying. If there is someone who does give a lot of food to fead upon and people have come to a consensus then by all means a lynch could happen earlier.

When there was such a large spotlight on the three of you I wasn't risking everyone piling on you and either wasting my power by; dying with you if someone killed you, having more than one person verify you scum/town, or you dying and the flip saying more than my power. I picked someone I didn't trust but was vocal and out of the spotlight on that whole scenario. Now I have someone not involved that I can trust his reads are town driven.

In #2724, Panther makes a brief case for Garmr-scum.  Thirteen minutes later, there's \"very little reason\" to question Garmr.  Panther is now ready to blindly follow Garmr's investigation and lynch Pepcho, who he had called a very likely town wagon thirteen minutes ago in #2724.  Actually, forget I said thirteen minutes.  Post #2728 tells us that his whole change of heart about Pepcho and Garmr changes not in thirteen minutes, but rather in the span of only six minutes.  Isn't it amazing how quick Panther's opinions can change?  To me, this is Panther having absolutely no conviction about him.  He didn't even need time to think about whether he believed Garmr's claim or not.  All he needed to know was that the town believes Garmr's claim, therefore he should back right off of Garmr and jump onto Pepcho's wagon, which he sees as a very safe place to be.<br><br>In #2735.  \"There is not required resolution of the other shit.\"  This tells me a few things.  It tells me that Panther is aware of others wanting to continue to scumhunt today.  He is opposed to this.  \"Why the fuck are we not lynching pepe.\"  Through tone, you get the sense that Panther wants Pepcho powerlynched and he wants it urgently.<br><br>#2727 is mostly Panther's confused reaction to FA's confusing post which badly misrepresented the game-state.  One of the most important things it tells us is that Panther was still confused at 8:58.  Besides that, check out how he says \"I won't get to [reading the game] til tomorrow or the weekend.\"  I'm still a big believer in lurking as a scumtell, though I acknowledge YMMV here.<br><br>But here's the biggest kicker.  This is how I know Panther's attitude towards Pepcho is totally fake, contrived only to fit in with town.<br><br>In post #2727, when Panther believes that the Gamma is the watcher with the claim of seeing Pepcho target -Grey-, this is his tune on Pepcho: \"So if it was a watch you don't actually know that's what killed him, you just know pep visited. so I'm assuming pep claimed something else?\"  Very defensive, you see.<br><br>This was my case on Panther before you hammered like a jerk."}

I will tell you the same thing I told him. I. Didn't. Trust. You. Yeah that flip from FA helped put you in town but yesterday your whole act put you back in scum. I don't play by yalls rules I play by my own and I investigate the loud players that I know have away with the group. Once I know they are trying to lead in the right direction I trust them. You fucked us over on Ant and gave scum another chance to kill and use powers by not killing pep. Now you want to lynch the cop? <br><br>And I wasn't nk'd last night because I made sure to make it seem like I was out of shots.<br><br>I will probably survive one more night simply cause I'm useless again tonight. I won't survive the next night. So we need to get things on a good path since you keep leading us astray RC.<br><br>Gamma's spot is pretty much dead since the new kid (which welcome, kudos on taking such a spot) confirmed the same role and FA seemed pretty certain that role wouldn't work as town. The fact that he dropped as well seems pretty claiming after Pep was lynched."}

Now I'm willing to give more time but I wasn't going to just let them know that. I'm lynching either Gammas spot or FB this phase. I reckon I will wait to decide."}

off so the best way to look at it is look at the vote count around Pep. If you look at these vote counts it's clear that the main 3 wagons of day 2 are Pep, Alisae, and Antora. Going off votecounts alone it should raise bells the main people on Pep's wagon are PP and mlmoo they stay on it the whole day so that made me give them some town points but the glaring thing I noticed was that Fire and Alisae never voted Pep once the whole day (Alisae did once but changed the vote the next page). Fire never voted Alisae either but they voted Anotora many times I think votecount 2.13 is the most telling <span style=\"font-style: italic\">especially</span> if you put in the mindset of those 2 being scum, 1 scum not being scum the other 2 trying to put a wagon on town while the others are spread out when the town is finally lynched Pep did a major fuck up claiming scum day 3 that could've been used to talk on events and who scum with Pep could be it would've gave a lot of info but Fire quickhammered the day making it quite hard to gather anything from that day. I think with all this info Alisae and Fingerbringer are both scum."}

I investigated Garmr so I could have an ally that was vocal with the town. I had it burned into my head that cops going after millers were pointless and didn't think about my own role could have fixed that claim. I then investigated RC because I had already pushed the idea of going after FB the first day and I didn't trust RC and with my ally garmr dead I needed a new one. Now that I am getting the impression that vanilla doesn't mean town here I am very suspicious of RC. You can take that info and do what you want with it once my flip shows I just honestly made a mistake and it wasn't scum strategy or slip."}

off so the best way to look at it is look at the vote count around Pep. If you look at these vote counts it's clear that the main 3 wagons of day 2 are Pep, Alisae, and Antora. Going off votecounts alone it should raise bells the main people on Pep's wagon are PP and mlmoo they stay on it the whole day so that made me give them some town points but the glaring thing I noticed was that Fire and Alisae never voted Pep once the whole day (Alisae did once but changed the vote the next page). Fire never voted Alisae either but they voted Anotora many times I think votecount 2.13 is the most telling <span style=\"font-style: italic\">especially</span> if you put in the mindset of those 2 being scum, 1 scum not being scum the other 2 trying to put a wagon on town while the others are spread out when the town is finally lynched Pep did a major fuck up claiming scum day 3 that could've been used to talk on events and who scum with Pep could be it would've gave a lot of info but Fire quickhammered the day making it quite hard to gather anything from that day. I think with all this info Alisae and Fingerbringer are both scum.</div></blockquote><br>Along with set up spec  but yes I should let everyone check in see if we got any cc's"}
