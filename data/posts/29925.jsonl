Townies get voted to L-1 all the time.  If you die, you can still win.  It's in your best interest to let the rest of the town gather as much info from the lynch as possible.<br>\n2. Not all L-1 wagons end in a lynch.  If you self-hammer, you're giving up on lynching scum before you have to.  Examples:  In the meta you referenced, on D2 lucky got voted to L-1 by the machinations of the ridiculously bad obvscum in that game (btw congrats on calling that game on day2, lucky).  If he had self-hammered, the town would in all likelihood have missed on the Jason lynch.  And in my ancient newbie <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=8379\" class=\"postlink\">here,</a> we got to a day2 L-1 on an unhelpful townie.  If he had self hammered, our cop wouldn't have been able to deliver a guilty on scum.  Further, he shaped up his play on day3, and thanks to getting cop cleared, he won the game for us in LYLO.  He actually said at one point:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=1136343#p1136343\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=1136343#p1136343\" data-post-id=\"1136343\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 294</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6801\">Sudo_Nym</a> wrote:</cite>But I'm also not a large enough asshole to hammer myself.</div></blockquote>\n3.

Plus, posted policy is extremely anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nAnd if you're town, here are some things to consider before you make a petulant OMGUS self hammer:<br>\n1. Townies get voted to L-1 all the time.  If you die, you can still win.  It's in your best interest to let the rest of the town gather as much info from the lynch as possible.<br>\n2. Not all L-1 wagons end in a lynch.  If you self-hammer, you're giving up on lynching scum before you have to.  Examples:  In the meta you referenced, on D2 lucky got voted to L-1 by the machinations of the ridiculously bad obvscum in that game (btw congrats on calling that game on day2, lucky).  If he had self-hammered, the town would in all likelihood have missed on the Jason lynch.  And in my ancient newbie <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=8379\" class=\"postlink\">here,</a> we got to a day2 L-1 on an unhelpful townie.  If he had self hammered, our cop wouldn't have been able to deliver a guilty on scum.  Further, he shaped up his play on day3, and thanks to getting cop cleared, he won the game for us in LYLO.  He actually said at one point:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=1136343#p1136343\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=1136343#p1136343\" data-post-id=\"1136343\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 294</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6801\">Sudo_Nym</a> wrote:</cite>But I'm also not a large enough asshole to hammer myself.</div></blockquote>\n3.  You know your alignment.  The mod knows your alignment.  If you're scum, your partner knows your alignment.  If you are getting voted to L-1 as town, it's because someone who doesn't know your alignment is mistaken about it.  It's obvious to you that they're wrong, but they aren't operating on the same information as you are.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It doesn't make someone dumb to draw an incorrect conclusion from incomplete evidence.</div><br>\n<br>\nNot comfortable with a vote on anybody yet, but we're getting there.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo why do you keep insisting that thinking you are scum is stupid?", "time": "Mon Jul 15, 2013 9:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29925&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "29925"}

The vast majority of the games I've played or run have been in meatworld.  When I was younger, we played once a month, but since I reached my majority (pun) I've played about twice a year in marathon sessions of 10-15 games.  I play with a board game group consisting of six regulars and occasional significant others and my Scout troop of 9 boys aged 11-17.  Because our games often involve children and inexperienced players, we tend to use simpler setups that finish quickly (although some of the older boys really like the dethy setup).  Because of this, every game I've played in the last five years has included exactly two scum.  Further, when I made that post I had just finished reading two Newbies (which of course contain two scum) and working a ridiculously long weekend, which may have affected my mindset.  <br>\n<br>\nI've completed six games on this site.  Three of them were mini themes, which usually have something odd in the setup, including one with three scum and a serial killer that could turn another player to form a second scumgroup.  One was a mini normal in which I was part of a two scum pair that had a third scum-aligned player who wasn't revealed until the end of the game.  Based on my experiences here, I'm not even close to being ready to speculate on the setup  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> <br>\n<br>\nA note on experience:<br>\nThe meta on this site is evolving constantly.  This likely means that you are all more familiar with how games are played now than I am, so I might miss some jargon or common knowledge plays that have become popular since my hiatus.  Also remember that while I've done this a lot, I'm still playing to win.  That's why I'll try to explain logically anything I say rather than justify it with experience, and why I won't accept \"oops lol im new\"  as an excuse for poor play.<br>\n<br>\nAnd wrecking Theo's alleged gambit to get reactions from feelit is yet another example illustrating why you shouldn't answer for other players.", "time": "Tue Jul 16, 2013 10:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29925&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "29925"}

I'm on a computer now.<br>\n<br>\nMy first little red flag was 59, where he says he doesn't like outing town tells because of the info it gives scum. I appreciate that to a certain extent, I've been mad when people will say someone is town because in certain contexts it can seal the death of someone useful (this happened in my last game). It's hard to say whether this is consistent with sthar's meta because his last game was 5 years ago, but I do think that it's a bit FAR to say that as a rule, one doesn't approve of outing town tells. By this logic, he should be accusing people who do like to out their town tells, which is like everyone, but he hasn't even mentioned it since.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing I'm noticing about him is just what he talks about. I'm just on page 3 and already most of his talk is about game theory, not actual scumhunting. He spends a bunch of time talking about how RC shouldn't be breaking the rules, but never mentions anything alignment related. He talks about good and bad play. He talks about meta. He asks people questions. He talks about game theory more.<br>\nWhat he never does is say \"X post is &lt;good/bad&gt;, here's why, I'm leaning &lt;alignment&gt; on this player\" or something along the lines of, you know, finding the mafia. It's the easiest way to fluff and look helpful.<br>\n<br>\nAs for a connection between him and theomoaner, I might have been wrong.

The logical conclusion to that is, in fact, that I will attempt to lynch a lurker day 1 if they cannot contribute anything real to the game.  I was under the (apparently mistaken) impression that pressuring lurkers, even to lynch, was routine and fairly common knowledge, but I'll elaborate on the reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n1. You accept that the goals of town and scum in mafia are different.  Further, you accept that the difference in motivation causes a detectable difference in posts.  If you do not accept these two things, then you believe mafia to be a game of pure chance, and no scumhunting would be valid at all.<br>\n2.  One of the goals of scum is to minimize the differences between their posts and town posts.<br>\n3. The fewer posts scum makes, the less opportunities they have to drop tells.<br>\n4. Lurkers are not always scum<br>\n<br>\nIf you accept these, it becomes a logical strategy for scum to simply not post, or only post the bare minimum required by the rules of the game.  Lurking scum gain the following benefits:<br>\n1.  Not posting means you do not drop tells<br>\n2. Since town has plenty of non-strategic reasons to lurk (new, confused, LA, etc), lurking is not inherently a scumtell, though it is better play for a scum player than for town<br>\n3.  Players will naturally focus on the more vocal, allowing lurker-scum to coast along with minimal effort.<br>\n<br>\nNow this means on a meta level that it is conceivably optimal for all scum to lurk every game.  This would lead to slower games with less activity and less interaction between the players, which is bad for the game as a whole.<br>\n<br>\nThe only way to counter this is to foster a meta in which it is not safe to lurk through a game.  That means that towns have to be willing to lynch players who are not contributing or only contributing the minimum.  Further, it makes good game sense to do so because:<br>\n<br>\n1.  Lurking is more beneficial to the scum win condition than the town one, making lurkers <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">slightly</div> more likely to be scum<br>\n2.  Players who do contribute generate more information as time goes on, while there is very little information to be gained from letting a lurker live.<br>\n3.  Players who lurk in the early game are likely to flake or cause difficult decisions in the endgame, to the benefit of scum.<br>\n<br>\nFor an example of lurker-scum, see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=8707\" class=\"postlink\">DarlaBlueEyes' posts in Mini 619.</a>  She skated through the first two days with multiple \"sorry guys I'll post later\"  posts, and likely would have lived to endgame if not for a countered role claim.<br>\n<br>\nAnother, far more interesting example is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4265233&amp;user_select=14166#p4265233\" class=\"postlink\">our own evilpacman18 in Mini 1364</a>.  Same deal, he skates through from day 1 with 22 posts including no real suspicions, a couple categorical dismissals of others' cases based on \"town reads\", and numerous promises to catch up and add content that are never delivered upon.<br>\n<br>\nParticularly telling from that example is the following:<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4364850#p4364850\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4364850#p4364850\" data-post-id=\"4364850\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 819</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14166\">evilpacman18</a> wrote:</cite>Lurking was going so well as an actual tactic too.

It's hard to say whether this is consistent with sthar's meta because his last game was 5 years ago, but I do think that it's a bit FAR to say that as a rule, one doesn't approve of outing town tells.

It would be incredibly easy for scum or bad town to leap onto either wagon, and there's not enough information right now to draw conclusions on anybody's actions regarding them.  I'm not saying those posts won't be useful later; there's just not much to go on right now and neither wagon is based on evidence, just like neither is generating interesting reactions anymore.  My wagon, however looks really promising right now, and it's always good d1 play to pressure lurkers.

Lurking is a powerful tactic as scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because it prevents other players from reading them</div>, which makes someone who is lurking more likely to be scum than town.  Since lurking players don't drop as many tells over the course of the game, they are more dangerous scum in the endgame.

If they don't respond at all they are likely <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">inactive</div>, and should be prodded until replaced.  If they respond when a couple votes are placed on them, you force them to drop tells and give reactions, which is protown.

Lurking should mostly be punished by the other players - not automatically, as some metagame set-in-stone law, but simply because lurking usually benefits scum more, and the threat of lynching is often the only way to get lurkers to speak up (which helps the town as well). Often the players rely far too much on the Mod to take care of lurkers for them - and in the case of deliberate lurkers, the Mod shouldn't do anything anyway (unless of course there are posting requirements as part of the rules, like in VM2).

Why should town players hold their votes until they're convinced of a hammer?  Without wagoning, where are you going to get the reactions that are so crucial on day 1?

Says i should logically be accusing people who out town tells.  Says its suspicious that on page three i'm talking game theory, encouraging good play over bad, and asking questions.  because i havent outed any alignment tells, he believes i'm attempting to look helpful without scumhunting.</div> <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Note that the first \"red flag\" point is equivocation. He says he agrees to a point, but that I take not broadcasting towntells too far so he finds it scummy.  In the post he's referencing, I say nothing about how far I'll take it, nor do I say that towntells are explicitly scummy.  I do say that I'll discuss them if they become relevant.  He doesn't say how discouraging bad play asking questions and discussing game theory is anti-town, he just suggests that I'm doing it instead of scumhunting.  On page 3.  For contrast, EPM's first real post is on page three, where he accuses the whole town of being idiots, says RC's tell on mnemonic is null, and asks questions to look into a theo wagon, which lead to nothing.  If my page 3 scumhunting was poor, then he must be my scumpartner.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">167: votes me</div><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I find it interesting that as per EPM's stated policy, this is when he becomes comfortable with the idea of me getting hammered and the day ending.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">173:  tells mnemonic he should replace out</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">178: calls mnemonic a child</div> <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Which is pretty ironic if I guess EPM's age correctly</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">192:  horse laughs and red herrings me</div> <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I think I've already addressed the garbage logic in this post.</div><br>\n<br>\nI haven't done one of these in a good long while.  If you have any questions please let me know.<br>\n<br>\nI started out expecting to find EPM mudslinging (four suspicions in two consecutive posts?) and generally trying to avoid pushing any wagon (equivocation on Feelit and Flench) while still trying to look town.  From <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=22959\" class=\"postlink\">the scum meta</a> I read on him earlier, I expected to see EPM trying to pick easy lynches that he could later say he wasn't part of (Theo early, feelit and flench later), and to see a bunch of poorly reasoned \"town\" reads and agreement as buddying(tybalt, RW, RC, jon, JJ).<br>\n<br>\nWhat I didn't expect to see, and am fascinated by, is the instant jumping on anyone who even mildly criticized him (me, theo, RW).  EPM looks to me like he's more concerned with how he appears to others, both today and tomorrow after the lynch, than with actually doing anything protown.  This is purely speculation, but EPM was outed as scum in that extracurricular reading by an investigative role.  Maybe he's trying not to get investigated so he doesn't lose the same way again?<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I certainly like this one more than a lurker vote.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: evilpacman18</span>", "time": "Thu Jul 18, 2013 8:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29925&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "29925"}

I think you're scum just trying to skate by, hoping no one starts noticing you. You've been staying under the radar for some time now, like almost the whole game.

You've made a few statements in your own defense, a comment about mnemonic's usefulness, the one post  on setup speculation, and the rest are trash posts that add absolutely nothing to finding scum. I'm pretty convinced you're scum, I'll only be moving my vote to help lynch someone who the majority finds scummy, probably closer to deadline.<br>\n<br>\nIn the off chance that you aren't scum, you better pick it up and do like your Avatar would do.

Agreed, there is a reasonable possibility that he is scum, but his interactions with others are so weak that there is little information to be gained about who his teammates might be.

I have strong town reads on Sthar(1), Radiant(2), Jon(3), EPM(4) and the AJ/JJ slot(5).<br>\n<br>\n(1): I never understood the scum reads on him, it seemed more like a disagreement with theory and playstyle he uses rather than actually thinking he was scummy. I think his PBPA on EPM is very wrong but the thought process comes across as natural as does the whole \"I don't care if the wagons on me, at least we have a wagon to analyze\" type attitude. I do have a few little harboring doubts but I'm shrugging them of.<br>\n<br>\n(2): I don't think scum would enter the thread with the whole \"Oh I'm the jester, read my role PM\" ploy whatsoever since it draws attention towards them but doing it as town to attempt to garner reactions to get a read from makes a lot of sense. I also think his constant vote shifts matches with confused town rather than opportunistic scum and there's really no care about the image he's giving of at all that I think scum would have.<br>\n<br>\n(3): The whole \"I'm a deer in headlights\" and the \"doubting all my scum reads because they're too scummy\" reads insanely genuine. I can follow his thought process a lot and the scumhunting reads legitimate. I'm going to feel like an idiot if this read is wrong because I'm very very confident in it.<br>\n<br>\n(4): This is partially meta based, I've seen EPM in a few games and as town he's a bigger 'personality' so to speak as in he's not afraid to state his thoughts of people and opinions without caring too much about the consequences. The whole \"I don't like votes being placed on the lead wagons\" isn't something I think he'd come out and state as scum while not having town reads on all of the players. Also him doing meta research to find out Devices confirmation voting thing being a null tell reads very town, mafia generally don't waste time doing meta research.<br>\n<br>\n(5): I think JJ's \"how many scum are usually in this setup\" is natural which means no inside information which means it's a town-slip, I also think his frustration is genuine and can follow his thought process a lot. And weirdly enough I think AJ not realizing that he replaced into JJ's slot is a big town tell, as scum I think he'd instantly have looked at his predecessors and partners play and therefore not said that he FoS's that slot.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to take a break, then I'll get through my thoughts on everyone else.", "time": "Fri Jul 26, 2013 8:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29925&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "29925"}

The selfvote makes a lot of sense as frustrated town and his read on Radioactive is rather decent. Only thing stopping him from being in the strong town pile really is that I didn't like his Radiant or JJ vote earlier at all.<br>\n<br>\n(8): A lot of the problem I'm having here is playstyle based I think because I'm having severe problems understanding his posts (I really hope I'm not the only one here that's not able to do it), his \"we should focus on lurkers\" type post early on doesn't match with his own activity level but I think that's due to him being V/LA so it's probably not a scum-tell.

Tunneling is a lot more problematic because there really is no consistency to look for at all. EPM, Jon (to an extent, just not having voted much) and especially mnemonicdevice are all subject to tunneling. The worst offender is by far device who was on RC for almost 9/10 of this game so far.

Sad fact but uh, I often don't read a lot of the mods posts (ie. Votecounts, replacement announcements) when reading through the thread catching up because I find that it just means I have more information in my head than I can cope with and it doesn't really help me scumhunting too much. Another thing is when I got my role PM it didn't state who I was replacing in it, the only way I knew was by someone filling the other slot before I requested to replace in so I think him not knowing who he replaced makes a lot of sense as town and don't think it means he 'hasn't read the thread'.<br>\n<br>\n5. The part that I agree with him completely about Radioactive is largely to do with the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Basically everything he has posted I can't agree with, when things don't seem logical to me I start to think he has other motivations for posting and voting as he has.\"</div> in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5162228#p5162228\">Post 376</a>. Radioactive really really doesn't seem to be hunting for motivations behind posts or attempting to contribute legitimate content and I struggle seeing any real town thought process behind his posts which really is why I don't understand town reads of mine reading him as town because either everyones right and I'm an idiot or I'm spot on and people aren't going back and ISOing him to notice the sheer lack of scumhunting. <br>\n<br>\n6. Eh, I wouldn't say that he's \"not\" actively lurking but I think his \"My other game has 3000 posts and has taken a lot of my focus\" attitude is very understandable, I used to overload myself in games too and it would lead towards me not keeping up with certain games that were lesser priority because of it (I don't anymore, learnt from that mistake) but it's something that I don't think is a scum-tell for him at all.<br>\n<br>\n7.

In mafia, as I am sure you know, this is what the business world would call a \"best a practice\". Something that should be done because it works best.

At first I wanted to avoid lynching him due to him being an easy target bandwagon that scum will often build. (look who is on the wagon). Flench selfvoting is awful townplay at best, downright scummy at worst which is what lowered my estimation of his alignment. I find theomoaner and Radiantwolf more scummy but the town is too split and divided to get a lynch on either of those two. There's been so much content in this game lots of us are confused and a no lynch will make this even worse and I strongly want to avoid one and I question the players putting votes on players you can see won't get lynched today.

The whole \"I don't like votes being placed on the lead wagons\" isn't something I think he'd come out and state as scum while not having town reads on all of the players. Also him doing meta research to find out Devices confirmation voting thing being a null tell reads very town, mafia generally don't waste time doing meta research.<br>\n<br>\n(5): I think JJ's \"how many scum are usually in this setup\" is natural which means no inside information which means it's a town-slip, I also think his frustration is genuine and can follow his thought process a lot. And weirdly enough I think AJ not realizing that he replaced into JJ's slot is a big town tell, as scum I think he'd instantly have looked at his predecessors and partners play and therefore not said that he FoS's that slot.\n</div></blockquote>\n(4)  That about fits with my read of EPM's meta.  The issue I have is that in this game, all his \"reads\" and \"pushes\"  appear to correlate to the players most suspicious or critical of him.  That doesn't read like \"without caring too much about the consequences\"  to me.  Also, I read the \"Don't vote unless you're ready to hammer\"  post as something he could point back to on day two after helping to reason out a mislynch to explain why he didn't vote for whatever wagon he wanted to push.  Effectively, he could drive whatever wagon he wanted as scum, leave only town votes on the record, then if he gets called on it he has a plausible explanation.<br>\n<br>\n(5)Not saying that AJ is scum, but that's a null-tell at best.  Equally plausible is that AJ replaced in thinking he was tybalt-scum, sees that he's been criticized for having no opinions, and rushes out an easy case.  A push on JJ would be easy to drop as his replacement started doing things differently, and equally easy to hound for behavioral tells that the replacement can neither fix nor explain.  JJ is an incredibly easy scum-target right now.<br>\n<br>\nDon't expect anything substantial from me today, but I will be reading along.  I will vote to prevent a no-lynch before deadline, but I will not vote theo or lucky unless they are literally the only option.

Either way, it's important now.<br>\nFirst of all, I think Flench is doing a lot better than he was earlier in the game, and it feels scum-led to me when a wagon picks up on someone and carries on but nobody thinks it's important to pay attention to the fact that a player has improved as time passes. Especially since scum typically play worse as the wagon builds on them, isn't that the idea behind \"pressure voting\" (which is stupid for other reasons than that but this isn't that conversation)? The inability of the lucky2u wagon to gain any steam when he's a pretty dirty scumbag screams scum-led Flench counterwagon also.<br>\n<br>\nI also like the consistency between his posts 351 and 376 where he says that he's focusing on another ongoing game more than this one, and then his posting gets better as the day in that game winds down and ends. Also if we assume that 320 is true (and he didn't care about this game because the other is more interesting) regardless of his alignment, then it looks really good that in 329 and 376, he actually tries to contribute more than he has been because if he was scum, he could probably get away with weak contribution based on his not caring about the game.<br>\n<br>\nSooo yeah I think Flench is town.<br>\nIn other news, I'm not there yet but it might be possible to pull me over to the Radioactive Wolf scum read side with enough convincing.

Right now I am favoring Radiant because (and this is what has gained me three votes) I changed my mind about my meta read on him. I went back to the previous game I had with him, where he played a doc. While he certainly ended that game with an overly dramatic self hammer, I realized I was letting his end of the game actions cloud my judgement over his over all play. At the start of the game he was very normal, he scum hunted, announced his reads regularly, and aside from a little fluff exchange between me and him, did nothing out of the ordinary for a player until he was under the knife. He was also paranoid about getting shot at night or mislynched during the day for talking too much. <br>\n<br>\nHere is a link to his ISO from that game: <a href=\"http://www.forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4974331&amp;user_select%5B%5D=20971#p4974331\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopi ... 1#p4974331</a><br>\n<br>\nWhen it comes to the other players though, I am a little more undecided.

You're saying there are distractions there, yet use it to test people. Funny because I've been calling you scum with cases and you reiterate with this shit. You said policy=/=principle so I went and proved that if you wanted to play a game of wording, you'd lose. Never responded to that. You asked where JJcool translated and what I meant by it. Cited specific examples. I gave my full list of scum reads, presented a case on how people have been being consistent thus far any you've still got an issue with it. You should just present a case and actually point what you're talking about because it is saturated with the dark side of the force. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, the tag system is failing hard for me.

While it was just a slip up by me, his reaction to it was pretty genuine, if just a little bit aggressive.

Lets use an example, lets say there's a watcher in this setup which is entirely possible since it fits with JK and 1-shot vig, if we mass claim mafia will just shoot the watcher tonight whereas via not massclaiming theres a chance they shoot Themoaner, watcher is on him and we get a guilty. Lets do another example, lets say our other role is 2 masons which fits with JK and 1-shot vig since neither are investigative (Would mean that scum would have to have a PR to counter it likely) and mass claiming just gets them killed. So no, we don't massclaim.<br>\n<br>\nThemoaner, while my town read on AJ is an 'opinion' I explained it in quite a lot of detail and really if my reasoning and reads are ignored what's the point in me spending time explaining them or even playing for that matter?

Also about your \"EPM is coaching\", lets get this straight because it's something that annoys me greatly, coaching is one of those 'fake' scum tells, people say \"oh coaching so scummy\" but it's not something that scum do more often than town and there's very much town motivation for 'coaching' a player if you believe they're town or potentially town and making mistakes or even if you think they're scum and are trying to not read them based on noob tells.

Also you  accuse me  of \"&#246;mgus\" for making a case against impetus, who presumably has an intent vote on me? That's anti-logic.... Feel it has a medium-large post count, and has done more than not contribute, he also threw weak  suspicion at people just to fish for waht would stick, and I can't see the process of how he changes his suspicion out of his posts. I'm going for easy lynches? Four people have town reads on impetus, and feelit is active enough to make efforts to scumhunt or open up viable discussions. I'm assuming that the other people who've done \"what feel it is doing\" are mmnemoic and flench? That's a fair accusation, but I had to defend town mnemoci from a mislynch in our last game together, and his posts very similiar, also they give you an idea of how his thought process shapes out, and I don't see his posts coming at times when a scum agenda would be viable, such as when someone gives an awful response to a question or when a wagon is first defended. <br>\n<br>\nflench made awful posts during early day 1, but then became towny by making logical pursuits, The most suspicous thing is that the wagon on him ended with him as a null read to most of the participants, where a town backed wagon really ought to have kept pushing until he flipped scum or convinced them of town... I'll have to reread that...<br>\n<br>\nI see Impetus  backing down when you made the first hard vote on me as the most scummy thing that's happened on d2.<br>\n@Impetus I made an early case against theomoaner d1 because I didn't like the reasons he used for voting radiant, later, I looked at the intent of his posts, and really he tries to get people to discuss things or break down how they built their case, so I unvoted him as a town read.

Voting without posting naturally leads itself to the argument that your vote is less valid because you didn't read the thread. It can be quickly dismissed. You can be painted as a player who doesn't need the whole picture to vote, which is dumb or scum. I don't think you are either, I just think you should keep that mind for the future.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the Flench post, he said there's more mafia than feelit. There's two ways of interpreting that, that's why I'm not so sure it is a slip. If it is, Flench confessed Feelit is scum, so I'd rather keep my vote on Feelit.", "time": "Sun Aug 11, 2013 6:52 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29925&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "29925"}
