You're obviously capable of it.<br><br>It's not always optimal scum play to self-hammer.  In fact, it's usually not.  Plus, posted policy is extremely anti-town.<br><br>And if you're town, here are some things to consider before you make a petulant OMGUS self hammer:<br>1. Townies get voted to L-1 all the time.  If you die, you can still win.  It's in your best interest to let the rest of the town gather as much info from the lynch as possible.<br>2. Not all L-1 wagons end in a lynch.  If you self-hammer, you're giving up on lynching scum before you have to.  Examples:  In the meta you referenced, on D2 lucky got voted to L-1 by the machinations of the ridiculously bad obvscum in that game (btw congrats on calling that game on day2, lucky).  If he had self-hammered, the town would in all likelihood have missed on the Jason lynch.  And in my ancient newbie <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=8379\" class=\"postlink\">here,</a> we got to a day2 L-1 on an unhelpful townie.  If he had self hammered, our cop wouldn't have been able to deliver a guilty on scum.  Further, he shaped up his play on day3, and thanks to getting cop cleared, he won the game for us in LYLO.  He actually said at one point:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=1136343#p1136343\" class=\"postlink\">post 294</a>, Sudo_Nym wrote:</cite>But I'm also not a large enough asshole to hammer myself.</div></blockquote><br>3.  You know your alignment.  The mod knows your alignment.  If you're scum, your partner knows your alignment.  If you are getting voted to L-1 as town, it's because someone who doesn't know your alignment is mistaken about it.  It's obvious to you that they're wrong, but they aren't operating on the same information as you are.  It doesn't make someone dumb to draw an incorrect conclusion from incomplete evidence.<br><br>Not comfortable with a vote on anybody yet, but we're getting there."}

Plus, posted policy is extremely anti-town.<br><br>And if you're town, here are some things to consider before you make a petulant OMGUS self hammer:<br>1. Townies get voted to L-1 all the time.  If you die, you can still win.  It's in your best interest to let the rest of the town gather as much info from the lynch as possible.<br>2. Not all L-1 wagons end in a lynch.  If you self-hammer, you're giving up on lynching scum before you have to.  Examples:  In the meta you referenced, on D2 lucky got voted to L-1 by the machinations of the ridiculously bad obvscum in that game (btw congrats on calling that game on day2, lucky).  If he had self-hammered, the town would in all likelihood have missed on the Jason lynch.  And in my ancient newbie <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=8379\" class=\"postlink\">here,</a> we got to a day2 L-1 on an unhelpful townie.  If he had self hammered, our cop wouldn't have been able to deliver a guilty on scum.  Further, he shaped up his play on day3, and thanks to getting cop cleared, he won the game for us in LYLO.  He actually said at one point:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=1136343#p1136343\" class=\"postlink\">post 294</a>, Sudo_Nym wrote:</cite>But I'm also not a large enough asshole to hammer myself.</div></blockquote><br>3.  You know your alignment.  The mod knows your alignment.  If you're scum, your partner knows your alignment.  If you are getting voted to L-1 as town, it's because someone who doesn't know your alignment is mistaken about it.  It's obvious to you that they're wrong, but they aren't operating on the same information as you are.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">It doesn't make someone dumb to draw an incorrect conclusion from incomplete evidence.</span><br><br>Not comfortable with a vote on anybody yet, but we're getting there.</div></blockquote><br><br>So why do you keep insisting that thinking you are scum is stupid?"}

Too late though now JJ has explained it.<br></div></blockquote><br>A little context for my comment:<br>I've been playing mafia for 18 years.  The vast majority of the games I've played or run have been in meatworld.  When I was younger, we played once a month, but since I reached my majority (pun) I've played about twice a year in marathon sessions of 10-15 games.  I play with a board game group consisting of six regulars and occasional significant others and my Scout troop of 9 boys aged 11-17.  Because our games often involve children and inexperienced players, we tend to use simpler setups that finish quickly (although some of the older boys really like the dethy setup).  Because of this, every game I've played in the last five years has included exactly two scum.  Further, when I made that post I had just finished reading two Newbies (which of course contain two scum) and working a ridiculously long weekend, which may have affected my mindset.  <br><br>I've completed six games on this site.  Three of them were mini themes, which usually have something odd in the setup, including one with three scum and a serial killer that could turn another player to form a second scumgroup.  One was a mini normal in which I was part of a two scum pair that had a third scum-aligned player who wasn't revealed until the end of the game.  Based on my experiences here, I'm not even close to being ready to speculate on the setup  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> <br><br>A note on experience:<br>The meta on this site is evolving constantly.  This likely means that you are all more familiar with how games are played now than I am, so I might miss some jargon or common knowledge plays that have become popular since my hiatus.  Also remember that while I've done this a lot, I'm still playing to win.  That's why I'll try to explain logically anything I say rather than justify it with experience, and why I won't accept \"oops lol im new\"  as an excuse for poor play.<br><br>And wrecking Theo's alleged gambit to get reactions from feelit is yet another example illustrating why you shouldn't answer for other players."}

I'm on a computer now.<br><br>My first little red flag was 59, where he says he doesn't like outing town tells because of the info it gives scum. I appreciate that to a certain extent, I've been mad when people will say someone is town because in certain contexts it can seal the death of someone useful (this happened in my last game). It's hard to say whether this is consistent with sthar's meta because his last game was 5 years ago, but I do think that it's a bit FAR to say that as a rule, one doesn't approve of outing town tells. By this logic, he should be accusing people who do like to out their town tells, which is like everyone, but he hasn't even mentioned it since.<br><br>Another thing I'm noticing about him is just what he talks about. I'm just on page 3 and already most of his talk is about game theory, not actual scumhunting. He spends a bunch of time talking about how RC shouldn't be breaking the rules, but never mentions anything alignment related. He talks about good and bad play. He talks about meta. He asks people questions. He talks about game theory more.<br>What he never does is say \"X post is &lt;good/bad&gt;, here's why, I'm leaning &lt;alignment&gt; on this player\" or something along the lines of, you know, finding the mafia. It's the easiest way to fluff and look helpful.<br><br>As for a connection between him and theomoaner, I might have been wrong. I'll keep thinking about this one, I'd love other peoples' (JJ?) opinions on their exchange between 94 and 99 and theomoaner's post 116."}

The logical conclusion to that is, in fact, that I will attempt to lynch a lurker day 1 if they cannot contribute anything real to the game.  I was under the (apparently mistaken) impression that pressuring lurkers, even to lynch, was routine and fairly common knowledge, but I'll elaborate on the reasoning.<br><br>1. You accept that the goals of town and scum in mafia are different.  Further, you accept that the difference in motivation causes a detectable difference in posts.  If you do not accept these two things, then you believe mafia to be a game of pure chance, and no scumhunting would be valid at all.<br>2.  One of the goals of scum is to minimize the differences between their posts and town posts.<br>3. The fewer posts scum makes, the less opportunities they have to drop tells.<br>4. Lurkers are not always scum<br><br>If you accept these, it becomes a logical strategy for scum to simply not post, or only post the bare minimum required by the rules of the game.  Lurking scum gain the following benefits:<br>1.  Not posting means you do not drop tells<br>2. Since town has plenty of non-strategic reasons to lurk (new, confused, LA, etc), lurking is not inherently a scumtell, though it is better play for a scum player than for town<br>3.  Players will naturally focus on the more vocal, allowing lurker-scum to coast along with minimal effort.<br><br>Now this means on a meta level that it is conceivably optimal for all scum to lurk every game.  This would lead to slower games with less activity and less interaction between the players, which is bad for the game as a whole.<br><br>The only way to counter this is to foster a meta in which it is not safe to lurk through a game.  That means that towns have to be willing to lynch players who are not contributing or only contributing the minimum.  Further, it makes good game sense to do so because:<br><br>1.  Lurking is more beneficial to the scum win condition than the town one, making lurkers <span style=\"font-style: italic\">slightly</span> more likely to be scum<br>2.  Players who do contribute generate more information as time goes on, while there is very little information to be gained from letting a lurker live.<br>3.  Players who lurk in the early game are likely to flake or cause difficult decisions in the endgame, to the benefit of scum.<br><br>For an example of lurker-scum, see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=8707\" class=\"postlink\">DarlaBlueEyes' posts in Mini 619.</a>  She skated through the first two days with multiple \"sorry guys I'll post later\"  posts, and likely would have lived to endgame if not for a countered role claim.<br><br>Another, far more interesting example is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4265233&amp;user_select=14166#p4265233\" class=\"postlink\">our own evilpacman18 in Mini 1364</a>.  Same deal, he skates through from day 1 with 22 posts including no real suspicions, a couple categorical dismissals of others' cases based on \"town reads\", and numerous promises to catch up and add content that are never delivered upon.<br><br>Particularly telling from that example is the following:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4364850#p4364850\" class=\"postlink\">post 819</a>, evilpacman18 wrote:</cite>Lurking was going so well as an actual tactic too.

I appreciate that to a certain extent, I've been mad when people will say someone is town because in certain contexts it can seal the death of someone useful (this happened in my last game). It's hard to say whether this is consistent with sthar's meta because his last game was 5 years ago, but I do think that it's a bit FAR to say that as a rule, one doesn't approve of outing town tells. By this logic, he should be accusing people who do like to out their town tells, which is like everyone, but he hasn't even mentioned it since.</div></blockquote><br>Wait.  Why should I be accusing people of being scum for a playstyle difference?  I think its <span style=\"font-style: italic\">dumb</span> to out towntells.

It doesn't mean anything about their alignment.<br><br>And I did point out that I don't like broadcasting towntells because they're inconclusive and they give scum information.  When you all decided to ignore that and keep posting them, should I have been jumping around every towntell in the thread with a sign that said \"LOOK HERE, SCUM.

You know it, I know it, a couple of people have commented on it.  The cowbell wagon boils down to \"Cowbell is playing badly!\" which is a null tell, and Theo's mistaking Cowbell's bad play as a scumtell which I've already discussed with him.  It would be incredibly easy for scum or bad town to leap onto either wagon, and there's not enough information right now to draw conclusions on anybody's actions regarding them.  I'm not saying those posts won't be useful later; there's just not much to go on right now and neither wagon is based on evidence, just like neither is generating interesting reactions anymore.  My wagon, however looks really promising right now, and it's always good d1 play to pressure lurkers.

He says he agrees to a point, but that I take not broadcasting towntells too far so he finds it scummy.  In the post he's referencing, I say nothing about how far I'll take it, nor do I say that towntells are explicitly scummy.  I do say that I'll discuss them if they become relevant.  He doesn't say how discouraging bad play asking questions and discussing game theory is anti-town, he just suggests that I'm doing it instead of scumhunting.  On page 3.  For contrast, EPM's first real post is on page three, where he accuses the whole town of being idiots, says RC's tell on mnemonic is null, and asks questions to look into a theo wagon, which lead to nothing.  If my page 3 scumhunting was poor, then he must be my scumpartner.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">167: votes me</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I find it interesting that as per EPM's stated policy, this is when he becomes comfortable with the idea of me getting hammered and the day ending.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">173:  tells mnemonic he should replace out</span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">178: calls mnemonic a child</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Which is pretty ironic if I guess EPM's age correctly</span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">192:  horse laughs and red herrings me</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I think I've already addressed the garbage logic in this post.</span><br><br>I haven't done one of these in a good long while.  If you have any questions please let me know.<br><br>I started out expecting to find EPM mudslinging (four suspicions in two consecutive posts?) and generally trying to avoid pushing any wagon (equivocation on Feelit and Flench) while still trying to look town.  From <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=22959\" class=\"postlink\">the scum meta</a> I read on him earlier, I expected to see EPM trying to pick easy lynches that he could later say he wasn't part of (Theo early, feelit and flench later), and to see a bunch of poorly reasoned \"town\" reads and agreement as buddying(tybalt, RW, RC, jon, JJ).<br><br>What I didn't expect to see, and am fascinated by, is the instant jumping on anyone who even mildly criticized him (me, theo, RW).  EPM looks to me like he's more concerned with how he appears to others, both today and tomorrow after the lynch, than with actually doing anything protown.  This is purely speculation, but EPM was outed as scum in that extracurricular reading by an investigative role.  Maybe he's trying not to get investigated so he doesn't lose the same way again?<br><br>Anyway, I certainly like this one more than a lurker vote.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: evilpacman18</span>"}

You've made a few statements in your own defense, a comment about mnemonic's usefulness, the one post  on setup speculation, and the rest are trash posts that add absolutely nothing to finding scum.

I have strong town reads on Sthar(1), Radiant(2), Jon(3), EPM(4) and the AJ/JJ slot(5).<br><br>(1): I never understood the scum reads on him, it seemed more like a disagreement with theory and playstyle he uses rather than actually thinking he was scummy. I think his PBPA on EPM is very wrong but the thought process comes across as natural as does the whole \"I don't care if the wagons on me, at least we have a wagon to analyze\" type attitude. I do have a few little harboring doubts but I'm shrugging them of.<br><br>(2): I don't think scum would enter the thread with the whole \"Oh I'm the jester, read my role PM\" ploy whatsoever since it draws attention towards them but doing it as town to attempt to garner reactions to get a read from makes a lot of sense. I also think his constant vote shifts matches with confused town rather than opportunistic scum and there's really no care about the image he's giving of at all that I think scum would have.<br><br>(3): The whole \"I'm a deer in headlights\" and the \"doubting all my scum reads because they're too scummy\" reads insanely genuine. I can follow his thought process a lot and the scumhunting reads legitimate. I'm going to feel like an idiot if this read is wrong because I'm very very confident in it.<br><br>(4): This is partially meta based, I've seen EPM in a few games and as town he's a bigger 'personality' so to speak as in he's not afraid to state his thoughts of people and opinions without caring too much about the consequences. The whole \"I don't like votes being placed on the lead wagons\" isn't something I think he'd come out and state as scum while not having town reads on all of the players. Also him doing meta research to find out Devices confirmation voting thing being a null tell reads very town, mafia generally don't waste time doing meta research.<br><br>(5): I think JJ's \"how many scum are usually in this setup\" is natural which means no inside information which means it's a town-slip, I also think his frustration is genuine and can follow his thought process a lot. And weirdly enough I think AJ not realizing that he replaced into JJ's slot is a big town tell, as scum I think he'd instantly have looked at his predecessors and partners play and therefore not said that he FoS's that slot.<br><br>I'm going to take a break, then I'll get through my thoughts on everyone else."}

I haven't much of a clue / am very conflicted about N64(8) and Mnemonic(9).<br><br>(6): This is a weaker read because I'm not entirely sure how to explain it which makes me worry it's gut based and I'm not a big fan of putting a lot of trust into my gut reads based or met reads. The only way I can really explain what I'm seeing here is that his reads, vote changes and content all read as natural to me. Blah. I guess it is partially gut based.<br><br>(7): I think his whole reads list on everyone read natural, especially liked the \"Idk, I can't decide if it's genuine\" type read that he has on Lucky and the \"understand his reasoning which is important\" on Jon, both don't seem contrived at all. The selfvote makes a lot of sense as frustrated town and his read on Radioactive is rather decent. Only thing stopping him from being in the strong town pile really is that I didn't like his Radiant or JJ vote earlier at all.<br><br>(8): A lot of the problem I'm having here is playstyle based I think because I'm having severe problems understanding his posts (I really hope I'm not the only one here that's not able to do it), his \"we should focus on lurkers\" type post early on doesn't match with his own activity level but I think that's due to him being V/LA so it's probably not a scum-tell. I do like his reasoning for his Feel scum read but gah I'm struggling reading him.<br><br>(9): I found his \"Anyone want to help me quicklynching the scum\" to be a slight town tell and think the admittance of OMGUSing is more likely to come from town but don't like his vote on Flench, reads as opportunistic.

The \"I've lost tract of the game I'll do more tomorrow\" seems to be essentially an attempt at begging for another day and the town read on Fletch that came out of nowhere with no reasoning attached reads as fake. This is probably my strongest scum read right now but I want to go over him again after I get some sleep to make sure I'm not already in a tunnel, consider me stating that this is where I'm likely to vote in 12 or so hours after some sleep though.<br><br>(12): I want to read some of his meta but don't have the time right now, I'll do this later because I'm finding his (Apologies if this is 'harsh') sheer uselessness scummy. I didn't like his reaction to Radiants gambit nor did I like his whole \"I'll probably sheep you but I will keep an eye on you\" and I really really didn't like the \"Yet turning on me when we were both town is exactly what you did Judas\" comment, read as an attempt at emotional manipulation but there's a lot of posts that show that he's read and up to date with the thread but have a real lack of analysis and like I said \"useless\", if I get time when I wake up I'll let you know what I find from his meta but lynch wise I prefer Feel It over him if they're the two likely lynches.<br><br>And with that night; I'll probably be unable to sleep though because I struggle getting scumhunting out of my head, bleh."}

I don't, if you get into the \"Scum could do X to make you think Y\" line of thinking then essentially every single town or scum tell could be debated and argued and if every tell is going to be argued no conclusion is ever going to be drawn.<br><br>2. I have never played with him or even seen a game of his. Might be worth doing but that's super low priority for me right now given deadlines not far away and any spare time I get I want to spend on people I actually think have a decent likelihood of being scum.<br><br>3. Not entirely sure what you're getting at with this? I think his \"I'm curious what others have to say\" is somewhat understandable in that I sometimes worry that if I'm too forceful with my reads and thoughts I'm just going to have everyone agree with me rather than state their own opinions which means that I don't get that opportunity to read them from it and if I'm wrong I don't get a chance to have it pointed out by someone beforehand.<br><br>4. Sad fact but uh, I often don't read a lot of the mods posts (ie. Votecounts, replacement announcements) when reading through the thread catching up because I find that it just means I have more information in my head than I can cope with and it doesn't really help me scumhunting too much. Another thing is when I got my role PM it didn't state who I was replacing in it, the only way I knew was by someone filling the other slot before I requested to replace in so I think him not knowing who he replaced makes a lot of sense as town and don't think it means he 'hasn't read the thread'.<br><br>5. The part that I agree with him completely about Radioactive is largely to do with the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Basically everything he has posted I can't agree with, when things don't seem logical to me I start to think he has other motivations for posting and voting as he has.\"</span> in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5162228#p5162228\">Post 376</a>. Radioactive really really doesn't seem to be hunting for motivations behind posts or attempting to contribute legitimate content and I struggle seeing any real town thought process behind his posts which really is why I don't understand town reads of mine reading him as town because either everyones right and I'm an idiot or I'm spot on and people aren't going back and ISOing him to notice the sheer lack of scumhunting. <br><br>6. Eh, I wouldn't say that he's \"not\" actively lurking but I think his \"My other game has 3000 posts and has taken a lot of my focus\" attitude is very understandable, I used to overload myself in games too and it would lead towards me not keeping up with certain games that were lesser priority because of it (I don't anymore, learnt from that mistake) but it's something that I don't think is a scum-tell for him at all.<br><br>7. It's actually very possible. Remind me to look at his meta tomorrow if I don't get around to it because that's rather important."}

At first I wanted to avoid lynching him due to him being an easy target bandwagon that scum will often build. (look who is on the wagon). Flench selfvoting is awful townplay at best, downright scummy at worst which is what lowered my estimation of his alignment. I find theomoaner and Radiantwolf more scummy but the town is too split and divided to get a lynch on either of those two. There's been so much content in this game lots of us are confused and a no lynch will make this even worse and I strongly want to avoid one and I question the players putting votes on players you can see won't get lynched today. Flench is the only player town might agree on lynching."}

The whole \"I don't like votes being placed on the lead wagons\" isn't something I think he'd come out and state as scum while not having town reads on all of the players. Also him doing meta research to find out Devices confirmation voting thing being a null tell reads very town, mafia generally don't waste time doing meta research.<br><br>(5): I think JJ's \"how many scum are usually in this setup\" is natural which means no inside information which means it's a town-slip, I also think his frustration is genuine and can follow his thought process a lot. And weirdly enough I think AJ not realizing that he replaced into JJ's slot is a big town tell, as scum I think he'd instantly have looked at his predecessors and partners play and therefore not said that he FoS's that slot.<br></div></blockquote><br>(4)  That about fits with my read of EPM's meta.  The issue I have is that in this game, all his \"reads\" and \"pushes\"  appear to correlate to the players most suspicious or critical of him.  That doesn't read like \"without caring too much about the consequences\"  to me.  Also, I read the \"Don't vote unless you're ready to hammer\"  post as something he could point back to on day two after helping to reason out a mislynch to explain why he didn't vote for whatever wagon he wanted to push.  Effectively, he could drive whatever wagon he wanted as scum, leave only town votes on the record, then if he gets called on it he has a plausible explanation.<br><br>(5)Not saying that AJ is scum, but that's a null-tell at best.  Equally plausible is that AJ replaced in thinking he was tybalt-scum, sees that he's been criticized for having no opinions, and rushes out an easy case.  A push on JJ would be easy to drop as his replacement started doing things differently, and equally easy to hound for behavioral tells that the replacement can neither fix nor explain.  JJ is an incredibly easy scum-target right now.<br><br>Don't expect anything substantial from me today, but I will be reading along.  I will vote to prevent a no-lynch before deadline, but I will not vote theo or lucky unless they are literally the only option.  I do not understand the cases on them, and there is not enough time today to bring me around.  I'll be happy to examine both of them tomorrow."}

At first I wanted to avoid lynching him due to him being an easy target bandwagon that scum will often build. (look who is on the wagon). Flench selfvoting is awful townplay at best, downright scummy at worst which is what lowered my estimation of his alignment. I find theomoaner and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Radiantwolf</span> more scummy but the town is too split and divided to get a lynch on either of those two. There's been so much content in this game lots of us are confused and a no lynch will make this even worse and I strongly want to avoid one and I question the players putting votes on players you can see won't get lynched today. Flench is the only player town might agree on lynching.</div></blockquote><br>Assuming the bolded is a typo? <br><br>I actually read his selfvote as a town tell and while it's not exactly good play it's something I don't see from scum and if we're lynching people based on 'bad play' then lynches would essentially be playerstyle based and not alignment based so while I get the \"Must get a lynch through\" reasoning I sadly think he's flipping town and think people pushing to compromise on him rather than elsewhere have a decent shot of being scum. And I get that \"Not every lynch is possible\" because if it was I'd be happy with a Radioactive one (Seriously, I need an in depth explanation on why certain people read him as town because I'm not seeing it) but otherwise I think you and potentially even Lucky have a higher shot of flipping scum than Flench.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5166244#p5166244\" class=\"postlink\">post 429</a>, sthar8 wrote:</cite>(4)  That about fits with my read of EPM's meta.  The issue I have is that in this game, all his \"reads\" and \"pushes\"  appear to correlate to the players most suspicious or critical of him.  That doesn't read like \"without caring too much about the consequences\"  to me.  Also, I read the \"Don't vote unless you're ready to hammer\"  post as something he could point back to on day two after helping to reason out a mislynch to explain why he didn't vote for whatever wagon he wanted to push.  Effectively, he could drive whatever wagon he wanted as scum, leave only town votes on the record, then if he gets called on it he has a plausible explanation.<br><br>(5)Not saying that AJ is scum, but that's a null-tell at best.  Equally plausible is that AJ replaced in thinking he was tybalt-scum, sees that he's been criticized for having no opinions, and rushes out an easy case.  A push on JJ would be easy to drop as his replacement started doing things differently, and equally easy to hound for behavioral tells that the replacement can neither fix nor explain.  JJ is an incredibly easy scum-target right now.</div></blockquote><br>Re; (4) I'm not reading his play in this game that way at all, I think you've got yourself into a confirmation-bias type situation with him, I don't think all his reads correlate to others reads on him at all, his reads and thoughts all come across as genuine. Sorry to say I think you need to step back from him and reassess and Re; (5) I don't agree at all, generally I've found scum PMs state partners on it which have predecessors name it too, or a link to a QT where predecessors and partners would have posted; long story short I think scum that replace in would have more information and wouldn't mistake their slot in the manner he did not to mention I had a town read on his predecessor when reading through too.<br><br>I need to see when the extension is too because if we have time I still want a Feel It lynch or a Radioactive one.

If you have a problem with someone's activity, then ask the mod for prods/replacement.  This is far better than just throwing your vote at them because (as you said yourself), not all lurkers are scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>sthar wrote:</cite>Look, the leading two wagons are shit. You know it, I know it, a couple of people have commented on it. The cowbell wagon boils down to \"Cowbell is playing badly!\" which is a null tell, and Theo's mistaking Cowbell's bad play as a scumtell which I've already discussed with him. It would be incredibly easy for scum or bad town to leap onto either wagon, and there's not enough information right now to draw conclusions on anybody's actions regarding them. I'm not saying those posts won't be useful later; there's just not much to go on right now and neither wagon is based on evidence, just like neither is generating interesting reactions anymore. My wagon, however looks really promising right now, and it's always good d1 play to pressure lurkers. The stance I'm taking on that garbage is that there are more important things to spend my time on.</div></blockquote><br><br>Alright, I'm at a little bit of a loss...<br><br>So, you already said that the wagons sucked and that they're really not well founded.  And you further state that scum are likely to join them.<br><br>What exactly are you waiting for to start getting scumreads on people of either of these wagons?</div></blockquote><br><br>Radioactive  points out that the \"foolish\" votes on radiant cowbells and theomoaner can allow relatively lurky players to gain credit by dismissing them publicly, without pushing the culprits, who should really be questioned on their intent. Sth3r making another post on how the wagons are weak without reads on the wagons, is a thorn in the side for radiactive, but I don't know why he's more worried about it than exposing the people on them. I think the whole posts is him overreading people taking free townpoints with an out of place lurker vote.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5146858#p5146858\" class=\"postlink\">post 277</a>, Radioactive Wolf wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5146780#p5146780\" class=\"postlink\">post 275</a>, jon_h61 wrote:</cite>pedit @ Radioactive I made that post as I was reading the ISOs of the players.

I don't agree with how far he pushes some of his reads, but they seem natural to me. I'm ready to see a lucky2u and feel it scumteam, especially since lucky2u is still content with bringing up anecdotes rather than scumhunting. I see more informaton coming from a feel it lynch though. Flench hasmade bad osts, but they're not coming out at times when a scum agenda could feasibly work. I'll barrage him d2."}

Either way, it's important now.<br>First of all, I think Flench is doing a lot better than he was earlier in the game, and it feels scum-led to me when a wagon picks up on someone and carries on but nobody thinks it's important to pay attention to the fact that a player has improved as time passes. Especially since scum typically play worse as the wagon builds on them, isn't that the idea behind \"pressure voting\" (which is stupid for other reasons than that but this isn't that conversation)? The inability of the lucky2u wagon to gain any steam when he's a pretty dirty scumbag screams scum-led Flench counterwagon also.<br><br>I also like the consistency between his posts 351 and 376 where he says that he's focusing on another ongoing game more than this one, and then his posting gets better as the day in that game winds down and ends. Also if we assume that 320 is true (and he didn't care about this game because the other is more interesting) regardless of his alignment, then it looks really good that in 329 and 376, he actually tries to contribute more than he has been because if he was scum, he could probably get away with weak contribution based on his not caring about the game.<br><br>Sooo yeah I think Flench is town.<br>In other news, I'm not there yet but it might be possible to pull me over to the Radioactive Wolf scum read side with enough convincing. BUT I'M NOT THERE YET. I'm just closer to null than the start of the game when I had a pretty strong town read on him."}

Now he calls it a wild outburst and paints it as suspicious. In my read list I mentioned post 186 and questioned if it was genuine.

Right now I am favoring Radiant because (and this is what has gained me three votes) I changed my mind about my meta read on him. I went back to the previous game I had with him, where he played a doc. While he certainly ended that game with an overly dramatic self hammer, I realized I was letting his end of the game actions cloud my judgement over his over all play. At the start of the game he was very normal, he scum hunted, announced his reads regularly, and aside from a little fluff exchange between me and him, did nothing out of the ordinary for a player until he was under the knife. He was also paranoid about getting shot at night or mislynched during the day for talking too much. <br><br>Here is a link to his ISO from that game: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4974331&amp;user_select\">viewtopic.php?p=4974331&amp;user_select</a><!-- l -->[]=20971#p4974331<br><br>When it comes to the other players though, I am a little more undecided.

You're saying there are distractions there, yet use it to test people. Funny because I've been calling you scum with cases and you reiterate with this shit. You said policy=/=principle so I went and proved that if you wanted to play a game of wording, you'd lose. Never responded to that. You asked where JJcool translated and what I meant by it. Cited specific examples. I gave my full list of scum reads, presented a case on how people have been being consistent thus far any you've still got an issue with it. You should just present a case and actually point what you're talking about because it is saturated with the dark side of the force. <br><br>Also, the tag system is failing hard for me.

Lets do another example, lets say our other role is 2 masons which fits with JK and 1-shot vig since neither are investigative (Would mean that scum would have to have a PR to counter it likely) and mass claiming just gets them killed.

Also you  accuse me  of \"\u00f6mgus\" for making a case against impetus, who presumably has an intent vote on me? That's anti-logic.... Feel it has a medium-large post count, and has done more than not contribute, he also threw weak  suspicion at people just to fish for waht would stick, and I can't see the process of how he changes his suspicion out of his posts. I'm going for easy lynches? Four people have town reads on impetus, and feelit is active enough to make efforts to scumhunt or open up viable discussions. I'm assuming that the other people who've done \"what feel it is doing\" are mmnemoic and flench? That's a fair accusation, but I had to defend town mnemoci from a mislynch in our last game together, and his posts very similiar, also they give you an idea of how his thought process shapes out, and I don't see his posts coming at times when a scum agenda would be viable, such as when someone gives an awful response to a question or when a wagon is first defended. <br><br>flench made awful posts during early day 1, but then became towny by making logical pursuits, The most suspicous thing is that the wagon on him ended with him as a null read to most of the participants, where a town backed wagon really ought to have kept pushing until he flipped scum or convinced them of town... I'll have to reread that...<br><br>I see Impetus  backing down when you made the first hard vote on me as the most scummy thing that's happened on d2.<br>@Impetus I made an early case against theomoaner d1 because I didn't like the reasons he used for voting radiant, later, I looked at the intent of his posts, and really he tries to get people to discuss things or break down how they built their case, so I unvoted him as a town read. Finally, he claimed credit for a death, which is kinda too bold for scum to do, if it were a gambit regardless, I would need to know if he felt the need to re-justify his claim again under the pressure of discussion."}

Voting without posting naturally leads itself to the argument that your vote is less valid because you didn't read the thread. It can be quickly dismissed. You can be painted as a player who doesn't need the whole picture to vote, which is dumb or scum. I don't think you are either, I just think you should keep that mind for the future.<br><br>As for the Flench post, he said there's more mafia than feelit. There's two ways of interpreting that, that's why I'm not so sure it is a slip. If it is, Flench confessed Feelit is scum, so I'd rather keep my vote on Feelit."}

So for you to vote him with a single reason, that mmnemoic actually addressed seems really artificial. If you currently think mmnemoic is scum... you can tell us why you saw him as town, which of his posts were warning signs that you might have to read him in another light, and how the same wall of town posts(assuming you ever made him) could actually have scum intent. If you think he's town, please argue with the people on his wagon so they can lynch someone who has made more scummy posts than null ones.<br><br>@ TIP  I just wanted to know if your strong town read on Nsin was based on something I'm not seeing (previous games, similiar thought process) since in order, he voted radiant, asked if anyone wanted to know about, hammered (still not saying anything about anyone), laughed at mmnemoic bringing up Saki to you.. and also wavering between Feel it and mnnemoic...

I see that games in the normal queue that don't state that anything about it in setup must allow it, and that it should be the amount of players needed to make a lynch impossible. Meaning that whenever there is an even(2,4,6,etc) player count no lynch should be 1 below normal lynch.<br><br>Of course, the mod has final authority."}

Flench almost got lynched for inactivity day 1 and once his posting rate improved, he appeared scummy enough to get him killed.  The town lurkers just prove that the behavior needs to be disincentivized for both alignments, which your suggestion of \"lol i hope they replace\" does not accomplish.<br><br>There's no point in arguing it with you, pacman, but your bad play effectively lost the game.  The lurking town enabled it, but a good town leader could have won the game from your seat.  You put in effectively no analysis, went whole days without generating content whilst bitching about how boring the game was, alienated the obvtown md to the point that his lylo vote on you was inevitable, and filled the thread with meaningless noise posts.<br><br>Basically, the scum weeded out all the town skill and left you in a predictable lylo of your own making.<br><br>@ Desperado- You did a great job as the mod.  Scumteams should probably be in their pm, though.<br><br>@ N64- Were your day 1 incomprehensible posts intentional?  Your scumchat and later posts are wayyy easier to read."}
