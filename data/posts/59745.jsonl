{"number": 1, "id": "6362816", "user": "Empking", "user_id": "9160", "content": "Rules of the Game: (modified stolen from Bbmolla)<br>\n<br>\nGeneral Gameplay and Etiquette:<br>\n1. You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. <br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>\n6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 10 day deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>\n1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>\n2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.<br>\n8. This game does have DayTalk<br>\n<br>\nHere is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nYou are a Citizen.
