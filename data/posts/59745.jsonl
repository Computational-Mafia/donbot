You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. <br>3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a \u201cNo Action\u201d PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br><br>Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone\u2019s fate.<br>3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>7. This game will have 10 day deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br><br>Miscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don\u2019t get missed.<br>5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging.<br>8. This game does have DayTalk<br><br>Here is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Citizen. You have no special abilities.<br><br>You win if at least one town player is alive when there are no other living living factions.</div></blockquote>"}

I would then use this to try and decide if it's a town or a mafia push or a mix and base my reads on that, I see none of that from Flubber; moreover it would never cross my mind to unvote someone, I vote people I think are scum and pressure others put on me is irrelevant unless it makes them even scummier, then I would vote for them, what is the town motivation for unvoting there? Other than what Flubber said about causality =/ correlation I don't see it and his reason is unverifiable.

That helps me a bit with your VI image though, even if you really think he is town, the downside of you being wrong is so huge I would never endorse that kind of play and it's not something I would imagine mafia would say, maybe you're just bad.<br><br>I really don't like Swag either for selective quoting, the main reason I was leaning scum on Flubber was his reaction to getting voted for lurking, which is a totally valid reason to vote someone btw, so that when he has to reply you can decide if he is mafia or not. You can agree or disagree with me that giving town reads to everyone on your wagon and unvoting is more or less scum indicative, although frankly you will never convince me it was not scummy, Flubber himself seems to imply it when he said that it was a coincidence that his reads came at the same time as when the wagon formed on him by those players, which implies that if it wasn't coincidence it would have been scummy, but not even mentioning it as Swag does strikes me as disingenuous.<br><br>FudZ I have to hear more from but for now he isn't making much sense, the only points I understood about his play was the vote on mykosian and Boon for being opportunistic.<br><br>Mykosian's town read has evaporated in the mean time, while AK looks pretty town to me because that read on Swag seems pretty legit.<br><br>I have nothing on Nati and I think she should start producing her own content."}

I'm sure that Boon and most likely swag, too, have the same alignment as Flubber. So whatever Boon says, this lynch would provide plenty of information. Even if he flipped town, we'd get two technically universal townreads, that's quite good.<br>On another note, what I've read about Flubber in this thread, he isn't really the player scum would actively try to get rid of early on (nohard feelings, pal,neither am I.)

I've never actually called him scum, btw, I originally joined his wagon only to do something with my vote. (It should answer one of swag's questions, he didn't wanted to learn the answer too much, though.) I'm pretty content with my decision in hindsight because of this hysteria around him. I'm sure that Boon and most likely swag, too, have the same alignment as Flubber. So whatever Boon says, this lynch would provide plenty of information. Even if he flipped town, we'd get two technically universal townreads, that's quite good.<br>On another note, what I've read about Flubber in this thread, he isn't really the player scum would actively try to get rid of early on (nohard feelings, pal,neither am I.) So that would actually put myko on the town side, I suppose.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hmm, why does a flubber town flip make us town? Scum can do that too."}
