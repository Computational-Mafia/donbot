The wind, however, is unusually chilly for September, and only promises to grow colder during the rest of the trip. The cold drove all the passengers indoors early in the evening; even the nightwatchman, assigned to patrol the decks, retreats to the bar for a drink and several quiet hours to himself.<br><br>A calm, wide sea. Too kind, too gentle. <br><br>Suddenly a shriek is heard from somewhere on the ship, startling its inhabitants awake. One by one the groggy guests open their doors into the corridors, beginning to gather and ask what is going on. As the shouts continue, the quizzical glances turn alarmed. The group clambers up to the deck to investigate the disturbance, trying to locate the source of the commotion. <br><br>Fresh traces of blood are discovered at starboard side, just outside the officers\u2019 quarters. No one knows who it belongs to. Panic quickly begins setting in. <br><br>Suddenly, somebody exclaims in horror: \u201cThere!\u201d They lean over the railing, pointing at waters below.

Two crew members run off to check the radio room, only to report that all telecommunication systems are inexplicably down. The crew has been instructed to continue on to the nearest major port city in case of emergency. However, with the captain dead and communications down, the crew cannot reliably determine how far the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Vendetta</span> veered off course during the night. It will take some time to reorient \u2013 time that you do not have, considering there is a murderer on the loose.<br><br>The passengers begin to slip into a tense paranoia. However, it\u2019s soon clear that they haven\u2019t completely lost their wits.

Investigative and protective roles can put you aside as a target.  The main thing a miller gains IMO is a sense of liberty from concerns about being lynched.  Lynch may happen, but it will be because of the miller's role more than because of their play.  Taking that concern off the table leaves time and energy for finding scum, finding town, developing reads, etc.<br><br>As scum, I dunno.  I know scum players sometimes gambit with miller, but IMO it would be really difficult to fabricate the sense of liberty that comes with the miller role."}

Statistically, a miller claim is far more likely to come from scum since the \"power\" they are claiming, coming up guilty upon investigation, is present in the majority of scum roles whereas millers only appear in a fraction of games. Sitewide meta on how to handle miller claims fluctuates over time. Judging by this game, where no one is batting an eye at someone going \"hey, I come up guilty when investigated, problem?\", a lot more scum are going to claim miller in the near future across all games.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CrashTextDummie in TV U-Pick mafia wrote:</cite>Claiming miller is not null. Claiming miller is admitting to a role characteristic that the vast majority of scum roles possesses. Claiming miller also doesn't just have merits as a scum gambit if it instantly makes you look town, the entire point of claiming miller as scum is to sidestep and invalidate the cop role.<br><br>I don't think claiming miller on D1 is even optimal pro-town play, but this is up to debate.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CrashTextDummie in TV U-Pick mafia wrote:</cite>I know for a fact that this game has several scum roles that would come up as guilty upon a cop investigation (this game was not announced to be bastard).

I might be totally off base, but it's enough that I'm inclined to try to read them as I would players in general. I might be unconsciously biased to find it more Townien than I'm laying out in the nice clear-cut theory of it, because I'm probably giving Brian more than he deserves - his play is meh at best. It's actually pretty reactive - focusing on deflecting things that aren't hugely important and doing stuff like commenting back to fferylt that he doesn't find Townread-gathering scummy. Is anyone even voting him currently that he's still inundated with minutinae of defense and clearing up stuff? Now's the time to do stuff.<br><br>Spy, though . . . I really don't know, and I'm always paranoid about Spy and paranoid about my paranoia in turn. I don't read him as defending Brian per se - I'd be pretty surprised if they're scumbuddies, honestly - but there's a very odd angle on it (or maybe I just don't have a mental schematic for scum claiming Miller in response to an RVS wagon and can't fathom why Spy would) and a willingness to spend time ruminating on it. For all he talks big about Aero/SK he doesn't try to affect the situation. He leaves himself a lot of wiggle room about a wagon I thought was complete crud and still am having trouble sorting out signal from noise on because it felt so bad. There's a posture of commitment and confidence but the wagon comes and goes.

My vote on Aero was placed because of attitude more than anything else and again was my vote and was made for a reason, which was explained.

Of particular inanity is your suggestion that a town sweep is an appropriate way of dealing with claimed millers, because you know as well as me that that's an exceedingly rare occurrence, and yet you're using it as an excuse for postponing a decision in the matter.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5351154#p5351154\" class=\"postlink\">post 335</a>, SpyreX wrote:</cite>CTD is one note and that note is brown.</div></blockquote><br><br>Elaborate.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5349047#p5349047\" class=\"postlink\">post 265</a>, Smudger wrote:</cite>As for no scum hunting content, I would venture that I am not the only one who that could be said of and find your singling me out rather puzzling?</div></blockquote><br><br>Who are you comparing yourself to?

I think the fact that there was a page 1 mini wagon on him had absolutely nothing to do with the claim (e.g., the miller claim itself was not a reaction to the wagon but something that had been thought out well in advance).<br>- Right now, I'm inclined towards thinking the claim is fake. I'll explain why once I'm fully caught up with the thread.<br>- If Brian is scum, I don't think he came up with the miller strat all on his own as he seems to be a newer player. My guess is that, if he's scum, a more experienced player suggested the claim to him and coached him on how to do it ahead of time.<br>- Brian / CTD are unlikely to be scum together given the strong policy-type push from the latter in the early game (wouldn't make sense for CTDscum to agree to the claim only to strongly push a lynch on him early, especially given the site's general antipathy towards miller claims - he's be committing to a hardbus too early).<br>- Smudger's ignorance of what a miller is supposed to be in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341937#p5341937\" class=\"postlink\">#63</a> makes me think he's not scum with Brian either.<br><br>Heading to dinner now, moving surprisingly quickly through all of this so I'll be getting my big reads wall in sooner than I expected."}

Here's a compilation of all my reads with reasoning. I know this thing's rather long and unwieldy but please take the time to go through all of it. Let me know if you have any questions or if you need me to elaborate on anything. As an aside, a lot of people in this game look really town and it feels really nice but there's a lot of TvT-type arguments going on that need to stop ASAP (looking at you, Kaze / SKrew / Garmr / notscience). It's cluttering the thread with a lot of nonsense at this point and the votes could very well be served elsewhere.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">TOWN</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">fferyllt:</span> Consider this read to be very largely meta based -- from what I'm aware of her meta, she hates being scum and tends to be very lurky / image conscious, which is very unlike her play here. She feels comfortable posting, is generally very engaged with the thread, and has bits of cheekiness that I don't expect her to post as scum (ex: the second line of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341966#p5341966\" class=\"postlink\">#66</a>). Another little thing I liked is the way she locked horns with notscience in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348290#p5348290\" class=\"postlink\">#215</a> by telling him to \"give it a rest\" -- I think, as scum, she'd be more likely to encourage notscience's \"false positives\" or at least just altogether refrain from talking about it and let town self destruction happen (which was her approach in Xenologue). Her meta analysis in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351392#p5351392\" class=\"postlink\">#349</a> and the level of detail she goes into breaking down Kaze's linguistic falls in line with the meta analysis she loves to do as town and I think she's not as inclined to do as scum (in Xenologue, she basically took my word on LLD's meta without doing any visible work of her own). All in all, would be really surprised if she were scum this game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kazekirimaru:</span> Really not understanding why this dude has votes on him. Pretty much all of his posts and the way he's approached arguments with various players have a \"I have the higher moral ground\"-type tone to them (ex: \"you're being stupid\" / \"you're just wrong\") which is far more likely to come from town than scum -- town are far more likely to have a greater attachment to arguments like the one he's having with SKrew because they want to be right / feel vindicated; scum just see these kinds of back and forths as a way to contribute but as nothing more. His progression from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341908#p5341908\" class=\"postlink\">#62</a> to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5343735#p5343735\" class=\"postlink\">#100</a> based on the reasoning he provides in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346574#p5346574\" class=\"postlink\">#146</a> is something that makes A LOT of sense from a player with his experience -- a lot of newer town players do tend to take into account interactions with their scumreads in this fashion / consider what other people have to say. His abrasive playstyle is something I consider a towntell as I'd expect him to conform to expected behavior as scum. His reaction to the wagon + his frustration that people are not listening to him in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351163#p5351163\" class=\"postlink\">#337</a> reads incredibly genuine. The more and more I read this guy's posts, the more depressed I get that he was wagoned to L-2.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">notscience:</span> He's another player who I think has a very abrasive / annoying playstyle and just get this 'ugh' feeling reading through his stuff. That said, his play here fits the skeletal model I have of his townplay (he's another play I'd expect to conform to expectation as scum). He's not afraid of throw down cursory dismissals of suspicion against him (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345697#p5345697\" class=\"postlink\">#124</a>) and his repeatedly calling himself obvtown is something that checks out with his townplay in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=31132\" class=\"postlink\">Open 527</a>. I think he'd be a lot more self conscious as scum than to fuck around with posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346675#p5346675\" class=\"postlink\">#147</a> / <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346683#p5346683\" class=\"postlink\">#149</a>. Overall, the abrasive, rough-around-the-edges attitude he displays here reads strongly town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Plum:</span> Need to double check the meta of her (from what I remember she's another player who dislikes being scum) but she's shown strong signs of gamesolving given the level of detail behind her reads and her lines of inquiry. Mostly, though, I really like the indignant attitude undercutting all of her posts and the bits of introspection sprinkled throughout her reactions to others (ex: her reaction to Smudger's 63 in her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346757#p5346757\" class=\"postlink\">#157</a> -- \"This one really stupid thing is keeping me from voting you and I feel so dirty for that\"). I also liked her paranoia of SpyreX in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348611#p5348611\" class=\"postlink\">#263</a> and the way she goes about ruminating over his posts. There's an element of looseness to it that I wouldn't expect from her as scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Garmr:</span> He's another player who feels more invested in the arguments he has against certain players than I'd expect scum with his experience to be. I like the way he stands up to notscience in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345704#p5345704\" class=\"postlink\">#125</a> and his being indignant over notscience calling himself obvtown when he thinks he hasn't done anything worthy of the title reads as genuine. I liked his reaction to Kaze's vote in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5350854#p5350854\" class=\"postlink\">#303</a> as it almost feels like he's taking the vote against him to heart which is something I see far more from town. The level of detail he provides for his scumreads on notscience and Kaze reads like legitimate / genuine scumhunting.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">SKrew:</span> He's someone that I don't fully trust myself to read for some reason but I do like a lot of what he's posted. His reaction to the whole argument / line of questioning with Kaze reads very town, particularly with his frustration that Kaze is doing \"nothing\" with his votes in posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348255#p5348255\" class=\"postlink\">#207</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348259#p5348259\" class=\"postlink\">#209</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348299#p5348299\" class=\"postlink\">#220</a>. I also like the way he calls out SpyreX for the shift of read on his slot, I think he'd have just taken that and ran with it as scum rather than probe into turnaround. I like what I see here but will probably do a meta check whenever I get free time just to be sure.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">CTD:</span> Reading him as town mostly because I think he's playing differently than from what I saw of his scum play in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=25712\" class=\"postlink\">/in-vitational 12</a>. In that game, his votes lacked conviction as he placed them on all of the major wagons of the time with weak / lazy reasoning and he seemed more concerned with following the crowd. The votes he's placed this game have a lot more meat to them and him being shocked early on that people are believing Brian's miller claim wholesale is something I don't really expect from his scum game -- I'd have expected him to drop the issue entirely and move onto something else, not continue to pressure Brian. Need to do a full-on meta check here too, though, as I know he plays a very strong game as scum and I don't remember having read his town games too deeply.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NULL</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">LolWagons / Smudger:</span> I had to go over Smudger's ISO a few times to try and get a more firm read and I still feel really conflicted over the slot. I don't like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5344875#p5344875\" class=\"postlink\">#114</a> where he questions how people are forming townreads too early as it doesn't read genuine to me and it just feels like he's trying to discredit those reads at the risk of getting boxed in by them later on down the road. His votes on Aeronaut and Maestro do fit the scum-on-the-wagon / \"hey we can make this mislynch happen\" role given that there's not a whole lot of meat of them. There are also some places where it feels like he's deflecting certain questions by responding with something to the effect of \"other people are doing it too\" that just rubs me the wrong way. At the same time, some of the things he says do read genuine to me at a gut level -- for example, I really liked his response to SKrew in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346924#p5346924\" class=\"postlink\">#178</a> where he basically says \"it's my vote and I do what I want with it\". And I do remember his playstyle being hard to read, as some others have mentioned. Hopefully, Slaxx's replace-in will help out here.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">CDB:</span> Liked his entry into the game as that seems consistent with what I remember of his early game play as town, but the fade out really worries me as I know he has a tendency to get lurky / inactive as scum.

He also claims the miller claim is town and wants to win without having to lynch it but then mentions in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351154#p5351154\" class=\"postlink\">#335</a> that it will have to die at some point. The two positions seem mutually exclusive to me. It feels like he's keeping his options open to lynch Brian down the road. I also don't like his progression from AeroSK to Kaze either -- it doesn't make sense for him to feel so confident that Aero is scum to the point where he's willing to hammer that lynch without deliberation (and want that slot's blood all over his face) but then move onto Kaze. In that light, the vote on Kaze feels oppportunistic. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Brian:</span> I don't like the presentation of the miller claim in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5340885#p5340885\" class=\"postlink\">#12</a> with the \"look elsewhere\" bit on a gut level mostly because it does feel like he's coming into the thread hoping that the ensuing attention on his claim goes away. The main thing that bothers me, though, is that it feels like he's laying the martyr act way to thick -- all throughout his ISO, there's plenty of mentions about how he's ok with being lynched / killed (notable examples include: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5340924#p5340924\" class=\"postlink\">#18</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341190#p5341190\" class=\"postlink\">#43</a>, end of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351325#p5351325\" class=\"postlink\">#347</a>). It almost feels like a WIFOMy dare to get him lynched. As far as his scumhunting goes, it's all very surface-level / cursory and I just don't get a sense that he's strongly engaging with the thread.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">YYR:</span> Very weak read here, but I didn't like his cursory mention of the miller claim when he entered the thread in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341842#p5341842\" class=\"postlink\">#57</a>. Aside from that, the attacks he's given on Kaze just feels like he's hitting things that look bad on the surface but not aren't actually scummy. Still waiting on more content from him though.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: SpyreX</span>"}

Yessir he was sure saying look elsewhere:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm the miller. I'm going to die anyways, look for someone else.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assume the town typically either lynches the miller at some point or a vig shoots him at night.</div></blockquote><br>3.) I'm not \"keeping options open\". I'm stating a fact. If this isn't a sweep, a miller claim gets lynched because it WILL be lynched at lylo for a loss. Its too easy and it has to be dealt with. Period. I'm pretty sure that \"the meta\" hasn't shifted that much since I've been around and, if it has, thats bad and you should feel bad. I want to win without having to eat what WILL be a mislynch.<br>4.) Now, I know I'm not hip with the lingo and I'm sooo hard to follow but the same \"broken record\" that Slaxx espoused was me saying that while I want(ed) the lynch, I do not want it fast and I want other things dealt with beforehand. This isn't even looking at it sideways. I want someones to straight faced tell me that ANYWHERE you get \"without deliberation\" from what I said. I want that done before this day is done because, when the time comes, I want whomever is left alive to murder any slot with impunity that has the stones to commit to weapons-grade nonsense. <br>5.) Kaze is \"opportunistic\". When SK started, I wasn't down with it. However, as things progressed SK is giving far more positive vibes and this is kaze:<br><img src=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/images/img-tags/gCNP00gO40hauJJxIrqd.gif\" alt=\"Image\"><br><br>And this isn't even under \"the heat\". This is little pokes exploding into nonsense over and over again. That kind of circuit rewire makes waaay more sense as scum capitulating to pressure and milking the death.<br><br>And, of course, the other vaunted scum read is Brian (and a lurker oooooh). In what universe would that make any, ANY, sense. This isn't a large.

Trading a 180 in a game where the wolves are salivating for any excuse for nonsense (see this power wagon) in order to...secure a D1 lynch on Kaze?

Yet one of Empire's big reasons for voting SpyreX is because Spyre believed Miller claims aren't a shield. Well, they aren't.

If I find flaw in voting reasoning, it feels good enough to me to throw a vote on them. Townies are supposed to be thorough when they profess to seriously vote someone. Scum however don't need to put as much thought into their votes. They know who scum is, they just need to mislynch town.

I'm saying from multiple people, you included, were sure as hell listing me as scum with Kaze. So, I 180'd a position on SK to bus a partner to get nothing out of it.

You bet your ass - unless the town wins before it gets to that point. You dont leave dangling things like that around at lylo, because they lose games.

It's a bad habit, but I don't care because I like to see people's reactions (your reaction reads town to me btw).<br><br>As far as why I'm not voting anyone yet, it's because I've been put in this awkward dilemma. I usually like to gauge early reads based on how people are reading the way I'm playing. The problem is that I claimed my role with a terrible opening post and I haven't done anything to seem town. On the contrary, I've been playing pretty poorly and I'm a miller. Although I want people to read me as town, I can't tell if it's because they legitimately believe me, buddying me, or trying to use my flip as an excuse to get towncred. On the other hand, I can't tell if people that are reading me as scum are trying to push a mislynch on me or if they're legitimately reading me as scum for my play. And then there's Spyrex, who isn't even reading me at all.<br><br>Because I've been having trouble scumreading the players thus far, I've been trying to townread players and sort by PoE. The reason I haven't voted for anybody is because I'm not leaning heavily on any person being scum yet. Furthermore, I feel there has been pretty good discussion being generated by other players such as SK and I haven't felt the need to pressure vote anyone (other players have already been doing it).<br><br>I've been playing pretty passively because of this and trying to make opinions based on other events of the game. This works for me anyways, because I hate Day 1 and I'm generally more passive anyways. Also, I haven't been following the thread very well due to school, taking on too many games, and other non-mafia related stuff that may or may not be related to real life stuff.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5355638#p5355638\" class=\"postlink\">post 411</a>, Empire wrote:</cite>If Brian is scum, I don't think he came up with the miller strat all on his own as he seems to be a newer player.

If you want me lynched, then push my lynch. I won't stop you.<br><br>As far as not strongly engaging the thread, you're right. I've already explained this a few times.

Notscience voting me right after post 34 didn't help either. As for whether it's scum or town motivated, I judged it based on you saying you believe my claim without giving any reasoning. Three people consecutively say they believed my claim. You were one of them, and the other two have trajectories that are either clear or can be inferred. No matter how you look at it, it's suspicious.<br><br><br><br><br>Other thoughts:<br>-I'm still liking Plum for town. Her posts just feel town to me. Especially since she's trying to hit more underlying issues.<br>-SK feels town because I like her stance on attacking anything that moves.<br>-I'm also still liking CTD for town. He's taken a pretty hard stance of not believing my claim and he's the most outspoken about my play thus far. CTD has also been pushing other people and, generally, I'm liking the arguments he's been putting forth.<br>-I liked Lolwagons catch-up post. It felt town to me, especially his reaction to me not voting. As for CTD's argument against Lolwagon changing his vote, I disagree. If he doesn't like the way his wagon formed, then he needs to reanalyze what's going on. It feels town-motivated.<br>-The notscience-Spyrex mess is just whatever to me. There's no guarantee that both of them are town. This was confirmed by notscience, which means I get to read them independently of their role. I can't read notscience worth a damn, but notscience feels like scum to me, and the more people townread him based on his meta (which he wants to change anyways), the more skeptical I become. I don't like how easily swayed he was by CDB early on and I don't like his \"obvtown\" pleas. There's a weird little contradiction pointed out already in post 56 where he lists both me and aero as scum. His prevention of the early lynch on me could have been done by anyone.<br><br>Still debating Garmr, Empire, Spyrex."}

His progression from #62 to #100 based on the reasoning he provides in #146 is something that makes A LOT of sense from a player with his experience -- a lot of newer town players do tend to take into account interactions with their scumreads in this fashion / consider what other people have to say. His abrasive playstyle is something I consider a towntell as I'd expect him to conform to expected behavior as scum. His reaction to the wagon + his frustration that people are not listening to him in #337 reads incredibly genuine. The more and more I read this guy's posts, the more depressed I get that he was wagoned to L-2.</div></blockquote><br>I've been liking Kaze as town thus far, so I don't really have an issue with this read as a whole. The only problem is that he doesn't understand why people were voting him. People thought he was scummy, so they pressured him. There could also have been scum voting him. It's nitpicking, but it's meh to me.<br><br>Other than that, it's mostly based on meta that I'm unfamiliar with. And it feels somewhat informed, but he might just be that strong of a player. His posts read like town posts and I would like for him to be town. But to be honest, I'm not confident in reading him at all, especially with such a small sample to base my read off of. Not to mention he replaced Maestro who just lurked all day. Regardless, the basis for his reads make sense to me. The null-read on Smudger especially reads genuine to me. I'm willing to call him town for now.<br><br>Regardless of his alignment, I feel like his reads list is pretty strong and should help people sort in some way."}

The matter in which he carries himself is rather confident and he appears proactive. This doesn't really convince me, though. I don't associate confidence with a town role PM, and it's much more related to the personality of the player. He explains away his scumminess simply by dismissing it as something he does as a player (I'm thinking specifically when questioned on his wagon hopping and his change of reads based on the mentality of other town players). It's not about framing them in a town mindset but appealing it to some character trait. It does little to appease my scumread because I have no reason to trust him when he says these things about himself. Even assuming it's true, the scum motivation to do these things still exist, and I can't leave that alone. His 'proactive' game feels cheapened when he constantly switches wagons, and it feels like he rarely follows through with questioning and ideas because of this. <br><br>Despite all of that, his recent post on Spyrex makes me look at my read again, mostly because his read on Spyrex seems very much more town motivated than scum motivated. It's already been brought up that Spyrex has a good history as a player, and I find it unlikely that scum would pass the opportunity to let the wagon go through when the repercussions of that wagon would most likely fall on other players. I'm willing to take a step back at the very least and reevaluate at a later time. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><br>I'm not seeing where the Spyrex wagon is coming from. I've kind of skimmed the thread and focused more on ISO's on relevant players right now since I missed a lot and wanted to reread a lot. Based on Spyrex's ISO,  I'm not getting the huge scumread people are getting from him. Maybe I missed something along the way, but for him to be the leading (or second leading?) wagon seems disproportionate to what I've read from him. I'll do a more in-depth look at the thread itself, but eh, the guy looks town to me."}

I'm going to die anyways, look for someone else.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assume the town typically either lynches the miller at some point or a vig shoots him at night.</div></blockquote><br>3.) I'm not \"keeping options open\". I'm stating a fact. If this isn't a sweep, a miller claim gets lynched because it WILL be lynched at lylo for a loss. Its too easy and it has to be dealt with. Period. I'm pretty sure that \"the meta\" hasn't shifted that much since I've been around and, if it has, thats bad and you should feel bad. I want to win without having to eat what WILL be a mislynch.<br>4.) Now, I know I'm not hip with the lingo and I'm sooo hard to follow but the same \"broken record\" that Slaxx espoused was me saying that while I want(ed) the lynch, I do not want it fast and I want other things dealt with beforehand. This isn't even looking at it sideways. I want someones to straight faced tell me that ANYWHERE you get \"without deliberation\" from what I said. I want that done before this day is done because, when the time comes, I want whomever is left alive to murder any slot with impunity that has the stones to commit to weapons-grade nonsense. <br>5.) Kaze is \"opportunistic\". When SK started, I wasn't down with it. However, as things progressed SK is giving far more positive vibes and this is kaze:<br>[...]<br>And this isn't even under \"the heat\". This is little pokes exploding into nonsense over and over again. That kind of circuit rewire makes waaay more sense as scum capitulating to pressure and milking the death.<br><br>And, of course, the other vaunted scum read is Brian (and a lurker oooooh).

It's not just him saying to \"look elsewhere\" but that he's pushing people to do so with his actions.<br>3) The issue that I have is that you were taking the claim as legit to the point where you criticized someone for jumping onto it while at the same time saying Brian probably needs to be lynched at some point down the road. Now I don't know how miller claims were dealt with in the past but it seems really weird to suggest that the game can be won without having to deal with the claim while at the same time suggesting that there must be some point where we have to deal with him down the road. They seem like mutually exclusive positions, which doesn't make sense to me, and that's why it feels like you're keeping your options open w.r.t. the miller claim.<br>4) Then I misunderstood <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5342240#p5342240\" class=\"postlink\">#88</a> (\"I'm not super anxious, but I do not want to see this mill about forever and a day waiting for the check in. I want Aero blood all over my face\")? I interpreted that line as saying you didn't really want to waste a whole lot of time deliberating things.<br>5) I was gonna ask you what gave you positive vibes on SK but it seems like the stuff's already been answered which helps clears things a bit for me here (disagree on Kaze though, I think the flail is something that depends a lot more on personality / playstyle than alignment).<br>6) I haven't put a whole lot of thought into associations between my scumreads aside from some hypothetical stuff about Brian's claim. I just put my scumreads into their own little section of the list and that's that for now -- I typically don't even think about that stuff unless I'm alive on D2/3/etc or we've had a flip.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5356585#p5356585\" class=\"postlink\">post 449</a>, fferyllt wrote:</cite>@Empire, this is a general question about your reads list.

I'm not going to generate content for the sake of it.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I wasn't talking about lack of conclusions, I was talking about not initiating many interactions.  I went back to look in case my impression was wrong, but most of your posts interacting with other players were initiated by the other players.  Including this interaction.<br><br>In fact, the post that I snipped this bit from was the only one that had any clear and obvious examples of you picking out something another player said and questioning them about it rather than responding to something that the player said either to or about you.  And that post was made after I commented on the lack, though apparently I didn't explain myself well."}

I mean, I don't think anyone could argue that I've not been fairly disconnected from this game, so if I'm looking for reasons to call notscience town, wouldn't I have read more thoroughly and made sure I wasn't doing something that would play badly? Subjectivity bias here but I thought it was fairly clear that my last few posts have been from me just picking through the thread basically backwards as I go; why would I decide notscience was town on page 27 if there was a chance he'd done something I could have exploited differently on page 26?<br><br>You could perhaps argue that I was looking for a reason to call him <span style=\"font-style: italic\">anything</span>, for the sake of having reads. And that's perhaps true; I'm a bit ashamed of having offered so little so far and am keen to make up for it by saying things that can be both useful and analysed. However, I do feel particularly on Day 1 that you don't need huge amounts of reasons to call someone town.

But his reaction to Kaze's vote doesn't read as town to me and looks more reactive than anything. He says to lynch somebody that fits a particular set of descriptions for a good lynch, and he does offer Kaze as a good target (but this still feels reactionary). I still like his suspicions against notscience.<br>-CDB comes in with a feeble townread on notscience. A lot of people already have townreads on notscience so I see it as a way to jump on the townread wagon. I could be wrong, but this is how I see it.<br>-notscience still doesn't seem town to me at all. I have some familiarity with notscience, but he is the type of player I will never be comfortable reading.<br>-Grimgroove needs to stop spamming the thread so I can care enough to actually develop a read on him.<br>-Aeronaut looked optimistic on his early wagon jump. His defense wasn't that good either. I did like SK's approach to attacking everything that moved (early townread). However, now that pressure has dissipated off her a bit, she is already resorting to a utility lynch. I think it's scummy to lynch somebody just for information instead of for a scumread (if she thought I was scum when she voted me, then she should have said so). SK drops down my reads list (I don't really have an active list somewhere; just assume she's in my lynch pile somewhere).<br>-Fferyl and CTD are solid townreads for me. Fferyl feels warm and fuzzy and I don't see scum-motivation in her actions. CTD has the best reasoning to lynch me and he's extremely blatant about it. His actions read as town."}

I certainly didn't have time or energy this past week to do a very hard push. I really don't like the notion that a strong player shouldn't be lynched early because his scumhunting could pay dividends. The longer a strong player stays alive the more he can do for his team, but that goes whether he's Town or not; a strong scum player alive Day 3 and 4 in a game like this can be a very very dangerous beast. I didn't say much against it at the time - somewhat demoralized, I guess, and a difference of opinion that was rooted in a theory disagreement seemed unlikely to sway fferylt, for instance. I thought the wagon might yet have something in it. That's certainly not the case now.

I certainly didn't have time or energy this past week to do a very hard push. I really don't like the notion that a strong player shouldn't be lynched early because his scumhunting could pay dividends. The longer a strong player stays alive the more he can do for his team, but that goes whether he's Town or not; a strong scum player alive Day 3 and 4 in a game like this can be a very very dangerous beast. I didn't say much against it at the time - somewhat demoralized, I guess, and a difference of opinion that was rooted in a theory disagreement seemed unlikely to sway fferylt, for instance. I thought the wagon might yet have something in it. That's certainly not the case now.

This is on the hasty side of normal for me, but a reread of SpyreX's iso at that point kinda confirmed that his posts up to that point were reflective and observational.  The ornate narrative style caught my attention, but I couldn't decide if there was scummy intent buried in it.  More about this later.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5356697#p5356697\">458</a>, in response to CDB's post about Kuribo's flowchart, I unvoted.<br><br>The unvote was not a free day 1 pass.  It was essentially an acknowledgement that there's probably more than meets the eye to SpyreX' style and I shouldn't expect to be able to sort him so quickly.  It was also an acknowledgement that if he's town, he'll be a valuable asset in this game. <br><br>So, about that style and his contributions.  I think it would have been relatively easy to go hard after some of the low hanging fruit in this game, and look really proactive and stuff.  That's not what SpyreX has done.  He put some early policy-style stances into the game, and reiterated them, but hasn't shut things down to focus on those stances alone.  He has also taken a more interactive approach to the game.<br><br>----------<br><br>Overall I feel like this game is stalling. Some of the folks who were active early on have slowed down or faded.  I'm fine with a deadline extension."}

What I got so far:<br><br><br>Main topics were:<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">The Miller Claim</span><br>First off: I believe it. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5340924#p5340924\">18</a> I was almost sold, but then fferyllt's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341122#p5341122\">36</a> sealed the deal for me. I find a gambit highly unlikely.<br>When it comes to the reactions to this claim:<br>I liked: fferyllt, notscience, ChannelDeliBird, Spyrex, CrashTextDummy (even though several people voiced different opinions on the matter, the way they put forward arguments sounded town-intentioned)<br>I disliked: Aeronaut, Kazekirimaru<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Aeronaut's vote on Brian and his tone</span><br>I agreed with it being quite scummy, both tone and the vote. <br>I liked fferyllt's response to it and the way she probed Aeronaut.<br>I didn't like Kazekirimaru's initial push on the matter, especially because he was focussing on technicalities like Aeronaut making some mistake by quoting the wrong post. <br>I did not like Smudger's reaction to it.<br><br>General notes on players so far:<br><br>Liking both SpyreX and fferyllt as obvious town, already after 6 pages. The <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345841#p5345841\">133</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345955#p5345955\">135</a> really made me sorry I wasn't there at the time. Would love to become part of their town-affair and form some kind of love-triangle. I had the EXACT same thoughts as fferyllt in 133 when reading that discussion, and had the EXACT same feelings as Spyrex in 135. Beautiful.<br><br>Which brings me to both Garmr and notscience. both read like town to me. Garms I had written down \"well-intentioned newbie\". notscience is living up to the town-meta I think I know of him, a bit self-involved but I liked his moderate reaction to Garmr's case. <br><br>ChannelDeliBird always looks cranky. At least in the beginning of the game, but also while I was posting high. Somehow, I can't match \"crankiness\" with scum. You can say it's an emotion that's a null-tell, but I just can't wrap my head around cranky scum. His doubts surrounding the miller-claim seemed very pro-town and the way he talked himself out of policy lynching a miller felt very genuine.<br><br>Aeronaut, not liking his opportunistic vote on Brian. During the fallout of that, his defense was focussed on pointing at others (\"they're doing the same\") and on technicalities. Not feeling good about that slot, saw he replaced out but didn't see anything from SleepyKrew yet.<br><br>CrashTextDummie read very opportunistic to me at first, both by asking for more rope for me while I was how I was, and by taking such a strong stance on \"lynch all millers\". But after reading his explanation on why he thought millers should be lynched, I ciould see town motivations shine through it. I like how he found the inconsistency between the Wiki and what Brian was saying. It's something you'd only be looking for as town thinking you can catch scum. <br><br>Smudger (now Lolwagons) is my biggest scumread so far. His posts are off the beaten track, but without really leading us anywhere.<br>On top of that he stalls ongoing debates by questioning what normally should not be questioned from a Town PoV, namely their (the ongoing discussions') use. Not constructive at all. <br><br>Plum wasn't participating in the game yet by page 6.<br><br>Maestro was neither, I was genuinely surprised when I saw his \"waaaaat\"-post. Felt like a post of some out-of-game-observer.<br><br>Brian Skies: I believe his claim and I said why. Not much to add to that.<br><br>Kazekirimaru (Peabody): Not as sold on him being scum anymore. While I did not like his reaction to the miller claim (contradictory) and to Aeronaut's vote (opportunistic), the top of page 5 was a game-changer for me. There he really took clear stances for clear reasons, looking all the better for it. Maybe I should get ready putting that A4-paper in some blender. <br><br>More later. But already quite some townreads to show for only 6 pages <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">"}

His <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5377129#p5377129\" class=\"postlink\">assertion</a> he will eat paper if I'm scum assures me of this.  As I reviewed his iso, I wanted to lynch him, but no. Scum wouldn't say this. <br><br>Plum - Why does it matter if my town reads match the reads of others?  We all saw the same things.<br><br>I know my play is lackluster so far, but I'm just not feeling this game like I have others.<br><br>Notscience is not looking good.  His <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5357269#p5357269\" class=\"postlink\">reads</a> post is lacking.  Spyrex was scum because he called notscience town? Meh.  He has no reads on my slot, but he acts as if an accusation he is unreadable is making my slot scum.  Empire is 'leaning' scum because he hated the read on him?  He does have a better accusation against Plum who doesn't post a case on to back up his vote.  Why did he not vote Plum instead of Spyrex who he has less against?  His confident play like I'm 'obvtown' or his \"Sup, Scum\" in the neighborhood quicktopic doesn't read right to me.  However, he does seem to be mirroring pretty exactly a game I was in with him where he attempted to call out scum #1 and #2.  Because he's familiar with his meta, this doesn't sit right with me.  It's too exact.<br><br>If Brian is scum, I don't see CDB as scum based on early interactions and casting doubt on the miller claim.  I definitely can see as scum if Brian is town.  As was mentioned before, a miller claim is easy bait for scum to latch onto, and I think CDB's fixation on Brian's claim is consistent with scum trying to get him lynched.<br><br>CDB - Can you reexplain why you changed your town read <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5356625#p5356625\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>  on my slot to a <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5361257#p5361257\" class=\"postlink\">possible scum read</a>?  You said Kaze looked town based on his Maestro vote, and his unvote changed your mind.  But I don't understand this.  He still held a Maestro vote for a long time.  Your switch in attitude looks like you're opening yourself up for a possible mislynch.<br><br>Smudger (LolWagons) pings me as scum as well.  His vote on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5343242#p5343242\" class=\"postlink\">Aeronaut</a> is a sheep.  He casts suspicion on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5343242#p5343242\" class=\"postlink\">notscience</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341937#p5341937\" class=\"postlink\">CDB</a> really early, and these are passive-aggressive attacks.  Like he's testing the waters.<br><br>His vote on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346699#p5346699\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro</a> is bad, considering he casts suspicion on NS in the same post and mentions he is uncomfortable with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5344875#p5344875\" class=\"postlink\">Aeronaut's</a> play a little earlier than that.  This is all inconsistant with his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346903#p5346903\" class=\"postlink\">zero top reads</a> at the moment that he says later.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote Lolwagons</span><br><br>@LolWagons - I still want you to tell me why you felt the need to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5375646#p5375646\" class=\"postlink\">tell</a> Garmr that his question about my read on my predecessor's slot is unecessary instead of letting me answer.

I did not ask you to not answer the question, I just said it was bad and useless. It had been different if I had stepped in and said \"Peabody, you don't have to answer that\" or \"Don't answer that, its stupid\". My thoughts were directed only to Garmr. In a way, I suppose I gave you an excuse not to answer at that point, but I feel like its fairly common knowledge that is a bad question (ive seen it both asked and shot down once or twice in games) that you could have easily gotten away with saying the same thing, so that doesn't really matter. Lastly, hardly any discussion is bad, but that would have turned into bad discussion and a distraction. Since you said it was a \"trap\" you are implying it was designed for you to fail regardless, so how you react to it would have all been useless anyway, because the initial premise of the question was bad. We don't really have time for bad discussion at this point."}

I have half the activity and number of posts as Garmr and I still feel like I've given you more content than him. The only things I've really seen Garmr do that's different from me is his initial push against ns in the beginning of the game and his reactionary push against Kaze. And in regards to activity, I think I've been pretty fair in comparison to the players I had to deal with in the game that just ended today: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=31272\" class=\"postlink\">The Room of Doom</a>. Now, I understand my activity is still an issue, but I still feel you're over-reacting. People get busy, yet I'm the only one that gets all the flak for it (CDB, YYR, Garmr). The only reasons why I'm not replacing out is because I like to finish what I started and I don't think it's fair to completely make a slot look bad and give it to some poor unfortunate soul replacing in.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Reads</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fferyl </span>- Town. This slot feels warm and fuzzy to me and completely unlike the game I played against her in Mismatched. She is actively engaging people, trying to make reads, and using meta.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">CTD </span>- Town. This slot has felt I was scum from the start and for good reason. I feel like his distrust for me is legitimate based on my play. There was a small period where I was concerned he was scum trying to push my lynch, and then he questions SK's utility lynch against me. This is a town reaction.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kaze/Pea</span> - Town. I liked his trajectory of believing my claim and I still do. There was deliberation and I am satisfied with the answer he gave when questions about it. Kaze's scum-hunting feels genuine even though some people may disagree with it. His interactions with SK read to me as slightly irritated town. I know I said I wanted to talk to Peabody, but to be honest, I'm not completely caught up (I'm actually caught up I just don't remember what he wrote). I've already decided the slot is town for today.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lolwagons/Smudger</span> - Town. Smudger had some issues with some of his earlier actions seeming somewhat opportunistic or shallow. However, his interactions with SK feel like irritated town in much the same way as Kaze feels that way. I was getting the feeling Smudger was getting annoyed at SK that SK kept telling him he wasn't scum-hunting when Smudger was convinced he was. I've been pretty happy with Lolwagons being town since he replaced in.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Plum </span>- Less town. This is mostly due to recent irritation. But it's not like the slot moves anywhere. The slot is asking incisive questions and the scumhunting feels legitimate. The irritation of having to deal with inactive players also reads as town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">CDB </span>- Town. During my re-read, a lot of the comments and thoughts actually read as town to me (yeah, go figure).<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5376000#p5376000\" class=\"postlink\">post 686</a>, ChannelDelibird wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5373110#p5373110\" class=\"postlink\">post 626</a>, notscience wrote:</cite>Everyone died ;-;</div></blockquote><br>This post makes me think notscience is town.

I'm using my limited anecdotal experience with him and a recent reminder from another game of how scum prefer it to form a hypothesis, which does the job of answering the question to myself of \"would I be OK to lynch notscience today?\".</div></blockquote><br>This post feels somewhat genuine to me as it is the same exact question I constantly ask myself when dealing with notscience. So yeah, CTD gets to be town for a day. I still think the slot could be scum and I could easily slide it down into scum territory. It's mostly a gut thing (it's my gut and after the Room of Doom I'm going to do whatever I want with it).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Garmr </span>- Town. The push against ns early looked town-motivated to me. The push against Kaze looked reactionary and bad, but he did follow it up with a decent argument that makes me think it's just town tunneling against his aggressor. Overall, it just feels like lost town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Spyrex </span>- Null. I wish I could feel better about this slot, but I can't. The guy has been completely reading me based on my claim and not my actions. Not to mention the whole neighbor thing that I don't want to get into right now. Nothing he says really resonates with me in either direction.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Grimgroove </span>- Null. I kinda just stopped reading. I don't really have an opinion because I didn't have an opinion on the slot to begin with. There wasn't enough content generated by YYR to make me care enough. As for Grimgroove, it looks like he generated a lot of content the last few pages but I just haven't had a chance to look at it. Now, if I had to choose, I'd choose town. From the little content YYR did generate, it did look like the slot had good town-motivated intentions in it's actions.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">notscience </span>- Scum. I still don't like notscience's easy flip-flop in terms of voting me early on in the day. Backing off of the early wagon looks like it could of been done by anyone. The slot feels somewhat obnoxious in its attempts at townreads. I don't understand what's with the post-by-post-analysis. He knows I discriminate in favor of more verbose and logical posts, preferably walls. So I can't really get the angle and am wondering if it's directed at me or at everyone. Regardless, he's a claimed neighbor and should be sorted out later. If I had to choose one between the neighbors being scum, I would choose ns at this point.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Empire </span>- Scum. I actually feel like Empire could be town, so this is mostly by association through SK trying to pull votes off of Maestro than anything. I still like his reads list in general and some of his recent posts strike me as town. However, his opinion of me being coached for my miller claim feels like reaching and his Kaze/ns reads still bug me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">SK </span>- Scum. During the first read-through of the game, it just felt like a town player replacing into a slot where the predecessor made a poor play. \"Attacking everything that moves\" initially felt town to me. However, during my re-read, I get a completely different view. It mostly feels like scum fighting for self-preservation and throwing mud at whoever to see what sticks. The discussions with Kaze and Smudger feel like he's forcing them down our throats and I don't like how hard he was pushing those wagons. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">As soon as pressure seems to dissipate over him, he pushes a utility lynch on me and even admits to not even bothering to make a read on me. </span> How the part in italics would read as town-motivated to you guys is beyond me.<br><br>Now, I see a few wagons forming, but the only one I'm interested in isn't even up for consideration. I'm quite disappointed. With my luck, I might not even be around in time for the deadline hammer, but who knows.

Kaze's interactions also felt like irritated town. <br><br>As far as Smudger goes, his early interactions showed the first signs of irritations with SK and he seemed to be having issues with SK doing all the attacking without acknowledging the attacks Smudger was giving in return. Smudger also feels like irritated town. I can't see the two of these guys being buddies, so only one can be scum. Also, Lolwagons has seemed town since the replacement and has made me feel more comfortable about this read.<br><br>It's the way SK attacks Kaze and Smudger and tries to force those reads down our throats that makes me think scum. It seems he just asks a bunch of questions, tries to see where he can redirect the wagon to, and tries to paint those people as scum. It doesn't even feel like he's looking at the bigger picture.<br><br>Some things to note are the relative lack of interactions with some of the other players. SK doesn't really push CDB or notscience. Yet, he complains about Kaze not doing enough scumhunting when Kaze votes Maestro (what's wrong with motivating a lurker to come into the thread?). It also feels wrong the way SK tries to pull votes off of the Maestro wagon (which makes me think there is an association with Empire, but I could be wrong). He also completely avoids interacting with me unless he feels the need to, his only early mention of me being a miller claim that needs to be dead before lylo. His recent push against me feels like an easy cop-out (\"I'm not going to bother reading you at all because you're a miller\"). It doesn't feel town.<br><br>Also, based on the recent interactions, I can't see GG and SK being scum together, only one. The late push near deadline makes me think at least one of them is town (thinking GG, follow the logic), especially since SK didn't seem to have that much pressure from other players to be at risk of a wagon.<br><br>As far as re-reading goes, it's something I tend to do. Reading the game as it's happening is completely different from reading the game from a fresh perspective. I had the same issue in Mismatched where my early interactions with Shiny made me think Shiny was scum but everyone thought Shiny was town and I was scum. I couldn't figure out why until I made a re-read of the game. We were both town that game."}

Empire talks a good talk.  I went back through the Xenologue game that we referenced and he may be right that I misattributed some of the posts I was thinking about to his hydra partner.  But not all of them.<br><br>The observations about Brian's activity level in the two completed games is semi-accurate.  I happened to play both of those games, and the periods of inactivity was more noticable in Brian's scum game.  In Mismatched (his town game) the game days ended early with quickhammers, so the pace was much faster and there was incentive for town players to stay on top of the derphammerers."}

Some of you guys aren't even bothering to read me, so why should I take my wagon seriously? And I've given you content. I've given you tons of content. Maybe it's not the type of scum-hunting you expect from other players, but then we get into play-style differences.<br><br>Yes, I had a wagon on me. No, I was not the most inactive or contentless player in the game. You just chose to single me out because of my claim. Is it scum-motivated? I don't know. I've had to deal with inactive players too. But I've given you content and the way you're discriminating against me is complete bullshit. And I don't know if I already said this, but if you want to get specific content from me, leave some questions in the thread. I'll respond to them. I'll ask questions. I'll engage you more. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">COMMUNICATION WORKS BOTH WAYS!</span> But when there are a ton of people in the thread, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">will </span>get the tendency to just sit back and observe. That's just the type of person I am and there is correlation between that and the way I play the game.<br><br>Also, I always appear near deadline. Why? Because that's when the most inactive players tend to show up. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Because shit needs to get done.</span><br><br>Now, I already said this before, if you want to lynch me, then do it. But do it because you think I'm scum or because there are other better reasons that will lead to directly finding scum or benefiting town. I won't stop you. Just doing it because millers need to be dead at lylo or for whatever shitty reason that has nothing to do with my alignment is terrible and doesn't benefit town in any way. It's a cop out. And only scum need cop outs."}

Here's a compilation of all my reads with reasoning. I know this thing's rather long and unwieldy but please take the time to go through all of it. Let me know if you have any questions or if you need me to elaborate on anything. As an aside, a lot of people in this game look really town and it feels really nice but there's a lot of TvT-type arguments going on that need to stop ASAP (looking at you, Kaze / SKrew / Garmr / notscience). It's cluttering the thread with a lot of nonsense at this point and the votes could very well be served elsewhere.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">TOWN</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">fferyllt:</span> Consider this read to be very largely meta based -- from what I'm aware of her meta, she hates being scum and tends to be very lurky / image conscious, which is very unlike her play here. She feels comfortable posting, is generally very engaged with the thread, and has bits of cheekiness that I don't expect her to post as scum (ex: the second line of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341966#p5341966\" class=\"postlink\">#66</a>). Another little thing I liked is the way she locked horns with notscience in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348290#p5348290\" class=\"postlink\">#215</a> by telling him to \"give it a rest\" -- I think, as scum, she'd be more likely to encourage notscience's \"false positives\" or at least just altogether refrain from talking about it and let town self destruction happen (which was her approach in Xenologue). Her meta analysis in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351392#p5351392\" class=\"postlink\">#349</a> and the level of detail she goes into breaking down Kaze's linguistic falls in line with the meta analysis she loves to do as town and I think she's not as inclined to do as scum (in Xenologue, she basically took my word on LLD's meta without doing any visible work of her own). All in all, would be really surprised if she were scum this game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kazekirimaru:</span> Really not understanding why this dude has votes on him. Pretty much all of his posts and the way he's approached arguments with various players have a \"I have the higher moral ground\"-type tone to them (ex: \"you're being stupid\" / \"you're just wrong\") which is far more likely to come from town than scum -- town are far more likely to have a greater attachment to arguments like the one he's having with SKrew because they want to be right / feel vindicated; scum just see these kinds of back and forths as a way to contribute but as nothing more. His progression from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341908#p5341908\" class=\"postlink\">#62</a> to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5343735#p5343735\" class=\"postlink\">#100</a> based on the reasoning he provides in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346574#p5346574\" class=\"postlink\">#146</a> is something that makes A LOT of sense from a player with his experience -- a lot of newer town players do tend to take into account interactions with their scumreads in this fashion / consider what other people have to say. His abrasive playstyle is something I consider a towntell as I'd expect him to conform to expected behavior as scum. His reaction to the wagon + his frustration that people are not listening to him in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351163#p5351163\" class=\"postlink\">#337</a> reads incredibly genuine. The more and more I read this guy's posts, the more depressed I get that he was wagoned to L-2.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">notscience:</span> He's another player who I think has a very abrasive / annoying playstyle and just get this 'ugh' feeling reading through his stuff. That said, his play here fits the skeletal model I have of his townplay (he's another play I'd expect to conform to expectation as scum). He's not afraid of throw down cursory dismissals of suspicion against him (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345697#p5345697\" class=\"postlink\">#124</a>) and his repeatedly calling himself obvtown is something that checks out with his townplay in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=31132\" class=\"postlink\">Open 527</a>. I think he'd be a lot more self conscious as scum than to fuck around with posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346675#p5346675\" class=\"postlink\">#147</a> / <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346683#p5346683\" class=\"postlink\">#149</a>. Overall, the abrasive, rough-around-the-edges attitude he displays here reads strongly town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Plum:</span> Need to double check the meta of her (from what I remember she's another player who dislikes being scum) but she's shown strong signs of gamesolving given the level of detail behind her reads and her lines of inquiry. Mostly, though, I really like the indignant attitude undercutting all of her posts and the bits of introspection sprinkled throughout her reactions to others (ex: her reaction to Smudger's 63 in her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346757#p5346757\" class=\"postlink\">#157</a> -- \"This one really stupid thing is keeping me from voting you and I feel so dirty for that\"). I also liked her paranoia of SpyreX in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348611#p5348611\" class=\"postlink\">#263</a> and the way she goes about ruminating over his posts. There's an element of looseness to it that I wouldn't expect from her as scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Garmr:</span> He's another player who feels more invested in the arguments he has against certain players than I'd expect scum with his experience to be. I like the way he stands up to notscience in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345704#p5345704\" class=\"postlink\">#125</a> and his being indignant over notscience calling himself obvtown when he thinks he hasn't done anything worthy of the title reads as genuine. I liked his reaction to Kaze's vote in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5350854#p5350854\" class=\"postlink\">#303</a> as it almost feels like he's taking the vote against him to heart which is something I see far more from town. The level of detail he provides for his scumreads on notscience and Kaze reads like legitimate / genuine scumhunting.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">SKrew:</span> He's someone that I don't fully trust myself to read for some reason but I do like a lot of what he's posted. His reaction to the whole argument / line of questioning with Kaze reads very town, particularly with his frustration that Kaze is doing \"nothing\" with his votes in posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348255#p5348255\" class=\"postlink\">#207</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348259#p5348259\" class=\"postlink\">#209</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348299#p5348299\" class=\"postlink\">#220</a>. I also like the way he calls out SpyreX for the shift of read on his slot, I think he'd have just taken that and ran with it as scum rather than probe into turnaround. I like what I see here but will probably do a meta check whenever I get free time just to be sure.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">CTD:</span> Reading him as town mostly because I think he's playing differently than from what I saw of his scum play in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=25712\" class=\"postlink\">/in-vitational 12</a>. In that game, his votes lacked conviction as he placed them on all of the major wagons of the time with weak / lazy reasoning and he seemed more concerned with following the crowd. The votes he's placed this game have a lot more meat to them and him being shocked early on that people are believing Brian's miller claim wholesale is something I don't really expect from his scum game -- I'd have expected him to drop the issue entirely and move onto something else, not continue to pressure Brian. Need to do a full-on meta check here too, though, as I know he plays a very strong game as scum and I don't remember having read his town games too deeply.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NULL</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">LolWagons / Smudger:</span> I had to go over Smudger's ISO a few times to try and get a more firm read and I still feel really conflicted over the slot. I don't like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5344875#p5344875\" class=\"postlink\">#114</a> where he questions how people are forming townreads too early as it doesn't read genuine to me and it just feels like he's trying to discredit those reads at the risk of getting boxed in by them later on down the road. His votes on Aeronaut and Maestro do fit the scum-on-the-wagon / \"hey we can make this mislynch happen\" role given that there's not a whole lot of meat of them. There are also some places where it feels like he's deflecting certain questions by responding with something to the effect of \"other people are doing it too\" that just rubs me the wrong way. At the same time, some of the things he says do read genuine to me at a gut level -- for example, I really liked his response to SKrew in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5346924#p5346924\" class=\"postlink\">#178</a> where he basically says \"it's my vote and I do what I want with it\". And I do remember his playstyle being hard to read, as some others have mentioned. Hopefully, Slaxx's replace-in will help out here.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">CDB:</span> Liked his entry into the game as that seems consistent with what I remember of his early game play as town, but the fade out really worries me as I know he has a tendency to get lurky / inactive as scum. Expecting more content to hopefully make the slot more readable.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">SCUM</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">SpyreX:</span> I really disliked his treatment of the miller claim early on in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5342240#p5342240\" class=\"postlink\">#88</a> -- his argument that \"he's not throwing it up as a shield\" makes no sense given that 1) miller claims are mechanically \"shields\" as it is basically claiming immunity to cop investigations, and 2) Brian <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> initially treat his claim as a shield by telling people to \"look elsewhere\". He also claims the miller claim is town and wants to win without having to lynch it but then mentions in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351154#p5351154\" class=\"postlink\">#335</a> that it will have to die at some point. The two positions seem mutually exclusive to me. It feels like he's keeping his options open to lynch Brian down the road. I also don't like his progression from AeroSK to Kaze either -- it doesn't make sense for him to feel so confident that Aero is scum to the point where he's willing to hammer that lynch without deliberation (and want that slot's blood all over his face) but then move onto Kaze. In that light, the vote on Kaze feels oppportunistic. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Brian:</span> I don't like the presentation of the miller claim in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5340885#p5340885\" class=\"postlink\">#12</a> with the \"look elsewhere\" bit on a gut level mostly because it does feel like he's coming into the thread hoping that the ensuing attention on his claim goes away. The main thing that bothers me, though, is that it feels like he's laying the martyr act way to thick -- all throughout his ISO, there's plenty of mentions about how he's ok with being lynched / killed (notable examples include: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5340924#p5340924\" class=\"postlink\">#18</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341190#p5341190\" class=\"postlink\">#43</a>, end of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5351325#p5351325\" class=\"postlink\">#347</a>). It almost feels like a WIFOMy dare to get him lynched. As far as his scumhunting goes, it's all very surface-level / cursory and I just don't get a sense that he's strongly engaging with the thread.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">YYR:</span> Very weak read here, but I didn't like his cursory mention of the miller claim when he entered the thread in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5341842#p5341842\" class=\"postlink\">#57</a>. Aside from that, the attacks he's given on Kaze just feels like he's hitting things that look bad on the surface but not aren't actually scummy. Still waiting on more content from him though.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: SpyreX</span></div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>I'm going to look at some of his scum games and see if there are any patterns in where he puts his partners in reads lists."}

I've already mentioned getting one on her before, and I think I'm still happy with the reason on that one. Reading back, I initially wondered about <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5345716#p5345716\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>; I can see it both ways as either genuinely town trying to force another player into action/go with a hunch, or alternatively as scum trying to nudge a buddy into doing more. It's probably null but it did make me start looking at ffery more intently than some others as I read through and there are some confusing leans.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348395#p5348395\" class=\"postlink\">This</a> seems like an odd time/reason to unvote Maestro. [url=forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5355952#p5355952]This[/url] from Empire, in a larger post that should be crucial but that I find frustratingly impenetrable, at least doesn't seem to make a ffery partnership less likely. Again, I could see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5373129#p5373129\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> going either way but I thiiiiiink I lean slightly scummish on it. But then you get <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5385881#p5385881\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> and it's getting to a point where she's been pushing Empire for such a long time that it's hard not to think it's townish. But then <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5387973#p5387973\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> happens and I wonder again, although I thiiiiink it's consistent with fferytown as well. Overall, I am confused but I am willing to chalk enough of it up to paranoia and look at some general towniness and say this isn't the place to go today.<br><br>Plum, then. Around <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5348611#p5348611\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> time, she seems to be largely ignoring Maestro but includes him in a pretty passive list of basically 'people who can die, I guess', which I think is more likely to come from a buddy than not. I find her vote on Grimgroove a bit weird, as he looks fairly solidly town due to sheer volume of input and heart, and there are also a couple of other posts which I noted down though are mostly seen through confirmation bias, I suspect. Of everything, she seems like the vote I can least argue with at the moment.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Plum</span><br><br>If anyone wants to ask me stuff/point me to anything I missed, this is a good time.

The weight of your concerns about Empire towards the end of the Day seemed to focus on your previous experience of him in a game where you were scum and he was scary-to-you Town and much more proactive/aggressive than he'd been playing; the way you brought it up was both in line with similar lines of inquiry from you throughout the Day and naturally prompted in the course of analysis on your part. But the disagreement about what actually went down in the game you cited seemed natural on both sides; I felt that Town or scum, Empire genuinely remembered the game that way (and you also genuinely remembered the game that way) and furthermore that I had no strong feeling that either he was lying or that the example went exactly as you said rather than fall somewhere in the middle of the he-said-she-said. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5396269#p5396269\" class=\"postlink\">post 1041</a>, notscience wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5395960#p5395960\" class=\"postlink\">post 1038</a>, Peabody wrote:</cite>Garmr's post looks like a 'congratulating the doctor' tell.</div></blockquote><br><br>This was exactly my thought process</div></blockquote><br><br>Meh, I've been tempted to post things that would trip that so-called tell as both Town and scum, and personally refrained as all alignments because of the way it's perceived.

CDB called Empire 'promising' but also didn't touch him and remained on Brian all Day (lurking through deadline didn't help my general opinion of him, either - his IRL busyness is plausible, but dude didn't even mention that he'd be missing deadline?). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5397952#p5397952\" class=\"postlink\">post 1044</a>, Grimgroove wrote:</cite>I don't have much else to add at this point, apart from the fact that Plum's effort in 1031 rings town to me, though I'd like to hear more about her pre-selection process when lifiting out those three.</div></blockquote><br><br>Working on the assumption that the Emp wagon was all Town; I think it's a worthwhile assumption. The Kaze/Peabody slot is obviously not scum with Empire if you read the interactions and votecounts. I'd guess that the chances that Empire put no scumbuddies outside of Town on his initial reads post is fairly low, leading to strong scrutiny of the YYR/Grimgroove slot (listed as scum, but never pursued) and CDB (listed as null and occasionally poked at thereafter but also never pursued; both could have been pushed yesterday but didn't end up wagoned, and Empire also refrained from pushing them. CTD stood out for being mildly antagonistic towards the Maestro wagon and trying to get votes off it. It was neither as prominent a position as SK's not as inquisitve; it was basically just 'don't vote Maestro; I empathize with you guys but you should vote somewhere else'. That seems a more likely scummy position to me than SK's, though I do mean to look at that more - maybe later tonight, maybe tomorrow. CTD was minimally discussed by Empire yesterday (though he also was minimally pressured); not indicative of very much, but doesn't give any pause to my feelings about how CTD related to the Maestro wagon.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5399260#p5399260\" class=\"postlink\">post 1051</a>, ChannelDelibird wrote:</cite>Plum, then.

No, unlikely, but as scum I find that there are things I have to call out my partners on because I would have spotted them as town. Seeing as you seem to know Empire well, it would make sense that you'd feel obliged to draw attention to something.

As I indicated, I've played one game with him.  I pushed him because his play here didn't seem much like the prior game.

The Kaze/Peabody slot is obviously not scum with Empire if you read the interactions and votecounts. I'd guess that the chances that Empire put no scumbuddies outside of Town on his initial reads post is fairly low, leading to strong scrutiny of the YYR/Grimgroove slot (listed as scum, but never pursued) and CDB (listed as null and occasionally poked at thereafter but also never pursued; both could have been pushed yesterday but didn't end up wagoned, and Empire also refrained from pushing them. CTD stood out for being mildly antagonistic towards the Maestro wagon and trying to get votes off it. It was neither as prominent a position as SK's not as inquisitve; it was basically just 'don't vote Maestro; I empathize with you guys but you should vote somewhere else'. That seems a more likely scummy position to me than SK's, though I do mean to look at that more - maybe later tonight, maybe tomorrow.

My preferred lynch at the time of responding to that, SpyreX, was certainly going nowhere. From the perspective of looking at the most viable choices, the ones I might have to compromise on as deadline approached, Brian was the best of the lot by a small amount in terms of scumminess (I'd certainly never had the sort of town conviction on him like I had in relation to YYR's intial posting, and Grimgroove's initial round of posting looked good); the game utility of offing him was also relevant to me. I didn't think he was likely to be more generally readable, take up less discussion space hashing and rehashing as an issue, or contribute.

Whether a notsci town flip actually points strongly to town SpireX may be debatable (I say it does point that way), but the more important consideration to me is what would scum think?  Continued or increased paranoia between those two could help increase the in-thread noise level.

I certainly didn't have time or energy this past week to do a very hard push. I really don't like the notion that a strong player shouldn't be lynched early because his scumhunting could pay dividends. The longer a strong player stays alive the more he can do for his team, but that goes whether he's Town or not; a strong scum player alive Day 3 and 4 in a game like this can be a very very dangerous beast. I didn't say much against it at the time - somewhat demoralized, I guess, and a difference of opinion that was rooted in a theory disagreement seemed unlikely to sway fferylt, for instance.

You\u2019re a little more reassured than last time, though. Going through her clothes pockets, you find several extra bullet cartridges and an elegant silk scarf.

You thought there might be a chance that you had eradicated all the scum, but even then how would you know for sure?<br><br>You take a leisurely dinner out on the deck, trying to ignore the circumstances and enjoy the sea air. What you are really doing is avoiding the retreat indoors, which would quickly be followed by night, which would quickly be followed by\u2026 more death? <br><br>You\u2019d have to wait and see.<br><br>When you finally do get back to your cabin, you decide to drag the ornate wooden armoire behind your door. Just in case. If the scum decide to visit you tonight, the obstacle might not hold them off for long, but it would at least buy you some time. And that could make all the difference.<br><br>The furniture is relentlessly heavy. After it\u2019s moved, you\u2019re so drained that you let yourself fall into bed without another thought. <br><br>You sleep perfectly soundly, running through dreams upon dreams, none of which you remember when you wake up.<br><br>Hours later, you are rudely woken by a sharp rapping on your door, followed by someone trying to turn the knob on the door.

This whole thing has turned you silly.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Quite insane, actually.</span><br><br>With another laborious effort, the armoire is moved out of the way and you emerge from your room. You\u2019re apparently the last to have risen, and the others are all nerves and impatience.  <br><br>You fall into step as the group heads to the main deck. This is a morbid routine by now. You begin thinking of possible ways this day might go.<br><br>As you surface on the deck, the sunlight is harsh and in your eyes. You\u2019re blind, thrown off for a moment.<br><br>Then you hear a loud thud. <br><br>Then another. Faces dissolve in panic. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Yes, with this voyage \u2013 you can always assume the worst. You are right to assume the worst.</span><br><br>You look overboard to determine the location of the foreboding sound; perhaps there is something hitting the sides of the ship? Some stray flotsam, perhaps?<br><br>No, there\u2019s nothing there. <br><br>One by one eyes are cast skyward. Subconsciously you know what the sound is before you even see the body.

Unless you have something REALLY game changing that's going to take a long time to type up, I don't see what you could possibly have to add at this point.  I'm of the opinion that slow games lead to apathy.  Apathy hurts Town and Town alone.  It's kind of like baseball in that respect.  You only need to slow the game down when you are losing big.

At first the droplets were easy enough to ignore, and you decided to wait it out, not wanting the weather to get in the way of the deliberations. But by midday the skies had been rent open, assailing the ship with brutal rainfall. <br><br>Your group hurriedly seeks refuge in the lounge (though you remember that there was a death here only the other night, you try to put it out of your mind). You can see the veins of lightning through the bay windows, elongating the forms of the furniture. By now the sky is black, and your thoughts are punctuated every now and then by the discordant symphony of blaring thunder. <br><br>The deliberations are swift. After all, you can only stand the discomfort of sharing the same closed quarters with scum for so long... knowing they could be seated on the chaise lounge right beside you makes you so uncomfortable you could scream. Everybody lays out what they know on the table, hoping to find discrepancies in the individual claims. Something's just not adding up. You have decided the last scum must be <span class=\"noboldsig\">fferyllt</span>.<br><br>She bolts to her feet, shocked. She maintains her innocence and keeps questioning the others, telling what is to happen tomorrow when she \"flips town\". You of course are impatient. This scum is the cause of all your problems - she killed innocents and made you kill innocents yourself! - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and still has the nerve to lie about it</span>. Rage fills your heart.<br><br>One of you grabs her roughly by the arm and begins dragging her towards the door that leads outside. The rest of you follow, some more bloodthirsty than others. She does not flail, only keeps shouting and asking questions. Anything to stall the fate that awaits. You still have the rope that hung last night's victim; it would be an effective (and appropriate) weapon, vindicating the deaths of the innocent with the blood of the guilty.<br><br>In the torrential downpour, everything is made slippery, and it's hard to hold anything down with firm grip. Frustrated, one of you shoves the scum against the side railing, a little unexpectedly. As she falls, her head knocks squarely upon a metal rigging fixture protruding from the ship's side. Her eyes lose focus as she slowly slumps to the ground.<br><br>The rain continues cascading down, blooming into a red puddle on the deck beneath your feet. She hasn't lost consciousness yet, but she's fading fast. Now she sits in a state of statuesque calm, whispering something lightly. <br><br>There's no use for the rope now. \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Well,</span>\" someone says coldly, \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">any last words?</span>\" If the question is heard it is ignored, as she continues to murmur distractedly until finally, she doesn't.<br><br>The only crime <span class=\"noboldsig\">fferyllt</span> had ever committed was caring about the passengers aboard the Vendetta.<br><br>That had been enough to end her life.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">fferyllt, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town One-Shot Bulletproof</span></span>, has been lynched Day 4.</span><br><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Night 4 now begins.</span><br><br>Deadline: Tuesday, November 19th, noon PST.</span></fieldset>"}

Again you use some heavy furniture to block the entrance, and your vigilant gaze is set towards the door for hours. Every now and then you get up and look through the peephole to see if anything is going on in the corridor. <br><br>You have no real weapons but you have taken apart the bronze lampstand that was on the desk and hold it loosely across your lap. It would have to do. If the scum had decided to visit you they would have found you like that, sitting on the edge of your bed in your bathrobe and slippers.<br><br>But not tonight.<br><br>No \u2013 as the sun rises and someone comes to your door to collect you, you are still alive. Sorely sleep-deprived, you are cannot even find the energy to be happy to be spared.<br><br>The passengers have a brief conversation with the crew about the Vendetta's confused trajectory over the last several days. Despite the early sabotage of the ship's navigational systems, the staff says landfall is due within a couple days. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">We don\u2019t have a couple days</span>, you think tiredly. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">This has to end today.</span><br><br>It's either them - or you. All the optimism of earlier days is gone.<br><br>So you are unsurprised when a crew member reports another one of the passengers was found dead this morning. You to be escorted to where the body was found. Unexpectedly, the staff do not lead you up to the deck, but to the level below the rooms, deeper within the ship.<br><br>Finally you come to the ship\u2019s boiler room, and the crew member gestures you inside. <br><br>The space itself is large, though clearly designed to fit as much bulky equipment as possible \u2013 so nothing feels spacious. In fact, it is just the opposite. With large, bulky fixtures and pipes sticking out from every surface - even the ceiling - you're very cramped. Even though you are down to only a handful of people left, you feel very claustrophobic inside.<br><br>Nevertheless, you make your way around the narrow metal scaffolding used for maintenance checkups. As you turn a corner, the victim comes into view. They are collapsed against vertical piping. There is a glinting silk scarf skewed across their collarbone; looking closer, you notice the skin on their neck to be badly bruised. You realize the accessory must have been used as a garrote against the piping, so that the victim was slowly strangled to death. <br><br>Here, deep within the recesses of the ship, no one heard him die.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Yates, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Doctor</span></span>, was killed Night 4.</span><br><br><br>In his right breast pocket you find the keys to his cabin. You gingerly take the keys off his corpse. As with the others, you decide to head up to his room to search for anything that will help find the last scum. <br><br>Once you open his luggage, your heart drops. You expected to find nothing useful inside, but... in every compartment, you find a large assortment of instruments, painkillers, and gauze. This is no rudimentary first-aid kit. But none of you possess the medical training required to use these items safely. Based on the way some instruments have been strewn about on the wooden desk, you suspect <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yates</span> might have used them during past nights. But you can't be sure.<br><br>Everyone is taking this loss particularly hard. After all, the longer you kept the doctor alive, the longer you kept yourselves alive.

They had a severe disadvantage pretty early on as I hadn\u2019t anticipated crosskills until near endgame. I think it\u2019s very much worth mentioning that Empire had a BRILLIANT initial read on SpyreX and if he had gone with his gut for his N1 roleblock, the game might have gone very, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very</span> differently. Plum did what she could after Empire was killed, but there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of wiggle room.  <br><br>That being said, I don\u2019t think another person on the playerlist could have pulled off what SpyreX did for as long as he did. At first I thought SpyreX was going to screw himself by killing off the competition so swiftly, but it worked out for him. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> That was possibly the smoothest SK win I\u2019ve read onsite, I\u2019ve never seen a vigilante claim go over that well! Peabody could still have investigated SpyreX Night 4, as I did not make him investigation-immune \u2013 he would have turned up guilty.<br><br>As for the miller, I\u2019ve never played in a game with one, so Day 1 was interesting to watch. I\u2019ve always thought neighbors intriguing and knew I wanted to see how different factions would try to use the hood. In the end I decided the Serial Killer would have an interesting time with it, presenting a race of sorts to see if the Town Neighbor would suss him out in time. <br><br>Ffery\u2019s vest was never used. I was also pretty amazed that town\u2019s PRs survived so long without necessarily finding each other before massclaim, as I was expecting some to drop early game. The last couple lynches surprised me, as I thought both fferyllt and CTD had presented solid town play.

I didn't play particularly well, but I knew I couldn't bus my Roleblocker to death Day 1 in a 13 player game with a two-member scumteam. I was hoping I'd have Day 2 to work some damage control, try to milk another mislynch or at least get a good counterclaim if Empire were forced to claim. Buying a Day or two was, I thought, my only chance. Day 2 Empire being dead put me in a hole I was almost certain I couldn't come back from, and I didn't. Granted I was all but certain it was a Vig - I don't think I've ever seen SK claiming Vig go smoothly into endgame, and this game was an exception largely because Town expected scum to have been more powerful, it seems. I wish <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">. Not only did my only scumbuddy and only source of Roleblock in a setup rapidly leaning towards having a Cop (and ultimately, for that matter, having a Cop and a Doc) get offed Night 1, but my kill Night 2 didn't even go through! The degree of control scum had on the game fell away in the Day play and also through the setup. Alas, good game all. Spy, well played; like I said, first time I can recall an SK claiming Vig went smoothly.<br><br>CTD, excellent case on me. I did my best with it, but you were right in saying that the response was no more than a competent scum could whip up, and it was basically correct for scumminess on many counts.<br><br>I was going to say I'm fine with Mafia QT being posted if Empire is, but it already has in the Role PMs, so enjoy, I guess.

You can't derp your way to a win as SK against a town this strong. Spyrex scumhunted really well, managed to thwart the early suspicion on himself and overall played a very clean game. He was most certainly up to the task and earned this win fully in spite of setup gripes.<br><br>It's also not right to blame this loss on set-up spec. We were in a situation with 5 townies looking very town and an SK looking equally town. What's a town supposed to do if not speculate on the set-up? Keep in mind that the only way we can catch Spyrex in this situation <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> set-up spec! It's not the godfather spec that sunk us, it's the lack of 2-scum spec. I saw Slaxx do just that in the dead QT, so it was pretty clearly a case of town collectively misjudging gamestate.<br><br>Ultimately, this was a game where the majority of players did really well. And when two factions play really well (Spyrex and the town in this case), it comes down to subtleties, like the ABR lynch (it's highly unusual for a D2 mislynch to have such far reaching consequences). It also goes without saying that losing after doing well stings, but sometimes that's just the way the cards fall.<br><br>This game was a blast."}
