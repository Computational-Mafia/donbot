He's posted a lot more since then and I will provide some more opinions on him below.<br><br>Regarding my vote on Kcd. I feel like he has given off the strongest scum vibes. I do think there's a chance he could be VI which would mean it might not be the smartest lynch on day 1. I don't want that to be his excuse, just like how pisskop gave the derpy excuse, which is essentially the same. All that being said, you've given me a bit of a reason to pause on my vote on Kcd.

Overall, I think you should have posted the gut feelings you had on others.  How are we supposed to get a read on you and how are you supposed to interact with others if you're not going to post.  Doing anything else is {active}Lurking.  Saying you had 'nothing to go off of' is clearly not the same as 'having gut feelings'.  Why did you not want to participate in the discussion with your 'gut feelings', thus pushing us further from the RVS that you deem to be largely worthless?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Your question was how I contributed.

Since you have since said that you gain reads by gauging reactions, why were you not trying to get those reactions?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>No.  its an insult.  When you ask if Ive read the game it comes off as 'are you a moron, mate? You cant see why I would find it insulting?</div></blockquote>This is bullshit.  If I'd asked \"Have you even <span style=\"font-style: italic\">read</span> the thread?\"  Or if I said \"RTFT\", those would be insulting.  I simply asked if you'd read the thread because you hadn't been acting like you'd fully read the thread.  You're putting emphasis into the question which I find telling.  You feel that I was attacking you by asking if you were caught up.

A total of one post from this slot that had me reading his as town (p115).  First thing that sticks out is him not even looking at those on his wagon for possible scum.  This is the complete opposite of what I see wagoned town (including myself) tend to do.  Next is this weird connection between him and Xay.  d3x and I are close friends irl and play together often on this sight.  If anything, I'm more suspect of him possibly being scum when I'm town than anything.  The complete opposite is found from PK in regards to Xay's alignment culminating in his scum slip in p197 lumping himself in with Xay as \"townies\".  There is absolutely no way (barring Masons which I doubt this game has) that he could know Xay's alignment without being scum and either KNOWING Xay is town or trying to make them both out to be town while they are both scum.  My opinion at the moment is he should be today's lynch.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">ICEninja</span>:  Prob town.  I'm not a fan of being seen as scummy when I feel I'm being as transparent as fuck in my reads and my posts.  The only time I actually care how my shit comes out is when I'm scum.  This is why Titus and d3x are telling you fools I'm town.  Anyway, at this moment, there is little to no suspicion surrounding those on my wagon except coming from myself.  I don't see scum-ICE unvoting when he did.  That reads town re-considering and not tunneling more than scum trying to distance.  <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">d3x</span>:  Null atm.  I dunno.  I know this guy really well and there is a lot that looks like his town game in this game.  There are some things though that I expect him to do as town that I haven't seen.  It's still early though.  Those talking about his post being fluff while ignoring all the other fluff out there is looking scummy to me though...especially when the mindset is that I'm going to be lynched today.  Looks like setting up for multiple mis-lynches possibly.  PK has done this specifically in p193.  Thomith is guilty of this as well but I get different vibes from that slot (see below).<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">ika/Titus</span>:  Null leaning town.  Had this slot as scum while ika was around but Titus has only scored town points so far.  Coming in when he did, scum him could easily have called me scum and jumped on.  I always worry about scum distancing from a mis-lynch but I don't get those vibes from this atm.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Thomith</span>:  Leaning town.  I have seen town and scum both replace in and do a full thoughts list during a re-read.  The issue I have with this slot being scum is that as scum, the smart thing to do would be to read first, figure out where you wanted to end up, and then fake the reread in order to avoid contradictions of yourself.  He comes out the gate giving me a town lean.  As time passes, this changes.  I don't see the scum motivation for doing this.  Shows transparency which is a town trait.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kcdaspot</span>:  Leaning scum but I don't know....  I thought this slot was derp derp moron troll town but he proved he actually does know how to play this game with p153.  Super hard tunnel on town is usually a town trait but then again, I've seen scum do it too.  I dunno.  Prolly shouldn't be today's lynch and I might have him leaning scum just because I don't like how he plays MS (see all his post prior to p153).<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Rhinox</span>:  Null leaning scum.  I dunno.  Comes off friendly...a little too friendly?  I'm not his top scum read, but I'm on the list opening the availability for him to vote me for today's lynch while being able to say (after the flip) that I was low on the priority and shouldn't have been lynched today.  I dunno, could be paranoia, could be positioning.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Aisa</span>:  Super null.  Not enough posts.  What posts are there could be viewed as scumhunting but there is no follow up from her.  Not sure of alignment, but I do know she needs to post a lot more before the day ends.<br> <br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Xayzeck</span>:  Scum.  All I think I know for sure is that there is scum between PK and Xay if not both.  First he feels compelled to remind us all he's not scum multiple times.  Then there is him being on my wagon with sheeping Kcd's case.  He also doesn't really answer questions.  Look at his ISO 6 and 7.  Total scum backtracking.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Lucresia</span>:  Null.  I want to say leaning town because he's not all gung ho to lynch mean, but really need more activity.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Konowa</span>:  ...........will probably be replaced soon.<br><br><br>Alright, now to the case on me from Kcd (Thom's is pretty much a reword of what Kcd has said).  Every time I try and get into it, it pisses me off because everything I've posted has been in a manner to not hide any thoughts I have at the time of the post.  I wrote something up and saved it as a draft.  It was a lot meaner then.  I fixed it up best I could to be less mean, but I know it's still pretty offensive.<br><br>First point:  he completely ignores \"Thus, with Star-wars type logic, pisskop is scum.\"  Hmm...let's see, I us star-wars type logic and post it as such....how serious am I that I'm certain someone is scum in p27 of the game.  Dumb point.  Second bolded...Asking questions and expecting people to answer them in order to exit RVS is scummy now?  OMFG dumb.<br><br>Second point:  laughable.  I have called him derp-town all game.  I only want him dead because he's an idiot and bad for town.  And town being transparent is scummy now?  Town don't need to explain their thought process?  WTF is this shit?<br><br>Third point:  Calling someone to explain their posts is scummy again.  So so so freaking stupid.  There isn't shit about that post that's fluff.  I'm calling you out for not doing anything to drive the game forward.

Thus I called him derp town for the whole game up to p153.<br>-In p153, he shows he actually does know how to play MS and show reasons for his vote (as off base as they may be)<br>-Thus changes my read of him as VI to someone with a brain who knows how to play this game and thus could now be scum because he's NOT a complete idiot troll.  <br>-The reason I posted in the same post that I had called him derp town all game is in response to his 2nd point of his case on me.  Did you even go back to look at what that point was to see what the context of this supposed contradiction was referencing?  I'm betting a big fat no.  It was in response to him saying \"I actually think you're trying to set up a wagon me with this.\"  I had been calling him derp town all game, NOT fence sitting on what to think of him.<br><br>So, as you can see, there is no actual contradiction there.

I don't think we would coordinate ourselves so well even with a day QT(not sure how you came up with this either).

Lucky for you, I'm equally paranoid and that's how I'm going to read it at this point.  This is very likely to change if you keep mis-repping my posts in order to try and make me out as scum.  I post plenty of shit that looks scummy to most people anyway.<br>-Honestly, if you don't think PK though he was hammering, you need to re-read the events again.<br>-My p50 wasn't a suggestion for a hammer, it was a question to get an answer to get a read.  It was page 3 for crying out loud and nobody was anywhere near hammerable at that time.  Please don't mis-rep me again<br>-You need to not stand by your vote.  Xay likely isn't scum.  <br><br>p289<br>-yeah...I already said that reason isn't what I'm thinking or going with, but the paranoid part of me demanded it be considered.  Quite snipping segments of posts and trying to make it out like that's where I'm at when I clearly said I believe the other scenario I posted in the post you quoted it from.  More mis-rep.<br>_________________________<br>PI:  You really need to either look ahead to see what's happening currently before going to a full read of the game OR not vote after reading 3 pages.  p290 is awful.  Also, if you are going to comment on posts from the first 3 pages, put the link of the post you are referencing with your comment.  Unless you really don't give a shit if people completely ignore you.  We have people who are current in the game that ignore walls of the current goings on, you think they are going to go track down all those posts you are referring to??<br>_________________________<br>Xay:  scum day-talk is (or was last I played a few months ago) something that's fairly common on MS now.  An genuineness is actually why I see you as town not scum.  Hell, most of reading people on MS deals with how genuine of fake their posts feel, not just what they say in the post....especially D1.<br><br>-Also, I don't understand why you are calling PK town.  I already explained that a hammer yesterday preventing too much beneficial town info to be coming from town.<br>________________________<br>Rhinox:  I didn't say it CAN'T be faked, but please read through Xay's ISO and tell me he's going to be the player that is able to fake that reaction.  I said there was no way it was faked...not because scum can't fake something like that, but because I don't think Xay could fake it.<br><br>-p268 is the post that looks fake.  Maybe I have tunnel vision, but until Titus posted, I multiple people thought Xay was hammered.  PK asking Xay for additional info when the POST BEFORE HIS REACTION POST WAS HIS READS LIST is fake as fuck.  PK is trying to look town before a town flip.  No, PK is even scummier for p268, not townier.<br><br>-As for when I realized PK's vote wasn't the hammer, it was when Titus voted PK.  This forced me to look back at all the voting done since the last VC.  All my posts at that time were phone posts.  You know when I'm at a computer vs when I'm phone posting.  Computer posts are very much more detailed and longer....like this one or p287.<br>_____________________________<br>Thom:  You are one of a few that realized it wasn't the hammer.  Well, maybe more did realize it, but they weren't active at the time.  First person to realized it that was active was Titus, and I'm willing to bet he was at a computer.  You are right though, there was a fake post during that time and it was p268.<br>_____________________________<br>d3x:  ditto from the above.  <br>-Also, do you think I knew it wasn't a legit-hammer?  You didn't include me yet didn't say anything about it in your p296.<br>-As for the rest of the post, I more or less agree.<br>-Also, it's time to vote PK<br>____________________________<br>PK p297:<br>Flail scum flail.<br>-Your whole 'case' on me is plagiarism from other players and what they've already said.  Thus me saying nothing of original thought.  Also, if your case is \"quite valid\", why were you in such a hurry to 'hammer' Xay?<br>-Also, your intent to hammer reasoning is.....weird. You wanted everyone to know that you were going to hammer after your business?  You say it was so they could intervene?  You gave less than an hour for people to do that.  So...either you're lying or you don't realize that this is a forum game and not everyone in the game is on at the same time you are.....  Basically, I'm calling you a liar for this.  More proof you're scum.<br>-\"I had to talk myself into hammering him, and it was hard.\" - PK.   Lies.  If it was \"hard\", it would have taken longer than 50 minutes between intent and vote.  Also, if it was hard, that means you would have been unsure.  Being unsure means if you were giving intent so people could intervene as you claim, you would have WANTED people to post in between the intent and hammer...well...as town you would...thus lies.<br>-As stated above, 'your' case on me is nothing new or original.  Also, you're scum.  Why would I bother with your scum-case?  Tell you what though.  On the very off chance that you flip town (what...like less than 1%), if I'm still alive come day 2, I will address every single point you regurgitated in 'your' case.<br>____________________________<br>Aisa p302:  Good vote.  Want more from you.  See below.<br>____________________________<br>ICE:  The PK wagon has been anything BUT easy.  Trust me, I've been pushing it awhile.  It seems easier now because he's scum and messed up pretty bad and got caught for it.<br>____________________________<br><br>And that brings me back up to speed.  After posting my thoughts during catch-up, I've notice some similar lines of thinking and that is good.<br><br>Some things that need addressed:<br><br>Kcd:  Where are you?  Why have you disappeared after your push for my lynch lost steam?  What are the things that had you having second thoughts?<br><br>-Things to look out for in regards to Kcd.  I find it slightly odd that he was super busy and couldn't post....until it looked like PK hammered.  His p270 is just odd under this scenario.  It appears Kcd also believed Xay hammered and wanted to get some suspicion going for tomorrow with regards to me.  This makes perfect sense for scum-him to do if he know's Xay's about to flip town.<br><br>Titus:  I'd like to hear what you have to say about Xay's reaction.  Real or faked?  Does it make him still poss scum or likely town to you?<br><br>Aisa:  Same thing.  What are your thoughts surrounding the whole hammer that wasn't a hammer incident?<br>____________________________________________<br><br>Sigh....sorry, it turned into a wall.  Glad I didn't use quote tags..."}

Nothing new again.<br>-Yeah, me pushing your scum-slip (before you scum-screwed up with your 'hammer') isn't the only reason people are voting you.  Also, this has been brought up and addressed MULTIPLE times.<br>-more buddying.... see above.<br><br>Yeah, first of all, there isn't anything in 'your' case that can't be viewed as either not a reason someone is scum or had already been brought up and addressed previously.<br><br>'Your' case not being your case isn't even the reason you're scum btw.  Why are you so focused on it and ignoring most of the OTHER reasons I'm calling you out as caught scum.  Oh yeah, that's right, cuz you're caught scum grasping at straws.<br><br>You missed these btw:<br>-Also, your intent to hammer reasoning is.....weird. You wanted everyone to know that you were going to hammer after your business? You say it was so they could intervene? You gave less than an hour for people to do that. So...either you're lying or you don't realize that this is a forum game and not everyone in the game is on at the same time you are..... Basically, I'm calling you a liar for this. More proof you're scum.<br>-\"I had to talk myself into hammering him, and it was hard.\" - PK. Lies. If it was \"hard\", it would have taken longer than 50 minutes between intent and vote. Also, if it was hard, that means you would have been unsure. Being unsure means if you were giving intent so people could intervene as you claim, you would have WANTED people to post in between the intent and hammer...well...as town you would...thus lies.<br><br>You still haven't given us a full reads list.  I've asked for it in p246 and again in p287.  Know who doesn't want to give a full reads list?  Scum.  Hell, let's look back at your only 'full' reads list (which wasn't a full reads list at all but the closest thing I could find).  It was way back in p115.  Long story short, give us a reads lists with reasons why you are reading people what you're reading them.  If you were actually town, this is something you'd WANT to produce in the even of your lynch.  More proof you are scum."}

All of friday, saturday, sunday, and monday is still a lot of time to make sure a lynch happens. <br><br>Just because you argue loudly and repeatedly for your case and people aren't entirely convinced doesn't mean that PK is hard to lynch scum. <br><br>Lynching to \"provide the best information\" is not a good reason to lynch. Any lynch provides good information. Counter wagons provide good information. Quick lynches provide good information. Slow lynches provide good information. No lynches provide.. er.. well... information. Ppl not voting or avoiding the main wagons provide good information. EVERYTHING provides information, there is not 1 way that is best for any situation. Forcing ppl to vote a certain way \"for information\" actually REDUCES the information gained, because now everybody has a pro-town excuse for their action (\"I did it for the infermashunz\").<br><br>Even if you're right and PK is scum, and everyone voting PK is town, then thats what likely 6 out of the remaining 8 players are town. You suggest the titus wagon may be a scum driven counterwagon, so lets say both the remaining scum are there. That means {Lucresia, Kcda, xay, d2x, PI, and one of me, ICE, or Thom} are all town you've so far failed to convince, and regardless of how highly you think of yourself, I think its more likely that ~65% of the town is simply not convinced, rather than \"have our heads up our asses\".<br><br>Now, take another look at the VC. PK and Titus are tied. When PK realizes that you're not going to be lynched today and its either him or Titus, I'd expect him to vote titus, meaning the counterwagon will then have more support than the main wagon. If you don't think Titus would be a good lynch, then you're going to have to look at the case and tell me why its not a good lynch. Also, Lucresia, Kcda, Xay, d3x, and PI need to stop putzing around and pick one of these 2 wagons to pony up on or come up with a better option in a hurry. Pretty sure Xay or Kthx are not getting lynched today, so voting them or not voting at all at this stage is not helping anyone."}

Because thats exactly how I read it, as a hypothetical, and why I never understood what the slip was at first. In order to be a slip, then you'd have to argue that PK WASN'T presenting a hypothetical, and its pretty clear it was a hypothetical. If PK is scum it is not because of this \"slip\". The problem is that this slip is the only reason you've given for voting pk, and its a bad reason."}

The counterargument is what the person you accuse says it is, and then you decide if you buy the excuse or not. PK never claimed he had a town read on Xay as the explanation why he didn't slip. You don't get to just imagine a scenario up as THE counterargument and shootout it down as being farfetched when it is irrelevant. There are many many explanations one could imagine, but PK said he was talking about a hypothetical situation where if kthx and d3x were scum, then Xay wouldn't be. THAT is what you need to decide whether its farfetched or not. Not just dismiss it outright because you thought up your own easy to shoot down counterargument.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5744264#p5744264\" class=\"postlink\">post 340</a>, Titus wrote:</cite>Of course, you are using the wrong post to interpret my arguments.

It looks like a better worded version of the first post. Nothing was unjustly changed or added to explain away the slip, it was just worded better. I find it a completely logical, valid explanation.

There is no way you should be this confident about piss being scum based on the \"plausible but not airtight\" slip. Either you're bussing him, or you're just trying to survive the day. Even extremely valid looking slips that people have lynched for still end up flipping town. Slips are one of the most unreliable form of scumhunting and this isn't even close to a \"good\" slip.

I honestly don't buy the scumslip, because his explanation does address it pretty damn well. I don't know why you choose to keep it in there, because he could say that as town or as scum(given his explanation). What's left in this case is just a lot of things I'd call dumb, but not exactly scummy. Intent to lynch, and then hammering a few posts later? Dumb move. Saying we shouldn't hammer early, and hammering early? Dumb. Contradicting himself? Dumb. Blatantly jumping on another leading wagon while under pressure? Dumb.<br><br>Piss has been playing mafia longer than I have, and has been in more games than me. I'd expect his scumgame to be a lot better than this. A lot of these things are dumb moves I don't expect him to be making. What scum says that we need more info before a lynch, goes to the leading wagon, intends to hammer, and hammers without being sure I actually get hammered? Even if I DID get hammered, he'd get lynched the next day for hammering just after he claims intent, and ending the game so damn early. I doubt he could talk his way out of his lynch D2 for being so stupid.<br><br>Of course, he could just have a horrible scumgame and is making mistakes all over the place, but I don't expect him to be this bad. And what scum would pull a case out on a scumteam D1?<br><br>I came in and make 1 short post and get questioned.

I am townreading both Titus and piss, yes, but piss's play has been really all over the place. You keep jumping from person to person, wall after wall calling different people scum over and over again.

If you're town, you know any case on you is wrong. Bad players (town or scum) let emotions get in the way and are unable to consider that a player voting them can be wrong but still town. The hyperbole in the response is what makes it scummy. \"thats the poorest twisting I have seen\" is hyperbole. <br><br>If that was the only such statement it wouldn't be a big deal but she continues...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"Desperate for a mislynch? Or just totally ignore facts\"</span><br>This is pure baseless rhetoric. It serves no points but to score debate points and throw mud on my case any way she can. Again, the suggestion here is that I must either be scum or incompetent to vote her. And not only that, but the \"desperate for a mislynch?\" line suggests that not only am I scum, but I am scum WITH PK. She's arguing as if PK is already confirmed scum and that because I'm considering other options than PK and specifically voting her that I must also be scum. Why is she so sure PK is scum? And even if so, is it even such a sure thing that scum go so far out of their way to avoid getting a partner lynched? Sure, its something to consider, but Titus isn't merely considering it, to her its already a fact thats what I'm doing. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"(which there's evidence of considering you called me a he)?\"</span><br>This is really just ridiculous mudslinging. What does me using the wrong pronoun to refer to titus have to do with anything? She's trying to make a leap in logic that because I called her a \"he\", that means I'm incompetent and incapable of recognizing facts. Which is entirely bullshit. This is not something town says.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"I also find it funny that you appear to chainsaw, with a total lack of voting, until Pisskop is damn near L-1 if not at it.\"</span><br>This is a continuation of the \"Rhinox must be PK's scum partner\" idea, but for someone who just accused me of \"totally ignoring facts\", where did the total lack of voting come from and when was PK ever at L-1? I was voting Xay 24hrs before I voted Titus, and PK only ever had 3 or 4 votes, so L-3 at worst? Really, town or scum have no reason to blatently misrepresent a situation like this, but because Titus is trying so hard to smear me with rhetoric that makes it more likely she's doing it as scum. All this is rhetoric and smearing and trying to score points. She's not actively trying to lynch me so idk if she's just trying to scare me off or survive the day and get PK mislynched or if she is bussing PK and setting me up to take the fall tomorrow when PK flips scum. I do know that this is not how town reacts to getting voted.<br><br>There's more do I have to keep going? I'd really like to get some sleep tonight...<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744264#p5744264\">340</a> \"of course you're using the wrong post\" yes <span style=\"font-style: italic\">of course</span> because I'm scum right? <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Of course</span> I would do such a thing because I'm scum...<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Of course</span>... scummy rhetoric. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744414#p5744414\">343</a> I already addressed some of this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744872#p5744872\">350</a> but \"Th fact you don't want me to argue and use logic\" please this is not things that town says. \"look how scum rhinox is he doesn't want me to argue and use logic\". Its ridiculous and has never been a serious case in the history of mafia.

What do I have to be defensive about? I'm not the one getting lynched today. Yes, I'm absolutely trying harder to get you lynched because the more you post the more sure I am you're scum. If anyone has \"doubled down\" on anything, it has been you with this scum slip - you've gone from \"don't see the slip\" to \"plausible but not airtight\" to \"so obviously a slip no possible reason it can not be a slip\". I \"need you dead yesterday\"? this is just another way of saying I'm \"desperate for a mislynch\".

I don't care about the majority's interpretation. I haven't and I never will.\"</span><br><br>is just an excuse to disregard anything that doesn't fit your agenda regardless of if its valid or not. Right now your agenda is PK is scum because slip and I'm inherently PK's scum partner and anything that doesn't fit that agenda is disregarded as shit or just outright ignored.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"Piss's scumread makes sense for a) serial killer who sees me as scum and tries to link Town!ice to scum!Titus\"</span> - so after all the goings on about how I'm so obviously PK's scum partner, the \"A\" option for explaining <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744609#p5744609\">347</a> is that PK could be a serial killer? this is comically bad. There is no business even bringing up the possibility of a SK in a 12p mini normal unless there is some kind of evidence like unaccounted for extra kills. You know who brings up SK's like this? scum. either because towns that are SK hunting aren't looking for mafia/scum in general, or because you just slipped that your scum team is smaller than whats expected for a mini normal and you suspect there must be an SK out there for a balanced game. Town don't even think about SK hunting on day 1 in a mini normal. The idea doesn't even cross their mind.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"b) scum!kop trying to drum up support for my wagon from those who feel Ice!scum is unlynchable\"</span> - another implausible explanation that somehow leads to a conclusion that PK's post is scum - who are all these mysterious posters who think ICE is scum and would rally to vote you based on the connection? <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"c) scum!kop putting out a ridiculous theory to appear town. For instance, his big point is that ika never mentioned Ice. That's non-sense.\"</span> - why would scum-pk expect a ridiculous case would make him look town? THIS is nonsense...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"d) create more cover your ass caess for scum!Rhinox and ???Piskop who is in survival mode. D is my favorite.\" </span>- lol.. so now I'm scum and PK is ??? ? Did you finally realize that when PK flips town you still need an out to make sure you're not lynched in 2 seconds at the start of D2?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"Piss's whole theory isn't designed to be accurate, it's designed to get town!Titus lynched.\"</span> - yeah, so when its down to an either you or I situation, its not actually scummy at all to try to get the counterwagon lynched. <br><br>The fact that he did so by potentially alienating support he'd need to get you lynched and prevent his own tells me he was probably giving genuine thoughts. If he's scum, he's either hilariously bad at this game, or it is brilliant WIFOM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"Whatever, I always get lynched as town, it's much easier to scumhunt when I can post bullshit and have 3 people lapping it up rather than post the truth and get chainsawed six ways from Sunday. Seriously, no one thinks that Rhinox's \"attack\" on me and on the evidence isn't to save obvscum!kop. The freaking evidence is just right there. My god.\"</span> - I suppose it was only a matter of time before we got to emotional appeals as well. now we're back to PK being \"obvscum\" and I'm obvscum as well trying to save him. <br><br>In all this time, you've never established why if I'm scum I'd be concerned at all with \"saving PK\". Seems kinda like a foolish move that would only end up getting 2 scum lynched once people realize I was just desperate for a mislynch, instead of just 1. Why wouldn't I just bus the obvscum and try to get some towncred for it? Why would I do anything that would cause me to stick out at all? If PK is town I could just fall in line on the PK lynch and let kthx take all the blame. Of course its all wifom because scum can act a number of ways around a lynch. Its the townies job to analyze which situation is most likely after it's happened. PK hasn't even flipped yet and already you've decided I'm scum because I'm not just letting PK get lynched by default, based on nothing other than I had the audacity to vote you. You've made the conclusion without waiting for the evidence to do the analysis. <br><br>The problem is you've overplayed your hand. \"Chainsaw\" doesn't even become remotely valid until a flip happens. You're way too confident in PK being scum. You either know PK is scum and you're bussing while trying to set me up to be lynched tomorrow, or you're caught and you're just trying to live another day, make sure 1 mislynch goes through before you're hanged. <br><br>As far as I'm concerned, its a win-win at this point. 3 outcomes to the day.<br><br>1) Titus is lynched, almost certainly flips scum. I've seen this pretend-logic keep insisting you're right and dismissing or ignoring any and all evidence to the contrary kind of posting a couple times before, and every time I've seen it, its ended up coming from scum.<br><br>2) PK is lynched and flips town. Titus is lynched D2 in record time. Distraction and likely-scum are eliminated from the game.<br><br>3) I'm wrong and PK is lynched and flips scum. I eat crow and don't care because hooray scum lynch. If I have to take the fall day 2 as a result, so be it - I'll gladly trade townies for scum 1 for 1, pretty sure we've got the numbers to win that game. As long as its clear you're joining me on day 3 after I flip town."}

Yet, she's not voting for xay right now. She's voting for pisskop which is mainly based off of her town read on kthx and her believing the scum slip. (which I do not agree is a \"slip\" of any sort.) So she thinks xay is scum but then she is hesitant to follow through, and then agrees with an argument I consider to be very poor from kthx. This makes me feel like she's trying to go along with what kthx is doing as if trying to back up her scum buddy. I don't however see where she's defending xay, unless you just mean the uncertainty in post 308.<br><br>@ Rhino in post 338: I do agree at this point that if no one is willing to really lynch xay, then I need to look for more scum today. I do not want to waste a vote. I do not like a no lynch / deadline scenario. It hurts the town to not take advantage of our chance to get scum. With 7 to lynch and only 1 other person on board, I am in agreement that I need to move my vote. Xay, that doesn't mean you are off the hook in my mind, just on the back burner for now.

A weak argument against pisskop from kthx is enough for a vote, yet she hasn't even voted xay at any point today (even though she's made several points to note his scumminess.) To me this looks like someone avoiding a wagon with a buddy on it, but making her opinions that she thinks he is scum known for when he flips scum (town cred.)

Hop off titus and lynch scum-pk today.</div></blockquote><br>Scum don't just act how you say they act, you know. This is a very simplistic and naive view of \"how scum act\"."}

You seem outraged that you aren't getting enough people to blindly follow you. I just see you pulling at little strings hoping to get a bite. I am not buying the pisskop wagon right now. His actions thusfar just seem a little newbish, but not scum. <br><br>This is also why I wish we'd all go back to the Xay wagon. I am more confident on day 1 about the xay wagon than I feel confident about the titus wagon. Yet, I don't want to waste my vote either if no one is really willing to lynch him today. I think we get more information from a xay lynch. it'll help us actually get a better read on pisskop while getting a read on kthx. If xay is townie, i'd bet on pisskop being scum and kthx as town. If xay turns up scum then I can see pisskop looking more town with kthx looking like scum. Whether Titus turns scum or town, I really am still going to find kthx scummy. Yet, I won't have too many other leads. I want our lynch to provide us with some good day 2 analysis.<br><br>Here's two scenarios I can see regarding kthx's alignment with a Titus lynch for either role flip:<br><br>1. if Titus flips scum, kthx looks scummy for avoiding the wagon so hard. <br>2. If Titus flips town, kthx still look scummy because he took the easy way out. He's already set himself up for it by pointing out how \"fast\" the wagon formed on her. However, with a looming deadline, and being close to lynch, he knows she would be lynched without his intervention. Thus he can keep his hands looking clean."}

Rubicon was technically voting Kthx but that was KCDA's vote and I pretty much lump Rubi into the titus wagon players since it appeared he would have hammered had kthx not. PI was not voting anybody and has not really participated at all. kthx wanted to lynch piss and only reluctantly switched to titus for deadline so I'd rather lump him in with the kthx voters.<br><br>piss is probably gonna get a bunch of early votes and I'm not really inclined to speak against it since my reads to a bit of a hit with Titus flipping town.

I could see Rubicon-scum if piss is scum, but null or slightly town if piss is town. I could see kthx-scum if piss is town, and town if piss is scum. But I am most confident in finding scum in a group of {ICE, Thom, piss, xay, Lucresia}.

D3x flipped tracker so it is entirely possible that scum picked up on something. Perhaps it had something to do with him saying he had information he didn't want to discuss. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a specific player he wanted to track.<br>2) The player has dangerous reads. If someone calls out an entire scum team, they usually need to die.<br>3) To frame somebody and speculate on #2. I'm not saying Kthx is scum, but scum will night kill to send people down the wrong paths and even use it as a drive for a scum-pushed wagon.<br>4) A player is unlynchable, and will make it to lylo and win if he is not NKed.<br><br>It is often a mix of these.<br><br>Day 1 NKs are not particularly good to speculate on because there is typically so many different reasons as to why someone can be NKed. ESPECIALLY if someone flps PR.<br><br>I do not like Xay's flip from Asia to piss back to Asia, especially since he voted for someone that he didn't want to vote for the purpose of placating another player. That is so so scummy. I now feel like the scum team is 2 of [piss, Xay, Rubicon] and 1 of [PrivateI, Asia]. I'm not sure if I like Xay and piss for buddies though, which bugs me a little because Rubicon is mostly on there out of PoE and reads the most town of the 5 players I just posted, but if my current speculation is correct he is statistically the correct vote.<br><br>Gut still says there is no way all the D1 wagons are town, and the only way piss is town is that Xay is scum. PrivateI should probably be lynched sooner than later though, if he isn't going to play.<br><br>I'm not feeling an Asia vote right now, with all this other stuff. I'll stick with piss."}

I was thinking about this for a little while prior but not really acting on it because I didn't feel like lynching an active player would be best for the game with so many inactives. Now that we've got replacements, I don't have a problem saying that I was starting to feel like ICE may be scum. I know I said I thought he was town earlier but comments like these made me question it:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5757967#p5757967\" class=\"postlink\">post 461</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>This day is starting out slower than I did the morning after St. Patrick's day.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5765330#p5765330\" class=\"postlink\">post 501</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>But let's be real I don't really give a shit about this game anymore so...</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5767302#p5767302\" class=\"postlink\">post 503</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>*Crickets*</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5773590#p5773590\" class=\"postlink\">post 519</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>SIGH.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5775821#p5775821\" class=\"postlink\">post 522</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>If this game just kind of fizzled and died, I honestly wouldn't even mind at this point.<br><br>Just saying.<br><br>I'll give this game a couple more days before I'm out of here.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5784356#p5784356\" class=\"postlink\">post 556</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>But yeah there are, what, 4 slots that are probably going to replace and we've gone half a week without anyone stepping in?<br><br>I'm just about done with this game.</div></blockquote><br>Now, yes the game was slow. We were all a little bit annoyed by it. But these posts stuck out to me moreso than comments others were making because... well when a town is apathetic it is is scum's best interest to keep the town apathetic, because apathetic towns are easy to manipulate or at least hide in simply by not being useless. It has been proposed in some of the MD \"how to play scum\" guides I have seen that encouraging apathy can be a useful (albeit boring) scum strategy. And these posts seem to be encouraging apathy. 501 - I really don't believe ICE didn't care about the game anymore. He was active and generally posting useful content and then this \"I don't give a shit anymore...\" comment just really came out of no where. Same with 522. If players see other players not giving a shit then they're less likely to give a shit themselves. These kinds of posts just seem to be intended to fuel the apathy, and not combat it, so I am suspicious of ICE for them.<br><br>I can't remember if I had other things I wanted to say about Rubi's wall of posts back on page 22 or not at this point. I kinda agree with kthx in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5778153#p5778153\">538</a> that a lot of it seemed fake but I don't have too much of a problem with it because the game was stalled and if you have to force a bit to get something going then of course it is not going to read naturally. I kinda thought maybe Rubi could be scum just trying seem like a dutiful townie trying to spark the game. Yeah yeah I know I just said maybe ICE could be scum for sowing apathy so how can \"trying to spark the game\" also be scummy? Well neither are definite scum tells, its more in looking at the motivation behind the action. I've felt good about ICE prior and I felt good about KCDA so I don't know if either is scum really or if I was just grasping for something at a time when the game was stalled.<br><br>I think Rubi was probably town-motivated trying to spark something because he did get both kthx and Xay to engage him in conversation, and he kept the conversation going, not just post a bunch of stuff and attack attack attack lynch lynch lynch etc. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5780356#p5780356\" class=\"postlink\">post 550</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>Unless I'm wrong about BOTH Rhinox and Kthx, I doubt there is any scum skillful enough to be pushing multiple wagons on town like that. And Kthx was pushing on piss. I'm pretty much feeling like scum is just as bad as town this game, and the victory will ultimately come down to which side gets better replacements.</div></blockquote><br>I don't agree with this. What does scum skill have to do with what the wagons were? Town can be pushing wagons on town, its not just scum that lead the mislynches. If you assume 3 scum in the game and everyone in the game is bad at it, then the odds all 3 were town comes down to random chance. When you work the numbers, if you take a random sample of 3 players there is a 62% chance 1 or more is scum and a 38% chance that all 3 are town. And thats just a random sample it would be the same if you selected any other 3 players randomly. Even if scum players are bad, given that these were wagons and scum are an informed minority, it may even be logical to assume that the D1 wagons are less likely to be scum given that even bad scum are probably more likely to support wagons on town than their scum partners. If that is true, it may even be wise to lynch from <span style=\"font-style: italic\">outside</span> the group of D1 wagons today. Anyways, just going back to random numbers, sticking with the same group of 3 wagons from D1, the fact that Titus and d3x flipped town means the odds of at least 1 of the remaining 2 wagons being scum drop to 53%, with a 47% chance they are both town. And if piss or xay is lynched today and flips town (a la your hypothetical scenario in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5783900#p5783900\">552</a>) and there is another town nk, then the odds that the remaining day 1 wagon being scum falls to 37% or 3/8 - same odds of anybody being scum if selected randomly. Just because on D1 a group of 3 players has a 62% chance of containing at least 1 scum doesn't mean that the remaining living player from that group has a 62% chance of being scum 2 days later if the other 2 players in that group flipped town. That is the definition of the gambler's fallacy.<br><br>I'm not trying to say that you're basing anything on mathematical odds, just that your premise and logic is wrong. Bad players mean choices are no better or worse than random IMO, and the odds of a player in an essentially random group don't increase for the remaining members of the group after 1 or more of them flip town. I don't know if you're just using bad logic incorrectly but from a town motivation, or if you're trying to entice the town to mislynch both Xay and pk over the next 2 days because you \"can't imagine all 3 D1 wagons were on town\" from a scum motivation. IE:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5784351#p5784351\" class=\"postlink\">post 555</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>So Rubicon, if Xay dies and flips town with Titus dead an having flipped town, you'll still <span style=\"font-style: italic\">legitimately</span> believe that piss is town?<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I don't have great feelings about Xay and you might be right about him, but if piss flips scum I know who I'm instantly voting.</div></blockquote><br><br>TLDR: you're either town falling prey to the gambler's fallacy, or using it to set up/justify mislynches as scum.<br><br><br><br>So yeah I think that gets me up to what I said I wanted to post thoughts on in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5787701#p5787701\">558</a>.

Town and scum are of different alignments, with different win conditions, and play differently. If there wasn't multiple scum trying to throw town off, then I can pretty much guarantee you that D1 lynches are going to occur on scum more often than 1 out of N-1. The D1 lynch tends to fall on town partially, yes, because there are more town than scum, but the pick is NOT random, and it is HEAVILY influenced by scum.<br><br>Especially consider how the wagons started yesterday, and who the main players pushing them were. It was the competent players. And they are the players who I feel are more likely to be town than scum. People can call me scum for being this confident about this all day and it doesn't change the fact that I'm still probably right.

You look to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5721689#p5721689\">38</a>, you see Xay coming out early against pisskop's wagon. Immediately I'm thinking buddying; immediately I'm thinking there's some ulterior motive for this post. Especially when he up and admits he'll be \"buddying quite a bit\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5722232#p5722232\">45</a>. One post I can't link to you is something that Xay has done all game long. Sure, I can show you <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5730524#p5730524\">160</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5732675#p5732675\">217</a> or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5732832#p5732832\">225</a>, but it doesn't truly sum up what every player that has been in this game since D1 knows about Xay. He's been inactive, half-baked, and not giving it his all. You can say he's posting from his phone, you can say there are worse players than Xay doing this, etc, but those are just excuses. His activity has just not been up to snuff. Another really ugly, really objectively scummy post is his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758154#p5758154\">466</a>. He sheeps Kthx despite the fact that he's been open to the idea that Kthx is scum and even voted him for a time. As others, notably ICE, have said, Xay was a leading wagon yesterday that was spared at the last minute due to what some saw as pisskop attempting to orchestrate a quicklynch. I do not think pisskop is capable of concocting a scheme like that, and, further, I think pisskop's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5736119#p5736119\">268</a> speaks to the fact that this was a genuine attempt at lynching a player that looked scummy. In any case, ICE makes a good point about Xay potentially being \"the one that got away\" yesterday. Lastly, Xay has already claimed. This should speak to your sense of pragmatism when evaluating the best lynch for today. I do not think anything about Xay's unprovoked claim is necessarily townie, nor do I think Xay's reaction to him thinking that he was lynched was necessarily townie. I'm not using these as points against him either, however.<br><br>Has the scumteam been sitting back, allowing the town to fight amongst themselves, and providing the bare minimum amount of content to keep from catching too much flak? If so, we should vote <span class=\"noboldsig\"><strike>Aisa</strike> pacman</span>. Xay is arguably guilty of this too, as is PrivateI's slot, but pacman is clearly the worst culprit in this department. We start it off early with a poor, poor excuse for a reaction test in her self vote of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5721447#p5721447\">35</a>. She does it at an extremely awkward time that only serves to detract from the bigger things going on (notably, pisskop catching a lot of heat). What makes this post even worse is that she claims that she agrees with Kcda insomuch as pisskop is guaranteed scum, yet she still votes herself without explaining this discord. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5723998#p5723998\">77</a>, she does attempt to explain that she didn't want to see pisskop at L-2 so early, but this after the fact explaining is a day late and a dollar short. To me, town wouldn't be afraid to explain this in the same post, especially when they're calling a person out a scum. As I say in my notes, I'm all about being above board as town. When someone deliberately starts to stray from that, I get suspicious. A ton on inactivity from her until we finally get something in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5738068#p5738068\">302</a>, she half-heartedly defends Kthx because of meta (huh?) and says PrivateI's posts look like filler (Which everyone effectively already said in much harsher terms, oh, and by the way, PrivateI had only made one post at that point). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740754#p5740754\">320</a> isn't believable for me. It sounds robotic, rehashed, overdone. Her question for Titus led nowhere and she didn't care to follow up on it. Finally, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5747003#p5747003\">376</a>, her second to last post, we're left with her undercutting herself in the very same post.

If so, we should vote <span class=\"noboldsig\">ICE</span>. Until the last ~5 pages, I was prepared to have Kthx as my answer for this scenario. I still very much think Kthx is a candidate for scum, but I've found a player that has managed to overtake him. My notes show a lot of coverage of Kthx during D1. Remember that Kthx spent a great deal of time arguing with pisskop. Some of his reasons were good (pisskop trying to overexplain himself during RVS), some not so good (the so-called scumslip). With ICE, I didn't find all that many problems with his play early on. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5729505#p5729505\">130</a>, I found it odd that ICE didn't take the time to call out ika over ika's sheeping of him. It was just weird, it looked like ICE was playing dumb a bit here. I didn't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5734713#p5734713\">239</a>, which is rolefishing. You can say that Kthx was the one to bring this up already in the form of \"scumslipping\", but ICE was the one to try and connect it to a town PR. There's no town motivation to put that out there, regardless if Kthx brought up the quote already or not. ICE really starts to take a turn for me around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5748454#p5748454\">390</a> though. This isn't so bad by itself, but it gets worse later. Here he's calling out Rhinox for flipping scum for pisskop flipping scum for Titus flipping town before Titus has even flipped. I'm not even kidding. Further, it implies that he knows Titus will flip town. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758452#p5758452\">474</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5769911#p5769911\">513</a> contradict one another. ICE changes his principles/scumreads to accomdate others and push his agenda. Read these two quotes back to back:<br><ul><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 474 wrote:</cite>Day 1 NKs are not particularly good to speculate on because there is typically so many different reasons as to why someone can be NKed. ESPECIALLY if someone flps PR.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 513 wrote:</cite>OH also something I forgot to include about the D1 kill, if a majority of the scum team was on the day 1 mislynch, scum tend to prefer to shoot someone who wasn't on the wagon, as the day 2 lynch tends to fall more often than not on someone who was on the mislynch wagon day 1. Shooting someone on the wagon makes it easier for town to nail scum day 2.</div></blockquote></ul>NKs aren't good to speculate on, but here's some speculation about the NK, in other words. You may ask yourself why ICE would be so contradictory? Because his 474 was in response to Xay voting Aisa in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758296#p5758296\">473</a>, while his 513 was in response to ICE bolstering his pisskop scumread. I think his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5779865#p5779865\">548</a> is misleading about Xay and pisskop's relationship, but Xay should speak to that one more than I should. ICE's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5793139#p5793139\">589</a> is unsightly panic at the thought of Kthx actually taking the time to step back and think about this game rather than just kneejerk vote pisskop like ICE wants him to. ICE subtlely tries to intimidate Kthx into going back on the pisskop wagon by threatening to scumread him. He uses a similar tactic with Rubicon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5784351#p5784351\">555</a> as well."}

I can understand why you'd be confused about this as I wrote quite a bit. I'm trying to do something a little different this game. Since we do not have a scumflip yet, I'm trying to free my mind of harboring any bias whatsoever (A is scum, so that means B is likely his partner). I think that leads to confirmation bias. I tried to break it down in kind of a unique way in that I have three separate scumreads based on what a scumteam could be trying to pull off in this game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Xay 631 wrote:</cite>Also, brief thoughts on the rest of the playerlist?</div></blockquote><br><br>I strongly disliked Kthx during D1, but I think his D2 has been a total transformation.

Should we consider a player that is lurking, avoiding confrontation, and providing content that's stale and useless?

I actually was about to post this discrepancy too before I went back and Ctrl+F'd the game. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 635 wrote:</cite>It wasn't role fishing. I was simply saying \"It wasn't a scum slip. It could have been a mason slip but it isn't because they aren't masons.\"</div></blockquote><br><br>The point is, you were broadcasting thoughts about a player you thought was potentially a town PR. To me, that's a no-no. Thankfully, I am not a mason, but I would be pretty pissed if I was because it would certainly limit my tactical options vis-\u00e0-vis claiming going forward. I mean, you could've easily said that you didn't think it was a scumslip and left it at that.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 635 wrote:</cite>I don't recall any of the players active at the time thinking I was rolefishing.</div></blockquote><br><br><strike>That's because none of the players are as good as I am.</strike> No one calling you on it before means precisely dick to me. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I'm</span> calling you on it, and I will let others judge the merits of my accusation.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 635 wrote:</cite>My post 390 was in response to Rhinox explaining 3 possible scenarios based on flips, and Kthx pointing out that he missed a possible scenario. I was filling that in. I wasn't particularly expecting that situation at the time.</div></blockquote><br><br>Elaborate on this, please. You mean to tell me that this post was not implying that you would suspect pisskop and Rhinox should Titus flip town?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 635 wrote:</cite>Kthx tries to use d3x's death as part of his reasoning to explain why I'm scum. I explain extensively (mostly in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758452#p5758452\" class=\"postlink\">post 474</a>) why there were too many reasons d3x could have died to use it as reasoning as to why I'm scum. In the second one, I was adding yet <span style=\"font-style: italic\">another</span> reason d3x could have potentially died.

To clarify, I'm not saying that either of these positions are necessarily right or wrong, I'm just saying that they contradict in a suspicious way.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 635 wrote:</cite>I'm also not threatening anyone of scum reading them.

Anyone can look at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5784351#p5784351\">555</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5793139#p5793139\">589</a> and come to this conclusion. On two completely different, completely distinct situations, where two different players wanted to diverge justifiably from voting pisskop, you threaten them for considering that alternative. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kthx 638 wrote:</cite>Slip or am I reading into things here? Leaning slip</div></blockquote><br><br>Eh, that's prettttty technical, but I get what you are saying. My language was off, I meant to say, \"I have the unique position in knowing that pisskop is town, but you [would] not [if you are a townie].\" <br><br>I thought that was implied given that I was voting him and explaining my rationale behind why I thought Xay's buddying of pisskop was sketchy, but hopefully that clarifies it for you.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 645 wrote:</cite>Oh that's rich, I just went through and read RC's catchup notes.

Hard to explain, sort of, but Kcdaspot gets really excitable as town, and his tone here reminded me of an old game where I'd read him as scum for pretty much the same reasons Kthxbye did in this game, and Kcdaspot had been town there. Good times. Anyway, Rubicon has done nothing to change this read and seems to bleed town himself, so this slot's good.<br><br>2) Kthxbye is town. I'm pretty sure of this. Apart from his behavior, which is seriously town because no scumbag plays with that level of conviction and passion for pretty much everything, I doubt he would have killed d3x last Night. d3x was reading Kthxbye as town, and there was a significant portion of the rest of you who were not; Kthxbye-scum would have kept d3x alive for at least another Night.<br><br>3) Town read of Rhinox still holds, I think.

His pursuit of ICEninja while there was a competing wagon being made on Titus, on the other hand, is the opposite. Grrargh. Thus, tonight, I'm going to go read a couple of games of pisskop's to observe him in various habitats and maybe that will provide some insight into what kind of habitat this game was for pisskop.<br><br>That said, I really like that RedCoyote went through the game and posted thoughts on each bit. I'll read it in better detail later, particularly because my eyes started glazing over when ICEninja and RedCoyote went at each other. Maybe tomorrow.<br><br>4) I've already talked about the difference in Xayzeck's play between this game and Micro 302 and how his answer doesn't make much sense. I had some niggling gut town feelings from reading Xayzeck's more defeatist \"welp, I'm getting lynched\"-type posts, but those were blown to smithereens with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758154#p5758154\">post 466</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5761804#p5761804\">post 481</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5768501#p5768501\">post 507</a>. In the first two linked posts, Xayzeck votes pisskop to appease Kthxbye and then later admits to pisskop that the vote had been to appease Kthxbye. Hell no. Town does not vote a town read to appease someone else. As if that wasn't enough, Xayzeck then votes pisskop again when the wagon on that one swells in the middle of Day 2. Keep in mind that Xayzeck had been very loud about his town read of pisskop for the latter half of Day 1.<br><br>That said, I'll hold the vitriol until I've read a scum game of Xayzeck's.<br><br>5) I said something earlier about having a problem with most of my scum reads being in a certain pool and my town reads being in another pool. Fortunately, it's less of a problem now! ...because I don't see pisskop and Xayzeck being scum together, and I'm fairly certain we have at least one good player on the scum team. The reason for this is WIFOM, but let's roll with it: d3x was very obviously town but so were other players who were not under pressure as of the end of Day 1 (e.g., Rhinox). If the scum pool were contained within {Aisa, pisskop, PrivateI, Xayzeck}, they would not have needed to target d3x necessarily; Rhinox was more active and had more sway than d3x. I believe that, had the entire scum team been contained in that group, that group would have targeted Rhinox, even if Rhinox was protecting pisskop at the time. pisskop was under fire from pretty much everyone except Rhinox, Rubicon, and Xayzeck, at any rate.<br><br>Instead, it's d3x. Crumbs, reads, whatever the reason he died, I'm pretty sure there's at least one player outside of the aforementioned group who is scum. As to who it is, no clue yet! Ihihi.<br><br>The rest:<br><br>6) PrivateI is a huge, gaping black hole.<br><br>7) Lucresia is also a huge, gaping black hole but for an entirely different reason. There's probably a culture clash going on because all ~2005 players sound the same to me (except Cogito Ergo Sum), and here's Lucresia, who sounds very 2005. Since Lucresia isn't here, I'll probably get something from N, which may happen sooner or later. N's method of replacing in gives me some good feelings at the moment.<br><br>8) Admittedly, I don't have much of a read on Aisa. Her theory that pisskop didn't want to miss out on a lynch of Xayzeck and thus jumped on it gave me a gut town feeling, but that dissipated by the time she went \"Titus might be town and now I'm hesitant,\" which, given hindsight, didn't sound very good. I can see the merit in Rubicon's (I think it was Rubicon's, though it might be RedCoyote's) case that Aisa was waffly and hesitant in everything, which is exactly what scum would be doing in a slow game. So, uh, I guess that means I need to reread her and evilpacman18.<br><br>9) I said earlier that I was bothered by ICEninja forgetting Xayzeck had claimed. The reason for this is typically scum will have claims in mind, especially if they're hunting for power roles (and they are in this game, I guarantee it; see #5). I read ICEninja as town because he forgot Xayzeck claimed. When he announced, just as enthusiastically as the last time, that he'd forgotten, well, there goes the read? Going off what I know of ICEninja in previous games, if he's scum, he's probably not scum with any of the inactives. I'll need to reread ICEninja's posts in light of all the stuff that's been brought up against him, but that will most likely happen after I go through pisskop and Xayzeck.<br><br>The setup:<br><br>10) It's not yet time! Ask me again later. :D<br><br>I thought I'd be done when I was all caught up, but nooo. There's still so much goddamn stuff to read.<br><br>tl;dr - Unless reading more changes my mind, I'll most likely vote Xayzeck."}

I mean, if the scum team was something weird like {Aisa, PrivateI, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">[insert the last experienced scumbag here]</span>}, then it's possible that all 3 wagons sprang on town because the other two were either barely present or simply absent for much of the Day.<br><br>Let me think on it?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5804827#p5804827\" class=\"postlink\">post 705</a>, RedCoyote wrote:</cite>What's ICE's response to this, E?

Rhinox I have a town read on, and the only reason I didn't toss him out, too, is paranoia and lack of knowledge as to what Rhinox-scum looks like.

I believe EPM because I think the best explanation for the lack of a kill is a protection on equinox. No offense to ICE I just don't think he would have been the nk last night. I also kinda believe that there was no protect submission from Aisa N1 &gt;.&gt;, whereas I think scum would have just claimed anyone as a N1 target if it was a fake claim. As for ICE I think he seems pretty genuine and I don't think he would have had a reason to come out and claim today as scum. I also see that back at the beginning of D2 he was consistent was calling Thomith town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5788141#p5788141\">561</a>. I don't see the crumb for the N target, but I don't think it matters. I think claiming with 2 innocent results after 2 mislynches is a pretty good time to claim as town. So if everyone is telling the truth, then:<br><br>ICE<br>EPM<br>Equinox<br>N<br><br>are all town. Me also being town, that means likely 3 scum are in the remaining group of 4:<br><br>RedCoyote (pkop)<br>Rubicon (kcda)<br>Kthx<br>havingfitz (Konowa/privateI)<br><br>Not quite easy mode, but pretty close. One thing going back to D1 is I really don't think KCDA and Kthx can both be scum, so I'd probably prefer lynching red and/or fitz first.<br><br>I'm just thinking about could there be any shenanigans. I don't see a reason why both claimed roles wouldn't/couldn't be town. Hider is best used as kind of a weak investigative role, and ivestigative+protective is pretty standard town power. Hider role could have easily resulted in a \"2 deaths in one night\" scenario with no claimed innocents, so its kind of swingy but I don't think the fact that the town can be in a good position like this after 2 mislynches rules out both roles being town. It could have easily swung the other way, and I bet at least 50% of games begin with 2 mislynches anyways so we really shouldn't be in dire straights yet. Doc role can't protect the hider and let the hider get any investigative results, so its a balanced combo, not OP IMO. Scum likely has some role... could be as simple as a RB but maybe not - I just finished up a game where scum had a 2-shot strongman and a rolecop vs. a normal cop and JK so there could be alternatives to the RB. I think current site meta is biased against RB usage because it is too strong for scum but that doesn't rule it out. I guess there could be a chance ICE would have been RBed last night and have an invalid result on N, but I'm not concerned about that right now. Only if one of RC or fitz flips town. I don't know if we can assume any valid results going forward though. Scum with a RB could RB ICE tonight and kill EPM for example. I think that also rules out any strategy to get another result for tomorrow."}

He did push for pkops lynch quite hard D1, but ultimately hammered titus. Then I got suspicious of kthx D2 for voting Xay to explore other avenues when it seemed to be not just exploring other avenues, but polar opposite his beliefs. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5759257#p5759257\">476</a>. Kthx called it a reaction test that I passed but it very well could be evidence that kthx was looking to no longer bus pkop starting in D2. I mean, if town was so intent on not lynching scum!pkop, then scum!kthx would eventually probably stop bussing so hard right?<br><br>I actually think this post might point to Rubi being town. If he's scum, he knows I'm town, and therefor would be painting himself into a corner if he got me lynched, and then I flip town and he has no one left to push as the 3rd scum.<br><br>I think best thing is still probably to lynch RC and/or fitz - assuming they both flip scum, then town has 2 chances to lynch the final scum out of Me/Rubi/kthx which I'd be fine with. If one of RC or fitz flips town then something screwy is going on with the roles. <br><br>If scum don't have a RB, then its possible we could get another result from ICE's role. ICE should probably hide behind one of Me/Rubi/kthx I just don't know if its better to announce before lynch or not. If we knew there was for sure no RB, then ICE's target could be announced and say he picks kthx, then EPM can protect kthx to avoid 2 deaths, and ICE wouldn't be targetable. So if ICE dies, kthx is scum, and if ICE lives, kthx is town. Problem is if scum have a RB they can really screw with the results - for example if target is really scum, block ICE + kill EPM to \"confirm\" the target is town. Or if the target is really town, then block+kill ICE could frame the target as scum. If ICE doesn't announce, it kinda forces scums hand to block ICE + kill EPM to prevent any worthwhile results. I guess best case scenario is we lynch a scum RB today or other scum role powerful enough to make a scum RB unlikely.<br><br>Plan could be something like:<br><br>1) if scum RB is lynched, hider target will be announced as XXX, doc also protects XXX (announced before hammer)<br>2) otherwise, target will not be announced."}

I did not use the last shot last night because, one, in case there was a chance my role could be confirmed somehow by the town, and two, I didn't think I would get shot last night. <br><br>So, with that all said, I'm at a weird position. Does my role count as a protective role? I can protect myself with it. The <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=commuter\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">commuter</a> wiki page lists it as a protective role as well. The Mod's link to the classification of \"protective\" roles (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5720492#p5720492\">1</a>) has commuter on that list. Does my role count as a \"non-standard Hider-like\" role? The commuter is not part of the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=normal\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">normal</a> list of roles that are explicitly defined as normal, but then again, it's not on the list of roles which are explicitly \"non-normal\" either. What's more, the hider role <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> on the list of explicitly normal roles, and the compulsive modifier (as well as X-shot) are both listed as explicitly normal as well. <br><br>So where does that leave us? Does my role specifically preclude one of the other two from existing in this game? Could all three PRs conceivably be in the same game? Is it possible that either pacman or ICE has a scum-aligned version of their roles? <br><br>Again, I didn't really want to claim this until I could pressure pacman a bit more because, frankly, I have not liked his play at all in this game. I do not think his protection makes sense based on the things he's said. I do not like his claiming so early today because it smacks of premeditated strategy. I did not like Aisa's play at all prior to pacman's replacing in. I saw nothing that would otherwise point me to thinking that that role slot had a PR. I've yet to see pacman show us any sort of breadcrumbs. <br><br>Now, with that part said as well, pacman has two major things going for him: 1) Doctor is as \"standard protector-y\" role as you can get. The flip side of this argument is that, as Rubicon said, although the Mod clearly states that there is a protective role in this game, it does not specify that the role is necessarily town-aligned. Further, I would've never considered a commuter as a standard protector role until I actually read the wiki that had it listed under the category of protective roles. 2) The lack of a night kill last night. The flip side of this argument is that we have a player that has claimed hider. Further, I contend that pacman's play is unusual today. I do not think it is ridiculous to consider the prospect of a deliberate no kill by the scumteam last night in order to then immediately have a player claim doctor that visited a non-controversial player like Equinox who is generally thought of as town by a majority of players here. <br><br>You know, if it was any other player that had claimed doctor, I'd be much less critical of the position we are in. Additionally, it's easy to dismiss everything I've said and say \"occum's razor; vote: RC\" because, in truth, I know I'm in a bad position here. I'm at the point though that I have to put all my cards on the table and we'll see what happens. I've got to say that I do not trust pacman and I think there's more to this setup than meet's the eye. I'm going to spend a little time researching the Mod to see if he has ran any games prior to this.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: evilpacman18</span>"}

You're right, commuter is literally within that link, so even though he could have implied that a standard protective role would only mean doctor, he explicitly means that a commuter could be within that statement. This definitely could suggest that Pacman was actually lying the whole time. Oddly enough, with this all considered, RC's claim actually feels more town to me.<br><br>I still have a damn near impossible time thinking that RC is town. It is entirely possible htat they're BOTH scum and have actually set up these fake claims to ensure one of them lives.

However, a quick search of the wiki reveals that a hider is explicitly normal, and simply making a role compulsive and/or unable to target a player on consecutive nights doesn't make the role non-normal (or experimental) but simply non-standard. Which is the verbage the mod used. A commuter, then, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span> exist in this game.

As it happens, this isn't Bicephalous Bob's standard operating procedure. I don't know if the announcement regarding the setup was a recommendation by the Normal Review Group, and it's something I didn't see in the 100 or so setups I collected in Little Italy between December 2010 and October 2012. However, two things lead me to believe either that such a recommendation happened or that the reviewers allowed the moderator to make some setup information public: This is something that theme game reviewers occasionally recommend because it's needed to balance the game, and, within the context of Normal games, there was an issue with a Large Normal that ended in March 2012 (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=21341\" class=\"postlink\">New York 145</a>) where there were too many non-standard roles and there had been concerns while the game was ongoing that the fact that this wasn't announced had the potential to affect the game.<br><br>That said, to give you an idea of what does and does not warrant public information: Last year, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=21622\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1326</a> was run with 13 players and two factions, but the mafia team consisted of only 2 members. There had been no announcement there. What's different, though, is that the power roles that had been used in that game had no modifiers and there were no atypical mechanics (i.e., no Day talk). That said, considering the amount of power that's been claimed already, we're more likely looking at a full scum team.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div>I've been skimming the past three days, so I'm going to comment on just the claims now and get back to the rest of the material in a few hours once I've caught up properly.<br><br>For the purposes of this part of the post, I'm going to assume RedCoyote is a commuter as he claims: Judging from the presence of a hider, protective role, and tracker and the claim of a commuter, Bicephalous Bob may have been designing this game around the theme of hide-and-seek. Unfortunately, there are two possibilities under this Hide-and-Seek Theory, which doesn't help with determining RedCoyote's alignment at the present:<br><br>1) A scum-aligned commuter would make sense with a town tracker if the aim of the setup was to have both sides playing hide-and-seek against each other. Town hides from scum, and scum hides from tracker. A town-aligned doctor would also make sense here in the sense that a town doctor would \"hide\" someone from scum seeking that player. Furthermore, with a scum-aligned commuter, the scum would naturally make the assumption of a second anti-town faction; Bicephalous Bob specifically mentioning that there is only one anti-town faction would have been for scum's benefit.<br><br>2) Commuters are more likely to be town (<a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commuter\" class=\"postlink\">according to the wiki</a>). A town-aligned commuter would make sense if the aim of the setup was to have town playing hide-and-seek against scum. If we look at the game this way, there cannot be a doctor in the setup; a scum-aligned doctor wouldn't make sense given that the moderator has already taken out the lulz factor of putting one in, which would mean evilpacman18 is lying through his teeth. Given that people were putting evilpacman18 in their lynch lists, it's not unlikely that he saw the blurb and decided to claim doctor to draw out any counterclaims for the \"standard protective role.\"<br><br>Basically, I'm pretty sure we actually do have a commuter. Honestly, option 1 makes more conceptual sense to me, but that line in the wiki bothers me. Site search shows precedence in Little Italy for all commuters being town except for one third-party commuter, as well, counting only the games that were run after Normalcy reviews were required: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=24199\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1400</a> (1-shot), <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=27171\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1444</a> (near-vanilla with town-aligned commuter being the sole power, and now I've got a bro-crush on Voidedmafia), and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5068082#p5068082\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1454</a> (2-shot).<br><br>Argh. Anyway, I need to read this thread, but have fun with this harebrained theory in the meantime."}

Both of these things seem equally unlikely to me in as non-bias of a way as I can look at it. 1) Assuming you believe I'm a commuter, what are the odds that a commuter would be scum-aligned given the lack of precedent? 2) Assuming you believe pacman is a doctor, what are the odds that he's scum given the lack of practicality of having a scum doctor in this setup (Mod stated that there's only one scum team and it's extremely unlikely the town has any sort of killing role). <br><br>With that said, I'll go back to being my bias when I state that I can give at least three strong, catagorically separate ways in which pacman is not a part of this town. 1) Meta-wise, I believe I could take the time to form a substantial case for this not being the way pacman plays (I have a little experience with him that encourages me to research this argument more thoroughly if I become inclined to do so). 2) Based on Mod-supplied, public information about the setup and the questionable reasons to include two \"protective\" roles. To be fair, this argument is mostly stomped out with the Mod using a qualifier \"at least one\" in his ruleset. 3) pacman's play on this game as an island and how it does not appropriately fit with either a doctor claim or a town-aligned slot. <br><br>To put it in less fancy of a way, he's scum because of meta, setup speculation, and his overall play.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 816 wrote:</cite>I (correctly) guessed why he did it, but it is suboptimal town play unless he's on the chopping block.

I've explained this to pacman some, but I don't think I've yet to put them altogether.<br><br>1) pacman protects Equinox despite never mentioning Equinox at all during D2. His explanation was that his reads were \"changing\". Leave aside the fact that it makes logical sense to protect one of your top four (!) townreads over night, which pacman did not, why choose Equinox? It's seemingly random. I mean, Equinox personally would've probably been my third choice protection-wise, but I made it clear that that is where she was as far as my townreads go (behind Rhinox and Rubicon).<br>2) pacman claims his role and his protection immediately despite no pressure whatsoever to do so. His explanation was that he didn't want to \"waste time\" because he thought there would be four clears with him and ICE put together. He can't even say that he was trying to spare Equinox from being lynched, because ICE already outted his information. pacman really gave the town no good information here. I contend that neither pacman nor Equinox were ultimately going to be the lynch today without the claims. It would've been me or fitz's slot, I think.<br>3) pacman immediately believes ICE's claim despite the fact that pacman was on record saying that he was starting to read ICE as scum yesterday. I mean, pacman wasn't the least bit suspicious of ICE? Really? Perhaps if he had waited a day or two to see if there were counters or other players with role-based information that may dispute what ICE was saying, I would be lenient here. pacman doesn't wait for any of this though. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 816 wrote:</cite>Also remember that if we lynch RC today it forces scum to NK pacman, whereas if we lynch pacman today RC won't be night killed, and they'll most likely target a cleared player.</div></blockquote><br><br>Either way we're going to lose a cleared player (cleared according to one of us three, of course), but I like this point.

If you're town, then the whole wagon before you unvoted is town. At least 75% of it from your POV, depending on your read on me. I don't know why that would be giving you an odd feeling. There's no argument against it because everyone has pretty much POE'd the slot as scum out of necessity for anything else to make sense. The fact that fitz/idk hasn't been lynched yet should be a sign that its not as \"easy\" as you think it is.<br><br>If fitz/idk is scum, I really don't expect scum could afford to be actively against lynching him. I think we're pretty much at the point of the game where scum usually aren't actively against their partner's lynches because they're afraid of being linked to their partners. When there's such a small pool of likely scum, when scum pretend to be town, from their POV they pretty much have to have scum reads on their partners and be ok with their lynches.<br><br>The way the day is evolving, it looks like either EPM or idk will be the lynch, and I think both are likely scum. I see the same argument regarding the EPM lynch that no one is really against it. I actually sensed more momentum towards lynching one of RC or EPM throughout the day than lynching fitz/idk, which makes it seem like scum doesn't want fitz lynched today."}

A big part of the reason why that was so though was because pacman and I are actively going after one another whereas fitz hasn't posted at all D3 and idk just got here yesterday. In that regard, I think you ought to weigh that idea that it \"seems like scum don't want fitz lynched\" versus people being reluctant to lynch someone over what amounts to lurking and PoE. I'm not shy in saying that pacman is a scumread of mine based on content, meta, and setup speculation. By contrast, idk isn't a scumread of mine based on any of those traits. He's only a scumread of mine because he's the least townie VT by factors completely independent of him. Hence PoE. And with that, I want to add that it's entirely possible that you and/or Kthx and/or Rubicon could be playing well enough in my eyes to get me to actively read all three of you as town. <br><br>As a matter of fact, it could still very well be the fact that you all three are the scumteam... although that clearly is what I would consider to be the least likely scenario at this point.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 902 wrote:</cite>I'm ok with waiting for people to come in and give their 2 cents but I'm honestly not sure what more can be added today based on the information we currently have.

This was mostly because I know who I think is town and if they thought fitz needed rope over the other uncertains, like Rhinox, I was fine with trusting them. idk has since come in, immediately aligned himself with RC, and come up with some really weak reasons to be voting me. Given his position when he replaced in, where he was about to be lynched, it seems like too much of a coincidence too, that he came in, didn't try to read anyone but me, and voted me. The vote comes off as more of a best bet at survival than a scum read he legitimately has.</div></div></div><br><br>More in a few hours, that actually took a long time to write. Anything I should address besides cases? Maybe I should try to better explain why me claiming was a good idea.</div></blockquote><br>Oh dear, you caught me. I am in fact scum. You should all probably lynch me now!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br><br>I voted you&gt;RedCoyote because you both are scumreads of mine, but RC's case is based mostly off of WIFOM, while yours is not. I said \"as far as I know\" because I'm not going to falsely claim that I've read everything so far. You pretty much nailed the definition of \"forced\", if you slightly altered the beginning. If a claim is forced, the person who claimed was a suspect, but was not at L-1/L-2, and still claimed. And, *gasp*, that's exactly the situation you were in. <br><br>This sentence: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Actually reading that sentence \"seemed very forced\" and \"he didn't have any reason to claim\" are not only both lies but also directly contradictory to one another.\"</span> is absolutely incorrect. First of all, they do not contradict each other whatsoever. Secondly, I said \"as far as I know, he didn't have any reason to claim\", not just \"he didn't have any reason to claim\". This may not seem like a big difference, but what I said implies that I do not know for sure (which I don't). Can someone give me a reason why he needed to claim?<br><br>I'm kind of swamped with homework right now, so I may not be able to post again tonight, but I'll try and check in at some point tomorrow. See ya."}

How that man managed to never catch any suspicion on his alignment is beyond me. I guess because it just didn't seem like a scum role at all, but I was sufficiently (and pleasantly!) surprised that we didn't have to deal with anyone second guessing him. N did a fine job. He was effectively given free rein thanks to ICE. This allowed him to do whatever he wanted and playing a touch trollish just to keep the town off their game. <br><br>Coming into this game, I worked very hard to secure that Xay lynch. Realistically, I thought that that would be all I'd be able to do for the scumteam this game. After securing that lynch, all I wanted to do was get the protective role outted and then I fully expected to be lynched. I threw that commuter crumb out there early as an ace-in-the-hole, not knowing if I'd ever want or need to use it. I figured it was ambiguous enough to cause some confusion. When Equinox started spinning her theories about \"Hide and Seek\", I was sitting here like, \"Huh? Oh... Uh, y-yeah! That's the ticket!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\">\" I don't think neither myself nor N expected pacman to be the protective role though, much less have a successful protection. That threw me for a total loop. Strangely enough, Luc and pisskop fingered both PRs immediately on N1. How they were able to ascertain that was very impressive. <br><br>But pacman allowed me to really push him hard the entirety of D4. ICE was a big help in assisting with that, as was Rubicon. When ICE and Kthx dropped the whole \"one of Xay/pisskop/Titus has to be scum\", that was a very helpful. I'm glad no one called them out on that, because I had no effective answer to that. <br><br>Anyway, it was a shame that there were so many flakes/inactives in this game. I was having a ball with it. <br><br>Mod, I enjoyed the flavor. I wish there'd have been more of it.

First thing, I would actually like to apologize to town. The way I exploited my role was legitimately unfair for your side. That combined with a sheer number of replacements made this game virtually impossible for town to win.<br><br>So. Mafia traitor compulsive hider. This is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">both</span> the worst role to play in a normal that I've ever seen and the role with the most possibility to ruin the game based on play (with only a mafia framer being worse but that is based on luck, a successful frame has decided entire games before based on a single night action, ICKY) depending on the setup.<br><br>First, regarding my reaction receiving this role PM. I was...pretty unhappy. I'm biased in that I always prefer to play town over scum, as the thrill of the flip is my favorite part of this game, but this role made it even worse. The part about playing scum that sucks so much is the feeling of isolation during the day phase. During the night phase you're able to talk and plan, which really alleviates that, and many games have day talk these days which actually allows me to enjoy playing scum because it feels a lot less like you're on your own, one screwup away from being lynched.<br><br>Being a traitor doesn't give you that comfort of playing with your allies, though. Sometimes traitors are attempting to get \"assimilated\" in to the mafia squad by being the target of the night kill, but being a hider, I knew that it wasn't possible.<br><br>So then there is the other half of my role PM is being a hider. By itself, a town hider (compulsive or not) is generally best played as a suicide bomber unless you're super town. If a town hider gets super town status then they should be playing to dodge kills. However, most hiders play as a sort of suicide bomber. A cleverly crumbed hider dying behind scum flips and all but ensures scum's death, even better than a cop guilty claim. I obviously didn't get to do this. Instead I had to pick the player who was least likely to die and dodge my own team's kills. Because I had absolutely no control over who my team was going to kill and could be on the nasty end of that should they do something unpredictable.<br><br>After only a single kill N1 I figured I was more or less safe to simply hide behind whoever was probably going to get lynched the next day, and once I realized that the mod had actually pointed out that there was a non standard hider in this game without a second mafia team and without a town vig, that I could claim and absolutely <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nothing</span> could stop me. I had to come up with a non-standard hider role to claim, and who the hell would suspect a scum based hider if there's absolutely NOTHING to kill him? The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">only</span> way anyone could possibly guess I was scum is if I was exactly as I am, a traitor hider. Which is quiiiiiite a stretch.<br><br>SO basically I had a role that was lame to play and broke the game. It wasn't really much fun <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">.<br><br>I honestly didn't even feel like I played very well. I pulled a hell of a lot of suspicion early on in the game just because I suck at playing scum. I pretty much relied on the fact that once I \"cleared\" N, that my buddies knew what my real role was. If they realized what I was up to, then town had little to no counter-play."}

Just sucks that we lost because of it.<br><br>I think it would have been more fair and interesting had ice not known his scum partners, so he could have had a chance at dying if he hid behind scum. I think its pretty easy to predict which town scum would not kill, so there really wasn't much point to a scum hider at all. But its a lot harder to determine scummy looking (thus not likely night-killed) town from scum. That gives the role purpose, because ICE would be using the role to kind of identify his scum partners through POE. And maybe his partners give something away trying to breadcrumb themselves to him. Would have made it much more interesting. It would have made it a brilliant role, actually. But it still isn't a purpose the town would ever be likely to divine due to the mod-confirmed setup information.<br><br>Because there was mod info that there was a hider in the game and there was only 1 scum faction, the town really had no reason to spend too much time considering that the hider might be scum. From town's POV, there is no purpose to a scum hider in this game based on the information we're able to figure out. The only way we could have figured out if ICE was lying was if the tracker tracked the same target as the hider, and that is so specific and unlikely that it should really fall under the general \"don't design your game around specific intended role interaction\" guideline of setup design. I think had the mod-confirmed setup information not been given, the town would have been more skeptical of ICE's claim, and he wouldn't have been able to cruise the scumteam to a win based on the claim alone. It's almost a case where providing the mod-confirmed setup info makes the role kind of bastard-ish. It's borderline lying to the players, kinda like scum masons. Actually, its more like putting in a miller or GF without a cop, probably.<br><br>It was still a fun game though aside from the flakers, and I really enjoyed the flavor. I just think, make the hider not know the scum team, and take away the mod-confirmed setup information, and the game would have been infinitely better."}

My read on ICE was headed in the right direction until his claim which by most normal game standards would have been necessarily true.</div></blockquote><br><br>I agree that this is our job. We looked on this game for balance and if it fell within the normal guidelines. Hiding is a mechanic that's allowed, which makes the combination role of traitor hider Bob's one \"new\" thing in this setup. Basically, there's nothing we can do, he's well inside the rules. But Bob wasn't an idiot and to help his players out already gave away pregame that something was up with his hider. So moreover, there's nothing we <span style=\"font-style: italic\">want</span> to do. <br><br>Somewhere in Ice's post pm there's the dangerous bit. The core argument of calling Ice town is because a hider goon would not make sense. This argument has come up before in MD in a different way: setups do not have to make sense. If a mod wants a miller in a game without a cop, he's allowed to. Had bob wanted to make a goon hider, there's literally nothing that would keep him from that. <br><br>Ice made a claim in such a way that people didn't go looking on, town decided to try to outmeta the mod. And yes, that working claim then takes over the game, because scum obviously abuse it to the fullest. In the end, that's the peoples play during day that make that scum win this game, not because some set of roles are too strong or the numbers on something are off. That's what I can take care of as a reviewer. I'm not there to protect town from giving some claimant a free pass he shouldn't get. Bob's admittance that there was a \"non standard\" hider in there was already nice towards you.<br><br>All in all, I do not believe bob should feel bad about this. The setup he came to us with had options for nice play, wasn't power mad and showed some inspiration. After that, how the players decide to use the roles and information you've given is all the game."}

The mod-confirmed role information helped the scum a lot more than it helped the town. It gave scum a confirmable role ability, and the knowledge of a town role.<br><br>Without the info, ICE's claim is not a confirmable role and thus he is not immediately believed, and N doesn't get cleared either. Since a protective role is also confirmed, and the scum know its not them, they know to hunt for one in the town, and they can draw it out or CC it like RC did. Leave that info out, and maybe RC doesn't crumb commuter and the doc would be hidden from scum's knowledge longer. So that info gives scum info about the town PR's they can use to plan and manipulate the town.<br><br>How exactly does the mod-provided role information help the town at all? We're supposed to read it and know that there is something up with the hider? How exactly was town supposed to do that without speculating about the mod-provided setup information (aka \"outmeta-ing the mod)? The presence of the info itself is what invites the setup speculation and mod-guessing and etc into the game. The whole game comes down to whether the town can guess correctly that the mod would use the hider as a scum role, but that is pretty hard to do when the scum have all the information on the setup. No one is ever ever ever lynching a mod-confirmed hider when there is also a mod-confirmed standard protective role and 2 players claiming to be that role. Town could do, what exactly, about it? RC played brilliantly, ICE played brilliantly, but the setup was clearly in scums favor, and the town made plenty of mistakes and got some unfortunate breaks - the titus lynch instead of pkop D1, the bad Xay lynch D2, the unfortunate nk of the tracker N1, and the fact that scum got a huge upgrade in the replacements - its clear that everything was getting stacked against the town this game. The setup is one thing that didn't have to be stacked against the town though, and it could have been easily fixed simply by omitting the mod-confirmed role information, and maybe weakening the traitor-hider role a bit so it was more likely it would die on its own. Just IMO, anyways.<br><br>I'm not mad at bob at all though and I'd happily play in any game he'd mod in the future, just I think you're being pretty disingenuous myko because I think you and anybody else probably makes the exact same mistake had you been in the game. It's just not something the town really had any control over. All the options for nice play, whatever you think they are, were all on the scum side."}
