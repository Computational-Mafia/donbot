Your words sound like you want to be in a \"safe\" spot on a bandwagon, then jump off at the right moment to avoid suspicion. This SCREAMS scum to me. You are already planning on jumping off the bandwagon when it gets high already, is that because you know pisskop's alignment to actually be town?

Kthxbye - His posts indicate actual scum hunting and helping us gather vital information on day 1. High probability of town.<br>\n2. pisskop - Explaining an rvs vote does seem scummy to me.

The few that made any sense seemed scummy (see above.)<br>\n4. Xay - As someone who also keeps up on the thread via her phone when I can throughout the day, I know how it is to come back home and find that a bandwagon blew up from scum and a townie is dead.

I do think there's a chance he could be VI which would mean it might not be the smartest lynch on day 1.

Overall, I think you should have posted the gut feelings you had on others.  How are we supposed to get a read on you and how are you supposed to interact with others if you're not going to post.  Doing anything else is {active}Lurking.  Saying you had 'nothing to go off of' is clearly not the same as 'having gut feelings'.

I simply asked if you'd read the thread because you hadn't been acting like you'd fully read the thread.  You're putting emphasis into the question which I find telling.

Not really indicative of anything though, and i guess kind of seems like a town gambit, but still a little weird as i personally think it was explained a little weirdly.<br>\n<br>\nPage 4-\n<blockquote><div><cite>pissk in 75 wrote:</cite>It all feels like omgus to me, and later when I have real points the RVS may become supporting points...</div></blockquote> <br>\nIf RVS does not give you ANY reads at all when it is happening, how will it help you later?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Aisa in 77 wrote:</cite>  You are assuming that 1. \"tryhardness\" automatically means trying to look town and that trying to look town is not something that town do; both of which I find incorrect.</div></blockquote>\nI think he had a rather decent point.

A total of one post from this slot that had me reading his as town (p115).  First thing that sticks out is him not even looking at those on his wagon for possible scum.  This is the complete opposite of what I see wagoned town (including myself) tend to do.  Next is this weird connection between him and Xay.  d3x and I are close friends irl and play together often on this sight.  If anything, I'm more suspect of him possibly being scum when I'm town than anything.  The complete opposite is found from PK in regards to Xay's alignment culminating in his scum slip in p197 lumping himself in with Xay as \"townies\".  There is absolutely no way (barring Masons which I doubt this game has) that he could know Xay's alignment without being scum and either KNOWING Xay is town or trying to make them both out to be town while they are both scum.  My opinion at the moment is he should be today's lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">ICEninja</div>:  Prob town.  I'm not a fan of being seen as scummy when I feel I'm being as transparent as fuck in my reads and my posts.  The only time I actually care how my shit comes out is when I'm scum.  This is why Titus and d3x are telling you fools I'm town.  Anyway, at this moment, there is little to no suspicion surrounding those on my wagon except coming from myself.  I don't see scum-ICE unvoting when he did.  That reads town re-considering and not tunneling more than scum trying to distance.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">d3x</div>:  Null atm.  I dunno.  I know this guy really well and there is a lot that looks like his town game in this game.  There are some things though that I expect him to do as town that I haven't seen.  It's still early though.  Those talking about his post being fluff while ignoring all the other fluff out there is looking scummy to me though...especially when the mindset is that I'm going to be lynched today.  Looks like setting up for multiple mis-lynches possibly.  PK has done this specifically in p193.  Thomith is guilty of this as well but I get different vibes from that slot (see below).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">ika/Titus</div>:  Null leaning town.  Had this slot as scum while ika was around but Titus has only scored town points so far.  Coming in when he did, scum him could easily have called me scum and jumped on.  I always worry about scum distancing from a mis-lynch but I don't get those vibes from this atm.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Thomith</div>:  Leaning town.  I have seen town and scum both replace in and do a full thoughts list during a re-read.  The issue I have with this slot being scum is that as scum, the smart thing to do would be to read first, figure out where you wanted to end up, and then fake the reread in order to avoid contradictions of yourself.  He comes out the gate giving me a town lean.  As time passes, this changes.  I don't see the scum motivation for doing this.  Shows transparency which is a town trait.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Kcdaspot</div>:  Leaning scum but I don't know....  I thought this slot was derp derp moron troll town but he proved he actually does know how to play this game with p153.  Super hard tunnel on town is usually a town trait but then again, I've seen scum do it too.  I dunno.  Prolly shouldn't be today's lynch and I might have him leaning scum just because I don't like how he plays MS (see all his post prior to p153).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Rhinox</div>:  Null leaning scum.  I dunno.  Comes off friendly...a little too friendly?  I'm not his top scum read, but I'm on the list opening the availability for him to vote me for today's lynch while being able to say (after the flip) that I was low on the priority and shouldn't have been lynched today.  I dunno, could be paranoia, could be positioning.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Aisa</div>:  Super null.  Not enough posts.  What posts are there could be viewed as scumhunting but there is no follow up from her.  Not sure of alignment, but I do know she needs to post a lot more before the day ends.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Xayzeck</div>:  Scum.  All I think I know for sure is that there is scum between PK and Xay if not both.  First he feels compelled to remind us all he's not scum multiple times.  Then there is him being on my wagon with sheeping Kcd's case.  He also doesn't really answer questions.  Look at his ISO 6 and 7.  Total scum backtracking.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Lucresia</div>:  Null.  I want to say leaning town because he's not all gung ho to lynch mean, but really need more activity.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Konowa</div>:  ...........will probably be replaced soon.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlright, now to the case on me from Kcd (Thom's is pretty much a reword of what Kcd has said).  Every time I try and get into it, it pisses me off because everything I've posted has been in a manner to not hide any thoughts I have at the time of the post.  I wrote something up and saved it as a draft.  It was a lot meaner then.  I fixed it up best I could to be less mean, but I know it's still pretty offensive.<br>\n<br>\nFirst point:  he completely ignores \"Thus, with Star-wars type logic, pisskop is scum.\"  Hmm...let's see, I us star-wars type logic and post it as such....how serious am I that I'm certain someone is scum in p27 of the game.  Dumb point.  Second bolded...Asking questions and expecting people to answer them in order to exit RVS is scummy now?  OMFG dumb.<br>\n<br>\nSecond point:  laughable.  I have called him derp-town all game.  I only want him dead because he's an idiot and bad for town.  And town being transparent is scummy now?  Town don't need to explain their thought process?  WTF is this shit?<br>\n<br>\nThird point:  Calling someone to explain their posts is scummy again.  So so so freaking stupid.  There isn't shit about that post that's fluff.  I'm calling you out for not doing anything to drive the game forward.  Town or scum, your posts up till p153 have done nothing but bog down the game, not these fluff walls you claim I post.<br>\n<br>\n\"the rest\":  <br>\n1.  already talked about and the point was copied from ICE I believe.<br>\n2.

That's scum hunting.  Take a look at your ISO.  You say I'm not hunting scum?  YOU HAVE DONE SHIT ALL GAME.  Now all you're doing is tunneling town and half heartily admitting Xay might be scum.<br>\n\"you can't even claim you're town. You are acting far too aggressive and manipulative to people with votes on you.\"<br>\nYeah, town don't ever look at their own wagon for possible scum.

It's kinda like how my last post gives you the creeps for ending up where it did.  If Thom was scum and wanted an easy vote on town, I don't see him stating he got town vibes from me earlier.  If he was scum, I'd see him at least taking anything positive toward my slot so it looked less contradictory when he voted me.<br>\n<br>\nAfter looking through your ISO to see why you thought I was reading the game wrong, I came across your reads.  They happened to be similar to mine so I asked you about it.  I did think about how it might be used against me by some but meh, I wanted to ask the question.  I wasn't a fan of any of those 3 long before you came in so it's more the reads just being similar than me trying to mimic your reads.<br>\n<br>\nAs for PK, I disagree with your analysis of his early wagon.  I'm in a better spot than you to see it due to being the counter wagon to his.  Then again, looking back at the VC's just now, 2 of my 3 scum pile were on his wagon so maybe you aren't off on PK.  I dunno yet.  I'm still having a hard time with how town would say \" to lynch <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">townies</div>\" when we don't have a clue about anyone's alignment but our own.

I was unsure how to read him because I was looking for something I expect from his as town.  That something was p212.

He's also got some other strong town tells that I'll be looking out for, but this is one of his stronger ones.<br>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\nNext up is this supposed contradiction by Thom.  <br>\nYou need some reading comprehension skills I think.

Did you even go back to look at what that point was to see what the context of this supposed contradiction was referencing?  I'm betting a big fat no.  It was in response to him saying \"I actually think you're trying to set up a wagon me with this.\"  I had been calling him derp town all game, NOT fence sitting on what to think of him.<br>\n<br>\nSo, as you can see, there is no actual contradiction there.

He was still my scummiest lead at that point. That said, my concern after reading kthx's post was that if he's VI, then it's a bad lynch.

His bad posting is probably clouding my judgement, and this pushed me towards being unsure. <br>\n<br>\nSince that time, I have less of a scummy read on kcd.

Keeping what I see as a scum slip in mind, this reads to me like scum buddying up to town or scum chatting away with his scum buddy.  Also, this comment directed to Xay come out of nowhere.  What's fine?

Lucky for you, I'm equally paranoid and that's how I'm going to read it at this point.  This is very likely to change if you keep mis-repping my posts in order to try and make me out as scum.  I post plenty of shit that looks scummy to most people anyway.<br>\n-Honestly, if you don't think PK though he was hammering, you need to re-read the events again.<br>\n-My p50 wasn't a suggestion for a hammer, it was a question to get an answer to get a read.  It was page 3 for crying out loud and nobody was anywhere near hammerable at that time.  Please don't mis-rep me again<br>\n-You need to not stand by your vote.  Xay likely isn't scum.  <br>\n<br>\np289<br>\n-yeah...I already said that reason isn't what I'm thinking or going with, but the paranoid part of me demanded it be considered.  Quite snipping segments of posts and trying to make it out like that's where I'm at when I clearly said I believe the other scenario I posted in the post you quoted it from.  More mis-rep.<br>\n_________________________<br>\nPI:  You really need to either look ahead to see what's happening currently before going to a full read of the game OR not vote after reading 3 pages.  p290 is awful.  Also, if you are going to comment on posts from the first 3 pages, put the link of the post you are referencing with your comment.  Unless you really don't give a shit if people completely ignore you.  We have people who are current in the game that ignore walls of the current goings on, you think they are going to go track down all those posts you are referring to??<br>\n_________________________<br>\nXay:  scum day-talk is (or was last I played a few months ago) something that's fairly common on MS now.  An genuineness is actually why I see you as town not scum.  Hell, most of reading people on MS deals with how genuine of fake their posts feel, not just what they say in the post....especially D1.<br>\n<br>\n-Also, I don't understand why you are calling PK town.  I already explained that a hammer yesterday preventing too much beneficial town info to be coming from town.<br>\n________________________<br>\nRhinox:  I didn't say it CAN'T be faked, but please read through Xay's ISO and tell me he's going to be the player that is able to fake that reaction.  I said there was no way it was faked...not because scum can't fake something like that, but because I don't think Xay could fake it.<br>\n<br>\n-p268 is the post that looks fake.  Maybe I have tunnel vision, but until Titus posted, I multiple people thought Xay was hammered.  PK asking Xay for additional info when the POST BEFORE HIS REACTION POST WAS HIS READS LIST is fake as fuck.  PK is trying to look town before a town flip.  No, PK is even scummier for p268, not townier.<br>\n<br>\n-As for when I realized PK's vote wasn't the hammer, it was when Titus voted PK.  This forced me to look back at all the voting done since the last VC.  All my posts at that time were phone posts.  You know when I'm at a computer vs when I'm phone posting.  Computer posts are very much more detailed and longer....like this one or p287.<br>\n_____________________________<br>\nThom:  You are one of a few that realized it wasn't the hammer.  Well, maybe more did realize it, but they weren't active at the time.  First person to realized it that was active was Titus, and I'm willing to bet he was at a computer.  You are right though, there was a fake post during that time and it was p268.<br>\n_____________________________<br>\nd3x:  ditto from the above.  <br>\n-Also, do you think I knew it wasn't a legit-hammer?  You didn't include me yet didn't say anything about it in your p296.<br>\n-As for the rest of the post, I more or less agree.<br>\n-Also, it's time to vote PK<br>\n____________________________<br>\nPK p297:<br>\nFlail scum flail.<br>\n-Your whole 'case' on me is plagiarism from other players and what they've already said.  Thus me saying nothing of original thought.  Also, if your case is \"quite valid\", why were you in such a hurry to 'hammer' Xay?<br>\n-Also, your intent to hammer reasoning is.....weird. You wanted everyone to know that you were going to hammer after your business?  You say it was so they could intervene?  You gave less than an hour for people to do that.  So...either you're lying or you don't realize that this is a forum game and not everyone in the game is on at the same time you are.....  Basically, I'm calling you a liar for this.  More proof you're scum.<br>\n-\"I had to talk myself into hammering him, and it was hard.\" - PK.   Lies.  If it was \"hard\", it would have taken longer than 50 minutes between intent and vote.  Also, if it was hard, that means you would have been unsure.  Being unsure means if you were giving intent so people could intervene as you claim, you would have WANTED people to post in between the intent and hammer...well...as town you would...thus lies.<br>\n-As stated above, 'your' case on me is nothing new or original.  Also, you're scum.  Why would I bother with your scum-case?  Tell you what though.  On the very off chance that you flip town (what...like less than 1%), if I'm still alive come day 2, I will address every single point you regurgitated in 'your' case.<br>\n____________________________<br>\nAisa p302:  Good vote.  Want more from you.  See below.<br>\n____________________________<br>\nICE:  The PK wagon has been anything BUT easy.  Trust me, I've been pushing it awhile.  It seems easier now because he's scum and messed up pretty bad and got caught for it.<br>\n____________________________<br>\n<br>\nAnd that brings me back up to speed.  After posting my thoughts during catch-up, I've notice some similar lines of thinking and that is good.<br>\n<br>\nSome things that need addressed:<br>\n<br>\nKcd:  Where are you?  Why have you disappeared after your push for my lynch lost steam?  What are the things that had you having second thoughts?<br>\n<br>\n-Things to look out for in regards to Kcd.  I find it slightly odd that he was super busy and couldn't post....until it looked like PK hammered.  His p270 is just odd under this scenario.  It appears Kcd also believed Xay hammered and wanted to get some suspicion going for tomorrow with regards to me.  This makes perfect sense for scum-him to do if he know's Xay's about to flip town.<br>\n<br>\nTitus:  I'd like to hear what you have to say about Xay's reaction.  Real or faked?  Does it make him still poss scum or likely town to you?<br>\n<br>\nAisa:  Same thing.  What are your thoughts surrounding the whole hammer that wasn't a hammer incident?<br>\n____________________________________________<br>\n<br>\nSigh....sorry, it turned into a wall.

Secondly, calling someone VI when everyone else/the majority want to lynch them is buddying, and it could be very possible that if kcda is town kthx could be scum looking for towncred.

All of friday, saturday, sunday, and monday is still a lot of time to make sure a lynch happens. <br>\n<br>\nJust because you argue loudly and repeatedly for your case and people aren't entirely convinced doesn't mean that PK is hard to lynch scum. <br>\n<br>\nLynching to \"provide the best information\" is not a good reason to lynch. Any lynch provides good information. Counter wagons provide good information. Quick lynches provide good information. Slow lynches provide good information. No lynches provide.. er.. well... information. Ppl not voting or avoiding the main wagons provide good information. EVERYTHING provides information, there is not 1 way that is best for any situation. Forcing ppl to vote a certain way \"for information\" actually REDUCES the information gained, because now everybody has a pro-town excuse for their action (\"I did it for the infermashunz\").<br>\n<br>\nEven if you're right and PK is scum, and everyone voting PK is town, then thats what likely 6 out of the remaining 8 players are town. You suggest the titus wagon may be a scum driven counterwagon, so lets say both the remaining scum are there. That means {Lucresia, Kcda, xay, d2x, PI, and one of me, ICE, or Thom} are all town you've so far failed to convince, and regardless of how highly you think of yourself, I think its more likely that ~65% of the town is simply not convinced, rather than \"have our heads up our asses\".<br>\n<br>\nNow, take another look at the VC. PK and Titus are tied. When PK realizes that you're not going to be lynched today and its either him or Titus, I'd expect him to vote titus, meaning the counterwagon will then have more support than the main wagon. If you don't think Titus would be a good lynch, then you're going to have to look at the case and tell me why its not a good lynch. Also, Lucresia, Kcda, Xay, d3x, and PI need to stop putzing around and pick one of these 2 wagons to pony up on or come up with a better option in a hurry. Pretty sure Xay or Kthx are not getting lynched today, so voting them or not voting at all at this stage is not helping anyone.", "time": "Fri Mar 14, 2014 4:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}

The counterargument is what the person you accuse says it is, and then you decide if you buy the excuse or not. PK never claimed he had a town read on Xay as the explanation why he didn't slip. You don't get to just imagine a scenario up as THE counterargument and shootout it down as being farfetched when it is irrelevant. There are many many explanations one could imagine, but PK said he was talking about a hypothetical situation where if kthx and d3x were scum, then Xay wouldn't be.

But I don't play scared to make wrong decisions. Until one of those outcomes happen, you can piss off with this whole \"chainsaw of pisskop\" thing. There is no way you should be this confident about piss being scum based on the \"plausible but not airtight\" slip. Either you're bussing him, or you're just trying to survive the day. Even extremely valid looking slips that people have lynched for still end up flipping town. Slips are one of the most unreliable form of scumhunting and this isn't even close to a \"good\" slip.

I honestly don't buy the scumslip, because his explanation does address it pretty damn well. I don't know why you choose to keep it in there, because he could say that as town or as scum(given his explanation). What's left in this case is just a lot of things I'd call dumb, but not exactly scummy. Intent to lynch, and then hammering a few posts later? Dumb move. Saying we shouldn't hammer early, and hammering early? Dumb. Contradicting himself? Dumb. Blatantly jumping on another leading wagon while under pressure? Dumb.<br>\n<br>\nPiss has been playing mafia longer than I have, and has been in more games than me. I'd expect his scumgame to be a lot better than this. A lot of these things are dumb moves I don't expect him to be making. What scum says that we need more info before a lynch, goes to the leading wagon, intends to hammer, and hammers without being sure I actually get hammered? Even if I DID get hammered, he'd get lynched the next day for hammering just after he claims intent, and ending the game so damn early. I doubt he could talk his way out of his lynch D2 for being so stupid.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, he could just have a horrible scumgame and is making mistakes all over the place, but I don't expect him to be this bad. And what scum would pull a case out on a scumteam D1?<br>\n<br>\nI came in and make 1 short post and get questioned.

I am townreading both Titus and piss, yes, but piss's play has been really all over the place.

She wasn't just shifting a vote, she was ready to hammer if PK had been at L-1<br>\n<br>\n2) As a townie outside of an absolute deadline situation, could you ever imagine hammering someone if the best reason you had was, by your own admission, \"plausible, but not airtight\"?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">In the arguing back and forth since then...</div><br>\nTitus becomes \"locked in\" to the belief that the slip is absolutely 100% valid and she can't possibly imagine there being a valid reason for it not being a slip.<br>\n<br>\nDoes this make any sense to you to come from town? kthx, you're the one who caught the \"slip\" and even you have admitted that there is a potentially valid explanation for it not being a slip and you're willing to concede it because you still find PK scummy enough to lynch even if it wasn't a valid slip.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile Titus is locked into the slip and hasn't even mentioned any other supporting reasoning for PK being scum. Her entire reasoning is \"slip = scum\". Anything before <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5732399#p5732399\">208</a> she already said she didn't see PK is scum, and in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5739320#p5739320\">308</a> she refuted other points you have brought up as reasons to lynch PK. Her entire reason is the slip. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">The above is the core case...</div><br>\nBut just as telling is the way Titus has reacted since I voted her. She's been lashing out with baseless rhetoric in order to discredit me any way she can. I've been avoiding going point by point because there are just so many. I'm not going to convince her she's scum, and everyone else likely tunes out at this point. But I'll go through them now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"That case sucks because it leaves out a lot. Those posts aren't back to back for me.\"</div><br>\nImmediately she says the case sucks because semantics. The point was that when she finished up posting in the AM on Sun Mar 09, her mindset was \"I don't like Pisskop as scum.\" and the next time she started posting in the PM on Mon Mar 10 her mindset was \"Checking votes but planning to vote Pisskop unless I'd be hammer. Then intent to hammer.\", and she said nothing in between to justify the change in mindset. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"That's the poorest twisting I have seen in quite awhile Rhinox.\"</div><br>\nThis is her first post after I vote her. Immediately, she assumes malintent. She never had a bad word to say about me before this point. She never mentioned me at all, actually. But I vote her and instantly she argues as if that makes me confirmed scum. Its natural when you're town to be a little suspicious if someone votes you and presents a case. If you're town, you know any case on you is wrong. Bad players (town or scum) let emotions get in the way and are unable to consider that a player voting them can be wrong but still town. The hyperbole in the response is what makes it scummy. \"thats the poorest twisting I have seen\" is hyperbole. <br>\n<br>\nIf that was the only such statement it wouldn't be a big deal but she continues...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"Desperate for a mislynch? Or just totally ignore facts\"</div><br>\nThis is pure baseless rhetoric. It serves no points but to score debate points and throw mud on my case any way she can. Again, the suggestion here is that I must either be scum or incompetent to vote her. And not only that, but the \"desperate for a mislynch?\" line suggests that not only am I scum, but I am scum WITH PK. She's arguing as if PK is already confirmed scum and that because I'm considering other options than PK and specifically voting her that I must also be scum. Why is she so sure PK is scum? And even if so, is it even such a sure thing that scum go so far out of their way to avoid getting a partner lynched? Sure, its something to consider, but Titus isn't merely considering it, to her its already a fact thats what I'm doing. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"(which there's evidence of considering you called me a he)?\"</div><br>\nThis is really just ridiculous mudslinging. What does me using the wrong pronoun to refer to titus have to do with anything? She's trying to make a leap in logic that because I called her a \"he\", that means I'm incompetent and incapable of recognizing facts. Which is entirely bullshit. This is not something town says.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"I also find it funny that you appear to chainsaw, with a total lack of voting, until Pisskop is damn near L-1 if not at it.\"</div><br>\nThis is a continuation of the \"Rhinox must be PK's scum partner\" idea, but for someone who just accused me of \"totally ignoring facts\", where did the total lack of voting come from and when was PK ever at L-1? I was voting Xay 24hrs before I voted Titus, and PK only ever had 3 or 4 votes, so L-3 at worst? Really, town or scum have no reason to blatently misrepresent a situation like this, but because Titus is trying so hard to smear me with rhetoric that makes it more likely she's doing it as scum. All this is rhetoric and smearing and trying to score points. She's not actively trying to lynch me so idk if she's just trying to scare me off or survive the day and get PK mislynched or if she is bussing PK and setting me up to take the fall tomorrow when PK flips scum. I do know that this is not how town reacts to getting voted.<br>\n<br>\nThere's more do I have to keep going?

There is no business even bringing up the possibility of a SK in a 12p mini normal unless there is some kind of evidence like unaccounted for extra kills. You know who brings up SK's like this? scum. either because towns that are SK hunting aren't looking for mafia/scum in general, or because you just slipped that your scum team is smaller than whats expected for a mini normal and you suspect there must be an SK out there for a balanced game. Town don't even think about SK hunting on day 1 in a mini normal.

My god.\"</div> - I suppose it was only a matter of time before we got to emotional appeals as well. now we're back to PK being \"obvscum\" and I'm obvscum as well trying to save him. <br>\n<br>\nIn all this time, you've never established why if I'm scum I'd be concerned at all with \"saving PK\". Seems kinda like a foolish move that would only end up getting 2 scum lynched once people realize I was just desperate for a mislynch, instead of just 1. Why wouldn't I just bus the obvscum and try to get some towncred for it? Why would I do anything that would cause me to stick out at all? If PK is town I could just fall in line on the PK lynch and let kthx take all the blame. Of course its all wifom because scum can act a number of ways around a lynch. Its the townies job to analyze which situation is most likely after it's happened. PK hasn't even flipped yet and already you've decided I'm scum because I'm not just letting PK get lynched by default, based on nothing other than I had the audacity to vote you. You've made the conclusion without waiting for the evidence to do the analysis. <br>\n<br>\nThe problem is you've overplayed your hand. \"Chainsaw\" doesn't even become remotely valid until a flip happens. You're way too confident in PK being scum. You either know PK is scum and you're bussing while trying to set me up to be lynched tomorrow, or you're caught and you're just trying to live another day, make sure 1 mislynch goes through before you're hanged. <br>\n<br>\nAs far as I'm concerned, its a win-win at this point. 3 outcomes to the day.<br>\n<br>\n1) Titus is lynched, almost certainly flips scum. I've seen this pretend-logic keep insisting you're right and dismissing or ignoring any and all evidence to the contrary kind of posting a couple times before, and every time I've seen it, its ended up coming from scum.<br>\n<br>\n2) PK is lynched and flips town. Titus is lynched D2 in record time. Distraction and likely-scum are eliminated from the game.<br>\n<br>\n3) I'm wrong and PK is lynched and flips scum. I eat crow and don't care because hooray scum lynch. If I have to take the fall day 2 as a result, so be it - I'll gladly trade townies for scum 1 for 1, pretty sure we've got the numbers to win that game.

Yet, she's not voting for xay right now. She's voting for pisskop which is mainly based off of her town read on kthx and her believing the scum slip. (which I do not agree is a \"slip\" of any sort.) So she thinks xay is scum but then she is hesitant to follow through, and then agrees with an argument I consider to be very poor from kthx. This makes me feel like she's trying to go along with what kthx is doing as if trying to back up her scum buddy. I don't however see where she's defending xay, unless you just mean the uncertainty in post 308.<br>\n<br>\n@ Rhino in post 338: I do agree at this point that if no one is willing to really lynch xay, then I need to look for more scum today. I do not want to waste a vote. I do not like a no lynch / deadline scenario. It hurts the town to not take advantage of our chance to get scum.

A weak argument against pisskop from kthx is enough for a vote, yet she hasn't even voted xay at any point today (even though she's made several points to note his scumminess.) To me this looks like someone avoiding a wagon with a buddy on it, but making her opinions that she thinks he is scum known for when he flips scum (town cred.)

If xay turns up scum then I can see pisskop looking more town with kthx looking like scum. Whether Titus turns scum or town, I really am still going to find kthx scummy.

Rubicon was technically voting Kthx but that was KCDA's vote and I pretty much lump Rubi into the titus wagon players since it appeared he would have hammered had kthx not. PI was not voting anybody and has not really participated at all. kthx wanted to lynch piss and only reluctantly switched to titus for deadline so I'd rather lump him in with the kthx voters.<br>\n<br>\npiss is probably gonna get a bunch of early votes and I'm not really inclined to speak against it since my reads to a bit of a hit with Titus flipping town. So piss if you're town you should probably say why you're town and stuff and have a pretty compelling reason to lynch someone else.<br>\n<br>\nFor traditional VCA, here are some groupings of living players:<br>\n<br>\nTitus wagon: {Rhinox, ICE, Thom, pisskop, xay, Lucresia, kthx}<br>\npiss wagon: {Aisa}<br>\nvoting elsewhere/not voting: {Rubicon, PrivateI}<br>\n<br>\nModified groupings:<br>\nTitus wagon: {Rhinox, ICE, Thom, pisskop, xay, Lucresia, <div style=\"display:inline;color:gray\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">kthx</div></div></div>, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rubicon</div>}<br>\npiss wagon: {Aisa, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kthx</div>}<br>\nvoting elsewhere/not voting: {<div style=\"display:inline;color:gray\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Rubicon</div></div></div>, PrivateI}<br>\n<br>\nWhether Titus is scum or town (but especially if town), I'd say there are better than random odds that 1 of Aisa or PI are scum based on traditional VCA alone. I could see Rubicon-scum if piss is scum, but null or slightly town if piss is town. I could see kthx-scum if piss is town, and town if piss is scum. But I am most confident in finding scum in a group of {ICE, Thom, piss, xay, Lucresia}. I'd say there is certainly 1 scum in that group, 50/50 there are 2 scum there, and not insignificant odds that 3 scum may be found there.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ps mod may want to consider changing thread title to day</div>", "time": "Thu Mar 20, 2014 4:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}

This isn't just looking elsewhere, this is completely opposite of your belief.<br>\n<br>\nYou think pkop is scum and you think evidence of that is you never got a lot of support for his wagon. The implication is that if pisskop was town, then scum would have flocked to the wagon for the mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nSo you look elsewhere... by voting the only living player who was on the piss wagon? That just doesn't make any sense to me. If you really thought the fact that pkop's wagon didn't take off because he's scum and his partners were reluctant to bus, then I'd expect you as town to consider Aisa to be more likely town. At the very least, I'd expect you to have more of a reason to vote than just sheeping Rubicon, who is the replacement for Kcda, who you spent all D1 thinking was a VI, then scum.<br>\n<br>\nThis is why I can never fully trust you and buy in completely that you are town kthx.", "time": "Fri Mar 21, 2014 7:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}

We were all a little bit annoyed by it. But these posts stuck out to me moreso than comments others were making because... well when a town is apathetic it is is scum's best interest to keep the town apathetic, because apathetic towns are easy to manipulate or at least hide in simply by not being useless. It has been proposed in some of the MD \"how to play scum\" guides I have seen that encouraging apathy can be a useful (albeit boring) scum strategy. And these posts seem to be encouraging apathy. 501 - I really don't believe ICE didn't care about the game anymore. He was active and generally posting useful content and then this \"I don't give a shit anymore...\" comment just really came out of no where. Same with 522. If players see other players not giving a shit then they're less likely to give a shit themselves. These kinds of posts just seem to be intended to fuel the apathy, and not combat it, so I am suspicious of ICE for them.<br>\n<br>\nI can't remember if I had other things I wanted to say about Rubi's wall of posts back on page 22 or not at this point. I kinda agree with kthx in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5778153#p5778153\">538</a> that a lot of it seemed fake but I don't have too much of a problem with it because the game was stalled and if you have to force a bit to get something going then of course it is not going to read naturally. I kinda thought maybe Rubi could be scum just trying seem like a dutiful townie trying to spark the game. Yeah yeah I know I just said maybe ICE could be scum for sowing apathy so how can \"trying to spark the game\" also be scummy? Well neither are definite scum tells, its more in looking at the motivation behind the action. I've felt good about ICE prior and I felt good about KCDA so I don't know if either is scum really or if I was just grasping for something at a time when the game was stalled.<br>\n<br>\nI think Rubi was probably town-motivated trying to spark something because he did get both kthx and Xay to engage him in conversation, and he kept the conversation going, not just post a bunch of stuff and attack attack attack lynch lynch lynch etc. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5780356#p5780356\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5780356#p5780356\" data-post-id=\"5780356\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 550</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite>Unless I'm wrong about BOTH Rhinox and Kthx, I doubt there is any scum skillful enough to be pushing multiple wagons on town like that.

What does scum skill have to do with what the wagons were? Town can be pushing wagons on town, its not just scum that lead the mislynches. If you assume 3 scum in the game and everyone in the game is bad at it, then the odds all 3 were town comes down to random chance. When you work the numbers, if you take a random sample of 3 players there is a 62% chance 1 or more is scum and a 38% chance that all 3 are town. And thats just a random sample it would be the same if you selected any other 3 players randomly. Even if scum players are bad, given that these were wagons and scum are an informed minority, it may even be logical to assume that the D1 wagons are less likely to be scum given that even bad scum are probably more likely to support wagons on town than their scum partners. If that is true, it may even be wise to lynch from <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">outside</div> the group of D1 wagons today. Anyways, just going back to random numbers, sticking with the same group of 3 wagons from D1, the fact that Titus and d3x flipped town means the odds of at least 1 of the remaining 2 wagons being scum drop to 53%, with a 47% chance they are both town. And if piss or xay is lynched today and flips town (a la your hypothetical scenario in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5783900#p5783900\">552</a>) and there is another town nk, then the odds that the remaining day 1 wagon being scum falls to 37% or 3/8 - same odds of anybody being scum if selected randomly. Just because on D1 a group of 3 players has a 62% chance of containing at least 1 scum doesn't mean that the remaining living player from that group has a 62% chance of being scum 2 days later if the other 2 players in that group flipped town. That is the definition of the gambler's fallacy.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not trying to say that you're basing anything on mathematical odds, just that your premise and logic is wrong. Bad players mean choices are no better or worse than random IMO, and the odds of a player in an essentially random group don't increase for the remaining members of the group after 1 or more of them flip town. I don't know if you're just using bad logic incorrectly but from a town motivation, or if you're trying to entice the town to mislynch both Xay and pk over the next 2 days because you \"can't imagine all 3 D1 wagons were on town\" from a scum motivation.

Town and scum are of different alignments, with different win conditions, and play differently. If there wasn't multiple scum trying to throw town off, then I can pretty much guarantee you that D1 lynches are going to occur on scum more often than 1 out of N-1. The D1 lynch tends to fall on town partially, yes, because there are more town than scum, but the pick is NOT random, and it is HEAVILY influenced by scum.<br>\n<br>\nEspecially consider how the wagons started yesterday, and who the main players pushing them were. It was the competent players. And they are the players who I feel are more likely to be town than scum. People can call me scum for being this confident about this all day and it doesn't change the fact that I'm still probably right. If both piss AND Xay are town then I will probably reconsider how I find scum, but I don't think I'll need to.

That did not feel genuine, especially if you said you've never done it. You didn't have to vote for pisskop either if you did not feel comfortable putting him at L-2. <br>\n<br>\nI think a town mindset (if I agreed with your position) would've been to say, \"I think pisskop is scum, but I don't think we should put him at L-2 this early.

Of course, not all players realize this or are able to do this, but my point is that I think he's handling himself pretty dang well for a newer player.

I really want to like it despite not liking a lot of the little passive aggressive (and some not-so-passive aggressive) tendencies you're showing.

This is a blatant misrep.</div></blockquote>\n\nIt's like you want to have your cake and eat it too. Yeah, we get that you don't like Kcda. You still have to take a stand on this. First you called him VI town, then you said that you were only going to vote him today, then you unvoted him and say he's only leaning scum, then you get on Thom's case for characterizing you as having him at \"leaning scum\" because he didn't take into consideration all of your variables.

Yes, I realize you back off this statement in your next post, but the fact that you'd post it to begin with is troublesome.

Again, Rhinox has clear, concise and common sense responses to Kthx's attempts at derailing the Xay wagon. I haven't talked a lot about Xay myself in my notes, but it's because so much of his stuff is throwaway. I mean, how are you supposed to break down stuff like \"gut read that x is town/scum, but too lazy to go back and look for why\". It's just bad posting. I can't \"break it down\" more than that other than to say that I don't buy it. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Luc 263 wrote:</cite>I don't know that xay is scum or not.

He didn't do it alone either. You, Luc and Xay all implied that it was a hammer. So don't pretend like it was so obviously not a hammer that it confirms pisskop as scum.

I don't think it confirms either of them as scum/town. It looked pretty darn normal. I can see arguments for giving either player scum or town points. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE 301 wrote:</cite>The fact that Private didn't catch up, went \"oops I have HW can't catch up now\", but still voted for the main wagon makes me worried that he did indeed glance over current events and wanted to put town close to lynch and hope he gets hammered before he really has to commit to anything, and can claim complete innocence in the lynch for day 2.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is a good point.

Bear in mind, I don't necessarily think that the entire scumteam has to fall into one category. At this point we're trying to find the first scum. After we lynch the first scum, that's when we can successfully start looking for those associative tells that are otherwise elusive without something to bank on. I know which scenario I think it the most likely, but I am willing to argue and listen, be skeptical and be affirmative, change my mind and consider alternatives... <br>\n<br>\nHas the scumteam been under our noses the whole time, making mistakes, only avoiding suspicion because we've convinced ourselves that there's \"no way\" it's this easy? If so, we should vote <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Xay</div>. Xay and pisskop have forever and a day been strangely intertwined in this game. You look to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5721689#p5721689\">38</a>, you see Xay coming out early against pisskop's wagon. Immediately I'm thinking buddying; immediately I'm thinking there's some ulterior motive for this post. Especially when he up and admits he'll be \"buddying quite a bit\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5722232#p5722232\">45</a>. One post I can't link to you is something that Xay has done all game long. Sure, I can show you <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5730524#p5730524\">160</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5732675#p5732675\">217</a> or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5732832#p5732832\">225</a>, but it doesn't truly sum up what every player that has been in this game since D1 knows about Xay. He's been inactive, half-baked, and not giving it his all. You can say he's posting from his phone, you can say there are worse players than Xay doing this, etc, but those are just excuses. His activity has just not been up to snuff. Another really ugly, really objectively scummy post is his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758154#p5758154\">466</a>. He sheeps Kthx despite the fact that he's been open to the idea that Kthx is scum and even voted him for a time. As others, notably ICE, have said, Xay was a leading wagon yesterday that was spared at the last minute due to what some saw as pisskop attempting to orchestrate a quicklynch. I do not think pisskop is capable of concocting a scheme like that, and, further, I think pisskop's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5736119#p5736119\">268</a> speaks to the fact that this was a genuine attempt at lynching a player that looked scummy. In any case, ICE makes a good point about Xay potentially being \"the one that got away\" yesterday. Lastly, Xay has already claimed. This should speak to your sense of pragmatism when evaluating the best lynch for today. I do not think anything about Xay's unprovoked claim is necessarily townie, nor do I think Xay's reaction to him thinking that he was lynched was necessarily townie. I'm not using these as points against him either, however.<br>\n<br>\nHas the scumteam been sitting back, allowing the town to fight amongst themselves, and providing the bare minimum amount of content to keep from catching too much flak? If so, we should vote <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Aisa</div> pacman</div>. Xay is arguably guilty of this too, as is PrivateI's slot, but pacman is clearly the worst culprit in this department. We start it off early with a poor, poor excuse for a reaction test in her self vote of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5721447#p5721447\">35</a>. She does it at an extremely awkward time that only serves to detract from the bigger things going on (notably, pisskop catching a lot of heat). What makes this post even worse is that she claims that she agrees with Kcda insomuch as pisskop is guaranteed scum, yet she still votes herself without explaining this discord. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5723998#p5723998\">77</a>, she does attempt to explain that she didn't want to see pisskop at L-2 so early, but this after the fact explaining is a day late and a dollar short. To me, town wouldn't be afraid to explain this in the same post, especially when they're calling a person out a scum. As I say in my notes, I'm all about being above board as town. When someone deliberately starts to stray from that, I get suspicious. A ton on inactivity from her until we finally get something in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5738068#p5738068\">302</a>, she half-heartedly defends Kthx because of meta (huh?) and says PrivateI's posts look like filler (Which everyone effectively already said in much harsher terms, oh, and by the way, PrivateI had only made one post at that point). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740754#p5740754\">320</a> isn't believable for me. It sounds robotic, rehashed, overdone. Her question for Titus led nowhere and she didn't care to follow up on it. Finally, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5747003#p5747003\">376</a>, her second to last post, we're left with her undercutting herself in the very same post. Granted, Titus was town, so you can't be too harsh on Aisa here, but if we're going to take the approach that the scumteam has been sitting back and letting the game happen around them, pacman is the best candidate for our lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nHas the scumteam been actively trying to dominate this game, making great strides to push the town in a specific direction at great potential risk to themselves? If so, we should vote <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ICE</div>. Until the last ~5 pages, I was prepared to have Kthx as my answer for this scenario. I still very much think Kthx is a candidate for scum, but I've found a player that has managed to overtake him. My notes show a lot of coverage of Kthx during D1. Remember that Kthx spent a great deal of time arguing with pisskop. Some of his reasons were good (pisskop trying to overexplain himself during RVS), some not so good (the so-called scumslip). With ICE, I didn't find all that many problems with his play early on. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5729505#p5729505\">130</a>, I found it odd that ICE didn't take the time to call out ika over ika's sheeping of him. It was just weird, it looked like ICE was playing dumb a bit here. I didn't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5734713#p5734713\">239</a>, which is rolefishing. You can say that Kthx was the one to bring this up already in the form of \"scumslipping\", but ICE was the one to try and connect it to a town PR. There's no town motivation to put that out there, regardless if Kthx brought up the quote already or not. ICE really starts to take a turn for me around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5748454#p5748454\">390</a> though. This isn't so bad by itself, but it gets worse later. Here he's calling out Rhinox for flipping scum for pisskop flipping scum for Titus flipping town before Titus has even flipped. I'm not even kidding. Further, it implies that he knows Titus will flip town. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758452#p5758452\">474</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5769911#p5769911\">513</a> contradict one another. ICE changes his principles/scumreads to accomdate others and push his agenda. Read these two quotes back to back:\n<ul><li><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 474 wrote:</cite>Day 1 NKs are not particularly good to speculate on because there is typically so many different reasons as to why someone can be NKed. ESPECIALLY if someone flps PR.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>ICE 513 wrote:</cite>OH also something I forgot to include about the D1 kill, if a majority of the scum team was on the day 1 mislynch, scum tend to prefer to shoot someone who wasn't on the wagon, as the day 2 lynch tends to fall more often than not on someone who was on the mislynch wagon day 1. Shooting someone on the wagon makes it easier for town to nail scum day 2.</div></blockquote></li></ul>\nNKs aren't good to speculate on, but here's some speculation about the NK, in other words. You may ask yourself why ICE would be so contradictory? Because his 474 was in response to Xay voting Aisa in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758296#p5758296\">473</a>, while his 513 was in response to ICE bolstering his pisskop scumread. I think his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5779865#p5779865\">548</a> is misleading about Xay and pisskop's relationship, but Xay should speak to that one more than I should. ICE's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5793139#p5793139\">589</a> is unsightly panic at the thought of Kthx actually taking the time to step back and think about this game rather than just kneejerk vote pisskop like ICE wants him to. ICE subtlely tries to intimidate Kthx into going back on the pisskop wagon by threatening to scumread him.

I can understand why you'd be confused about this as I wrote quite a bit. I'm trying to do something a little different this game. Since we do not have a scumflip yet, I'm trying to free my mind of harboring any bias whatsoever (A is scum, so that means B is likely his partner). I think that leads to confirmation bias.

Hard to explain, sort of, but Kcdaspot gets really excitable as town, and his tone here reminded me of an old game where I'd read him as scum for pretty much the same reasons Kthxbye did in this game, and Kcdaspot had been town there. Good times. Anyway, Rubicon has done nothing to change this read and seems to bleed town himself, so this slot's good.<br>\n<br>\n2) Kthxbye is town. I'm pretty sure of this. Apart from his behavior, which is seriously town because no scumbag plays with that level of conviction and passion for pretty much everything, I doubt he would have killed d3x last Night. d3x was reading Kthxbye as town, and there was a significant portion of the rest of you who were not; Kthxbye-scum would have kept d3x alive for at least another Night.<br>\n<br>\n3) Town read of Rhinox still holds, I think. To be honest, I'm a little paranoid because I think Rhinox-scum would go right over my head, but I like that he's been proactive and more or less transparent this game, even if we don't agree on things all the time.<br>\n<br>\nThe problems:<br>\n<br>\n3) pisskop's stunt with the hammer was the very definition of scummy. His pursuit of ICEninja while there was a competing wagon being made on Titus, on the other hand, is the opposite. Grrargh. Thus, tonight, I'm going to go read a couple of games of pisskop's to observe him in various habitats and maybe that will provide some insight into what kind of habitat this game was for pisskop.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I really like that RedCoyote went through the game and posted thoughts on each bit. I'll read it in better detail later, particularly because my eyes started glazing over when ICEninja and RedCoyote went at each other. Maybe tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\n4) I've already talked about the difference in Xayzeck's play between this game and Micro 302 and how his answer doesn't make much sense. I had some niggling gut town feelings from reading Xayzeck's more defeatist \"welp, I'm getting lynched\"-type posts, but those were blown to smithereens with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758154#p5758154\">post 466</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5761804#p5761804\">post 481</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5768501#p5768501\">post 507</a>. In the first two linked posts, Xayzeck votes pisskop to appease Kthxbye and then later admits to pisskop that the vote had been to appease Kthxbye. Hell no. Town does not vote a town read to appease someone else. As if that wasn't enough, Xayzeck then votes pisskop again when the wagon on that one swells in the middle of Day 2. Keep in mind that Xayzeck had been very loud about his town read of pisskop for the latter half of Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'll hold the vitriol until I've read a scum game of Xayzeck's.<br>\n<br>\n5) I said something earlier about having a problem with most of my scum reads being in a certain pool and my town reads being in another pool. Fortunately, it's less of a problem now! ...because I don't see pisskop and Xayzeck being scum together, and I'm fairly certain we have at least one good player on the scum team. The reason for this is WIFOM, but let's roll with it: d3x was very obviously town but so were other players who were not under pressure as of the end of Day 1 (e.g., Rhinox). If the scum pool were contained within {Aisa, pisskop, PrivateI, Xayzeck}, they would not have needed to target d3x necessarily; Rhinox was more active and had more sway than d3x. I believe that, had the entire scum team been contained in that group, that group would have targeted Rhinox, even if Rhinox was protecting pisskop at the time. pisskop was under fire from pretty much everyone except Rhinox, Rubicon, and Xayzeck, at any rate.<br>\n<br>\nInstead, it's d3x. Crumbs, reads, whatever the reason he died, I'm pretty sure there's at least one player outside of the aforementioned group who is scum. As to who it is, no clue yet! Ihihi.<br>\n<br>\nThe rest:<br>\n<br>\n6) PrivateI is a huge, gaping black hole.<br>\n<br>\n7) Lucresia is also a huge, gaping black hole but for an entirely different reason. There's probably a culture clash going on because all ~2005 players sound the same to me (except Cogito Ergo Sum), and here's Lucresia, who sounds very 2005. Since Lucresia isn't here, I'll probably get something from N, which may happen sooner or later. N's method of replacing in gives me some good feelings at the moment.<br>\n<br>\n8) Admittedly, I don't have much of a read on Aisa. Her theory that pisskop didn't want to miss out on a lynch of Xayzeck and thus jumped on it gave me a gut town feeling, but that dissipated by the time she went \"Titus might be town and now I'm hesitant,\" which, given hindsight, didn't sound very good. I can see the merit in Rubicon's (I think it was Rubicon's, though it might be RedCoyote's) case that Aisa was waffly and hesitant in everything, which is exactly what scum would be doing in a slow game. So, uh, I guess that means I need to reread her and evilpacman18.<br>\n<br>\n9) I said earlier that I was bothered by ICEninja forgetting Xayzeck had claimed. The reason for this is typically scum will have claims in mind, especially if they're hunting for power roles (and they are in this game, I guarantee it; see #5). I read ICEninja as town because he forgot Xayzeck claimed. When he announced, just as enthusiastically as the last time, that he'd forgotten, well, there goes the read? Going off what I know of ICEninja in previous games, if he's scum, he's probably not scum with any of the inactives. I'll need to reread ICEninja's posts in light of all the stuff that's been brought up against him, but that will most likely happen after I go through pisskop and Xayzeck.<br>\n<br>\nThe setup:<br>\n<br>\n10) It's not yet time! Ask me again later. :D<br>\n<br>\nI thought I'd be done when I was all caught up, but nooo.

Rhinox I have a town read on, and the only reason I didn't toss him out, too, is paranoia and lack of knowledge as to what Rhinox-scum looks like.

{"number": 764, "id": "5814447", "user": "Rhinox", "user_id": "9533", "content": "As of right now I believe both claims and think they're town. I believe EPM because I think the best explanation for the lack of a kill is a protection on equinox. No offense to ICE I just don't think he would have been the nk last night. I also kinda believe that there was no protect submission from Aisa N1 &gt;.&gt;, whereas I think scum would have just claimed anyone as a N1 target if it was a fake claim. As for ICE I think he seems pretty genuine and I don't think he would have had a reason to come out and claim today as scum. I also see that back at the beginning of D2 he was consistent was calling Thomith town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5788141#p5788141\">561</a>. I don't see the crumb for the N target, but I don't think it matters. I think claiming with 2 innocent results after 2 mislynches is a pretty good time to claim as town. So if everyone is telling the truth, then:<br>\n<br>\nICE<br>\nEPM<br>\nEquinox<br>\nN<br>\n<br>\nare all town. Me also being town, that means likely 3 scum are in the remaining group of 4:<br>\n<br>\nRedCoyote (pkop)<br>\nRubicon (kcda)<br>\nKthx<br>\nhavingfitz (Konowa/privateI)<br>\n<br>\nNot quite easy mode, but pretty close. One thing going back to D1 is I really don't think KCDA and Kthx can both be scum, so I'd probably prefer lynching red and/or fitz first.<br>\n<br>\nI'm just thinking about could there be any shenanigans. I don't see a reason why both claimed roles wouldn't/couldn't be town. Hider is best used as kind of a weak investigative role, and ivestigative+protective is pretty standard town power. Hider role could have easily resulted in a \"2 deaths in one night\" scenario with no claimed innocents, so its kind of swingy but I don't think the fact that the town can be in a good position like this after 2 mislynches rules out both roles being town. It could have easily swung the other way, and I bet at least 50% of games begin with 2 mislynches anyways so we really shouldn't be in dire straights yet. Doc role can't protect the hider and let the hider get any investigative results, so its a balanced combo, not OP IMO. Scum likely has some role... could be as simple as a RB but maybe not - I just finished up a game where scum had a 2-shot strongman and a rolecop vs. a normal cop and JK so there could be alternatives to the RB. I think current site meta is biased against RB usage because it is too strong for scum but that doesn't rule it out. I guess there could be a chance ICE would have been RBed last night and have an invalid result on N, but I'm not concerned about that right now. Only if one of RC or fitz flips town. I don't know if we can assume any valid results going forward though. Scum with a RB could RB ICE tonight and kill EPM for example. I think that also rules out any strategy to get another result for tomorrow.", "time": "Fri Apr 11, 2014 4:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}

See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5759257#p5759257\">476</a>. Kthx called it a reaction test that I passed but it very well could be evidence that kthx was looking to no longer bus pkop starting in D2. I mean, if town was so intent on not lynching scum!pkop, then scum!kthx would eventually probably stop bussing so hard right?<br>\n<br>\nI actually think this post might point to Rubi being town. If he's scum, he knows I'm town, and therefor would be painting himself into a corner if he got me lynched, and then I flip town and he has no one left to push as the 3rd scum.<br>\n<br>\nI think best thing is still probably to lynch RC and/or fitz - assuming they both flip scum, then town has 2 chances to lynch the final scum out of Me/Rubi/kthx which I'd be fine with. If one of RC or fitz flips town then something screwy is going on with the roles. <br>\n<br>\nIf scum don't have a RB, then its possible we could get another result from ICE's role. ICE should probably hide behind one of Me/Rubi/kthx I just don't know if its better to announce before lynch or not. If we knew there was for sure no RB, then ICE's target could be announced and say he picks kthx, then EPM can protect kthx to avoid 2 deaths, and ICE wouldn't be targetable. So if ICE dies, kthx is scum, and if ICE lives, kthx is town. Problem is if scum have a RB they can really screw with the results - for example if target is really scum, block ICE + kill EPM to \"confirm\" the target is town. Or if the target is really town, then block+kill ICE could frame the target as scum. If ICE doesn't announce, it kinda forces scums hand to block ICE + kill EPM to prevent any worthwhile results. I guess best case scenario is we lynch a scum RB today or other scum role powerful enough to make a scum RB unlikely.<br>\n<br>\nPlan could be something like:<br>\n<br>\n1) if scum RB is lynched, hider target will be announced as XXX, doc also protects XXX (announced before hammer)<br>\n2) otherwise, target will not be announced.", "time": "Fri Apr 11, 2014 9:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}

I did not use the last shot last night because, one, in case there was a chance my role could be confirmed somehow by the town, and two, I didn't think I would get shot last night. <br>\n<br>\nSo, with that all said, I'm at a weird position. Does my role count as a protective role? I can protect myself with it. The <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=commuter\">commuter</a> wiki page lists it as a protective role as well. The Mod's link to the classification of \"protective\" roles (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5720492#p5720492\">1</a>) has commuter on that list. Does my role count as a \"non-standard Hider-like\" role? The commuter is not part of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=normal\">normal</a> list of roles that are explicitly defined as normal, but then again, it's not on the list of roles which are explicitly \"non-normal\" either. What's more, the hider role <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> on the list of explicitly normal roles, and the compulsive modifier (as well as X-shot) are both listed as explicitly normal as well. <br>\n<br>\nSo where does that leave us? Does my role specifically preclude one of the other two from existing in this game? Could all three PRs conceivably be in the same game? Is it possible that either pacman or ICE has a scum-aligned version of their roles? <br>\n<br>\nAgain, I didn't really want to claim this until I could pressure pacman a bit more because, frankly, I have not liked his play at all in this game. I do not think his protection makes sense based on the things he's said. I do not like his claiming so early today because it smacks of premeditated strategy. I did not like Aisa's play at all prior to pacman's replacing in. I saw nothing that would otherwise point me to thinking that that role slot had a PR. I've yet to see pacman show us any sort of breadcrumbs. <br>\n<br>\nNow, with that part said as well, pacman has two major things going for him: 1) Doctor is as \"standard protector-y\" role as you can get. The flip side of this argument is that, as Rubicon said, although the Mod clearly states that there is a protective role in this game, it does not specify that the role is necessarily town-aligned. Further, I would've never considered a commuter as a standard protector role until I actually read the wiki that had it listed under the category of protective roles. 2) The lack of a night kill last night. The flip side of this argument is that we have a player that has claimed hider. Further, I contend that pacman's play is unusual today. I do not think it is ridiculous to consider the prospect of a deliberate no kill by the scumteam last night in order to then immediately have a player claim doctor that visited a non-controversial player like Equinox who is generally thought of as town by a majority of players here. <br>\n<br>\nYou know, if it was any other player that had claimed doctor, I'd be much less critical of the position we are in. Additionally, it's easy to dismiss everything I've said and say \"occum's razor; vote: RC\" because, in truth, I know I'm in a bad position here. I'm at the point though that I have to put all my cards on the table and we'll see what happens. I've got to say that I do not trust pacman and I think there's more to this setup than meet's the eye. I'm going to spend a little time researching the Mod to see if he has ran any games prior to this.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: evilpacman18</span>", "time": "Sat Apr 12, 2014 4:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}

I have no idea why he used it on N1. From what I read of him, he seemed a bit newbish, so that was my best guess as to why.

I do not think we should be lynching from fitz/Rubicon/Rhinox/Kthx. I think we should be lynching pacman. Not to toot my own horn, but I think I've laid out a pretty solid case against the man.

I've never heard of that. Scum hider? I've never heard of that. Scum doctor? I have heard of that. Granted, it's uncommon, and given the apparent lack of a Vig/SK/third party, it's kind of pointless. But, heck, maybe pacman is a role cop that thought that claim seemed to scummy. <br>\n<br>\nSeriously, if you can show me one instance of a scum commuter or scum hider, I'll drop this point, but I've never heard of it.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, I do not know why pisskop commuted N1.

You're right, commuter is literally within that link, so even though he could have implied that a standard protective role would only mean doctor, he explicitly means that a commuter could be within that statement. This definitely could suggest that Pacman was actually lying the whole time. Oddly enough, with this all considered, RC's claim actually feels more town to me.<br>\n<br>\nI still have a damn near impossible time thinking that RC is town. It is entirely possible htat they're BOTH scum and have actually set up these fake claims to ensure one of them lives. Especially with the idea that RC could be surviving night phases by withholding information about when he's planning on commuting. RC would certainly get tons of town cred should pacman be lynched and flip scum non power role.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, when I first read the mod's statements about the setup, I figured \"non standard hider\" meant the experimental slot. However, a quick search of the wiki reveals that a hider is explicitly normal, and simply making a role compulsive and/or unable to target a player on consecutive nights doesn't make the role non-normal (or experimental) but simply non-standard.

I was waiting until evilpacman18 had returned and answered all the outstanding questions against him, so now that he has, this can happen.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, this isn't new information; people have already speculated that the public setup information was needed for balance. This is basically evidence for why I agree and believe that to be the case.<br>\n<br>\nThe purpose of the question in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5791732#p5791732\">post 575</a> was to ascertain whether Bicephalous Bob subscribed to the hitogoroshi style of moderation or not, as the latter would mean that there's an irregularity in the setup. As it happens, this isn't Bicephalous Bob's standard operating procedure. I don't know if the announcement regarding the setup was a recommendation by the Normal Review Group, and it's something I didn't see in the 100 or so setups I collected in Little Italy between December 2010 and October 2012. However, two things lead me to believe either that such a recommendation happened or that the reviewers allowed the moderator to make some setup information public: This is something that theme game reviewers occasionally recommend because it's needed to balance the game, and, within the context of Normal games, there was an issue with a Large Normal that ended in March 2012 (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=21341\" class=\"postlink\">New York 145</a>) where there were too many non-standard roles and there had been concerns while the game was ongoing that the fact that this wasn't announced had the potential to affect the game.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, to give you an idea of what does and does not warrant public information: Last year, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=21622\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1326</a> was run with 13 players and two factions, but the mafia team consisted of only 2 members. There had been no announcement there. What's different, though, is that the power roles that had been used in that game had no modifiers and there were no atypical mechanics (i.e., no Day talk). That said, considering the amount of power that's been claimed already, we're more likely looking at a full scum team.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:50%\"></div>I've been skimming the past three days, so I'm going to comment on just the claims now and get back to the rest of the material in a few hours once I've caught up properly.<br>\n<br>\nFor the purposes of this part of the post, I'm going to assume RedCoyote is a commuter as he claims: Judging from the presence of a hider, protective role, and tracker and the claim of a commuter, Bicephalous Bob may have been designing this game around the theme of hide-and-seek. Unfortunately, there are two possibilities under this Hide-and-Seek Theory, which doesn't help with determining RedCoyote's alignment at the present:<br>\n<br>\n1) A scum-aligned commuter would make sense with a town tracker if the aim of the setup was to have both sides playing hide-and-seek against each other. Town hides from scum, and scum hides from tracker. A town-aligned doctor would also make sense here in the sense that a town doctor would \"hide\" someone from scum seeking that player. Furthermore, with a scum-aligned commuter, the scum would naturally make the assumption of a second anti-town faction; Bicephalous Bob specifically mentioning that there is only one anti-town faction would have been for scum's benefit.<br>\n<br>\n2) Commuters are more likely to be town (<a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commuter\" class=\"postlink\">according to the wiki</a>). A town-aligned commuter would make sense if the aim of the setup was to have town playing hide-and-seek against scum. If we look at the game this way, there cannot be a doctor in the setup; a scum-aligned doctor wouldn't make sense given that the moderator has already taken out the lulz factor of putting one in, which would mean evilpacman18 is lying through his teeth. Given that people were putting evilpacman18 in their lynch lists, it's not unlikely that he saw the blurb and decided to claim doctor to draw out any counterclaims for the \"standard protective role.\"<br>\n<br>\nBasically, I'm pretty sure we actually do have a commuter. Honestly, option 1 makes more conceptual sense to me, but that line in the wiki bothers me. Site search shows precedence in Little Italy for all commuters being town except for one third-party commuter, as well, counting only the games that were run after Normalcy reviews were required: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=24199\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1400</a> (1-shot), <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=27171\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1444</a> (near-vanilla with town-aligned commuter being the sole power, and now I've got a bro-crush on Voidedmafia), and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5068082#p5068082\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1454</a> (2-shot).<br>\n<br>\nArgh.

I actually like both of your scenarios. They both sound pretty plausible. <br>\n<br>\nHere's the two things to balance out. Both of these things seem equally unlikely to me in as non-bias of a way as I can look at it. 1) Assuming you believe I'm a commuter, what are the odds that a commuter would be scum-aligned given the lack of precedent? 2) Assuming you believe pacman is a doctor, what are the odds that he's scum given the lack of practicality of having a scum doctor in this setup (Mod stated that there's only one scum team and it's extremely unlikely the town has any sort of killing role). <br>\n<br>\nWith that said, I'll go back to being my bias when I state that I can give at least three strong, catagorically separate ways in which pacman is not a part of this town. 1) Meta-wise, I believe I could take the time to form a substantial case for this not being the way pacman plays (I have a little experience with him that encourages me to research this argument more thoroughly if I become inclined to do so). 2) Based on Mod-supplied, public information about the setup and the questionable reasons to include two \"protective\" roles. To be fair, this argument is mostly stomped out with the Mod using a qualifier \"at least one\" in his ruleset. 3) pacman's play on this game as an island and how it does not appropriately fit with either a doctor claim or a town-aligned slot. <br>\n<br>\nTo put it in less fancy of a way, he's scum because of meta, setup speculation, and his overall play.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE 816 wrote:</cite>I (correctly) guessed why he did it, but it is suboptimal town play unless he's on the chopping block. He wasn't, at least from where I was sitting.</div></blockquote>\n\nWell, look it, there were three <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">gigantic</div> questionable actions made by pacman that have made me as stalwart as I have been so far about this. I've explained this to pacman some, but I don't think I've yet to put them altogether.<br>\n<br>\n1) pacman protects Equinox despite never mentioning Equinox at all during D2. His explanation was that his reads were \"changing\". Leave aside the fact that it makes logical sense to protect one of your top four (!) townreads over night, which pacman did not, why choose Equinox? It's seemingly random. I mean, Equinox personally would've probably been my third choice protection-wise, but I made it clear that that is where she was as far as my townreads go (behind Rhinox and Rubicon).<br>\n2) pacman claims his role and his protection immediately despite no pressure whatsoever to do so. His explanation was that he didn't want to \"waste time\" because he thought there would be four clears with him and ICE put together. He can't even say that he was trying to spare Equinox from being lynched, because ICE already outted his information. pacman really gave the town no good information here. I contend that neither pacman nor Equinox were ultimately going to be the lynch today without the claims. It would've been me or fitz's slot, I think.<br>\n3) pacman immediately believes ICE's claim despite the fact that pacman was on record saying that he was starting to read ICE as scum yesterday. I mean, pacman wasn't the least bit suspicious of ICE? Really? Perhaps if he had waited a day or two to see if there were counters or other players with role-based information that may dispute what ICE was saying, I would be lenient here. pacman doesn't wait for any of this though. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE 816 wrote:</cite>Also remember that if we lynch RC today it forces scum to NK pacman, whereas if we lynch pacman today RC won't be night killed, and they'll most likely target a cleared player.</div></blockquote>\n\nEither way we're going to lose a cleared player (cleared according to one of us three, of course), but I like this point. Of course, I'm bias, but I think I provide more value to the town this game than pacman by a considerable margin. Claim or no.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Equinox 825 wrote:</cite>it still makes no sense to me why he'd claim when he did.</div></blockquote>\n\nWould you agree that it's more plausible for him to do that as scum than as town?<br>\n<br>\nI don't think it was a smart move as either alignment, but I can comprehend why he'd do it as scum. I cannot comprehend at all why he'd do it as town. If he had protected someone OTHER than you or N, it would make a great deal of sense, but that's not what we're working with.

Why did you not comment about the above suggestion when it would be easy to confirm you by doing it?</div></blockquote>\n\nFor one, my pacman scumread is considerable (see this post and my last two). Two, What's to stop the scum from just killing N/Equinox if they know the doctor will be on me? Or ICE, for that matter, and then they can say \"oh look, RC killed ICE\". <br>\n<br>\nSeems like a waste of time. That said, Rubicon is right in that we should, at the very least, massclaim officially before lynching any PRs. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox 832 wrote:</cite>ICE's claimed role looks entirely explicitely normal to me and would not take up the one new/variant role slot.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo, assuming you believe my claim, does that necessarily make me the \"non-standard\" role?

However, if he hides behind scum while trying to clear town then it would still be mylo tomorrow but likely with only 1 conftown still alive, where as if he announces to try to find scum, and scum kill his target and him, we'd still have 2 conftown alive tomorrow for mylo.  But, the odds of being able to clear a townie are greater than the odds of confirming a scum, and if he lives he can \"investigate\" again the next night, so thats why I concur with not announcing and trying to clear a townie.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5824192#p5824192\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5824192#p5824192\" data-post-id=\"5824192\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 876</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12954\">Kthxbye</a> wrote:</cite>Im wary of the fitz wagon now.

If you're town, then the whole wagon before you unvoted is town. At least 75% of it from your POV, depending on your read on me. I don't know why that would be giving you an odd feeling. There's no argument against it because everyone has pretty much POE'd the slot as scum out of necessity for anything else to make sense. The fact that fitz/idk hasn't been lynched yet should be a sign that its not as \"easy\" as you think it is.<br>\n<br>\nIf fitz/idk is scum, I really don't expect scum could afford to be actively against lynching him. I think we're pretty much at the point of the game where scum usually aren't actively against their partner's lynches because they're afraid of being linked to their partners. When there's such a small pool of likely scum, when scum pretend to be town, from their POV they pretty much have to have scum reads on their partners and be ok with their lynches.<br>\n<br>\nThe way the day is evolving, it looks like either EPM or idk will be the lynch, and I think both are likely scum. I see the same argument regarding the EPM lynch that no one is really against it.

A big part of the reason why that was so though was because pacman and I are actively going after one another whereas fitz hasn't posted at all D3 and idk just got here yesterday. In that regard, I think you ought to weigh that idea that it \"seems like scum don't want fitz lynched\" versus people being reluctant to lynch someone over what amounts to lurking and PoE. I'm not shy in saying that pacman is a scumread of mine based on content, meta, and setup speculation. By contrast, idk isn't a scumread of mine based on any of those traits. He's only a scumread of mine because he's the least townie VT by factors completely independent of him. Hence PoE. And with that, I want to add that it's entirely possible that you and/or Kthx and/or Rubicon could be playing well enough in my eyes to get me to actively read all three of you as town. <br>\n<br>\nAs a matter of fact, it could still very well be the fact that you all three are the scumteam... although that clearly is what I would consider to be the least likely scenario at this point.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE 902 wrote:</cite>I'm ok with waiting for people to come in and give their 2 cents but I'm honestly not sure what more can be added today based on the information we currently have.

I probably have seemed bored with the game today, I certainly haven't been trying hard, the scum, Rubicon in particular, are hopping on that acting like it's scummy but really I think if you just look at my posts from my perspective, where the scumhunting is done and we just need to get on with the lynches and end this, I think it makes a lot more sense.

Actually reading that sentence \"seemed very forced\" and \"he didn't have any reason to claim\" are not only both lies but also directly contradictory to one another.<br>\nLike I said earlier, I was fine with a fitz lynch.

Given his position when he replaced in, where he was about to be lynched, it seems like too much of a coincidence too, that he came in, didn't try to read anyone but me, and voted me.

The scum team is idk, Rubicon, and RC. It's really pretty obvious if you look at the associative tells but I know a lot of people don't do that and I have the advantage of knowing my role. I probably have seemed bored with the game today, I certainly haven't been trying hard, the scum, Rubicon in particular, are hopping on that acting like it's scummy but really I think if you just look at my posts from my perspective, where the scumhunting is done and we just need to get on with the lynches and end this, I think it makes a lot more sense. Certainly I'd try harder as scum.

Notice for instance how his excuse for voting isn't so much related to me as it is related to not wanting to vote for RC. He sees my claim seems fake and my play is bad after admitting that he has only read day 3 and small parts of day 1 (\"as far as I know, he didn't have any reason to claim\" well you know very little, don't you?) and \"it seems forced\" is bullshit when talking about a claim that I really didn't need to do so early. \"Forced\" would be if I was on the verge of getting lynched, but I claimed on my own time, as my own decision. Actually reading that sentence \"seemed very forced\" and \"he didn't have any reason to claim\" are not only both lies but also directly contradictory to one another.<br>\nLike I said earlier, I was fine with a fitz lynch. This was mostly because I know who I think is town and if they thought fitz needed rope over the other uncertains, like Rhinox, I was fine with trusting them. idk has since come in, immediately aligned himself with RC, and come up with some really weak reasons to be voting me. Given his position when he replaced in, where he was about to be lynched, it seems like too much of a coincidence too, that he came in, didn't try to read anyone but me, and voted me. The vote comes off as more of a best bet at survival than a scum read he legitimately has.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nMore in a few hours, that actually took a long time to write. Anything I should address besides cases? Maybe I should try to better explain why me claiming was a good idea.</div></blockquote>\nOh dear, you caught me. I am in fact scum. You should all probably lynch me now!  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br>\n<br>\nI voted you&gt;RedCoyote because you both are scumreads of mine, but RC's case is based mostly off of WIFOM, while yours is not. I said \"as far as I know\" because I'm not going to falsely claim that I've read everything so far. You pretty much nailed the definition of \"forced\", if you slightly altered the beginning. If a claim is forced, the person who claimed was a suspect, but was not at L-1/L-2, and still claimed. And, *gasp*, that's exactly the situation you were in. <br>\n<br>\nThis sentence: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Actually reading that sentence \"seemed very forced\" and \"he didn't have any reason to claim\" are not only both lies but also directly contradictory to one another.\"</div> is absolutely incorrect. First of all, they do not contradict each other whatsoever. Secondly, I said \"as far as I know, he didn't have any reason to claim\", not just \"he didn't have any reason to claim\". This may not seem like a big difference, but what I said implies that I do not know for sure (which I don't). Can someone give me a reason why he needed to claim?<br>\n<br>\nI'm kind of swamped with homework right now, so I may not be able to post again tonight, but I'll try and check in at some point tomorrow.

Two things, 1) I misinterpreted the wording of my role PM so even if I hid behind a commuter and failed I would still not be able to target him tomorrow (which is what I was counting on, the extra player to potentially be able to target) and 2) with EPM flipping town I am significantly more concerned about scumRed.<br>\n<br>\nSo long story short, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rhinox is town</div>. He was a fairly safe bet and with our doctor dying tonight is was about 95% sure either Equinox or N was going tonight.<br>\n<br>\nI must say, I really wish we lynched idk yesterday. We would have got a scum, I would have died hiding behind RC, then everyone would have known who to lynch tomorrow and to leave EPM alive. Right now our chances are...fairly slim. The odds are very much against me to survive to endgame, and we have zero mislynches left.<br>\n<br>\nI suppose the fact that we have Rhinox confirmed town and that I'm almost positive he won't die tonight gives me <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> hope but this is looking fairly grim.<br>\n<br>\nI still think we need to go idk then RC then Rubicon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote idk</div>.

I guess because it just didn't seem like a scum role at all, but I was sufficiently (and pleasantly!) surprised that we didn't have to deal with anyone second guessing him. N did a fine job. He was effectively given free rein thanks to ICE. This allowed him to do whatever he wanted and playing a touch trollish just to keep the town off their game. <br>\n<br>\nComing into this game, I worked very hard to secure that Xay lynch. Realistically, I thought that that would be all I'd be able to do for the scumteam this game. After securing that lynch, all I wanted to do was get the protective role outted and then I fully expected to be lynched. I threw that commuter crumb out there early as an ace-in-the-hole, not knowing if I'd ever want or need to use it. I figured it was ambiguous enough to cause some confusion. When Equinox started spinning her theories about \"Hide and Seek\", I was sitting here like, \"Huh? Oh... Uh, y-yeah! That's the ticket!  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\">\" I don't think neither myself nor N expected pacman to be the protective role though, much less have a successful protection. That threw me for a total loop. Strangely enough, Luc and pisskop fingered both PRs immediately on N1. How they were able to ascertain that was very impressive. <br>\n<br>\nBut pacman allowed me to really push him hard the entirety of D4. ICE was a big help in assisting with that, as was Rubicon. When ICE and Kthx dropped the whole \"one of Xay/pisskop/Titus has to be scum\", that was a very helpful. I'm glad no one called them out on that, because I had no effective answer to that. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, it was a shame that there were so many flakes/inactives in this game. I was having a ball with it. <br>\n<br>\nMod, I enjoyed the flavor. I wish there'd have been more of it.

{"number": 999, "id": "5842613", "user": "ICEninja", "user_id": "12670", "content": "Whew alright. First thing, I would actually like to apologize to town. The way I exploited my role was legitimately unfair for your side. That combined with a sheer number of replacements made this game virtually impossible for town to win.<br>\n<br>\nSo. Mafia traitor compulsive hider. This is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">both</div> the worst role to play in a normal that I've ever seen and the role with the most possibility to ruin the game based on play (with only a mafia framer being worse but that is based on luck, a successful frame has decided entire games before based on a single night action, ICKY) depending on the setup.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, regarding my reaction receiving this role PM. I was...pretty unhappy. I'm biased in that I always prefer to play town over scum, as the thrill of the flip is my favorite part of this game, but this role made it even worse. The part about playing scum that sucks so much is the feeling of isolation during the day phase. During the night phase you're able to talk and plan, which really alleviates that, and many games have day talk these days which actually allows me to enjoy playing scum because it feels a lot less like you're on your own, one screwup away from being lynched.<br>\n<br>\nBeing a traitor doesn't give you that comfort of playing with your allies, though. Sometimes traitors are attempting to get \"assimilated\" in to the mafia squad by being the target of the night kill, but being a hider, I knew that it wasn't possible.<br>\n<br>\nSo then there is the other half of my role PM is being a hider. By itself, a town hider (compulsive or not) is generally best played as a suicide bomber unless you're super town. If a town hider gets super town status then they should be playing to dodge kills. However, most hiders play as a sort of suicide bomber. A cleverly crumbed hider dying behind scum flips and all but ensures scum's death, even better than a cop guilty claim. I obviously didn't get to do this. Instead I had to pick the player who was least likely to die and dodge my own team's kills. Because I had absolutely no control over who my team was going to kill and could be on the nasty end of that should they do something unpredictable.<br>\n<br>\nAfter only a single kill N1 I figured I was more or less safe to simply hide behind whoever was probably going to get lynched the next day, and once I realized that the mod had actually pointed out that there was a non standard hider in this game without a second mafia team and without a town vig, that I could claim and absolutely <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">nothing</div> could stop me. I had to come up with a non-standard hider role to claim, and who the hell would suspect a scum based hider if there's absolutely NOTHING to kill him? The <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">only</div> way anyone could possibly guess I was scum is if I was exactly as I am, a traitor hider. Which is quiiiiiite a stretch.<br>\n<br>\nSO basically I had a role that was lame to play and broke the game. It wasn't really much fun <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">.<br>\n<br>\nI honestly didn't even feel like I played very well. I pulled a hell of a lot of suspicion early on in the game just because I suck at playing scum. I pretty much relied on the fact that once I \"cleared\" N, that my buddies knew what my real role was. If they realized what I was up to, then town had little to no counter-play.", "time": "Wed Apr 23, 2014 7:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=39665&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "39665"}
