Voting for no lynch for the day is also possible. If no one gains a majority during a day, there will be no lynch for the day, and night will begin.<br>\nRule 8: Days will last a maximum of 2 weeks, but can be shorter if a lynch or no lynch is reached before the deadline. Extensions are possible, but unlikely. Nights will last 48 hours. If I do not receive a night action within that 48 hours, it will not count. <br>\nRule 9: If you die, you are allowed to make one 'bah' post that has no content in it, but after that no talking.<br>\nRule 10: If you are going to be away from the game for an extended period of time, please declare yourself V/LA in thread, and say how long you expect to be gone. If a player does not declare V/LA and they do not post for 48 hours, they will be prodded. They then have 24 hours to pick up their prod and start posting or they will be replaced out. If a person has been prodded twice and fails to post for 48 hours, instead of receiving another prod they will be replaced out.<br>\nRule 11: If you need to leave the game, please contact me via PM or say so in bold in the thread. It will be much appreciated over just flaking from the game.<br>\nRule 12: All roles will be decided by using random.org.<br>\nRule 13: Play to your win condition.<br>\nRule 14: I reserve the right to change the rules at any time if I feel it is necessary.<br>\nRule 15: If you break any of the rules, it will be my decision whether you are warned, replaced, or modkilled.<br>\n<br>\nHere is a sample Vanilla Townie role PM:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nHello, [player], you are a Vanilla Townie.

The main point of the system is just to help me better track how people sit relative to one another over the course of a game.

The point that Monkeyman was making is pretty obvious - in most circumstances, only scum would be in a position to have a declared townread of somebody on the first page (and it's safe to assume that a mason, daycop, etc wouldn't be dumb enough to declare their knowledge so prematurely).  I fail to see why what he said is scummy when, on this reasoning, it would have been perfectly okay (I'll get to the \"seems\" thing in a second) if he'd said: \"Implosion seems to know somebody is town.  Only scum would know that.  Therefore, Implosion is scummy.\"<br>\n<br>\n2) As for the \"seems\" point, you're again being ridiculously strict.  Sure, \"seems\" CAN be used for scummy hedging, but it is also perfectly legit to use it where you are reasonably uncertain.  Two examples:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>potentially scummy/hedging use of seems wrote:</cite><br>\nWhat Mr X just did <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">seems</div> scummy to me </div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>non-scummy use of seems wrote:</cite><br>\nMr X seems to know too much </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIn the first example, the person is being unclear about whether or not <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">they</div> think what Mr X did is scummy (ie there is a chance they are trying to hide their true position).  Even this isn't necessarily scummy, since it might well be unclear.<br>\n<br>\nIn the second example, however, it's just stating an objective fact - Mr X does appear to know too much.

Instead, you conclude that he just looks \"weird\" because of his post about Edo.  So, basically, you admit that he's done something that's pretty unarguably scummy, but then don't even appear to factor this into your overall read.<br>\n<br>\n2) On the self-voting point specifically, if you do think that a genuine self-vote can come from town or scum (which then begs the question: if scum can make a \"genuine\" self-vote, what one earth would a \"non-genuine\" one be?), then Implosion's attempt to defend himself by saying that edo's self-vote appeared \"genuine\" is simply invalid (because Implosion is assuming that genuine self-vote = town).

You'll note in the game with oopidstay that I mentioned his \"lingering selfvote\" - that is, that it wasn't just the selfvote that was townish, but also the way that he acted when people questioned it. In the game you linked, smooth criminal instantly unvoted when another person jumped on. The vote itself is actually fairly similar - but with oopid, it wasn't just the selfvote that made me think he was town. In this case, the selfvote itself was the vote that made me think he was town (although the careful reader will also note that I did mention his other post). <br>\n<br>\nThere's nothing in that selfvote that makes me think 'hm, smooth criminal is being genuine.' There are things in the selfvote from edosurist that make me think that it came from town (i.e., the way he explained it). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite>Is this part of your meta?

They elicit useful responses. Plus, my stance on towntells in general is to explain them if either someone asks me to explain them or if i happen to be in the mood to explain them, and it was my first post of the game, so i'd rather have something more interesting than analysis. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I agree it's significantly better (in terms of clarity). However, my whole point is that surely just making his position that little bit more explicit cannot be the difference between towntell and scumtell, when his meaning was already comprehensible to anybody with reasonable powers of inference.</div></blockquote><br>\n...But it is the difference between towntell and scumtell. His meaning was comprehensible - that's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that the way that he made his point is towing the line between asking me a question (i.e. 'implosion, how do you know that?') and flat-out calling me scum (i.e., 'implosion knows too much. implosion is scum/*vote for implosion*). That towing the line is scummy, and your rephrasing of his post completely removes that towing the line (and therefore completely removes what i find scummy in the post). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Monkey was saying that you seemed (ie. appeared) to know something you shouldn't. That's a pretty clear accusation on its own. Just because he didn't use the word \"scummy\" doesn't mean his meaning was vague.</div></blockquote><br>\nAh, here's where you're wrong. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monkey wrote:</cite>Gonna put implosion at L-2. I agree with most of the current analysis and don't like that he's taking so long to respond. This further's my suspicion that he's hiding something.

That is, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">he wasn't accusing me.</div> Additionally, his current vote was random - if he was truly accusing me, he would have no reason not to vote me there.

{"number": 57, "id": "4481677", "user": "vollkan", "user_id": "6898", "content": "<blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite><br>\nWell yeah. But then the rest of the point 1 was basically \"well, if monkeyman had said Y, then your point is invalid\" when in fact monkeyman said X and not Y. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOkay, so you have no argument rebutting the main aspect of my point 1.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the \"well if monkeyman had said Y\" thing, let's go back to what I actually said in my point 1):<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 1) It's not taking an accusatory tone without making a direct accusation. The point that Monkeyman was making is pretty obvious - in most circumstances, only scum would be in a position to have a declared townread of somebody on the first page (and it's safe to assume that a mason, daycop, etc wouldn't be dumb enough to declare their knowledge so prematurely). I fail to see why what he said is scummy when, on this reasoning, it would have been perfectly okay (I'll get to the \"seems\" thing in a second) if he'd said: \"Implosion seems to know somebody is town. Only scum would know that. Therefore, Implosion is scummy.\"<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYour attack was based on the premise that his meaning was (deliberately) unclear.  My point, which you haven't refuted, is that any reasonable person reading what Monkeyman said would know exactly what he meant. <br>\n<br>\nPut another way - not spelling things out in complete detail is not the same thing as being ambiguous/vague.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite><br>\n...But it is the difference between towntell and scumtell. His meaning was comprehensible - that's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that the way that he made his point is towing the line between asking me a question (i.e. 'implosion, how do you know that?') and flat-out calling me scum (i.e., 'implosion knows too much. implosion is scum/*vote for implosion*). That towing the line is scummy, and your rephrasing of his post completely removes that towing the line (and therefore completely removes what i find scummy in the post). <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou've actually provided a perfect illustration of my issue with your post.<br>\n<br>\n\"implosion knows too much. implosion is scum/*vote for implosion*\" would be totally unjustified.  I didn't think your townread post was scummy, but even if I had, I would have probably said something like what Monkey said.  I would definitely NOT have said: \"Implosion knows too much.  He is scum\"<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Imp wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Gonna put implosion at L-2. I agree with most of the current analysis and don't like that he's taking so long to respond. This further's my suspicion that he's hiding something. I'm not necessarily saying he needs to tell us, because sometimes there is information that needs to stay hidden early in the game, but this wagon strikes me as very town.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nMonkey here implies that he thought there was a chance (unlikely or otherwise) that I was hiding town-motivated information. That is, he wasn't accusing me. Additionally, his current vote was random - if he was truly accusing me, he would have no reason not to vote me there. What he did in post 30 was clearly an accusation, insofar as it was accompanied by a vote.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nUm...that's just my point?  Monkey's position is exactly what you'd expect from somebody who thinks, reasonably, that your post appeared to show inside knowledge, but who also recognises the slight risk that you might just be a town PR doing something weird.  That only makes it MORE likely that he'd say something like the \"seems\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>scooby wrote:</cite><br>\nplease stop the wallotexting Im skiimming and not getting anything at all<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt's hardly walling.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Monkey wrote:</cite><br>\nIt wasn't an accusation so much as a thought.

First off, lincolm clearly had a reason (good or bad) for unvoting which he made explicit - him questioning someone else as to their own motivations is not suspicious. Second, do you really think we should eliminate weak town in the early game? What you're suggesting here is similar to a policy lynch. Also, which do you think lincolm is based only on your second point: afraid-to-commit scum or weak town?

If not, do you deny that there is any possible protown motivation within that playstyle? if you do deny that, then do you think that wanting the day to go on for more than two pages isn't protown? I mean, you admit yourself that quicklynches aren't ideal - if others have stronger feelings about quicklynches, why are you unwilling to accept that? <br>\n<br>\nkillerjester's response to vollkan is also really underwhelming.

I said i thought he was town in one post, and then i looked more and i'm unsure. <br>\n<br>\nStraightforwardness isn't solely a personality thing, at least in my opinion. Scum often want to be able to change their opinion at will without looking scummy, and also may want to prepare for what they know will eventually be a townflip - to this end, they may include clauses or rhetoric which implies that 'i might be wrong.' <br>\n<br>\nI can also try to explain the difference between ambiguity and not explicitly stating that someone is scum. <br>\n<br>\nMonkey's statement attacked me without actually saying that I was scum, along the lines of \"implosion seems to know too much.\" An ambiguous statement would be more along the lines of \"implosion is scummy for his post X, but his post Y is towny.\" The first statement is relatively clear in its intent to cast suspicion on me, but it does not directly say \"i believe implosion is scum\" (that is, monkey may be trying to create a \"way out\" as described above). The second statement is ambiguous because, without further explanation from the poster, one cannot tell what their opinion on me is. I'm arguing that monkey's post falls into the first category, <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">not</div> the second - and I think this is where vollkan misunderstands me. <br>\n<br>\nComparatively, what killerjester is doing is attacking people for having an opinion (namely, that L-1ing on page two is a bad idea) which is not only arguably pro-town, but which is a very common opinion on the site (and i'm sure he knows that it's a very common opinion on the site). Attacking someone for having a certain philosophy about the game of mafia is different from attacking them for having a certain style of rhetoric in their post. Sure, my argument about monkey would be stronger if i were to compare this to a towngame of his (which i might do later). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>killerjester wrote:</cite><br>\nAnd thirdly, you're just trying to deflect the question of why you didn't offer to clarify why his implosion vote was a good vote.</div></blockquote><br>\nAnd fourthly, you're using this question to try to deflect the fact that vollkan completely defeated your other argument without having to admit that he did...", "time": "Sat Nov 17, 2012 1:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23948&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "23948"}

IMO it is.<br>\n<br>\n2 - I disagree. If Lincolm had just asked Naomi WHY she had unvoted, or asked IF or HOW her read on implosion had changed I might have thought nothing of it.

There's no point to it.</div></blockquote><br>\nhey benmage, your first sentence in this quote had two question marks and there was no point to the second - obviously, by your reasoning, this must be scummy. <br>\n<br>\nFirst off, there is a point to fluffposting - mafia isn't just a back-and-forth rhetorical exercise to see who can argue better. It's a game. It's intended to be fun. Many people *enjoy* fluffposting sometimes. Second off, even if there were no point to it, that in no way makes it scummy (read: two question marks in your first sentence). Not every single line has to be game-related. <br>\n<br>\nI think the way that you called her out also just feels off (as in, scummy-off) but that's more of a gut thing. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite>In my head, when I think: \"Would I do this as scum?\" , then, thinking strategically, very few things come out as towntells.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou shouldn't be thinking \"would I do this as scum\" - in many cases, it's easy for me to identify someone as town for something that I would do as scum all the time, but that i'm very confident they wouldn't be able to do for one reason or another (very often, inexperience). Besides, just like scumtells, towntells don't have to be absolute. I find that I can see towntells more often than scumtells because there are more town than scum - i often get into situations where i have too many townreads, and then the game becomes a process of narrowing down among my townreads by deciding which townreads have the weakest reasoning, and eliminating them as townreads. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not really sure why i just explained my meta but whatever~<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>(I bolded imp&#8217;s comment in the quote above) Not sure how you get a town feeling from Post 47. And why do you question KJ about not suspecting Lincolm when in the same post you seem to think suspecting Lincolm is a bad thing (it&#8217;s not)?</div></blockquote><br>\nI question KJ about not suspecting lincolm because, putting myself in KJ's shoes, it seemed like the reasoning that he was using to attack edosurist should have applied exactly as well to lincolm That is, that I was lincolm's primary suspect, yet he was willing to unvote me - it seemed very similar to his argument about edos, wherein edos not wanting to have the maximum possible number of votes on me was scummy. I was curious why he made one attack and not the other. <br>\n<br>\nAs for post 47, it felt both legitimately confused and legitimately annoyed. It felt like lincolm was genuinely confused as to the best way to scumhunt, and genuinely annoyed at killerjester for being unhelpful - i would expect both of these reactions to be likely from newbtown who got post 46 as a response. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>1 - You mention the possibility that he had a bad reason for unvoting you. If you acknowledge that Lincolm&#8217;s reason for unvoting you could be viewed as being bad (which I do)&#8230;why is that bad reasoning not subject to suspicion. IMO it is.<br>\n<br>\n2 - I disagree. If Lincolm had just asked Naomi WHY she had unvoted, or asked IF or HOW her read on implosion had changed I might have thought nothing of it. As it was&#8230;asking if implosion &#8220;was not enough suspicious&#8221; for her just came off as suspect for me.<br>\n<br>\n3- That isn&#8217;t what I am suggesting. My vote is on Lincolm because I suspect him to be scum. If I was going to push a policy lynch though (and I&#8217;m not) I couldn&#8217;t think of many better ones than on someone incapable of independent thought asking to be led.<br>\n<br>\n4 - See #3<br>\n<br>\n5 &#8211; Shouldn&#8217;t everyone justify their votes? What is wrong with me justifying mine? And I could be wrong&#8230;what&#8217;s wrong with admitting that? All D1 mislynches (if that&#8217;s what Lincolm were to turn out being) have more town on them than scum so aside from disappointment at not hitting scum&#8230;I would not feel any remorse at a Lincolm lynch. And to reiterate&#8230;I&#8217;m voting him because I suspect him of being scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n1: This goes back to my philosophy about mafia, in a way. When i first came to MS, i was of the opinion that bad pushes are necessarily scummy. I am no longer of that opinion. Bad play is in no way indicative of scum. Bad and scummy are, as far as I'm concerned, two completely different qualifiers that can be put on play. <br>\n<br>\n2: Well, your original criticism was simply because he questioned the unvote - the criticism wasn't because of the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">way</div> that he questioned the unvote. But fair enough. <br>\n<br>\n3-4: understood, but see 5<br>\n<br>\n5: noooo. That's not what I'm saying. That line isn't you justifying your vote - it's you preemptively giving a justification for if your vote is wrong. That is, it's kind of a weasely way to say \"well, i think that lincolm is scum. But if he winds up flipping town, then oh well.\" You voting him because you suspect him of being scum is more clear now - but still, the sort of secondary justification of \"if i'm wrong, it doesn't matter\" is scummy to me. I get that the justification for your vote is \"lincolm is scum because X\" - this is separate from that.", "time": "Mon Nov 19, 2012 1:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23948&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "23948"}

When i first came to MS, i was of the opinion that bad pushes are necessarily scummy. I am no longer of that opinion. Bad play is in no way indicative of scum. Bad and scummy are, as far as I'm concerned, two completely different qualifiers that can be put on play.<br>\n<br>\n2: Well, your original criticism was simply because he questioned the unvote - the criticism wasn't because of the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">way</div> that he questioned the unvote. But fair enough.<br>\n<br>\n3-4: understood, but see 5<br>\n<br>\n5: noooo. That's not what I'm saying. That line isn't you justifying your vote - it's you preemptively giving a justification for if your vote is wrong. That is, it's kind of a weasely way to say \"well, i think that lincolm is scum. But if he winds up flipping town, then oh well.\" You voting him because you suspect him of being scum is more clear now - but still, the sort of secondary justification of \"if i'm wrong, it doesn't matter\" is scummy to me. I get that the justification for your vote is \"lincolm is scum because X\" - this is separate from that.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1 &#8211; Actually I never put a bad qualifier (or any qualifier for that matter) on Lincolm&#8217;s play. I was responding to your use of &#8220;good or bad&#8221;. All I did was list the things I found suspects. Was Lincolm vote removal at the suggestion of Edo good or bad play? Who&#8217;s to say? Sure&#8230;both scum and town exhibit good and bad play. What I do know is is that based on Lincolm&#8217;s posts up to that point he seemed to have a reasonable suspicion of you (as good or better than anyone else voting you at that time) and he just let it go. What I find suspect is that his actions did not make sense to me. His unvoted seemed out of place&#8230;.I suspected it. Ergo I suspect Lincolm.<br>\n<br>\n2 &#8211; I suspected three things in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4482047#p4482047\">Lincolm vote post</a>. The unvote despite having perfectly (IMO) acceptable suspicions towards you at that time; the question (which I quoted) to Naomi&#8230;the way it was asked wasn&#8217;t singled out because the way was what it was. I only offer more suitable ways IMO to you as an example of what might not have caught my attention; and the helpless townie schtick which some people may not see as suspect&#8230;.but I do.<br>\n<br>\n5 &#8211; You said &#8220;pre-emptive justification&#8221; so I&#8217;m working with the term &#8220;justification&#8221;. Fine&#8230;you aren&#8217;t bothered with my vote and the associated suspicions. Your problem is with the fact I said weak town was not appealing to me and is best eliminated early in the game. I stand by that opinion. If someone I didn&#8217;t consider weak town was making mistakes that led to valid suspicions (IMO) towards them I would be all for that person&#8217;s lynch. Even if there were one or more &#8220;weak town&#8221; in the game. The fact the person I suspect also comes across as weak town (IMO) makes my vote on him doubly appealing to me. Fact remains&#8230;I&#8217;m not voting him because he is weak town, but that would make his potential mislynch a lot more palatable.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:75%\"></div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4489288#p4489288\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4489288#p4489288\" data-post-id=\"4489288\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 171</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6898\">vollkan</a> wrote:</cite> <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4487603#p4487603\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4487603#p4487603\" data-post-id=\"4487603\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 141</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11821\">havingfitz</a> wrote:</cite> 5 &#8211; Shouldn&#8217;t everyone justify their votes?

The advantage to scum in declaring early reads is precisely that they get the buddying effect without being \"committed\" or being \"forced to explain\".

Scum gain the buddying advantage.  This is why I stated it, and it is a valid scumtell.

So at best, your left with, wine... and it alone is not convincing.<br>\n**An additional point I would argue in favor of this nowadays leaning more to a towntell, is that we have become so sensitive to early scumbuddying attempts that one so obvious as implosions reads as one of those flippant town remarks I alluded to.

Doesn't that seem to suggest the deciding factor here is the level of productivity? If this is true, one need only look at how productive a player is being to see if they are scum or not, as aggression would be completely irrelevant.

Unvoting scum will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">never</div> earn you townpoints in my eyes. While it's true that scum does not want to be on a town wagon that gets pushed till lynch, there are other reasons to want to leave a wagon. For instance, not wanting to lynch your townreads. Or finding someone who you think is more likely to be scum. There's a pattern here if you can see it. Scum players are more influenced by appearances in their decision-making while town players are more interested in scumhunting, and would never allow appearances to dissuade their conviction. You're guilty of the former.

Everyone dreams of being an IC sometimes right?<br>\n<br>\nI get that you're confused and all but surely you must understand the implications of not securing enough votes for a lynch. The abridged version goes something like, it may look permissible to no lynch because players die at a slower rate, but those deaths are chosen by scum, so the benefit is not as good as one may think. Yes you may end up mislynching, but the mislynch holds more information than a no lynch does (basically D2 blind with one less person instead of two people down with a whole load of information). <br>\n<br>\nIf looking at 12 players feels overwhelming, you might do well to narrow your scope. At this late in the day you can probably rule out some players as unlikely to be lynched even if they do look scummy, just by nature of them not having votes on their slot and the logistical difficulties of convincing 6 other players to vote for them in a 28 hour time frame. However, that's quite alright because scum come in groups! Even if you can't lynch someone now you'll have other opportunities later in the game.<br>\n<br>\nStart by eliminating choices that have no votes. In my opinion it'd be difficult to lynch anyone besides implosion, Benmage, TML, MonkeyMan, or myself, presently.

This is really over-explanatory, which as scooby pointed out a while ago, is a scummy trait. It explains the RVS vote being disingenuous... but at the same time kind of compounds the issue. It feels like a really played-out tactic - like he's going \"oh look at me, i did something to elicit reactions!\" Then he explains what he did and why he stopped it in about four different ways within two lines...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Scooby's case on Librarian is very weak, but it's also a town tell.

Subject to what I say below in 2), I do only have one non-null read.<br>\n2) The point I was trying to get across in 509 was simply that \"null\" doesn't equal \"no opinion\".  As in, not finding somebody's play scummy is different from not having an opinion.

A scum/town-tell is an action that makes it more likely that a player is scum/town.  In practical application of this, my <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">operating</div> definition of a scumtell is: \"Any action that a town player would not reasonably take in the circumstances\".  My <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">operating</div> definition of a towntell is: \"Any action that a scum player would not reasonably take in the circumstances.\"  Now, at first glance, that seems symmetrical.  However, the range of actions that town could reasonably do is actually MUCH narrower than the range of actions that scum could reasonably do.  The reason for this is that whereas town's sole motivation should be \"catching scum\", scum have at least three motivations: lynching town, self-preservation, and confusion.", "time": "Tue Dec 11, 2012 2:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23948&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "23948"}

In 108, Scooby declares a scumread on Monkeyman for imp's \"something definitive\" point and for putting somebody at L-2 for BS reasons.  However, in 109, he goes on to vote TML for the comparatively weak tell of \"overexplaining himself\", which isn't even factually borne out in the examples he cites, and for *shock* asking questions.  When he's questioned on this, 114 just provides a generic theory explanation of \" Scum always over explain their actions because they need extra validation.\"<br>\n<br>\n208: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Edo+7</div> I got stuck on this Edo post for a while.

I believe you were trying to say<br>\n\"Yeah, I don't like how scooby doesn't want to lynch lurkers, but he built half of a case on TML about the way TML asked questions to certain people about another person\"</div></blockquote><br>\nI think it was the reference to Wam which says \"if you're intentionally trying to mislead the town\" which initially set me off - in that, with the benefit of hindsight, it is phrased weirdly to address wam and postulate \"if [he is] intentionally trying to mislead the town\", not least because \"the town\" sounds like a third party to them.  I'm not going so far as to call it a scumslip or anything so dramatic at this point.<br>\nHowever, beyond that the post itself does not make any sense, because Edo goes on to explain MM's actions and admits \" it actually wasn't that clear\".  In which case, why even bother with asking wam whether he was \"intentionally trying to mislead the town\"?<br>\nIn short, there's serious cognitive dissonance going on. I cannot see how a player who genuinely saw MM's post as confusing would accuse a player of intentionally trying to mislead the town. That's an independent, non-relational, tell - but, relationally, the strength of the tell is increased by the fact that wam is scum (because that would explain why the idea of wam deliberately misleading would even occur to edo)<br>\n295: I considered whether this was a relational tell against Benmage, but it's equally possible that it's Monkey setting up wagoning on a potential town wagonee as it is that it's Monkey distancing (attacking, in very strong language, without voting)<br>\n365: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Edo+3</div> NT had made it pretty damn obvious that she was a PR with information on Wam.

I don't think it likely that town's mind would so quickly turn to self-preservation by pointing out that this \"confirms\" himself (which, as an aside, it doesn't).  It reads more likely as scum trying to salvage a terrible situation.  Further, and what brnigs this to 7, this would provide one explanation for the N2 lincolm kill (Benscum wanting to kill lincolmtown both to eliminate somebody who might get treated as semi-confirmed AND to give credence to Benscum's own \"I'm cleared!\" BS),<br>\n390: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scooby+5</div> Attempts to delay wam's lynch, based on the fairly ridiculous implicit assumption that mafia being able to perform two actions in a night is absurd whereas a double-targeting neighbouriser is okay.<br>\n<br>\n====================<br>\nWith all that done:<br>\n<br>\n<table style=\"border:1px solid black; \"><th class=\"bbtableheader\">Player</th><th class=\"bbtableheader\">Score</th>\n<tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\">scooby</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\">60</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\">Benmage</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\">57</td></tr>\n <tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">killerjester</div></td><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">64</div></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\">Edosurist</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:3px\">60</td></tr></table>", "time": "Fri Dec 14, 2012 4:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23948&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "23948"}
