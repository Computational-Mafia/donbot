Each person starts at 50.  The basis for the points is my own view of how serious a scumtell is (ie the numbers are not a measure of probability calculated using a formula or anything).  The main point of the system is just to help me better track how people sit relative to one another over the course of a game.  I try to keep things in intervals of 5, so 5 means a minor/ordinary scumtell, 10 is a serious one, etc</div></div></div><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Monkeyman</span><br><br>A few reasons for this.<br><br>1) It's not taking an accusatory tone without making a direct accusation.  The point that Monkeyman was making is pretty obvious - in most circumstances, only scum would be in a position to have a declared townread of somebody on the first page (and it's safe to assume that a mason, daycop, etc wouldn't be dumb enough to declare their knowledge so prematurely).  I fail to see why what he said is scummy when, on this reasoning, it would have been perfectly okay (I'll get to the \"seems\" thing in a second) if he'd said: \"Implosion seems to know somebody is town.  Only scum would know that.  Therefore, Implosion is scummy.\"<br><br>2) As for the \"seems\" point, you're again being ridiculously strict.  Sure, \"seems\" CAN be used for scummy hedging, but it is also perfectly legit to use it where you are reasonably uncertain.  Two examples:<br><blockquote><div><cite>potentially scummy/hedging use of seems wrote:</cite>What Mr X just did <span style=\"font-style: italic\">seems</span> scummy to me </div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>non-scummy use of seems wrote:</cite>Mr X seems to know too much </div></blockquote><br><br>In the first example, the person is being unclear about whether or not <span class=\"noboldsig\">they</span> think what Mr X did is scummy (ie there is a chance they are trying to hide their true position).  Even this isn't necessarily scummy, since it might well be unclear.<br><br>In the second example, however, it's just stating an objective fact - Mr X does appear to know too much.  The person doesn't know whether Mr X actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span> know too much - so the most true thing that they can say is that Mr X \"seems\" (ie appears) to know too much.<br><br>3) Your \"Third\" isn't really a new point so much as just a melding of the two previous ones.  Anyway, the same things I said above apply here also.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4479223#p4479223\" class=\"postlink\">post 14</a>, implosion wrote:</cite>In non sequiturial news, I believe this is my first game with vollkan since my first ever scumgame.</div></blockquote>[/quote]<br><br>I do vaguely remember playing with you before, but memory of most past games is not great (this is my first game after a longish break/semi-retirement)"}

You'll note in the game with oopidstay that I mentioned his \"lingering selfvote\" - that is, that it wasn't just the selfvote that was townish, but also the way that he acted when people questioned it. In the game you linked, smooth criminal instantly unvoted when another person jumped on. The vote itself is actually fairly similar - but with oopid, it wasn't just the selfvote that made me think he was town. In this case, the selfvote itself was the vote that made me think he was town (although the careful reader will also note that I did mention his other post). <br><br>There's nothing in that selfvote that makes me think 'hm, smooth criminal is being genuine.'

The point that Monkeyman was making is pretty obvious - in most circumstances, only scum would be in a position to have a declared townread of somebody on the first page (and it's safe to assume that a mason, daycop, etc wouldn't be dumb enough to declare their knowledge so prematurely). I fail to see why what he said is scummy when, on this reasoning, it would have been perfectly okay (I'll get to the \"seems\" thing in a second) if he'd said: \"Implosion seems to know somebody is town. Only scum would know that. Therefore, Implosion is scummy.\"<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Your attack was based on the premise that his meaning was (deliberately) unclear.  My point, which you haven't refuted, is that any reasonable person reading what Monkeyman said would know exactly what he meant. <br><br>Put another way - not spelling things out in complete detail is not the same thing as being ambiguous/vague.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>...But it is the difference between towntell and scumtell. His meaning was comprehensible - that's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that the way that he made his point is towing the line between asking me a question (i.e. 'implosion, how do you know that?') and flat-out calling me scum (i.e., 'implosion knows too much. implosion is scum/*vote for implosion*). That towing the line is scummy, and your rephrasing of his post completely removes that towing the line (and therefore completely removes what i find scummy in the post). <br></div></blockquote><br><br>You've actually provided a perfect illustration of my issue with your post.<br><br>\"implosion knows too much. implosion is scum/*vote for implosion*\" would be totally unjustified.  I didn't think your townread post was scummy, but even if I had, I would have probably said something like what Monkey said.  I would definitely NOT have said: \"Implosion knows too much.  He is scum\"<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Imp wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Gonna put implosion at L-2. I agree with most of the current analysis and don't like that he's taking so long to respond. This further's my suspicion that he's hiding something. I'm not necessarily saying he needs to tell us, because sometimes there is information that needs to stay hidden early in the game, but this wagon strikes me as very town.<br></div></blockquote><br>Monkey here implies that he thought there was a chance (unlikely or otherwise) that I was hiding town-motivated information. That is, he wasn't accusing me. Additionally, his current vote was random - if he was truly accusing me, he would have no reason not to vote me there. What he did in post 30 was clearly an accusation, insofar as it was accompanied by a vote.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Um...that's just my point?  Monkey's position is exactly what you'd expect from somebody who thinks, reasonably, that your post appeared to show inside knowledge, but who also recognises the slight risk that you might just be a town PR doing something weird.

It feels like subtle pressure on her to put her vote back.<br><br>In addition...the \"I don't know who scum is\" and \"someone give me advice\" stuff (paraphrased) is not going to fly.

Neither of which are appealing to me and best eliminated early in the game.</div></blockquote><br>Dislike this post for several reasons as well. First off, lincolm clearly had a reason (good or bad) for unvoting which he made explicit - him questioning someone else as to their own motivations is not suspicious. Second, do you really think we should eliminate weak town in the early game? What you're suggesting here is similar to a policy lynch. Also, which do you think lincolm is based only on your second point: afraid-to-commit scum or weak town? Because your line about saying that either way his lynch is good feels a lot like preemptive justification for if lincolm ever flips town and you were on the wagon (which is scummy for obvious reasons). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>killerjester wrote:</cite>In regards to the points on me. Lynching scum is very helpful advice, it's how I win a majority of my games as town. I don't see how I twisted his words. There is a clear motivational contradiction between having a scumread on implosion and telling people to unvote implosion without a single effort to convince them that implosion is scum. The only thing that makes sense is scum wanting to avoid suspicion.</div></blockquote><br>Once again, you don't seem to be able to grasp the idea that other peoples' playstyles can differ philosophically from your own and still come from town players. Do you admit the legitimacy of a playstyle which would not want to L-1 someone on page two simply because they do not want to accidentally end the day on page two? If not, do you deny that there is any possible protown motivation within that playstyle? if you do deny that, then do you think that wanting the day to go on for more than two pages isn't protown? I mean, you admit yourself that quicklynches aren't ideal - if others have stronger feelings about quicklynches, why are you unwilling to accept that? <br><br>killerjester's response to vollkan is also really underwhelming. Vollkan is clearly right about what edo said, and killer is just kinda assuming that anyone who disagrees with anything that he's said is wrong for one reason or another. It doesn't feel like killerjester is really paying attention to the actual points that other people are making (which isn't necessarily scummy, but etc)."}

The second statement is ambiguous because, without further explanation from the poster, one cannot tell what their opinion on me is. I'm arguing that monkey's post falls into the first category, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">not</span> the second - and I think this is where vollkan misunderstands me. <br><br>Comparatively, what killerjester is doing is attacking people for having an opinion (namely, that L-1ing on page two is a bad idea) which is not only arguably pro-town, but which is a very common opinion on the site (and i'm sure he knows that it's a very common opinion on the site). Attacking someone for having a certain philosophy about the game of mafia is different from attacking them for having a certain style of rhetoric in their post.

On the other hand, where games are less analysis-heavy I seem more scummy (since if I can't prove that anybody is being wrong or inconsistent, I kind of enter a paralysis).<br>- I tend to get involved in lengthy back-and-forth arguments, but I am nowhere near as bad as I used to be <br>- My scale ranges from 0 to 100, but it's uncommon for anybody to go below 50.

It's a game. It's intended to be fun. Many people *enjoy* fluffposting sometimes.

Besides, just like scumtells, towntells don't have to be absolute. I find that I can see towntells more often than scumtells because there are more town than scum - i often get into situations where i have too many townreads, and then the game becomes a process of narrowing down among my townreads by deciding which townreads have the weakest reasoning, and eliminating them as townreads. <br><br>I'm not really sure why i just explained my meta but whatever~<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>(I bolded imp\u2019s comment in the quote above) Not sure how you get a town feeling from Post 47.

When i first came to MS, i was of the opinion that bad pushes are necessarily scummy. I am no longer of that opinion. Bad play is in no way indicative of scum. Bad and scummy are, as far as I'm concerned, two completely different qualifiers that can be put on play. <br><br>2: Well, your original criticism was simply because he questioned the unvote - the criticism wasn't because of the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">way</span> that he questioned the unvote. But fair enough. <br><br>3-4: understood, but see 5<br><br>5: noooo. That's not what I'm saying. That line isn't you justifying your vote - it's you preemptively giving a justification for if your vote is wrong. That is, it's kind of a weasely way to say \"well, i think that lincolm is scum. But if he winds up flipping town, then oh well.\" You voting him because you suspect him of being scum is more clear now - but still, the sort of secondary justification of \"if i'm wrong, it doesn't matter\" is scummy to me.

When i first came to MS, i was of the opinion that bad pushes are necessarily scummy. I am no longer of that opinion. Bad play is in no way indicative of scum. Bad and scummy are, as far as I'm concerned, two completely different qualifiers that can be put on play.<br><br>2: Well, your original criticism was simply because he questioned the unvote - the criticism wasn't because of the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">way</span> that he questioned the unvote. But fair enough.<br><br>3-4: understood, but see 5<br><br>5: noooo. That's not what I'm saying. That line isn't you justifying your vote - it's you preemptively giving a justification for if your vote is wrong. That is, it's kind of a weasely way to say \"well, i think that lincolm is scum. But if he winds up flipping town, then oh well.\" You voting him because you suspect him of being scum is more clear now - but still, the sort of secondary justification of \"if i'm wrong, it doesn't matter\" is scummy to me. I get that the justification for your vote is \"lincolm is scum because X\" - this is separate from that.</div></blockquote><br><br>1 \u2013 Actually I never put a bad qualifier (or any qualifier for that matter) on Lincolm\u2019s play. I was responding to your use of \u201cgood or bad\u201d. All I did was list the things I found suspects. Was Lincolm vote removal at the suggestion of Edo good or bad play? Who\u2019s to say? Sure\u2026both scum and town exhibit good and bad play. What I do know is is that based on Lincolm\u2019s posts up to that point he seemed to have a reasonable suspicion of you (as good or better than anyone else voting you at that time) and he just let it go. What I find suspect is that his actions did not make sense to me. His unvoted seemed out of place\u2026.I suspected it. Ergo I suspect Lincolm.<br><br>2 \u2013 I suspected three things in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4482047#p4482047\">Lincolm vote post</a>. The unvote despite having perfectly (IMO) acceptable suspicions towards you at that time; the question (which I quoted) to Naomi\u2026the way it was asked wasn\u2019t singled out because the way was what it was. I only offer more suitable ways IMO to you as an example of what might not have caught my attention; and the helpless townie schtick which some people may not see as suspect\u2026.but I do.<br><br>5 \u2013 You said \u201cpre-emptive justification\u201d so I\u2019m working with the term \u201cjustification\u201d. Fine\u2026you aren\u2019t bothered with my vote and the associated suspicions. Your problem is with the fact I said weak town was not appealing to me and is best eliminated early in the game. I stand by that opinion. If someone I didn\u2019t consider weak town was making mistakes that led to valid suspicions (IMO) towards them I would be all for that person\u2019s lynch. Even if there were one or more \u201cweak town\u201d in the game. The fact the person I suspect also comes across as weak town (IMO) makes my vote on him doubly appealing to me. Fact remains\u2026I\u2019m not voting him because he is weak town, but that would make his potential mislynch a lot more palatable.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:75%\"></div><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4489288#p4489288\" class=\"postlink\">post 171</a>, vollkan wrote:</cite> <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4487603#p4487603\" class=\"postlink\">post 141</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite> 5 \u2013 Shouldn\u2019t everyone justify their votes?

You say that aggression is only a scumtell in the context of unproductive aggression, indicating that productive agression is completely townlike. Doesn't that seem to suggest the deciding factor here is the level of productivity? If this is true, one need only look at how productive a player is being to see if they are scum or not, as aggression would be completely irrelevant. Why do you focus on and call me out for aggressive play if it has no bearing on alignment?"}

Unvoting scum will <span class=\"noboldsig\">never</span> earn you townpoints in my eyes. While it's true that scum does not want to be on a town wagon that gets pushed till lynch, there are other reasons to want to leave a wagon. For instance, not wanting to lynch your townreads. Or finding someone who you think is more likely to be scum. There's a pattern here if you can see it. Scum players are more influenced by appearances in their decision-making while town players are more interested in scumhunting, and would never allow appearances to dissuade their conviction. You're guilty of the former. In Spades. <span class=\"noboldsig\">FOS</span> Naomi.<br><br>Let's make this simpler, in a LyLo situation of you, Benmage, and myself who would you be voting for?"}

Everyone dreams of being an IC sometimes right?<br><br>I get that you're confused and all but surely you must understand the implications of not securing enough votes for a lynch. The abridged version goes something like, it may look permissible to no lynch because players die at a slower rate, but those deaths are chosen by scum, so the benefit is not as good as one may think. Yes you may end up mislynching, but the mislynch holds more information than a no lynch does (basically D2 blind with one less person instead of two people down with a whole load of information). <br><br>If looking at 12 players feels overwhelming, you might do well to narrow your scope. At this late in the day you can probably rule out some players as unlikely to be lynched even if they do look scummy, just by nature of them not having votes on their slot and the logistical difficulties of convincing 6 other players to vote for them in a 28 hour time frame. However, that's quite alright because scum come in groups! Even if you can't lynch someone now you'll have other opportunities later in the game.<br><br>Start by eliminating choices that have no votes. In my opinion it'd be difficult to lynch anyone besides implosion, Benmage, TML, MonkeyMan, or myself, presently. Take a look at those 5 slots and tell me what you think."}

Not even the content, just the way that it's phrased. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My RVS-y vote on Edorist has served its purpose: unvote<br><br>I actually find Edorist to be quite town at this point. He's posting informative posts and trying to catch scum. \"self-voting\" isn't really a scumtell; I just made it up to get the game moving.</div></blockquote><br>And here's where the fun starts. This is really over-explanatory, which as scooby pointed out a while ago, is a scummy trait. It explains the RVS vote being disingenuous... but at the same time kind of compounds the issue. It feels like a really played-out tactic - like he's going \"oh look at me, i did something to elicit reactions!\" Then he explains what he did and why he stopped it in about four different ways within two lines...<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Scooby's case on Librarian is very weak, but it's also a town tell. Why would scum try and create a wagon out of thin air when there's much easier going elsewhere?</div></blockquote><br>Another disingenuous point. Many people (i think) pointed out why it's a terrible point. Doesn't feel like actual contribution, feels like contribution for the sake of contribution. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, Vollkan's prob-town. I asked for his meta because I wanted to see if his points system was an overall playstyle or just a townie playstyle. From the games I looked it, it seems like it's a towny playstyle. Now, he could be throwing us for the loop and exploiting his meta, but I doubt that. Independently of his meta and that specific playstyle, I still think he's been scumhunting actively and contributing.</div></blockquote><br>Once again, not only overly explanatory, but also a self-insistent \"Look at me, i'm doing things\" kind of attitude. This tendency to want to explain his own actions is scummy (although i may have to meta on that). <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23706&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=12165&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">In the first game that I looked at (Bub is town),</a> he does do this - but only when asked. He doesn't explain his actions in the way that he does in this game without being asked. For instance, in post 71 of the linked game, he explains his own actions - but in response to someone. Explaining his actions without being asked is a strong indicator that one of his primary concerns is what others think of his contributions. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1. Because people have in the past.<br><br>2. Why would he randomly try and start a wagon on a scumbud who was under no suspicion? His case on TML makes no sense from a scum perspective.</div></blockquote><br>He continues hammering in this point... without any reasoning. He just says that it makes no sense, and asks why he would do it... and when he's given answers as to why it would happen, he ignores them. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think KJ's just bad town. Keep in mind that playing poorly does not necessarily imply scum. If anything, I think his vote on me implies that he is town. I don't really see a reason for scum to reach like that for a vote on a player who has no further suspicion on them.</div></blockquote><br>The whole \"the guy who's voting me is bad town\" thing feels <span style=\"font-style: italic\">so</span> played-out here. It's terrible reasoning, and it feels like he's just kind of weakly pleading to kj to unvote him. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Nothing's really changed with my reads.

I'll will not lynch Killjester.</div></blockquote><br>\"I'd be okay with bussing but... yeah, i'd rather not.\"<br>Yeah. I mean, this post also makes sense with him as town, but it makes a lot of sense with him as scum. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Vote: Lincolm<br><br>That Benmage wagon really looks like a counter wagon to me.</div></blockquote><br>That benmage wagon... which conveniently enough contained Monkey, Naomi and Lincolm. In other words... easy fodder. In other words... he wanted easy people to push on and an easy excuse to push on them without having to do actual scumhunting work.<br><br>So yeah. Lots of points against him, and nothing whatsoever that I see as a towntell. *yawn*."}

The whole over-explanatory thing goes from word-level to paragraph-organizational level. Words like \"RVS-y,\" the fact that he put \"self-voting\" in quotes... things like that make it feel like he's trying too hard. Then on the sentence level, he lacks concision. In my experience, a lack of concision in situations where concision would be much more appropriate is a scumtell. Bub has no concision here - he re-explains the same things three times. Furthermore, what he's actually saying is just stupid. The whole \"The point of my RVS vote was to get the game moving\" thing makes much, much more sense as scum than as town. I say this because bub-town would really have almost no motivation to, unasked, explain this. bub-scum would - that is, he would want to appear to have been protown."}

Subject to what I say below in 2), I do only have one non-null read.<br>2) The point I was trying to get across in 509 was simply that \"null\" doesn't equal \"no opinion\".  As in, not finding somebody's play scummy is different from not having an opinion.  If this seems obvious, the reason I raise it is just that I find people often treat \"null read\" similarly to how they'd treat \"I haven't read that player's posts\"<br>3) Some background, in case it helps.  A scum/town-tell is an action that makes it more likely that a player is scum/town.  In practical application of this, my <span style=\"font-style: italic\">operating</span> definition of a scumtell is: \"Any action that a town player would not reasonably take in the circumstances\".  My <span style=\"font-style: italic\">operating</span> definition of a towntell is: \"Any action that a scum player would not reasonably take in the circumstances.\"  Now, at first glance, that seems symmetrical.  However, the range of actions that town could reasonably do is actually MUCH narrower than the range of actions that scum could reasonably do.  The reason for this is that whereas town's sole motivation should be \"catching scum\", scum have at least three motivations: lynching town, self-preservation, and confusion."}

Really the only post of his that gives me any townvibes is 390, and i can see it coming from scum. <br><br>I reread benmage and it solidified him as town, at least to an extent.

Two reasons:<br>1) The propositions that KJ draws are basically strawmen.  This is because Edo's 48 was clearly not denying Imp's scumminess, or undermining his declared read, but simply wanted to replace an uncertain vote with his more definite one.<br>2) Conclusion is expressed with hyperbolic language, inflating the point (\"Edosurist must be scum\"), which is really only exacerbated by 54<br><br>109: Partly this is a benefit of hindsight thing, but <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scooby+5</span>.  In 108, Scooby declares a scumread on Monkeyman for imp's \"something definitive\" point and for putting somebody at L-2 for BS reasons.  However, in 109, he goes on to vote TML for the comparatively weak tell of \"overexplaining himself\", which isn't even factually borne out in the examples he cites, and for *shock* asking questions.  When he's questioned on this, 114 just provides a generic theory explanation of \" Scum always over explain their actions because they need extra validation.\"<br><br>208: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Edo+7</span> I got stuck on this Edo post for a while.  It bothered me, but I couldn't pinpoint why.  I'm going to quote it here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4493462#p4493462\" class=\"postlink\">post 208</a>, Edosurist wrote:</cite>Popping in here to address the post above Vote Count 1.6<br>Yeah, Wam. Either you've been reading that incorrectly, or if you're intentionally trying to mislead the town.<br>MonkeyMan, it actually wasn't that clear. I had to reread that sentence when I first read it. I believe you were trying to say<br>\"Yeah, I don't like how scooby doesn't want to lynch lurkers, but he built half of a case on TML about the way TML asked questions to certain people about another person\"</div></blockquote><br>I think it was the reference to Wam which says \"if you're intentionally trying to mislead the town\" which initially set me off - in that, with the benefit of hindsight, it is phrased weirdly to address wam and postulate \"if [he is] intentionally trying to mislead the town\", not least because \"the town\" sounds like a third party to them.  I'm not going so far as to call it a scumslip or anything so dramatic at this point.<br>However, beyond that the post itself does not make any sense, because Edo goes on to explain MM's actions and admits \" it actually wasn't that clear\".  In which case, why even bother with asking wam whether he was \"intentionally trying to mislead the town\"?<br>In short, there's serious cognitive dissonance going on. I cannot see how a player who genuinely saw MM's post as confusing would accuse a player of intentionally trying to mislead the town. That's an independent, non-relational, tell - but, relationally, the strength of the tell is increased by the fact that wam is scum (because that would explain why the idea of wam deliberately misleading would even occur to edo)<br>295: I considered whether this was a relational tell against Benmage, but it's equally possible that it's Monkey setting up wagoning on a potential town wagonee as it is that it's Monkey distancing (attacking, in very strong language, without voting)<br>365: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Edo+3</span> NT had made it pretty damn obvious that she was a PR with information on Wam.  Here, Edo pressures NT to \"vote\" wam, despite everybody not having chimed in.  <br>374: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ben+7</span> THe reason for these points is that, at this time, Ben would be the final scum member (allowing for wam's imminent death).  I don't think it likely that town's mind would so quickly turn to self-preservation by pointing out that this \"confirms\" himself (which, as an aside, it doesn't).  It reads more likely as scum trying to salvage a terrible situation.  Further, and what brnigs this to 7, this would provide one explanation for the N2 lincolm kill (Benscum wanting to kill lincolmtown both to eliminate somebody who might get treated as semi-confirmed AND to give credence to Benscum's own \"I'm cleared!\" BS),<br>390: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scooby+5</span> Attempts to delay wam's lynch, based on the fairly ridiculous implicit assumption that mafia being able to perform two actions in a night is absurd whereas a double-targeting neighbouriser is okay.<br><br>====================<br>With all that done:<br><br><table style=\"border:1px solid black; \"><th class=\"bbtableheader\">Player</th><th class=\"bbtableheader\">Score</th><br><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">scooby</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">60</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">Benmage</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">57</td></tr> <tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">killerjester</span></td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">64</span></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">Edosurist</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">60</td></tr></table>"}
