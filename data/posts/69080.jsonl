Well, in a way. I think Kamelot is more likely to be scum than you, and the argument for it implies you to be town, the interaction that makes her scummy makes no sense if you are scum as well (from a player of her stature). I'm happy to be proven wrong, but as of now I'm assuming you are town and Kamelot is scum, because of her overeager and very understanding defense of you (while a town would be at least somewhat worried about defending a scum by accident, have some reserve).", "time": "Wed Nov 09, 2016 9:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69080&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "69080"}

I agreed with the reasoning that Gamma copying a blank looked scummy so I voted him. <br>\n<br>\nI disagree with you wrt 98. If I just lynch whoever is most suspicious to me, I miss out on the opportunity to hear from players who haven't cast legitimate suspicions. These players might be scum and by letting them slide through D1 town loses info that could be useful later. Like I said in 98 though, I respect that some people disagree with me on this.<br>\n<br>\nIf such information was present I skipped over it because I felt I was being baselessly attacked and was focused on resisting RK. I drafted a post last night before bed about Gamma but waited to post it until after more people had chipped in. I'll post it soon, with a pedit. Will read again and decide on mykonian but I like him so far. That may be because he was already on RK when she attacked me though.

In short, buddying as a choice of tell is in my estimation of RK as a player, how experienced she is, etc. It makes sense from someone like her to jump in the breach for an attacked player slightly too eagerly. <br>\n2. Null, must admit, this being a newbie game kind of messes with me. You get all sorts. I've been way more lenient with Gamma for example than I would be with most people I'd play with. He's ehm, what do you call it in English. Dutch would be \"aangeschoten wild\". He got beaten up a bit at the start, that might have flustered him a bit, the wolves are looking at him and he's stumbling from one situation to the next. Even if RK ends up flipping scum, there's no way that that won't cling to him somehow, pack mentality is really sad in that way, he's shown a weakness this game. <br>\n3. Well I'm not voting him for a reason. Again, you get all sorts. I am rather annoyed by it though. You join, you play the game.

He's ehm, what do you call it in English. Dutch would be \"aangeschoten wild\". He got beaten up a bit at the start, that might have flustered him a bit, the wolves are looking at him and he's stumbling from one situation to the next.

Here, I don't really get that feel. I get where you come from, but what's the cool term nowadays? NAI? It feels playstyle based rather than allignment, but we can see how that develops.

You somehow have to discern town lynchbait from scum lynchbait. As for the association, right now, you could see it in there, it's a judgement call if you feel RK is a bit too far on Gamma's side and lets go of some suspicion that they might be scum after all altogether. However, if there's a flip, that crystallizes it, at that point, yes, I think it's rather obvious. That is not a scum-scum interaction from a solid, but newer player on MS. RK doesn't strike me as a particulary gambitty player, hence solid. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think Joshz has done an OK job at playing this game and presenting opinions so I don't really know if I can agree with this.

Calling him out only made him stubborn. For me, if I were scum, I'd love to get away with the position he currently is in, and he's getting away with it.

Sarcasm in argumentation is nearly always a sign that the user checked out of the conversation. Be that because of frustration or because there's not actually an argument. It's a sign of saying something where they don't want to say anything constructive. Road isn't frustrated here, but can't continue the argumentation that I don't know her well enough to read buddying into a post of hers. <br>\n<br>\nThe second part, beyond what it actually says, follows up similarly. Bro again could signify frustration, but that's really not going on. It's depreciatory, where part of the zing of her defense has to come from attacking person making the argument against her (me). It's not ad hom, but has the same flavour. She feels that a defense has to be either retaliatory or that her defense requires the attacker to look weaker. Given that her wagon isn't going anywhere, I'd say she posted it with a motive.", "time": "Thu Nov 10, 2016 4:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69080&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "69080"}

I've seen people like Maria before and the response tends to come out to some extend in every game.<br>\n<br>\nIt's a habit of mine (because I believe it's right) to start scumhunting asap, nearly every game I have is out of the RVS by the end of page 2. Not because I dislike the RVS alone, but also because I think the start of the game, and lylo, are the times the scum are most insecure, and that's something I want to exploit. So the gates open, and you hit the floor running, you keep up the pace so scum have to catch up constantly. At some point the game settles and then scum have a feel for where it will go, which people they need to play, who are lynch targets, etc and at some point you try to sift through the dust you've thrown up and hope one or two cases actually stuck. <br>\n<br>\nNow this means two things. One, the first cases are flimsy. Basically they are on wording or something like that. It's not quite creating something out of thin air, but it's not far off either. 95% of the time in mafia games you'll play with way more informations and standard for cases will be way better than what you can make in the first couple of pages. So it never looks all that great, this isn't the first and won't be the last game where in the first couple of pages I'm a controversial person (depends on the town if more or less than half the people go with me, or against me). It doesn't mean they are wrong per s&#233;, but you do have less to work with. Second, town as well, is not really used to the game starting off like that. Some people will balk and feel it's all going too quickly. <br>\n<br>\nNow Maria strikes me as somewhat of a thoughtful player, and in that case I might be pushing her comfort zone more than actually triggering a scumread if she thinks about it. She was indeed reserved, and that got her towncred, and it indeed might very well mean she's my blind spot scum, but just as likely it's her mentality towards the game. She would not be the first that puts the breaks on, then again, she could indeed be scum who talked plenty but tried to stay reasonable. Either way, it's not as obvious as you think it is and as such I'd love to see more from Maria, leave her for a day or two. There's plenty of better lynches out there (transcend, josh, jordan).", "time": "Mon Nov 14, 2016 2:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69080&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "69080"}

Starting discussion is not a scum habit. And  that's what an experienced player like you or ep would know and why he would generate discussion. And really, nothing he posted was that great. Jordan is exactly who scum would target (provided he isn't scum himself).  His activity combined with his posts have concerned me. He has it set up so no matter who we lynch he gets off scott free and that bothers me. I didn't worry about him either - i had him as my strongest town read.

You both have had enough time and posts to convince me you're town and I don't see it, so between you two is where my vote will stay until either 1.) someone else does something I find blatantly scummy or 2.) I am led to believe by the both of you are both town<br>\n<br>\nKraska- There have been a few people who have voiced that they would be okay with lynching me or that they want to, but if they aren't going to vote me or present a case I'm not going to get upset by it. A weak vote will not illicit a strong response from me, and it seems like a lot of people are just unsure about me. I'm not going to reread 30+ pages to verify this, but I'm pretty sure most of the people who have voiced that they were thinking about lynching me also stated they would rather lynch someone else instead. There's probably only been like 2-3 posts where someone has said they want to lynch me as their highest/only priority right now,", "time": "Tue Nov 15, 2016 11:42 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69080&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "69080"}

Now, Gamma. I want you to answer me this. If you claim that I was being opportunistic on the vote that I ended up influencing on, what was the reason for me to question Maria in her motives that led up to her questioning of my vote on you? Furthermore, I would like you to explain how come you didn't seem to think Josh was the one being opportunistic, as he was the one who originally switched his vote after the confrontation between Maria and I on our vote on you. <br>\n<br>\nGamma, now that you have read this, there is no way that you can possibly believe that I was trying to take advantage of the fact that the person who I was trying to get to vote you, voted you. As I was the reason he most likely decided to switch anyway. It is also key to point out that Josh said he would vote you if there was more than 2 people voting you, he'd switch his vote to you. Which in turn, I ended up unvoting, leaving one vote on you. He then seemed to contradict himself and vote you regardless of his past motion. How come you did not find this suspect coming from him?

What's happened in the last couple of days is a slow slide to Gamma becoming the default lynch, and otherwise people are merrily talking amongst themselves.

Say you are town and Gamma is town, then scum for one can't really be bothered, either of you is a mislynch and a mislynch in waiting.

RKs vote on gamma was godawful, they weren't there, then after the claim/my unvote, she decides to have a go. I could see MTD/maria as scum/scum gambitting, but really he's closer to the townreads than the scumreads from this.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">confirm vote RK</div>", "time": "Thu Nov 24, 2016 3:03 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69080&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "69080"}

This is how you don't get lynched: You limit your posts, but make them semi long, build up every point with a story, you don't step on peoples toes (omgus feelings are very real) so you pick your spots and don't move too quickly lest you startle someone, and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">at all points you make sure you make sense</div>. Other people are crazy enough. People who post lots, get attention, get into arguments, and where smoke is is fire, people flock to that. So you limit arguing, by being always the voice of reason, taking your time to get a good answer, you don't get into drawn out arguments and you look like someone who takes their time scumhunting and making sense out of it all. Nobody can disagree with you after all. <br>\n<br>\nNow this is all fine, and kind of obvious really. Scum love being in that position. If I could get away with it, I'd play scum that way, and in my earlier days I have. As town however, it gets muddled. You shouldn't care about not getting mislynched, and try to find scum with your fellow townies, but who really does that? It's too fun to be in the game, getting lynched kind of sucks esspecially when people the day after say you were just bad town (while they couldn't read you), and disregard your reads and hard work. It's really tempting to become that \"good player\", who never gets lynched, and comes with a thoughtful playstyle. Sit there quietly and play the game for a while. Everybody would praise you, nobody remembers the person who gets lynched d1 or d2, while everybody still reads along how you finish the game.<br>\n<br>\nThis is what makes Maria, without previous knowledge, a person I have to worry about. For one, they are hard to lynch, tend to have most obvious cases covered, so you get to the outlandish stuff that's hard to sell on people. The second, if they are town, they commit a host of tells anyway that I like to use, while otoh have the air of being dependable and having to be played around. It's hard to turn that positive initial read into a scumread, tends to need quite a bit of evidence. People like her tend to trip me up because I know there's town that like to play that way, and it makes sense they would want to, even though I believe it to be an ideal scum hiding place. <br>\n<br>\nCalling her reserved and reasonable then, is double. It could be her playstyle, or it could be a way of measured passivity. Now there were some other tells she committed that I\"m slightly miffed about didn't speak up more about back then, but otherwise I'm rather glad I don't have to figure her out.

It's quite easy to mess up a natural way to get on the wagon. For example, MTD scum, when asked to come back onto Ssbm would have worried about that, I believe. He didn't.
