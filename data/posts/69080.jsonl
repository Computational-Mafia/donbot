Well, in a way. I think Kamelot is more likely to be scum than you, and the argument for it implies you to be town, the interaction that makes her scummy makes no sense if you are scum as well (from a player of her stature). I'm happy to be proven wrong, but as of now I'm assuming you are town and Kamelot is scum, because of her overeager and very understanding defense of you (while a town would be at least somewhat worried about defending a scum by accident, have some reserve)."}

At this point in my post if you're still reading you probably think I'm an idiot and that's OK, because in the next 11+ days the \"towniest\" person will change and this will be irrelevant.

I agreed with the reasoning that Gamma copying a blank looked scummy so I voted him. <br><br>I disagree with you wrt 98. If I just lynch whoever is most suspicious to me, I miss out on the opportunity to hear from players who haven't cast legitimate suspicions. These players might be scum and by letting them slide through D1 town loses info that could be useful later. Like I said in 98 though, I respect that some people disagree with me on this.<br><br>If such information was present I skipped over it because I felt I was being baselessly attacked and was focused on resisting RK. I drafted a post last night before bed about Gamma but waited to post it until after more people had chipped in. I'll post it soon, with a pedit. Will read again and decide on mykonian but I like him so far. That may be because he was already on RK when she attacked me though.

In short, buddying as a choice of tell is in my estimation of RK as a player, how experienced she is, etc. It makes sense from someone like her to jump in the breach for an attacked player slightly too eagerly. <br>2. Null, must admit, this being a newbie game kind of messes with me. You get all sorts. I've been way more lenient with Gamma for example than I would be with most people I'd play with. He's ehm, what do you call it in English. Dutch would be \"aangeschoten wild\". He got beaten up a bit at the start, that might have flustered him a bit, the wolves are looking at him and he's stumbling from one situation to the next. Even if RK ends up flipping scum, there's no way that that won't cling to him somehow, pack mentality is really sad in that way, he's shown a weakness this game. <br>3. Well I'm not voting him for a reason. Again, you get all sorts. I am rather annoyed by it though. You join, you play the game. We used to have a player who did the same and it's rather frustrating to play with."}

Here, I don't really get that feel. I get where you come from, but what's the cool term nowadays? NAI? It feels playstyle based rather than allignment, but we can see how that develops. Currently doesn't ring any alarms for me. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>i mean i agree that gamma has shown himself as a lynchbaity and awkward player but that's just who he is regardless of alignment. don't really see why that's a reason to be lenient. don't get the bit about RK, are you saying that you think RK/gamma associatives are obvious?</div></blockquote> Eh, if you know he's a bit lynchbaity, you adjust the calibration, imo. You somehow have to discern town lynchbait from scum lynchbait. As for the association, right now, you could see it in there, it's a judgement call if you feel RK is a bit too far on Gamma's side and lets go of some suspicion that they might be scum after all altogether. However, if there's a flip, that crystallizes it, at that point, yes, I think it's rather obvious. That is not a scum-scum interaction from a solid, but newer player on MS. RK doesn't strike me as a particulary gambitty player, hence solid. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think Joshz has done an OK job at playing this game and presenting opinions so I don't really know if I can agree with this. If you're worried about a lack of engagement though, why not ask questions or get reads from him? From what I remember you pretty much went straight to calling him out rather than asking him questions, which looks to me more like looking for a scapegoat than frustration over a playstyle.</div></blockquote><br><br>I've kicked up my share of dust, didn't change his engagement. Calling him out only made him stubborn. For me, if I were scum, I'd love to get away with the position he currently is in, and he's getting away with it. So it's not just frustration, it's also that if he's scum, I want him out in the open."}

Bro again could signify frustration, but that's really not going on. It's depreciatory, where part of the zing of her defense has to come from attacking person making the argument against her (me). It's not ad hom, but has the same flavour. She feels that a defense has to be either retaliatory or that her defense requires the attacker to look weaker. Given that her wagon isn't going anywhere, I'd say she posted it with a motive."}

I've seen people like Maria before and the response tends to come out to some extend in every game.<br><br>It's a habit of mine (because I believe it's right) to start scumhunting asap, nearly every game I have is out of the RVS by the end of page 2. Not because I dislike the RVS alone, but also because I think the start of the game, and lylo, are the times the scum are most insecure, and that's something I want to exploit. So the gates open, and you hit the floor running, you keep up the pace so scum have to catch up constantly. At some point the game settles and then scum have a feel for where it will go, which people they need to play, who are lynch targets, etc and at some point you try to sift through the dust you've thrown up and hope one or two cases actually stuck. <br><br>Now this means two things. One, the first cases are flimsy. Basically they are on wording or something like that. It's not quite creating something out of thin air, but it's not far off either. 95% of the time in mafia games you'll play with way more informations and standard for cases will be way better than what you can make in the first couple of pages. So it never looks all that great, this isn't the first and won't be the last game where in the first couple of pages I'm a controversial person (depends on the town if more or less than half the people go with me, or against me). It doesn't mean they are wrong per s\u00e9, but you do have less to work with. Second, town as well, is not really used to the game starting off like that. Some people will balk and feel it's all going too quickly. <br><br>Now Maria strikes me as somewhat of a thoughtful player, and in that case I might be pushing her comfort zone more than actually triggering a scumread if she thinks about it. She was indeed reserved, and that got her towncred, and it indeed might very well mean she's my blind spot scum, but just as likely it's her mentality towards the game. She would not be the first that puts the breaks on, then again, she could indeed be scum who talked plenty but tried to stay reasonable. Either way, it's not as obvious as you think it is and as such I'd love to see more from Maria, leave her for a day or two. There's plenty of better lynches out there (transcend, josh, jordan)."}

Starting discussion is not a scum habit. And  that's what an experienced player like you or ep would know and why he would generate discussion. And really, nothing he posted was that great. Jordan is exactly who scum would target (provided he isn't scum himself).  His activity combined with his posts have concerned me. He has it set up so no matter who we lynch he gets off scott free and that bothers me. I didn't worry about him either - i had him as my strongest town read. And what I've learned is that your strongest town reads are the ones that can lose you the game if you're wrong, so I went back, looked at ep, and realized he could very well be scum."}

How do you think scum reads work?  You find the person you think most likely scum and you vote them.  MTD and Jordan both might be scum. Everyone might be scum. There's no point following through if I decide I don't have enough basis for an argument. And in what way am I completely focusing on myko? I already changed my vote off of myko, to you. Taking shots at a lot of people prevents any scum from becoming \"lock town\" and winning the game while no one's the wiser, and I'm posting a lot of what I am because there's a lot of newer people here that I want to still win for town if I die. Jordan is probably the best example, and I've explained why I think he's the obvious scum push. I don't want scum transcend or scum you or scum myko or scum whatever other experienced player to walk all over newbies because form when I've played tos with newer players in the lobby thst tends to be what happens. I completely agree, I prefer playing with more experienced people, but every site has its own set of everything and I'm still adapting to this site. And to address the question directly: 75% =/=  HAS."}

You're saying it's opportunistic in which way? Let me explain to you in a way that not only will you know that you're wrong, everyone will know you haven't been reading the game for coming to this conclusion. <br><br>You imply that my vote is opportunistic. Which means I'm taking advantage of the fact that others are voting you, correct? Now, if we use this logic, there are only 2 other people that are voting you.

As you can see from this post, I voted you way before he did. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8511454#p8511454\" class=\"postlink\">post 648</a>, gerryoat wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8510404#p8510404\" class=\"postlink\">post 637</a>, Joshz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8509914#p8509914\" class=\"postlink\">post 631</a>, gerryoat wrote:</cite>I didn't know some many people were into pokemon here, I'm excited for the new gen nerfs and buffs.

Now, Gamma. I want you to answer me this. If you claim that I was being opportunistic on the vote that I ended up influencing on, what was the reason for me to question Maria in her motives that led up to her questioning of my vote on you? Furthermore, I would like you to explain how come you didn't seem to think Josh was the one being opportunistic, as he was the one who originally switched his vote after the confrontation between Maria and I on our vote on you. <br><br>Gamma, now that you have read this, there is no way that you can possibly believe that I was trying to take advantage of the fact that the person who I was trying to get to vote you, voted you. As I was the reason he most likely decided to switch anyway. It is also key to point out that Josh said he would vote you if there was more than 2 people voting you, he'd switch his vote to you. Which in turn, I ended up unvoting, leaving one vote on you. He then seemed to contradict himself and vote you regardless of his past motion. How come you did not find this suspect coming from him? It seemed to fly over your head, and you seemingly decided to target me instead."}

Giga, EP, Road, MTD aren't really here, Maria and Transcend pretty much lost steam, while Josh and Kraska never really had any drive to their posts. It's pretty sad that the only person who seems to have more intent as the game nears the end of the day is Gerry. What's happened in the last couple of days is a slow slide to Gamma becoming the default lynch, and otherwise people are merrily talking amongst themselves. At this rate, this is going to be a deadline lynch on Gamma, and even if you are happy with that, you should put your vote where your mouth is. If you don't want it, like me, now'd be the time to act.<br><br>So Im asking you again, how shit do Jordan's votes have to be for you to consider him, even if you disregard his lurking? He doesn't have all that many votes, you can easily check them."}

This is how you don't get lynched: You limit your posts, but make them semi long, build up every point with a story, you don't step on peoples toes (omgus feelings are very real) so you pick your spots and don't move too quickly lest you startle someone, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at all points you make sure you make sense</span>. Other people are crazy enough. People who post lots, get attention, get into arguments, and where smoke is is fire, people flock to that. So you limit arguing, by being always the voice of reason, taking your time to get a good answer, you don't get into drawn out arguments and you look like someone who takes their time scumhunting and making sense out of it all. Nobody can disagree with you after all. <br><br>Now this is all fine, and kind of obvious really. Scum love being in that position. If I could get away with it, I'd play scum that way, and in my earlier days I have. As town however, it gets muddled. You shouldn't care about not getting mislynched, and try to find scum with your fellow townies, but who really does that? It's too fun to be in the game, getting lynched kind of sucks esspecially when people the day after say you were just bad town (while they couldn't read you), and disregard your reads and hard work. It's really tempting to become that \"good player\", who never gets lynched, and comes with a thoughtful playstyle. Sit there quietly and play the game for a while. Everybody would praise you, nobody remembers the person who gets lynched d1 or d2, while everybody still reads along how you finish the game.<br><br>This is what makes Maria, without previous knowledge, a person I have to worry about. For one, they are hard to lynch, tend to have most obvious cases covered, so you get to the outlandish stuff that's hard to sell on people. The second, if they are town, they commit a host of tells anyway that I like to use, while otoh have the air of being dependable and having to be played around. It's hard to turn that positive initial read into a scumread, tends to need quite a bit of evidence. People like her tend to trip me up because I know there's town that like to play that way, and it makes sense they would want to, even though I believe it to be an ideal scum hiding place. <br><br>Calling her reserved and reasonable then, is double. It could be her playstyle, or it could be a way of measured passivity. Now there were some other tells she committed that I\"m slightly miffed about didn't speak up more about back then, but otherwise I'm rather glad I don't have to figure her out. People like Maria are a pain.<br><br><br>p-edit goddamnit people you posted a page in that time."}

Gamma and SSBM wagons formed completely differently. SSBM's formed within little over a page, and the first half of that wagon looks very good, either through how they got on, or their interactions with Maria. It's quite easy to mess up a natural way to get on the wagon. For example, MTD scum, when asked to come back onto Ssbm would have worried about that, I believe. He didn't. Up till the very end of that that wagon looks very town. Which is weird, I admit. <br><br>But do a simple analysis of the wagon at the time of lynch, and the fact that some people moved while others sat at the same vote for the majority of the day gets ignored, and you get a flat picture. Try to get the scum to be evenly spread (a flawed premise anyway), and you end up with a mess."}
