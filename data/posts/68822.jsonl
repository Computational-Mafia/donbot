It should actually be called Arbitrary Voting Stage. An arbitrary vote is a vote that may or may not have a reason behind it, and that therefore can be analysed. Arbitrary votes aren't great for starting discussion, but they can work. IAmInnocent and goodmorning placed arbitrary votes.<br><br>A random vote, on the other hand, does not have a reason behind its target at all. It is verifiable for everyone that it was placed on a random player. Knowing that there isn't a reasoning, they are less likely to start discussion. Hoopla used dice tags, and then voted based on her result. That's a random vote, and intrinsically anti-town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>BlackVoid wrote:</cite>By your theory, not voting at all is just as bad. Any reason you didn't comment on my and TwoFace's lack of vote?</div></blockquote>Someone who posts strong comments, but doesn't vote, does far more to get discussion started then someone who arbitrarily votes, without commenting at all. You two at least posted comments that others could react to. The only thing people could react to in Hoopla's post was the fact that there was nothing to react to."}

That said, I like your tone and for page five I've seen worst cases.  <br><br>I don't want to step on Hoopla's toes because gambits are the name of her game.  I find her generally hard to get a read on in the early game so I tend to sort her town and let her out herself as scum as the game draws on.  It helps that I value her as an extremely strong town player and would really like to tag team on this game if she is indeed town.  Because of this I found Rask's initial case and vote on Hoopla weak, but most of it could be down to a lack of experience with her which could be understandable.  However, Rask's vote remains despite Hoopla's reasonable responses to his points.  <br><br>I like BBT more for scum at this point.  He came in with a vote on Rask to start a wagon, there were already two other players with two votes at the time Blackvoid and gm.  It seems to be an attempt to sort Rask which comes quick and with no further elaboration.  I would have expected more considering the history they both speak to.  Feels like he started the wagon then panicked a little when it took off.  I also remember BBTScum being very no nonsense cutting to the heart of the matter, were as townBBT being more open.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote: BBT</span><br><br>Rask - What do you think of BBT now?

Great job everyone!<br><br>More and more these days, I'm starting to believe that the first opening wagon that gets to L-1 or L-2 tends to be town a lot more often than random. Typically the less information in the game and the sooner it happens increases the likelihood of it being town. Why I think this is a trend is that at the beginning of the game any vote can be justified and there's no real information to go on, so there is more incentive for scum to plump existing wagons on town rather than their buddies. There's not really any incentive to distance heavily at the start of the game, because there's no punishment or scrutiny for voting town. Sure, scum still will vote each other from time to time, but there are more barriers along the way in order to achieve a L-1 or L-2 wagon on scum early, whereas when a town wagon emerges there's no hidden opposition ignoring it/voting it elsewhere -- everyone is considering it earnestly, as such, they tend to balloon quicker than scums. <br><br>To lynch scum, you need a lot of town zeroing in on the same wavelength or scum helping you. It's very hard to produce that perfect storm of town hivemindedness without genuine information that many players can agree on. And scum help is less likely early in the game, as they don't feel under pressure to distance themselves from each other -- convincing information pressures scum to distance. The reason for Raskol's wagon was decent, but I don't think scum helps us on this wagon very often (if Raskol is scum) and I don't think the reason is good enough to get five townies to vote him that often. It's easier combinatorially to assume Raskol is town and that scum have aided this wagon.<br><br>I don't have enough data to say for sure how pronounced this pattern is, but I think it exists and have been investigating it recently.

He came in with a vote on Rask to start a wagon, there were already two other players with two votes at the time Blackvoid and gm.  It seems to be an attempt to sort Rask which comes quick and with no further elaboration.  I would have expected more considering the history they both speak to.  Feels like he started the wagon then panicked a little when it took off.  I also remember BBTScum being very no nonsense cutting to the heart of the matter, were as townBBT being more open.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote: BBT</span><br><br>Rask - What do you think of BBT now?  Is my meta outdated?</div></blockquote><br>Lol. I don't have enough content to read BBT as of yet here, so your conclusion could actually be right, but for all the wrong reasons.<br>I'm pretty sure he isn't incompetent as to join a clearly growing wagon and not expect it to continue growing, or to \"panic\" from the l-2 and have that justify his next actions... I think your meta is really bad here. <br>From what I remember from my research BBT has no fear hardpushing mislynches, him at the forefront, no fucks given*. So to imagine him as an innocent scum babe not knowing what he was getting into and then overreacting/panicking from something like this doesn't fit at all.<br><br>If BBT is scum who actually wanted to lynch me, he wouldn't join the early wagon like this for the reason of \"wanting to get a wagon going\", but instead have built up a serious case and powerpushed it. Probably near mid-end of day as well for more likely results. He knows how to push, with or without case, so he wouldn't half-ass something he wants to get done; saying you vote for the sake of getting a wagon going early would inherently undermine that goal. <br><br>If he's scum his intentions would have been different than that and more sophisticated. The better theory is; he, as scum saw an opportunity there to join that early wagon, expect pressure and me to towntell and then the chance to be one of the first to call me town and then try to work with me, and get me onside against the others who have voted me. He would know I'd fight strongly against the lynch and give the opportunity that a turn like that would be plausible. In other words, the complete opposite intention as what you proposed. He knows from experience I'd have a hard time trusting him so this would be a chance for him to try to have a rapport/buddying with me through this; that would be the actual incentive.<br><br>Which realistically is a still a conspiracy theory... I could easily see this play from his as town too, and I can't judge as of yet. His default playstyle is very low information especially earlygame and there's a \"it's just day 1 I'm not overthinking things yet\" element I remember seeing from town-him. With this wagon though and pressure, I do look forward to seeing more in-depth reasoning and information though. It would be easier to judge the turn if it was explained why he townread me and changed his mind. In any case I'll need some more time on this.<br><br>This aside, I haven't read up fully yet, but I myself hope to find something I do think is probably scum to vote as opposed to \"well I don't know he ISN'T scum\" paranoia.<br><br>*possibly not that different from his t game OOOH BURN *sizzle* <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\">"}

If I'm following correctly, you townread from specific meta but wonder (and initially assumed) BBT may or may not have read for the same reasons.

Okay, but I can't follow it without an explanation. The implication is this isn't random.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8439744#p8439744\">112</a> is after BBT voted and unvoted on me,gm says  \"I kind of want to vote Toffee now but I really don't want to forget about Victor.\". I think this justification is a little strange, I'm curious as to how the rvs post could warrant this suspicion over if you didn't like bbt's play around the wagon. Victor's 2nd post of the game is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8441130#p8441130\">162</a> which is afterwards so I have to conclude GM has a problem with the 1st.<br><br>Then after victor posted more, gm explained his read on both bbt and victor as scum for not doing anything, and later that victor was far worse than bbt. Mentioned this already but I don't see how you make that conclusion as I feel it's almost objective fact victor has been more involved.<br><br>Overall this isn't saying much other than it's a little weird and I'm having trouble understanding it, but this is worth exploring. I want to know what made the rvs-post bad and how victor has been \"far worse\" than BBT here. And to keep in mind, out all the things going on the in the game, this is the priority, or what GM would think is the most promising lead."}

For you to start the game with a dice vote and follow it up with a couple of whimsical posts feels to me like you went deliberately off meta in order to provoke reactions. That everyone basically ignored it, even when you went back to more serious posting, is extremely surprising to me.

Goodmorning, what was the reason that you responded the way you did? <br><br>---<br>@Jack: I guess in the case of BBT, it's not just his general inactivity. As you mentioned, you, me, and IAI also aren't posting much. Yet in the case of IAI, it's pretty clear that he's simply not been here. And with you and me, there is some actual content in the posts we do posts. Whereas BBT's four posts are all oneliners containing unexplained reads.<br>---<br><br>Overall, I find it difficult to develop good reads from the last 10 pages. There's a lot of talking going on, but a lot of it is arguing on things that don't seem all that relevant, nor all that alignement indicative. Finding clear arguments for why players hold certain scumreads in all that is like looking for a needle in a haystack, easy to glance over if you're not reading in depth (and since I was reading 10 pages under time pressure, I didn't get much chance at in depth reading). <br><br>I currently have rask (attempted scumhunting in combination with what seems like genuine uncertainty) and BlackVoid (asks good, enlightening questions) as town, and I townlean Hoopla (the way she's given well founded townreads limit her options if she's scum), but not much beyond that.<br><br>@BlackVoid: if you could expand a bit on the townreads you listed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443465#p8443465\" class=\"postlink\">post #278</a>, that would be great.

I started to get try and get away from that after I became known for it.  Biggest weakness I would say forcing myself to post.

On reflection I kinda do, and I suspect them more than I do Victor (who I'm still trying to work out).</div></blockquote>I had the time to read the opening 2 pages and participated there. Furthermore, there is a variety of players interacting, and most of the posts are easy to read. As a result, it's easy to analyse those pages.<br><br>By comparison, I read page 4-10 under time pressure. I couldn't post on friday, so I really wanted to make a post on saturday morning, but I also had to leave at a specific time. To make matters worse, a lot of the posts there, the interactions between Victor and you/goodmorning/TwoFace in particular, consisted of wallposts. As a result, I know that you were arguing, but I couldn't tell you what the actual arguments were. I don't have an opinion on the interaction at the moment. I'm planning to take BlackVoid reads on them, and reread those pages with those reads in mind. However, that takes time, which I don't currently have available.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8445453#p8445453\" class=\"postlink\">post 326</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>@Michel, did you want me to explain my Hoopla-read as well or just those five?<br><br>Now my turn.

As I mentioned to Hoopla, I'm planning to use your reads to get a better grasp on the game myself, but can't right now due to time constraints.<br><br>Sotty I remember as a generally strong player, though it's been some years since I last played with her. Her play in this game confirms that assessment. She's making solid posts, I can understand the reasoning for the suspicions she voices. Overall, she hasn't given me any reason to be suspicious of her, but I can easily see scum her fake the level of townieness she's currently displaying. I'm currently townreading her, but mainly because each individual player has a better chance of being town then being scum a priori. <br><br>Maria is a bit of a spamposter. Coming from chat mafia into games with 2 week deadlines will do that for you, I suppose. As for a read on her: I don't have much on her either, sorry. The game I played with her where she was town, she completely flipped out when she felt she got unfairly pressured. The game I played with her where she was scum, I mainly remember the way she argued that a townslip made by her scumpartner could have been an intentional slip, and managed to do this in such a way that the argument was completely ignored. Nothing of the sort has happened in this game yet, so the only thing I can tell you is that her tone here seems to be generally consistent with what I saw in her town game."}

Every post they read is new information, meaning they are likely to change opinion frequently. By contrast, scum knows who's scum. Every thought they give on someone's scummyness is fake. Believably faking changing your mind is far more difficult to do than faking consistent reads. So scum is not as likely to frequently change their mind as town is.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, why did you choose GM to ISO?</div></blockquote>That was the bandwagon Hoopla and Sotty abandoned to vote rask."}

Maria's response isn't usual if you compare to most players but not really out of line with her usual omgusy/reactive style.<br>It's at this point still possible one of my townreads will do something to make me reconsider them, cloud I'm fading a bit on and furthermore IAI isn't even ingame.<br><br>I'm still not entirely sure BBT is scum even if sotty is. Problem is that individually, if you throw out associations he's more null than a scumread to me.</div></blockquote><br>I do think that BBT's argument that MariaR showed up to complain about the Rask wagon while not commenting on anything else was a valid one. But I didn't like his accusation that MariaR was fencesitting on Sotty7 because I had the exact same reaction as MariaR did to Sotty7's post. <br><br>Besides that, he made two separate accusations: He accused MariaR of fencesitting on Sotty7 in the event a wagon takes off. This implies that Sotty7 is town and MariaR is looking to opportunistically join that wagon. He also accused MariaR of trying to \"sync\" her reads with Sotty7 which is a buddying accusation which also only makes sense with Sotty7-town.<br><br>While I can buy that some people have reads independent of everything else, the bulk of BBT's MariaR suspicion seems to be based on how she played around Sotty7. So, it's unbelievable for me that he's happy to lynch either one. Do you think BBT's reads seem consistent?<br><br>Oh, and I also thought one stray comment from MariaR about Rask-wagon isn't something that would make BBT so confident that she's scum that he's deadset on her lynch."}

You're response to my question will help me greatly. <br><br>Another thing I noticed. You accused me of arguing semantics with victor. I never did that. Hoopla/victor were arguing semantics.

Your read on BBT is a little weird in retrospect. You say you expect better from him as early as page five. Then, you say that BBT was at least better than Victor for spending time on his Rask read. But all BBT had done up till that point was pressure Rask, back off and call him town for no reason. I can't see how he was better than Victor here especially since you seem to expect more from him.<br><br>Then there's your take on the competing wagons of BBT and Sotty7. You spent the early game throwing suspicion at BBT but he always takes a backseat for you, first behind Victor, now behind Sotty7. I dislike everything about your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8452995#p8452995\">528</a>. You quote posts of BBT where he says he needs time to invest in the game and call it an okay answer. If someone is inactive, it already means that they don't have time for the game. BBT showing up and saying that is a very mundane answer and I don't understand what you found okay about it. You even go so far as to tell Victor to \"leave off Toffee\" which makes zero sense given Toffee is a scumread for you.<br><br>Why do you even suspect Sotty7 anyways? I don't think you've given any reason for it. Given BBT is explicitly a scumread for you, I find your preference of the Sotty7 wagon highly suspect.<br><br>I also have a hard time understanding your townread on me. You call me town early but then cast suspicion on me for \"trying too hard.\" You make a few vague accusations that you don't fully explain. Can you tell me what you meant in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8441128#p8441128\">161</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8442426#p8442426\">224</a>? After that, I call you town and then there's no mention at all about my previous \"tryharding,\" you just townread me back. It looks like you think you can pocket me because I was townreading you and there's no progression there that makes sense from a town POV. I found it odd that you refute my townread on you despite reading me as town. Your other reads (like on TwoFace for not getting a joke) also feel really weak.<br><br>At this point, I don't feel comfortable at all with the Sotty7 wagon although I want Sotty7's answers to my questions anyways.

Her early town read of Rask and Two face is good, where she talks about \"scum are more likely to get the subtly\" I think is a good point that she didn't have to bring to the table at the time.  She does leave her BBT read swinging in the wind opting instead to push on Victor, who I think is very likely town.

BlackVoid posted his reasons for scumreading me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8458024#p8458024\">567</a>. As far as I can tell, this is what started the interest in me as a scum choice (Hoopla and GreyIce would soon follow in assert interest in me as scum).<br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8458801#p8458801\">572</a> you expressed a continued interest in me as a scum candidate, but weren't interested in voting me because there was no traction on the wagon.<br>4. This is where Hoopla and GreyIce, and maybe someone else I don't remember sort of fall in line on the whole \"Jaack is under the radar and lurking\" deal. GreyIce actually addresses me about things.<br>5. I address these concerns in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8460904#p8460904\">611</a> and essentially challenge someone to vote me if they are scumreading me.<br>6. You post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8462306#p8462306\">618</a> without addressing me.<br>7. You nakedly vote me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8462346#p8462346\">622</a>.<br>8. You justify it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8462586#p8462586\">642</a>, repeating the idea that I was just coasting.<br><br>That section is mostly for my own reference right now, but if there is anything that is incorrect, feel free to correct it.<br><br>My first actual question is this: Were you scumreading me between <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8452914#p8452914\">524</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8458024#p8458024\">567</a>?[/quote] You were right that I didn't think your wagon would go anywhere so I was debating on voting so when I saw \"oh this wagon can go somewhere\" I voted it number 6 isn't even about you it's about gray I was scumreading you long ago look at post let me go check"}

Here we go.</span></span><br><br>As a veteran irascible asshole, let me assure you of two things.  First, you don't necessarily change because you're scum.  Second, being townread is simply a tool to lynch scum.  If people town read you they're more willing to listen to you, if they're more willing to listen to you, they're more willing to vote with you.  Certainly we none of us think Victor is ambivalent about who gets lynched, yes?  <br><br>So early on Victor was getting significant pressure.  A feud with GoodMorning, several votes, people pushing him, etc.  He had to defend himself.  Then it tapered off.  What did Victor do?  He tapered off.  It's not like any of his comments were particularly insightful or probing earlier, but after the town read?  He didn't try and sell a single person on voting GoodMorning.  He just was happy to leave his vote there until the \"oh gee, I guess I better join the wagon under duress\".<br><br>That's supremely weak.  You get town read, you use it to smash home wagons on scum.  You don't sit there and wank off about it.  Even useless prickly people like Furcolow try to push wagons home on people they think are scum (yes, Furcolow was supremely bad at it, but his inevitable detonations were because no one would listen to him).  Victor prickles, but then backs down.  It's weak as hell.  <br><br>If you want to talk since then, he's been the most passionate about how we shouldn't shoot IAI.  That's funny.  He's been on site since 2013, he's very well aware that many extremely strong players have the philosophy that vigs should default to shooting useless lurkers precisely because they have no content and its hard to read them.  This is not a controversial opinion or one that is rarely voiced, it's very mainstream, and IAI is the prime candidate of this town under that.  The \"at least people would have to take a stance\" thing is super weird.  Does he think that scum wouldn't bus IAI?  It's not like he's playing well at all.  It just seems an attempt to preserve IAI's life without actually doing much that would commit him one way or the other.  It's a very weird stance to take.  More interestingly he didn't even argue the scum should shoot Goodmorning.  He just wanted it to be not-IAI, he didn't even think of Goodmorning getting shot.  That's very, very odd for someone who is so strongly reading her as scum.  He's strongly reading her, but he isn't really willing to push her and doesn't even think of having a vig shoot her?  That's downright off. <br><br>So as to why I'm scum reading him, yes."}

As a result I've probably skimmed a few of your posts.  But honestly your reasoning in 565 is weak.  \"You should focus more on X than Y\" is silly.  It basically boils down to \"in my opinion X is scummier\" and unless you think someone is transparently manufacturing reasons to make reads, it's a point so weak it's non-existent (protip: everyone is inconsistent if you squint hard enough.  Yes, even you).    I mean honestly your entire case is \"she's scum with you\" which I know factually isn't true.  Sooooo... yeah.  It's just factually not a thing that is true.  If that's it, I can rest assured whatever else happens you're not mislynching her, so I think we're good on this one.  <br><br>Hey, wanna see something interesting though?

This is not a controversial opinion or one that is rarely voiced, it's very mainstream, and IAI is the prime candidate of this town under that.  The \"at least people would have to take a stance\" thing is super weird.  Does he think that scum wouldn't bus IAI?  It's not like he's playing well at all.

If Sotty is scum, then I'd say it points towards Victor town, since she'd have had to have made a conscious decision to support his towniness, and then left him off her reads list after specifically deciding how to treat her buddy?  If it was most other players I'd dismiss the possibility out of hand, but Sotty might think to do that.  Regardless, I think that the more likely explanation is the simple one.  Sotty is town, she thought of some town reads off her head when she was asked, she didn't think of victor.  <br><br>As for the buddying... I honestly don't see it.  Buddying is like \"oh you're such a strong player\" only not quite that transparent.  She says she thinks Victor is town.

I'd love it if you can help me understand your recent play.<br><br>As far as I can tell, you are townreading Michel, and Sotty7, maybe me and Victor. You are scumreading GM, TwoFace, and Jaack. Sotty7 has been consistently pushed as a counterwagon to the BBT-slot by your scumreads. So, how are you saying that the BBT/GreyICE wagon is going through without resistance when all your scumreads are either on the Sotty7 counterwagon or said that they would join it?<br><br>You also said having time to assess a claim is good. But to get claims, you need to put someone at L-1 with intent to hammer. If you unvote because you are afraid of a hammer, you won't get claims so I found that counterproductive because you'd be delaying a claim from someone that the majority including you agreed was a good wagon."}

I'm assuming you are town. From my previous list, I'm still townreading Victor, IAI, TwoFace, goodmorning, Jaack, and Cloud. I need to think on Sotty7 a little but probably town. I think MariaR is unlikely to be partnered with Hoopla so conditionally town.<br><br>That leaves Hoopla, Rask, and MichelSableheart's slot who I think is the scumteam if you are town. Is there a reason you have Rask as such strong town? Quite frankly, I don't think a passing comment from Rask about him changing his playstyle is a towntell. All he said was \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Disclaimer, I'm on a loss streak and I'm going to be changing my style here a bit.</span>\" That's nowhere near as big as you are saying it is and is probably something he planned to do no matter what alignment he drew.<br><br>As for why I suspect him (this also answers MariaR's question): I think a lot of his early play feels contrived. After the wagon formed on him, he went through each vote dissecting them when it was basically a semi-RVS wagon. So early in the game, it didn't make sense to go through each vote as opposed to just pushing whoever he thought was scum. It looked like he was trying to do the towny thing and \"analyze\" the votes on him. <br><br>I know you start skimming once you townread someone but I really think Rask's early posts are worth a close read. Look at his Hoopla push in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8438367#p8438367\">70</a>. It's entirely nonsensical. Hoopla never justified a vote on him based on associatives. I think he's overselling his Hoopla scumread. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8438634#p8438634\">92</a> is a bit of a stretch. \"Am I in the twilight zone\" looked fake in context. His complaints about Hoopla's playstyle also seem overdone.<br><br>I think Sotty7 is right that once Rask got townread, he faded out, not to mention he seemed to completely forget his scumread on Hoopla which suddenly resurfaced. <br><br>What does he do now? He white-knighted you over the past couple of days. But when your wagon stalled at a critical point and it didn't look like it would go through without his support, he floats paranoia about how good you are and how he could be wrong. He is setting up to vote you closer to deadline while giving lip-service to Hoopla to appease you. But his vote ultimately falls on Victor who I'm reading as town. So, what am I missing? By the way, I think you are tunneling a bit on Victor and IAI. If they are town, who's scum?"}

The meta thing could be a good point, I just find his poking on Maria about why she didn't engage him to be a little disparate and it doesn't match with his \"world view\".

I like to move around my vote a lot, build wagons and then promote compromise early in the game because too often players won't relinquish ego and create stalemates that last until the eleventh hour and then suddenly any vote can be justified in a scramble. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the best/most alignment indicative stuff that happens on D1 happens post-claim, and you'll suddenly see the names in everyone's super solid <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"ALRIGHT GUYS, THE SCUMTEAM IS X, Y AND EITHER Z OR J\"</span> type posts change dramatically, and then again even more once we get flips. <br><br>You're under the delusion that you can solve the game D1 every game, whereas I value cohesion, compromise and securing an informative lynch that isn't just last minute scrambling. I think this is my best way to help the town instead of fooling myself I am nailing half the scumteam from spurious analysis. You are hyperbolic with the declaration of your reads whereas I value transparency about the strength of one's reads -- mine aren't strong at the moment, so I'm not going to pretend they are. <br><br>D1's are probably the main reason why I don't play much mafia any more, because reaching a compromise and organising a lynch on D1 is like pulling teeth, and it's laughable how many D1's follow this script. Arguing over inane shit all Day that gets thrown out the window after claims and flips isn't my modus operandi, and I'm confident the reason why you so frequently read me as scum when I'm town is largely due to playstyle differences. We haven't played together for years and I think I've become more radical in my beliefs (especially my D1 beliefs), and I also think your scummeta of me might be stale. I actually haven't been scum in two years and have no idea how I'd play it, so it beats me how you know my scumgame so well.<br><br>I don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open, and don't want to get into a big argument about this. This is just how I play, and hopefully you found something useful from this post either for this game or in the future. If you're town, I'd rather you spent your time doing a final reads post. Maybe try and pander to me and give me a top 2 or 3 in terms of sureness. I'll be more likely to follow your reads if you're honest about their strength and don't try and tell me the team is definitely X and five other players are defs town."}

He's putting all his eggs in one basket and going for broke. The only reason scum would do such a thing either late-game for a crucial mislynch, or if they are backed into a corner in a 1v1. Neither is the case here. If he were scum, there are other options like Victor, Sotty7, and Jaack. They can't all be scum with him. When he started posting, he had a clean slate and could push pretty much anywhere he wanted. He could have built up a reputation to look pro-town. But as early as D1, he went all in, and bet his heart and soul and everything else on this GreyICE scumflip. He thinks he's going to be vindicated and all the antagonism that he's gathered this day phase will be set right. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">That's</span> something I can't see scum faking and I don't think that in this context, and at this time, it makes sense for scum to do that.</div></blockquote><br>\"*shrug* whoops, i was wrong.

Soooooo... why might she be town despite her voting for someone she thinks is town, and acting like scum?  <br><br>There's a form of toxic thought process that goes like this: \"anything I'm bad at isn't important\".  You see it all the time.  How many tech guys/computer programmers have you seen whine about all the unnecessary social stuff that happens in the office?  They're bad at it = it's not important.  How often have you seen people dismiss computers and treat them as meaningless because they're bad at them?  Have you ever heard someone put down other majors, complain about needing to write things for science classes, or talking about how math can be done by computers in English?  They're engaged in this thinking pattern.  \"If I can't do it, it must not be important.\"  <br><br>Hoopla is terrible at day 1 shit.  Has she degraded to the point where she's so trapped in a toxic thought loop that she's effectively playing like scum while as town?  Unfortunately her last post brought up that distinct possibility.  <br><br>Fortunately there's a way for me to check this.  Meta dive.  Calcified thinking is one of the few things that's meta diveable, because it's impossible to hide.  A toxic thought process is terminating to creativity, it won't disguise itself because its incapable of doing so.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8070543#p8070543\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: Mini Normal 1809: Game Over</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoopla wrote:</cite>ok, i have RETURNED<br><br>i've done a quick read over the pages i've missed and the main concern i have is about the lack of serious wagons that have been generated. a lot of people are posting noise and are not attempting to further the game through their votes, which is bad given we've already used 30% of day 1's allotted time. the most important things that happen on day 1 post-claim, and we NEED time to analyse that/potentially switch and create a counterwagon or whatever else. so start voting people who are realistic wagons.<br><br>on this topic, i'm not sure what to think of elyse. initially i had her as quite town before bbmolla decided to conftown himself, and though i still find her zeal for that vote OK and not suspicious, it is concerning that she talks about willing to compromise and search for new targets yet has done nothing in the last 8 pages and STILL hasn't unvoted bbmolla despite acknowledging he isn't going to happen today.<br><br>i'm liking the composition of the vedith wagon: bbmolla, cmitc1 and house make for a fairly town trio, so i am going to jump on board given i don't have a town read on vedith.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: vedith</span><br><br>more to come...</div></blockquote><br><br>And... sadly this is the same thought-terminating schlock that I see this game.

That's a lot of work to sell the guy you're voting for on you  being town.  A whole fucking lot of work for that."}

He self-consciously calls himself out for doing something scummy in three, which explains the motivation for <span class=\"noboldsig\">(2)</span>.  He wants to add more content so he's not going to get scumread.   <span class=\"noboldsig\">(4)</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">(5)</span> are just fluff, although the fake thing on Victor is either a good catch or something you say as insurance when your buddy flips.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">(6)</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">(3)</span> are just a waste of time other than his own self-scum read.  Breaking it down... I wouldn't be sad if he was lynched on the basis of this post alone.<br><br>So why am I reluctant?  Because some of this stuff is pretty town.  Let me give you some examples:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8452783#p8452783\" class=\"postlink\">post 515</a>, Jaack wrote:</cite>I think cloud is going a bit under the radar as of late. A lot of people seem to be willing to write off his actions as playstyle, but reading through this iso, it seems like he's been trying way to hard to assert himself as an important part of the town while simultaneously acting trolly. I'm not really sure here, but I'm feeling he's scummier than people have been treating him as of late.</div></blockquote><br><br>Wow that's exactly my thoughts on Cloud. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8464795#p8464795\" class=\"postlink\">post 800</a>, Jaack wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8464771#p8464771\" class=\"postlink\">post 795</a>, Sotty7 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8463995#p8463995\" class=\"postlink\">post 754</a>, Jaack wrote:</cite>But in that interim, she does very little to push on that TwoFace vote.</div></blockquote><br>Okay that's just blatantly untrue.  I push Twoface hard and we have an extensive back and forth that could have easily became a death tunnel.  I am interacting and questioning twoface who starts off answering me and then just really falls back to insulting and taking pot shots at me.  I pushed his voting behavior, I asked him for several reads a couple of pages back that he still hasn't provided.  What would you consider \"pushing a scum read\"?  Vote them then disappear for several pages and never interacting or questioning them again like you have been doing with me?</div></blockquote><br><br>Upon further examination, I will concede this. I didn't originally feel as if your discussions with TwoFace were particularly productive and it felt more like you were biding your time until BBT came back and you could focus on him again. On a second read, I don't think you're pushes on TwoFace are as intense as your pushes on BBT, which does give me pause, but it's the smoking gun I considered it before.<br><br>As for the shade on me, I get it. I screwed up by being lazy and not participating for a good section of this game. If I get lynched for it that's on me. But that fact that you keep bringing up every time I try and do something now is counterproductive. Well, at least it's detrimental to me trying to contribute. Just because I had a bad start to the game doesn't mean I can't have something to say now.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is also town as fuck.  The \"shit or get off the pot\" attitude is fucking town.  There's a mea culpa, but no apologies.  It's like \"okay, my early game was shit, but I'm still in the game so I get to fucking play it.\"  Town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8465636#p8465636\" class=\"postlink\">post 874</a>, Jaack wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8465630#p8465630\" class=\"postlink\">post 870</a>, MariaR wrote:</cite>I don't hate anyone! ;-;</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8465617#p8465617\" class=\"postlink\">post 866</a>, MariaR wrote:</cite>I h8 u</div></blockquote><br>Blatant contradiction, confscum</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, things like this are pretty playful and attention grabbing for scum.<br><br>Soooooo............ conflicted?

But... he's new to this site, he's in one other game that's ongoing and therefore I couldn't discuss it.   But honestly, I think he leans town here.  <br><br>I dunno.  Welcome to me actually going into this wanting to say one thing and just not being able to.  I still really feel he's town, but this is not where I thought it would be.  I'd put down $20 on town, but not $200."}

Doesn't mean their way of play is any better or worse than mine, just means I need to try and read based of how they play, not how I would want or expect them to play.<br><br>With that in mind, Maria comes across as a very fluid type of player.  I haven't played with her before and I am not very good at reading this style of play which is why it took me so long to commit to a read of her.  Maybe it helped that she was pushing and voting for one of my scum reads at the time Jaack.  I felt like Jaack's panic to the vote was disproportionate to the pressure coming from Maria.  It felt like she voted him in an attempt to see if a wagon would start there and kick something going that wasn't Grey.  It didn't kick off, I would say mostly because Grey didn't move his vote.  Maybe I was reading too much into this since Maria never really claimed this was her plan, but that's how it looks to me looking in.  <br><br>The tone thing is mostly a gut reaction.  She feels relaxed and at ease which makes me think town more than scum.  There is a lot of fluff in the ISO but there are also reads.  She comments about the BBT wagon, on me, on Rask.  The Sable vote was pretty bad, but the Jaack vote looks good to me and the Victor push makes sense if she was town reading Grey which is what it looked like at the end of the day.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Maria - </span> What's your read on Cloud?

For the rest of the day you barely mention him beyond answering questions people asked you about why you voted him, but nothing about anything he did since earlygame, the \"I stopped reading his posts\" you said. Still absurd. The vote itself is somewhat murky to me, that you really hated his rvs and entrance for not talking about/addressing bbt wagon that much. Which is a little ironic considering what you've done since.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Midday</span> the greyice wagon was in fullswing, and had almost no opposition. Though it begun before greyice arrived, people stayed on after seeing what greyice said. No one would have expected any other wagon or lynch at that point, maybe jaack, but not victor. This is when you commented a little on greyice, and even then really not a lot. You had statements such as \"IAI is scum pushing grey and I don't like this\" which IMPLIES you would think grey is town but you didn't \"back up\" the read in the sense that you didn't ever come out and say \"I think grey is town\" or anything explicit. I have to give the benefit of the doubt and try to look at things from a gm-town perspective, and gm-town saying those things would have townread grey; but your later actions don't line up with that at all either. More accurately they line up with you not having a real read on either greyice or victor which is why you seemed to not care and used the situation to try to setup for d2 instead. To people reading this: ctrl f \"grey\" in his ISO. Mainly, you cast doubt on people for their approach around the wagon (interestingly enough NOT victor's greyice vote/stance though), which reads to me as expecting the lynch to go through with your hands clean of it and then getting those grey scumread next day (most notably IAI). No like, complaint about your townread being wagoned by victor+iai, not any motion to do a counterwagon beyond \"hey if a wagon on iai got going I COULD go on it\", but okay, I guess it makes sense because at this point it didn't look like any other wagon would be viable at this point!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lateday</span> a viable counterwagon approaches! Victor takes off, it gets to l-2 at one point, and spends several days as a wagon nearly as viable as the greyice one, up until the moment he claimed mason. Keyword, this gamestate lasted several days, 30 october maria and I voted, to 02 november, that's 4. It was not a very fast event that you missed or anything like that. You were there. Here are the posts made while victor, supposed scumread, was a competing wagon of greyice, supposed townread.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8465946#p8465946\">884</a> -  \"I'm just trying to engage you when it comes to Victor to try and understand where you're coming from\" you call super slimey - when you legitimately were tight on details there, stopped talking about victor at a certain point and hadn't said much since, so it's a valid question: wtf? Sotty shade, hoopla shade, then complaining. To be fair, small comment about people joining victor wagon at the end.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8466555#p8466555\">890</a> / <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8466738#p8466738\">892</a> - as an aside, I have a theory that gm-scum perceived IAI actions as extra scummy/antitown because as scum she knew the whole time that what IAI was super hard pushing was a mislynch.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8470052#p8470052\">984</a> - I think the gist of this reply to BV is \"town and scum can hardpush cases so you should not townread IAI for hardpushing\". This is okay - blah maria - THIS one is rich, what gm says to hoopla, \"hoopla why are you giving long playstyle lectures instead of campaigning for someone to be the last vote on the grey wagon?\". It's literally what gm does by addressing all these random topics INSTEAD OF GREY/VIC and ESPECIALLY \"campaigning for someone to be the last vote\". How does town-gm say this and at the same time no lightbulb turns on or anything. Gm at no point since early/midday tries to get someone on, not beyond weak statements like hmm it would be nice if it happened I guess. But beyond that, this is somewhat sinister; gm is asking hoopla why she isn't getting more votes onto greyice at the end of the day. This is effort which probably does contribute towards that end. In a way, the gm encouraged grey's wagon a bit with this and an earlier comment about it being \"inevitable\", probably about the same minuscule amount as she put towards encouraging the victor wagon. And again, she's fully conscious of it as a possibility given this exact comment, just not interested.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8472025#p8472025\">1050</a> - matter of fact response to greyice over some differences. CONTEXT: Deadline is closing, greyice is ranting, near-lynch, and giving his \"last reads\" in a fury, creature fakehammered. Victor lynch still possible though. Calm, unphased as fuck post from gm given everything. You're talking to your townread who's about to die, even if you already accepted it as \"inevitable\" long ago despite the VCs, and didn't think it was worth it to even read victor's posts let alone judge them any more, ignoring all that, you're just whatever with grey dying. This is what gets me, as benign as it looks this part sums up gm's play around the 2 wagons; indifferent. As town there's any given number of reactions you'd have, things to be focusing on, anything; from your point of view this day is supposed to have been a failure, a not-good outcome. I think gm is unfettered because she's scum, her play fits her being perfectly fine with that situation as it's a win for scum-her, a positive outcome, and her priority that whole time was already thinking to d2.</fieldset><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8480317#p8480317\" class=\"postlink\">post 1194</a>, goodmorning wrote:</cite>NOBODY WAS ON THE FENCE.

In early-midgame she then stopped reading his posts because well who cares. Greyice begun to be wagoned and gm pointed out some problems in the people wagoning him, mostly IAI, but really quickly goodmorning saw the greyice lynch as inevitable and thought it best to comment on other things. When there was renewed interest in the victor wagon, goodmorning didn't feel it was a priority then reading his posts either or campaigning for that, despite pointing out hoopla not having campaigned for greyice lynch. \"Also: showing up and talking about something I'd already made up my mind on would have been very boring indeed, and useless. Far better to post thoughts on a wide range of subjects so they can survive my inevitable death.\"[<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478858#p8478858\">1144</a>]. When the victor wagon was l-2 and a realistic lynch to greyice and greyice was pouring his heart out, goodmorning didn't find it a priority to make some noise about her townread being lynched with no of her scumreads on the wagon; perhaps the vig would shoot IAI as she asked, she maybe thought. Goodmorning calmly addressed side topics and had one post to greyice questioning two of his statements in a matter of fact way, but this was okay because goodmorning had been in this situation all the time and so she's used to it or something and doesn't see the value in defending townreads or campaigning for the last vote or two onto a scumread who is the counterwagon. Actually, similar to not reading victor's posts anymore, goodmorning didn't notice the gamestate, that the wagons were close or that anyone was \"on the fence\" through incompetence rather than maliciousness, and she just assumed nothing changed from earlier from her \"inevitable\" early-midday judgement.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Conclusion</span>: I am disgusted I have to consider this, but stuff like this has happened a few times. But those few times were newer players or hard-lurkers/really weird players. The problem is goodmorning is an experienced player, I've seen her queue for IC a few times I believe, I don't see a veteran player that wouldn't be capable of doing all this. I still have to meta and I'll do so tomorrow, but it'll be very disappointing if this is her townplay. That said even if one's townplay is proven bizarre/scum-ish in all these different ways that doesn't somehow clear her but just makes those specific tells nai. But hopefully the meta analysis would find some substantial tells in that case then.</fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">The case for gm scum<br>Goodmorning voted victor for rvs because it was easy. Gm keeps the vote and says victor's next posts are bad [but doesn't go into detail] because that's easy as well. Gm answers questions and responds to victor when necessary, but at one point starts ignoring victor out of scumlaziness. With greyice being a wagon gm uses it to cast a ton of shade onto people while not trying to divert it because she wants to leverage the ml into more tomorrow, something you can't do for a wagon you're on. She uses the reasoning that the lynch is probably inevitable anyways, which is reasonable at that specific time but she uses it for the rest of the day even when it's clearly not the case because it's the simple and an easy defense. With greyice and victor both being wagons gm doesn't particularly care which go through, her actions and focus onto minor/side things because she didn't care for any responsibility or attention from that. Out of casting doubt onto people for how they wagoned greyice, she had to assume a stance of appearing somewhat opposed so it made sense, but she didn't really care what outcome came of yesterday. Her mind was already onto what she's do afterwards.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Conclusion:</span> This fits a lot more, especially considering gm's play around the very late parts of the day. In terms of emotion she just read completely unperturbed by her townread having a meltdown, getting lynched in front of her with her two scumreads on the wagon, it's just so flat and unconcerned. It's not as obvious as it looks like because she's still commenting on things and contributing, so I can see scum-gm thinking it's fine acting this way as the activity is still acceptable, but it's just the focus and priorities don't make sense when you look at them closely. This explanation if nothing else is a lot simpler and so I think more likely.</fieldset>"}

My point was there wasn't much reason for scum-gm to push victor over greyice, as though greyice did townread gm he was still a potentially threatening player to scum overall; my point was there were reasons scum gm would be happy to have that happen as well. Casting doubt and have grey go through was better than the scum-alternative choice for gm, is my point; assuming victor town if he had been lynched instead it wouldn't have been as easy for goodmorning I think, not having it go through means she didn't have to change any stance. Not to mention that outright scumreading/pushing greyice would have potentially put gm in the firing line of him or others and invited people to ask questions there. I can see the point that she maybe could have just kept a minor scumread on greyice with BBT's play as reasoning, but I don't think it's by any means that simple. For starters, other scum on the greyice wagon would incentivise gm to have held this stance as an alternative."}

The most likely situation is we have two masons and one other good PR or two masons and two weak to middling roles. There's pretty much never two masons in a town with three or four other PR's, so we can easily tell later in the game if the mason claim is fake.

My point was there wasn't much reason for scum-gm to push victor over greyice, as though greyice did townread gm he was still a potentially threatening player to scum overall; my point was there were reasons scum gm would be happy to have that happen as well. Casting doubt and have grey go through was better than the scum-alternative choice for gm, is my point; assuming victor town if he had been lynched instead it wouldn't have been as easy for goodmorning I think, not having it go through means she didn't have to change any stance. Not to mention that outright scumreading/pushing greyice would have potentially put gm in the firing line of him or others and invited people to ask questions there. I can see the point that she maybe could have just kept a minor scumread on greyice with BBT's play as reasoning, but I don't think it's by any means that simple. For starters, other scum on the greyice wagon would incentivise gm to have held this stance as an alternative.</div></blockquote><br>But doesn't it work just as well for scumGM to say the lynch is inevitable, reason a switch to Grey and have a Victor vote in her back pocket to go back to?  Your case reads pretty well really until you get to your conclusions.  A lot of it seems based on how you personally would have played either side of the situation.  Bringing up GM's experience and saying you are disgusted this might be an option for her play is pretty manipulative.  Players make mistakes and players have different styles.  You can say you don't think this theroy fits the crime but to paint it as this is the worst possible option out of all the options is too extreme to buy in all the way.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8485540#p8485540\" class=\"postlink\">post 1264</a>, VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite>So she's all alone on the IAI wagon and yet once again she's doing nothing.

I personally like the IAI vote not necessarily on the strength of GM's position but because I think he could be scum.  He came into yesterday with no earth shattering reads, which in itself isn't that damming.  But now he is apparently fully caught up and yet is still very much standing on the outside looking in.  No vote.  Waiting on me, waiting on Hoopla.  It feels like he is waiting for someone to come up to him and say it's okay IAI, you can vote Sotty!  You can vote Hoopla.

Jaack's vote is based off reasons that date back to day one that I still think are pretty suspect.  Blackvoid is a strong town read of mine, I do like his logical thinking and our reads tend to match up everywhere else.  I think he has settled on me lately and has done very little to pressure me in any shape just resorting to banging the drum.  Jaack I suspected pretty hard day one, but that has dampened a bit today.  I'm not quite ready to say town, but he's not as hard scum as I thought yesterday.<br><br>Creature's vote is extremely empty.  He says he doesn't remember anything I did in the game.

Doesn't think I am the mason buddy, I guess?  Abandoned the GM vote that was going nowhere to put me to L-1 even though all his focus is still on GM.  <br><br>I think this wagon has swelled off the back off initial BVtown push that has fallen to the wayside since.  The idea that I might have to claim because of lazy votes pushing me to lynch for little reason is really starting to piss me off.  I keep trying to push my points but are making extremely little headway with very few in the player base willing to to interact with me.  I could be extra cranky right now, because I just woke up from a nap to the election map from hell, but I really don't think this wagon has any real force behind it or reason behind it to show why I am scum."}

It helps that I value her as an extremely strong town player and would really like to tag team on this game if she is indeed town.  Because of this I found Rask's initial case and vote on Hoopla weak, but most of it could be down to a lack of experience with her which could be understandable.  However, Rask's vote remains despite Hoopla's reasonable responses to his points.  <br><br>I like BBT more for scum at this point.  He came in with a vote on Rask to start a wagon, there were already two other players with two votes at the time Blackvoid and gm.  It seems to be an attempt to sort Rask which comes quick and with no further elaboration.  I would have expected more considering the history they both speak to.  Feels like he started the wagon then panicked a little when it took off.

What do you think about the points I made in 817?</div></blockquote><br>For one you overstated the inevitability of a Jaack lynch, we can see that with hindsight.  Several people were willing to move over but it never really surfaced.  If we're going to talk about counter wagons, that one had the potential to explode and yet it didn't.  The meta thing could be a good point, I just find his poking on Maria about why she didn't engage him to be a little disparate and it doesn't match with his \"world view\".  I have asked him a couple of times why he hasn't engaged me and he keeps shrugging it off as if it's nothing about nothing, why is he so keen to get an answer from Maria?  Doesn't add up to me.<br><br>Rask's buddying of Grey in the last page or so is really the only thing lately that has given me pause about that slot.  It seemed less like an attempt to sort than an attempt to position himself to go either way.  \"I don't know if I should trust you\" gave me the creeps.  Pick a side and commit.  Not enough for a scum read though.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8467455#p8467455\" class=\"postlink\">post 905</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>MariaR: Really dislike the constant refrain of \"if GreyICE is town, doesn't it bother anyone that there isn't a counterwagon.\" It seems like a twisted argument because she's using that to create a counterwagon. We could flip the question and ask why there's so much resistance to the GreyICE wagon that we've got first you, then Jaack, then Victor as counterwagons. Looks like a pathos-driven argument that's coming from someone who wants to push an agenda.</div></blockquote><br>I'll give you this point.  The counter wagon point holds no weight with me considering they have a band of players that could have done something about that by now.  Why are you town reading Cloud?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8467455#p8467455\" class=\"postlink\">post 905</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>TwoFace: The way he's pushing his reads, first Victor, now you.

He is voting me for my use of the word stuff.  He repeated this reasoning in a recent post and it's just awful.  Since then he has just sat on my wagon and thrown out more crap about the counter wagon (something you are scum reading Maria for) and done very little to attempt to read me.  I've asked him for reads that aren't me and he still hasn't delivered.  Scum can very easy fake anger here while wasting a vote and not moving it.

You are going to have to dumb this down for me a bit because it's apparently going over my head.</div></blockquote><br>There are a ton of different play styles on mafiascum and a lot of them are very different to mine and what I would consider \"optimal\" play.  Doesn't mean their way of play is any better or worse than mine, just means I need to try and read based of how they play, not how I would want or expect them to play.<br><br>With that in mind, Maria comes across as a very fluid type of player.  I haven't played with her before and I am not very good at reading this style of play which is why it took me so long to commit to a read of her.  Maybe it helped that she was pushing and voting for one of my scum reads at the time Jaack.  I felt like Jaack's panic to the vote was disproportionate to the pressure coming from Maria.  It felt like she voted him in an attempt to see if a wagon would start there and kick something going that wasn't Grey.  It didn't kick off, I would say mostly because Grey didn't move his vote.  Maybe I was reading too much into this since Maria never really claimed this was her plan, but that's how it looks to me looking in.  <br><br>The tone thing is mostly a gut reaction.  She feels relaxed and at ease which makes me think town more than scum.  There is a lot of fluff in the ISO but there are also reads.  She comments about the BBT wagon, on me, on Rask.  The Sable vote was pretty bad, but the Jaack vote looks good to me and the Victor push makes sense if she was town reading Grey which is what it looked like at the end of the day.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Maria - </span> What's your read on Cloud?

D1, the BBT/GI wagon stalled and people unvoted on occasion, but it never collapsed at any point. The sotty wagon, meanwhile, collapsed as soon as I unvoted and started looking elsewhere. I think that points to some scum bussing but looking for an easy out. There's a lot of 'not totally buying that claim but whatever' going around as well which I think feeds into that theory as well. As for hoopla herself<br><br>I think lynching sotty is probably our best option at this point.

One of the biggest tells I've noticed was when she told Sotty7 that she doesn't want to argue with good players when she suspects them. It seemed like such a bizarre thing for scum to say. If GM was scum and scared of Sotty7 beating her in an argument, couldn't she simply attack weaker players? Stuff I wrote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8445446#p8445446\">323</a> about her early play still apply.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Creature:</span></span></span> I'm pretty confident he's town now because he's seeing the game in a very similar way to me.

I like his reaction to that which was to tell me he was doing pro-town things and not to townread him for a slip. He also talks about how great he is as scum which tends to just put people on their guards so I think he probably wouldn't do it as scum.

The recent attack on Creature is simply attacking who she perceives as the weakest vote on her wagon. Creature's stances and positions are amazingly consistent and she just ignored that because he jumped onto two wagons. Guess what, both wagons that Creature jumped on (Sotty7 and Hoopla) were on people he was scumreading. It's not like he's randomly jumping on wagons. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla:</span></span></span> All of Hoopla's pushes today are bad. GM is town as is Jaack. Hoopla's reason for voting GM is literally \"she and TwoFace defended me against Victor and there's gotta be one scum there. TwoFace was town so GM is scum.\" That's so lame and if she actually believed what she was saying to Victor, she shouldn't find it surprising that people agreed with her. Then there's the Jaack push. No reasoning but I'll assume from D1 that she just thought Jaack was flying under the radar. I pointed out that this is Jaack's normal play and she hopped off because me and TwoFace were defending him.

What the heck are you guys doing? My townread on Jaack from D1 still holds and nothing he's done today has reduced that. He went after Sotty7 which seems consistent with the rest of his play. I think he's tunneling a bit given there are scum outside of Sotty7 but I understand why he wants his biggest scumread dead.

One of the biggest tells I've noticed was when she told Sotty7 that she doesn't want to argue with good players when she suspects them. It seemed like such a bizarre thing for scum to say. If GM was scum and scared of Sotty7 beating her in an argument, couldn't she simply attack weaker players? Stuff I wrote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8445446#p8445446\">323</a> about her early play still apply.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Creature:</span></span></span> I'm pretty confident he's town now because he's seeing the game in a very similar way to me.

I like his reaction to that which was to tell me he was doing pro-town things and not to townread him for a slip. He also talks about how great he is as scum which tends to just put people on their guards so I think he probably wouldn't do it as scum.

No reasoning but I'll assume from D1 that she just thought Jaack was flying under the radar.

He later stated that he was trying to get a claim although he did not vote you to put you back at L-1.

I tried to work out why you as scum would investigate me in anyway, and came to the conclusion that if scum had a rolecop and targeted me with it last night, than victor is likely lying about being a mason, as I would imagine that scum would use their rolecop to try and find the other mason. That being said, now that I'm actually explaining this more I realize that that is not the most useful insight because we could never confirm if a scum investigative targeted me N1. Whatever. You probably aren't going to get lynched again today so it's unlikely to matter right now.<br><br>I also just noticed that I left out my analysis of hoopla in my post in question aside from the transition into it.

I don't really like the opening of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8485676#p8485676\">1266</a>. It feels a little revisionist - there was nothing about BBT's D1 that made that slot doomed other than town apathy to finding a decent alternative. Seems a bit like she's trying to distance herself from participation on the GI wagon, but it's not a smoking gun to me. In general, there's a lot of that in Hoopla's posts. Stuff that could be from scum, but nothing that makes me compelled to vote.<br><br>I'm not super convinced of her being scum though. I'd much rather lynch sotty or cloud today, but it seems I'm alone in both cases.

You've had hard scumreads on two players for most of this game but have done nothing to see those through.<br><br>And finally, this counterwagon garbage again. First of all, it's patently false - Hoopla was a wagon today before I was. But it doesn't matter which came first, what matters is the quality of the wagon.

She obviously always claims Tracker as town Tracker, but now that I think about it, given we probably have two mason claims, there's likely only one or two other town PR slots, but there's three scum slots remaining, and since she claims something like this as scum almost always, it's actually more likely this claim comes from scum just from the number of scum left vs. number of PR's left.<br><br>I also think Jack is a decent chance of being scum, so I probably wouldn't switch unless something with a real shot of going through occurred."}

It's safe to say his reads might have been influenced by that. I'm also not sure why I'm supposed to care that he was townreading Sotty7. TwoFace is confirmed town as well and he was scumreading Sotty7 really hard. So, if you are weighing the opinions of confirmed town, they both cancel out.

The third one doesn't make sense. If Sotty7 is scum, then we've got a scum flip, we are one step closer to a win and you can push GM then. If she's town, then my bussing theory would no longer apply.<br><br>By the way, it wasn't my intention to demotivate you. I tend to make prolonged pushes and not let go when I lock onto someone. If you want to talk about why your GM-case hit alarm bells for me and why I was scumreading you for it rather than GM, I can explain my internal thinking more. I touched on it a bit in my reads list though.<br><br>Right now, GM has been sliding down my town-scale a lot so I'm considering that you might have a point there. I still think a Sotty7 flip is pivotal to solidifying my reads. There were three wagons D1. We know GreyICE was town and Victor very likely is too. Sotty7 is the unknown. We know she pushed very hard for the BBT/GreyICE lynch. We know BBT hard-scumread her before replacing out. We know TwoFace wanted her flip really, really badly and winded up dead N1. We know that she investigated her other threat. Hoopla's right that in her place, scum would almost certainly claim PR. All of this tells me Sotty7's flip is integral to figuring out the game and is a very, very likely scumflip. That's where I'm at and that's why I'd really rather not let go of Sotty7."}

A Tracker claim is never really provable, could be scum aligned or a Mafia Role Cop and is just much harder to evaluate from setup spec as it's a weak-ish investigation role that's existence could go either way if the setup is something like Mason/Mason/Doc or Mason/Mason/Doc/Tracker."}

Rask did hammer grey d1 but she also tried to flip the sotty's wagon to hoop,gm and myself in about 2 pages spawn which is extremely scummy, all she did at the end of the day was ask for a flip, this is not town whos afraid to lynch pr, this is mafia whos bored that their partner is getting lynched or something like that. Rask is an extremely easy read, like i said many times and she can read me pretty darn well too, yet she voted me and never doubted herself when im town, which is another scumtell imo. This is 100% rask scum game.<br><br>So on the wagon d1, rask is mafia, and i bet last mafia is in hoop/bv/creature. Bv should be town but i am paranoid.

In fact, it reminds me of the start of D2 when sotty started calling herself an obvious lynch candidate. You weren't preordained as a lynch candidate from the start -- at the end of D2, only Rask and I were particularly interested in lynching you. There's a ton of weird interactions between you and sotty beyond just your late attempts to save her. Furthermore, there was simply too much resistance to sotty's lynch at the end of D2 for it to be 100% a bus.<br><br>---<br><br>I will add one thing else. While at the start of the day I was reconsidering gm as a scum candidate, I'm pretty sure she's town now thinking about the IAI flip. There were a decent amount of IAI scumreads going around D1 and D2 but in all the counterwagons that developed yesterday, the only vote for IAI was by gm. My guess as to why is that scum was playing with the assumption that he was the other mason and knew that a wagon on him would be a waste of time as he wouldn't get lynched once he claimed."}

A couple of examples:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8445752#p8445752\" class=\"postlink\">post 343</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite>Don't feel like hoopla is pressuring sotty at all despite the vote.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8450958#p8450958\" class=\"postlink\">post 437</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite>I have a new conspiracy theory that involves BBT and sotty distancing while voting other people.<br><br>For BBT the maria scumread is for being useless/idling and relative to the sotty read you should feel the latter is stronger, as it's sotty pushing BBT for what bbt says is a very shallow way.<br>Sotty has what sounds like a strong bbt read too but wants to lynch twoface for something that sounds a lot weaker and kind of lame. Earlier pushing of each other is reasonable to assume wouldn't go that far, given weak reasonings given at that point. Sotty asking me if his bbt meta was outdated possibly expected me to say it was.</div></blockquote><br><br>~~<br><br>Idk, maybe I'm getting sucked into the allure of Sotty's scumplay and am giving her too much credit for being able to orchestrate how the town will perceive her interactions with her partners. Certainly a large part of what makes distancing look convincing is that it both scumbags are playing their part, not just Sotty -- and Jack and Rask have both told convincing stories with regards to Sotty if one of them is indeed scum. I think I just find it weird that so many people were so confident in sitting on Sotty votes for ages on D1 (TwoFace, Jack, Rask) and with good conviction. It seems suspicious that all these townies were on the same wavelength and nailed her so early in the game. I want to assume it's too coincidental and one is scum who knows the truth.<br><br>Weirdly, I didn't rediscover any paranoia for BlackVoid and am starting to not be repelled by his reads so much any more. <br><br>Well, this post went off tangent in a billion directions and I don't know where to go with it now or if it's even worthy of reading, so I'll just end it here still confused and kind of hungry."}

My biggest strength was my ability to boss games around as a town leader/key voice in the game and orchestrate things in a direction I wanted the game to go, whereas I think Sotty's strengths were more along the lines of very convincingly simulating her town game as scum, but these are all long ago memories that are hazy, nostalgic and simply not very meaningful beyond the surface.

I will say if he is such a concrete read, why am I just hearing about it now after probing for reasons, because I've never felt like you've expressed how town you view him. You seem to be under the impression that Creature is an obvious hivemind townread that didn't require much explanation or convincing of others, and I haven't seen you volunteering to dissuade those pushing the Creature wagon today, which I'd expect if this read is genuine. He is one of the most realistic alternate candidates, so why no chime in 'bout that?"}

I haven't finished but here's where I'm at so far. You are actually my strongest townread outside of Jaack and Arona and the one I have the most trouble explaining.<br><br>Cloud's ISO is actually not too horrible. I specifically looked to see all the times he mentioned Sotty7 and nothing came off like he already knew her alignment.

She claims she's known for not bussing. But despite attacking Sotty7, she never once voted her. She voted Victor who is town on D1. On D2, she kept her vote on IAI who's also town. For a brief moment, she switched to Hoopla, then Rask, then back to IAI. D3 she's voting you who I think is town. So, I don't know, that's one too many bad votes, and she never votes Sotty7.<br><br>Still need to ISO Rask and search for mentions of Sotty7. I'll get back to you on that. You seem to know him well, what do you think?<br><br>MariaR is the one I have no reason to believe is town so that's who I'd be most comfortable lynching. Saying you, me, and Jaack are scum is a pretty big stretch and I'm closer to thinking she's doing it to get towncred than because she actually buys what she's selling. There's also that D1 behavior where she complained about the GreyICE wagon (why is there no counterwagon? Is no one bothered???) Then TwoFace point-blank told her that Sotty7 was the counterwagon that was stalling. She didn't react to him and then moved onto Victor. But I haven't finished ISO'ing her either so more on this soon."}

She was heavily fosed for 2 days and she was going down, i dont see 1 mafia hard defending her (Mariar) + 1 coasting the lynch, or 2 coasting, it just makes no sens to me considering Sottys play and how the day happened.<br><br>So imho, if MariaR is town, at the very least 1 mafia bussed imo, that is -&gt; Hoop BV Crea Rask. <br>Another read i have is that MariaR and BV are just not a team imho, they can be both scum this game. MariaR wouldnt continually pushed BV whos in a somewhat townread position rn (at least by the clears), no reason to discredit your partner on ml either, so -&gt; BV and MariaR not 2mafias.<br><br>Now, if mariaR is mafia -&gt; BV should be town and vice versa<br><br>Now heres my personally reads<br><br>I do think mariar should be town if she didnt completly hard buddied a scum partner who was tote getting lynched, if she did then the game should be easy with her scum flip but i personally believe that her play from d2 was town and that she actually believe sotty was town. Her votes counts also doesnt reflect scum intention, shes also starting to towntell recently and BV outed several horrible lines and isnt being consistent in his townyness. <br><br>I also do think that GM should be town here, imo his d1 tone was on point, i liked a lot of his posts and his voting pattern just looks reckless af and i dont see mafia coasting with those votes all that much, theres also the IAI vote considering mafia already picked mason read the guy<br><br>Thats leaves Crea Rask BV Hoop<br><br>Crea just unvoted on me which is imo fairly towny, he also townread me for the entire game and other stuff but hes somewhat hard to read since low infos, he also doesnt look like hes with rask for the meta read out of the blue<br><br>Rask scumtold a bunch of times but also towntold recently. I personnaly do not believe shes the same as the town game we both played recently for one bit. Also creature outing the very same kind of meta read i had on her should be enough for me to tr him because we had about the same read. I do think shes scum and her GM push is bad<br><br>Hoop idk, have to reread. BV had flip floping reads on him for a while and i dont know how to read that if BV is scum. He also corrected BV on stuff that were wrong and outed good lines<br><br>BV towntold early on but made various terrible posts later on and had inconsistent logic on his own play, also hes pushing on mariar when i do think shes town.<br><br>My stance atm is <br><br>Crea/rask not a team<br>Maria/BV not a team (pretty fucking sure)<br>Hoop/BV not a team<br><br>Rask is mafia, Mariar is town, Gm is town<br>Bv is mafia over hoop for recent play"}

For example, I feel like Maria's hard defenses are a better reason to dismiss someone than Creature's posting style.</div></blockquote><br>I'm not townreading him for his posting style. I'm saying it's hard to explain my read on him because of how he posts but I'll give it a go. <br><br>First, there's my point on MichelSableheart - the way he asked me for opinions on you/Victor/GM/TwoFace and then went back to read with those in mind was probably town. Counter-intuitively, I think town are actually more receptive to listening to others and working with people. I don't think he'd be so blatant about buddying me as scum and he could have approached your conflict in other ways, ones that could be advantageous to him but his approach felt sincere. <br><br>Next, there's Creature replacing in and sort of doing the same thing D1. He said he'll help me push any other wagon as long as it's not on him. I think that's something scum would be too self-conscious to say. But if he's town and had me as a strong townread, I think he'd say that. <br><br>Then, there are his actual reads which aligned with mine pretty closely. I'm a little bothered that his four scumreads were the exact same ones I had but I don't think they were unreasonable. He scumread Sotty7, and had no hesitation in voting her. He did say PR-claim means we should wait but by itself, that's not telling. It seems to be common wisdom to leave PR claims alone for a day. The way Cloud did it struck me as scummy because he seemed so invested in Sotty7's survival. Creature didn't seem that way.<br><br>Finally, there's Sotty7's push on him. I think his vote on the wagon came across as easily attackable because he didn't give any reasons. It seemed more like that she was taking advantage of a townie who put down a weak vote on her as opposed to cross-bussing.<br><br>Can we discuss your read on Rask?

About Creature specifically, I feel like he is such a different player to you with such a different mindset that when you start saying things like <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"I expect that's something that scum would be too self-conscious to say\"</span> it weakens your case, because you're clearly applying a broad understanding of how scum play to a very niche and unusual player. I just don't think you can be so confident with your expectations about very different players.

I think with his claim, I'll be able to get a much better picture of the gamestate. If his claim is believable, I can continue looking elsewhere without worry about connections to him. I can rest easy knowing that we're not letting a really cheeky scumbag slip away right in front of our noses by being blatantly pro-scum.<br><br>There's also the fact that he revels in trolling. I've genuinely invested myself into the game and put in my time to try to figure out the puzzle. He knows that him being purposefully obstructionist is just frustrating me. He's happy about that.<br><br>Even if you think he's more likely town, it would be much nicer if you could just make him claim to get it over with so I can refocus. Just help me out here. You claimed to be townreading me heavily after I derailed your lynch and went for Sotty7. Arona is clear. Jaack is clear and Jaack has been pretty tunneled in on Cloud."}

Its not an actual crumb imo in the sens of it but i remember i tried to push the idea to actually test the tracker because Sotty couldve proved to me, i said that many times.<br><br>My whole d2 reason not to lynch sotty was because i wanted to be on her that day and maybe try to track outside, if this happened i wouldve crumbed who i was going on [sotty] to possibly clear her and wins a ml since we wouldnt have to lynch sotty anymore because she was virtually scumread by most of the town, that was essentially my plan. Also from slight setup meta on specs, i believe that town masons + track + weak-ish proctective role did made sens since theres over 1 investigative and 1 protective in most setup. <br><br>I also wanted to further get reads from a lynch outside the sotty claim because imo it was optimal in every way. <br><br>If i was on sotty and i get killed for it, sotty is clear, we win ml, her track is considered true++. I also seriously doubted that i wouldve been killed while not bodyguarding if Sotty was mafia, because i hard defended the shit out of her, not reason ti nightkill me the mason claim. <br><br>If the flip outside her was incriminating Sotty i wouldve probably no bodyguard or on the mason claim, idk i didnt actually think too much about it but that was essentially my state of mind.<br><br>The reason why i didnt want to full claim is because i expected to trade myself at somepoint in the game with another pr or a clear, claiming here just kill me pretty much and makes me completly useless.

Claim reliability/trustworthyness vs flexibility for faking. Town vs scum benefit. If town claim PR they are already a massive RB/kill target whether they soft or hard, the difference here is generally not huge barring things like BP or PGO(rare). Scum OTOH have huge benefit from waiting for a fake another day especially with extra theorycrafting/planning and if they have an info from their own information-gathering role to supplement.<br>2. Scum have more setup deductive powers than town (given they know their own power) and can guess fairly reliably from a soft whereas town are in the dark and focus on other things. Leveling-the-playing field principle which is along the same lines as what makes massclaim powerful.<br>3. If you're town and your role had any information (I don't know what level of competency you have and can't trust your decision making) it would all have been lost on death. I can't trust that for example you don't have potentially crucial information but because you think softing would prevent you from being killed, you refuse to hard then get killed and that information is permanently gone.

I believe that the sotty/bv ineractions were and could easily be mafia interactions since BV unvoted a bunch of time and some of his posts seems really inconsistent with a hard sotty sr. It seemed like he bussed to be consistent with his read as town!BV which his actions/behaviors did not match it. Being consistant when you antagonized your partner is also a way to strenghten your town position since he literraly lynched a mafia pr-claiming, something that is really ballsy imo so everyone would believe he hard sr her right ? I think that town!BV wouldve been even more consistent with his reads on sotty as per votes and the wagons, i also think that EVEN SO he wouldve been more careful about lynching a pr claim. <br><br>The wierd interactions, speech/behaviors non-matching but still ends up lynching a pr claims all points to scumplay imho, maybe im confbiasing too but this is the general feeling i got, maria also relieved good points. So its not more as to get towncred but to be consistent + solidify position, he literally got hammer on me today because of it and if hes mafia, theres no reason to hammer me here when he can just night kill without a loss of cred yknow."}

The wagon has given me the reactions I needed so that's good. Apart from the stuff I mentioned about her back and forth with Sotty7 on D1, there's also the really early interactions where she says something is off with BBT and Sotty7 immediately agrees with her and pushes him. I hate that she cast around for counterwagons at the last minute during Sotty7's lynch but I just don't get the feeling that she already knew Sotty7's alignment.<br><br>I'm leaning more towards Rask. Here's my problem with Rask: reading him in ISO, there's never a point where I feel that him and Sotty7 are definitely not partners. He suspects Sotty7 early, cuts through her BBT scumread and votes her. Then he colors a wagon with Sotty7 as his strongest scumread but leaves open room for her being partnered with GreyICE. Then quickly moves over to Victor even though Victor was apparently a townread (a \"fringe townread\" but a townread nevertheless). The funny thing is, he does everything he can to work with GreyICE to push a counterwagon despite throwing around Sotty7/GreyICE team possibilities. I think he wanted towncred for being against the GreyICE wagon while at the same time leaving him lynchable if Sotty7 flipped. I'll add that Hoopla is right that him saying she wasn't doing anything to \"pressure\" Sotty7 may indicate a partner tell.<br><br>Then D2, he spends most of his time pushing GM. Some of his points are accurate - GM did in fact do nothing when GreyICE was getting lynched and she posts in a way that can be difficult to parse and understand at times. But there's no smoking gun, and no passion in this push. He is quick to switch over to Sotty7 when the counterwagon picks up. If he was so sure GM was scum, I think he'd be resisting the Sotty7 counterwagon but it feels almost like he knows she's scum and is being very, very careful not to look bad from a Sotty7 flip. There was one small place where he said he assumed Sotty7 was a mason that I thought looked like a not-partner tell but I don't think it's beyond him to fake. Hopping onto Sotty7 late D2 with \"oh, yeah GM could be a partner\" just mirrors his D1 where he pushes Sotty7 as a potential BBT/GreyICE partner.<br><br>The final straw for me that sealed it was that a lot of his points are regurgitated from others. For example, Victor was the one who brought up the fact that he was doing more than BBT so GM shouldn't suspect him. He also complained about GM not reading his posts. Rask brings up both these points in his GM push. This is more of a general trend in Rask's posting. There were times when I really liked his posting but many points he brings up are unoriginal and when I read the thread, I realize someone else had made that argument before (one example I'll give is that he came up with a paranoid theory that BBT and Sotty7 were together <span style=\"font-style: italic\">after</span> I suggested that they could be scum vs scum counterwagons). I've tried to see his POV but I just can't get behind his reads. GM does all the wrong things like voting Rask when scum was about to be lynched but she just <span style=\"font-style: italic\">doesn't fit </span> as a Sotty7 partner in the same way Rask does.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Raskolnikov</span>"}

You never do anything that might be perceived as bad in case she's scum. You don't stick with your GM vote when Sotty7 was being wagoned even though you seemed so, so sure GM was scum. You stay on the Hoopla wagon until I called her posts sincere and then you switch to Cloud. When it finally seemed as though Sotty7 was the one who would eat rope D2, you move gracefully onto her wagon. Out of my five options, you fit in best. GM doesn't.

This is the basis for my suspicion of you. GM's Sotty7 interactions are, let's say \"dirty\" for lack of a better word. But they are natural. Yours are clean and artificial-looking. <br><br>You never truly consider the possibility of Sotty7 being town. There are others who haven't, like TwoFace and Jaack but their interactions are completely different. Hyper-aggressive, tunnely town that have locked in on scum.

He insists it has to be two of GM, Hoopla, and MariaR but none of them make sense. GM's interactions with Sotty7 look bad but really aren't bad which I think Rask is ignoring. He's basically taking some of the annoying things GM is doing and calling them scummy. Creature hasn't been posting much lately but he's pretty steadfast in a townread there despite the other pairings not really fitting. I think he decided to townread Creature either to defend a partner or buddy a townie and is sticking with that."}

I have a hard time seeing a scumteam outside of Rask. The only one I can see is Creature and MariaR but it's a bit iffy. There's also the IAI nightkill. IAI mildly suspected Rask saying that he thought Rask was just telling him what he wanted to hear which is exactly how I felt about Rask at times. If no one sticks out as obviously scummy, I think it points to one of the better players being scum and Rask and Sotty7 fit as a team extremely well. One other thing - when Sotty7 started D2 by voting Rask, my initial thought was \"that's probably a bus vote.\" I think she anticipated pressure D2 based on the TwoFace kill and wanted to start by distancing."}

Hell, even I did it yesterday. It's clear these tells aren't as reliable as they have once been (I've often found these tells to be pretty town looking in the past), and I don't know which ones to discount and which ones to consider valid.

The Cloud claim fiasco notwithstanding, BlackVoid has still been the most reasonable player in the game, and his recent posts about Rask have summarised a feeling about him I've also had for a while, where Rask's actions seem to have knowledge that Sotty is scum and he is making sure he is preemptively positioning himself well in his actions/stances/attacks in case she flips.<br><br>I think townies occasionally will accidentally find themselves in incriminating interactions with scum who end up flipping (it's hard to not when you don't know who is scum), but you can exonerate them based on the thought that they probably didn't know that player would ultimately flip scum. I think the lack of these situations from Rask paints a picture of a well calculated and if I'm honest, brilliant exhibition of positional scumplay, but like BV says, there is an undertone of implicit knowledge that Sotty is scum.<br><br>This isn't in slamdunk territory for me, but I find it more believable that Rask got himself into pretty good positions as scum over say, goodmorning getting herself into pretty bad looking positions upon a Sotty flip.

It's largely a PoE-everyone-else-has-better-reasons-to-be-town thing, so it isn't particularly strong or relevant to Creature specifically, so I don't have a leg to stand on re: arguing Creature's alignment based on his play. I think my best point was his lack of commenting on the Sotty wagon, which had 4 votes at the time he logged off and went to bed -- so it's not like he slept through all of it. And, to be honest, it doesn't really matter if he did. If I find everyone else's interactions with Sotty to appear genuine, then no interaction is scummy by default."}

I have a hard time seeing a scumteam outside of Rask. The only one I can see is Creature and MariaR but it's a bit iffy. There's also the IAI nightkill. IAI mildly suspected Rask saying that he thought Rask was just telling him what he wanted to hear which is exactly how I felt about Rask at times. If no one sticks out as obviously scummy, I think it points to one of the better players being scum and Rask and Sotty7 fit as a team extremely well.

Rask was in the background and his vote always came when it looked like Sotty7 would be lynched. But it's never been Rask telling people that she should be lynched. He was quick to move to Victor D1 (MariaR also did this), spent most of his time on GM during the first D2 wagon, and voted Cloud before he voted Sotty7 on the final D2 wagon. Remember that Victor was an actual townread on Rask's when he voted him. Why so quick to abandon the Sotty7 wagon despite scumreading her, despite TwoFace continuing to push the wagon, despite his speculation that GreyICE was a Sotty7 partner? If he really believed that, he would have stuck with Sotty7 with the worst case being GreyICE would get lynched anyways. But he actively pushed Victor as a counterwagon."}

I will say that BV does have some valid points re: rask, and I think the IAI kill would be a great choice for scum!rask. Rask's most recent posts also strike me as a little spastic, which is weird considering that I'm not even sure 5 people are willing to vote rask right now?<br><br>Honestly if we could just magically start a MariaR wagon again that would be rad.

For instance, incorrectly assuming that a scum is town or that a townie is scum. That's something I never see with Rask.<br><br>Take these two back-to-back posts for example:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8445747#p8445747\" class=\"postlink\">post 342</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">I THINK I like sotty now</span>, although it really doesn't help that I saw her mentioned in the goat thread, and now that I check again its for scumplay no less.<br><br>PoE is actually starting to push BBT and IAI down at this point...

But then immediately he accuses Hoopla of not pressuring Sotty7. He doesn't outright say it but the implication is that he thinks Hoopla and Sotty7 are partners and that Hoopla is distancing from Sotty7 but not really pushing her. So, that post is made with an underlying assumption that Sotty7 is scum. <br><br>That's the core of my Rask suspicion summarized into a single paragraph. Throughout the game, he always works with the assumption that Sotty7 is scum. He never develops reads with the assumption that she's town even when he calls her town.<br><br>Also, voting a \"fringe townread\" Victor is really bad given the three posts below.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8462714#p8462714\" class=\"postlink\">post 654</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite><span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">GreyICE (6)</span></span> - <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sotty7</span></span> , <span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hoopla</span></span> , <span style=\"color: #BFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MichelSableheart</span></span> , <span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">BlackVoid</span></span> , <span style=\"color: #BFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">VictorDeAngelo</span></span> ,<span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> I Am Innocent</span></span> L-1, <br><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sotty7 (3)</span></span> - <span style=\"color: #80FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Jaack</span></span> , <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Raskolnikov</span></span> , <span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">TwoFace</span></span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8462820#p8462820\" class=\"postlink\">post 669</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite>sotty/bbt theory still holds up though and especially against the why-no-cw logic</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8465605#p8465605\" class=\"postlink\">post 858</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Victor</span></div></blockquote><br>GreyICE is a null read that could be partnered with his major scumread Sotty7 (which explains why no counterwagons), but he wants to go for a fringe townread anyways.

Not to mention MichelSableheart voting the BBT counterwagon to Sotty7. If I have to take a guess, I'd probably go with Creature/Rask as our team. I'll try and see if there's anything at all that might contradict that view. Goodmorning, if you are town here and think Creature is scum, look at how the two of them subtly removed each other from their scumlists and vote Rask please."}

You certainly haven't been playing \"scummy\" or badly. On the contrary, I thought you were being far more reasonable than most.

I'm still agonizing over this although you can't tell from the way I make pushes and I have D1 open in a separate tab looking for anything that might contradict you being scum.<br><br>I don't have a strong townread on Hoopla and it's possible that when she saw herself and Sotty7 both being pressured, they decided a one-way bus of the person who made a PR claim was their best shot. But there's still the way Sotty7 buddied her on D1 and Hoopla never buddied her back that makes me think it was Sotty7-scum and Hoopla-town. I also think that Sotty7 enlisting MariaR's help in pushing Jaack and using her Jaack push as a reason to townread her is something scum do to town. That's more likely than two scum just deciding to push Jaack and townreading each other for making the same push. That leaves us with GM. I'm still looking for any indication that might point her way and coming up short."}

He had reasoning like \"if it was a really good bus as you theorise then why weren't you convinced by it?\" and \"oh you defending yourself like this is the classic scum move when they're under pressure\" and so on and we kept having arguments where after days and days it broke down and I basically called him ignorant and delusional and he told me to get bent, and literally replacements into the game are what saved me because they had different views and weren't around early. The worst part was scum wasn't even playing well they were actually completely terrible and obvious because it looked like an easy win.<br><br>Even I was having some trouble because none of the teams made sense with a third but I followed my individual reads and stuck true, and finally we got the lynch in lylo because he \"would feel less bad losing to me-scum than lurkersac obvscummcgee\" and didn't even really change his mind, and won right there as it turned out it was actually traitor third in the end (I know this is a HUGE taboo to ever mention or bring up for some reason but fuck it) and if I did a single conciliatory action or listened to anybody else that game was a loss.

I felt that he has towntelled and the flip only added to that feeling. I see your point on Cloud but I agree he's town anyways so we're on the same page there. What do you think of GM's catchup? I thought there was too little evolution of reads and when the rest of us have been trying pretty hard to figure out what was going on and reconsidered reads several times, she's just happy to dish out age-old townreads with no intention of reconsidering them or seeing who she might be wrong about.</div></blockquote><br><br>I simply don't think Jack has posted enough to warrant such universally townread status, no matter what he's done in those posts. In a game like this where everyone is towntelling, you can't discount the guy with 74 posts when the rest of the town has 200-400.<br><br>I'm not enthused by gm's catchup and I think her/Creature is probably my top pairing atm. I'm less sure about Rask as I was yesterday and don't even know who a good partner for him is. I don't think he posts so manically and frantically if Jack is his partner - what's the point when you know you probably have the game in the bag and can compromise onto so many wagons? Really, all of Rask's partners are pretty weird. Creature is a strong connection, goodmorning was a turbo-bus yesterday... I guess Maria makes the most sense with Rask, but even that's, eh. I think it's just Rask's playstyle I can see him doing something creative or awesome as scum and when I can't figure who it'd be without him in it, it makes me want to delve into the paranoia. It's why I'm considering Jack also.<br><br>I don't think Creature/Maria or goodmorning/Creature are a thing, so goodmorning/Creature is the only team that makes sense (and maybe Rask/Maria) without something really weird going on. Even now goodmorning wants Creature dead tho, soooo I don't know. When I flesh it out like this, I kinda see why people think I'm suspicious. There's just not that many good and obvious teams."}

I also think that Sotty7 enlisting MariaR's help in pushing Jaack and using her Jaack push as a reason to townread her is something scum do to town. That's more likely than two scum just deciding to push Jaack and townreading each other for making the same push. That leaves us with GM.

GM started that yesterday I think and MariaR latched onto it. I've been townreading Jaack independent of Sotty7's flip and with that flip, I just don't see any way Jaack bussed her the way he did. The Jaack suspicion is likely coming from scum who don't want to get eliminated quickly based on pairings. Based on today's posting, Cloud has been my strongest townread along with Jaack... which isn't really helpful since I was virtually certain they both were town anyways.<br><br>We've got a pool of four: MariaR, Rask, GM, Creature. Here's what I want from each of you. Make a case on who you think the scumteam is, based off of interactions with Sotty7 as well as each other. If you are town, you know that two of the remaining three are scum. Who is it?<br><br>I'm not happy enough with Rask's \"I'm pushing GM and none of the non-GM teams work.\" Because GM-Creature doesn't really work as GM was pushing him all along and he seemed completely certain that Creature was town anyways. From his POV, it has to be GM/MariaR but he isn't pushing MariaR.<br><br>MariaR's strong townread on Rask is bordering on improbable. If she's town, she should know that scum are two of GM/Creature/Rask but suddenly decides to bring Jaack into the lynchpool.<br><br>I don't like GM's suggestion of telling us to lynch her today. If you are town, you are wrong on one of your townreads on Rask, and MariaR. It would be really helpful if you could point out where you think you went wrong.<br><br>Creature - what do you think of Rask now? Who's scum? <br><br>Anyways, I think I want MariaR or Rask today.

Two scum, three town. If you vote Rask and no one hammers, that confirms either you or Rask as scum.

Again, anecdotal, but as scum I love to complain about \"oh no I have to do this because everyone else\" and not take responsibility or effort into fighting against it and changing people's minds (for obvious reasons)... she didn't really push gm with much effort before complaining like this, if you look at the iso.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Hoopla</span></div></blockquote><br><br>She pretty much talk about hoop, bv and Creature slot a lot but doesnt talk about sotty/twoface.

That only works if I'm alive tomorrow though. I can't stop Cloud from just voting Rask.<br><br>That's why I think waiting on a replacement is good. I want to read the GM-slot from a different angle."}

For example, telling Sotty7 that she wasn't interested in helping her produce content and shutting her out while Sotty7 takes a more consoling and placatory stance towards GM, trying to butter her up and engage her. If scum-theater was what they wanted, I think GM would be happy to have back and forth arguments with Sotty7 but that just doesn't look like it.

I don't know when you started townreading Creature. It seemed to just magically pop up and the read became incredibly strong. This is odd to me because Creature is far from obviously town.

Obviously, I agree. Where we disagree on is who the scum actually is. I've read over GM and I'm conflicted but still see some of her Sotty7 interactions as weird to come from partners. You had a similar degree of certainty when you pushed Hoopla. Even if you are town, you could be wrong and I don't think going with your most certain read day after day even when you are wrong is viable from my standpoint. I don't know your alignment.

He just said you are playing differently than you did in another game. How and what differences there are, he never explains. MariaR also uses \"meta\" to read you without explaining why your meta here is your town meta. I don't think it is at all unlikely that Creature and MariaR are partners. I've brought this up several times and everyone just says that's not the team. Maybe quotes will help me see what I'm obviously missing."}

Havingfitz didn't even mention it, and in general his analysis seems to have had an agenda behind it (fitting the facts to the story rather than interpreting the facts). Regaring me, he said he would ISO me later in that original vote/vca post and never ended up doing it, including now, and I don't get it at all how he's forming these views without that.

Its not an actual crumb imo in the sens of it but i remember i tried to push the idea to actually test the tracker because Sotty couldve proved to me, i said that many times.<br><br>My whole d2 reason not to lynch sotty was because i wanted to be on her that day and maybe try to track outside, if this happened i wouldve crumbed who i was going on [sotty] to possibly clear her and wins a ml since we wouldnt have to lynch sotty anymore because she was virtually scumread by most of the town, that was essentially my plan. Also from slight setup meta on specs, i believe that town masons + track + weak-ish proctective role did made sens since theres over 1 investigative and 1 protective in most setup. <br><br>I also wanted to further get reads from a lynch outside the sotty claim because imo it was optimal in every way. <br><br>If i was on sotty and i get killed for it, sotty is clear, we win ml, her track is considered true++. I also seriously doubted that i wouldve been killed while not bodyguarding if Sotty was mafia, because i hard defended the shit out of her, not reason ti nightkill me the mason claim. <br><br>If the flip outside her was incriminating Sotty i wouldve probably no bodyguard or on the mason claim, idk i didnt actually think too much about it but that was essentially my state of mind.<br><br>The reason why i didnt want to full claim is because i expected to trade myself at somepoint in the game with another pr or a clear, claiming here just kill me pretty much and makes me completly useless. As far as meta goes and from em, protective roles should almost never claim. <br><br>When sonia said that i was hardtrying today, i even reminded her the game when i got lynched as doc because i didnt claim, that was another soft and she mightve picked it up? idk she didnt push on me.</div></blockquote>"}

I still believe that creature isnt with mariar for the whole day, the voting pattern would need paranoia for me to make them as mafia here, so again, it all points to rask/fitz. BV counted on me to lynch rask on lylo, the thing is, i wont survive to lylo and jack wont lynch her. I also think that jack kind tr creature (like i do from the flip) and would lynch fitz in the case that rask flip town, which all works out considering my reads that creat/mariar not a team, fitz/rask not a team and jack town.

Reading through this morning from when I replaced in to the game up to now though has me thinking the last scum is Rask.<br><br>If Rask is scum...she's already shown a propensity for bussing (ex Sotty) so a Maria hammer is within reason.  Though up to Maria's hammer yesterday Rask had only voted Maria once...with her first vote of the game (RVS?).<br><br>Rask has never voted Creature in this game and yesterday when Creature got to L-1...if Creature is town...then Rask would have taken a lot of shit for hammering someone she has been town reading (?) most of the game.  This was blatently spelled out to Cloud when he told Rask that a Creature townflip would essentially be a scum claim by Rask.  This prevented Rask from hammering her town read and only left 2 options.  Me (who wagon momentum had petered out) and Maria...who was looking like a shoe in with both BBV and Cloud on it (along with me).   Speaking of along with me...If I was the last scum this same point regarding Rask and a Creature hammer did not apply to me.  As mentioned earlier...if any of you put any stock in meta, I absolutely would have hammered Creature to save a scum partner.  Rask did not have this luxury though and went for the 2nd scum lynch.  Not as good as getting a mislynch but if the lynch was inevitable she might as well get some town cred.<br><br>I also feel like a lot of the things Rask (and Creature to be fair) have said/pushed today have been trying to use NAI events to push suspicion towards me.  But Rask's push seems more thought out than Creature's.  I think Creature is shooting from the hip without much thought or filter whereas Rask is trying too hard to push a bs case.<br><br>I hope Rask is today's lynch and the game is over.  If not...my vote tomorrow will revert to Creature.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Rask</span>"}

So by meta specs wise, my claim is not less or more believable than an universal backup and 1-shot bodyguard is a weak protective role <br>- Rask, hoop, BV and eventually jaack all accepted my claims and eventually townread me. If any of them had any issues with me for about the last 50 pages, they wouldve said something, they didnt, im town ty<br>- I am new to the forum mafia game, i dont know specs much. Like rask said, if it was a fake claim, i would need some sort of coaching and rask didnt believe that sotty couldve since she fosed hoop for coaching the possible fake claim, hoop was town. That leave mariar who could coach me, mariar has also not so much experience. So either i random nailed spec-wise a pr claim as inexperienced player on a setup where only 2 masons claimed, that makes it even more likely, or im just, you know, 1-shot bg."}

In this game, it's not an open setup, but the masons are ALSO confirmed.  This is substantially different than, say, cop/doc/1-shot BP (or whatever the three town prs might be), where it's realistic that one of the claims is simply lying.  So in both this setup and that open setup, the masons are automatically confirmed, which means that one of the two standard advantages for town of open setups (actual PR claims are known to be real roles in the game) is irrelevant, espeically since it's virtually impossible for 3x masons to NOT be self-confirming (since only one can die each night, and it's a pretty notable advantage for town if all survive night one [which actually did happen]).<br><br>Moreover, the secondary town advantage of an open setup (you can't fake-claim a random role as scum) was ALSO not really a big difference here.  On day 2, sotty claimed tracker (a fake claim that in many mini normals can be taken as reasonable and buy some extra time), and was lynched anyway (you can debatably make a case that her fake claim made it MORE likely she was lynched as it didn't fit in setup at all, even though she had no real reason to have known at the time that it wouldn't fit into the setup, which meant that it was town-POSITIVE that she ended up fake claiming the way she did).<br><br>Later on, cloud fake-claimed 1-shot BG (and it's notable that his wagon was more \"just claim dammit\" as opposed to \"we really think you're mafia), and town made the conscious choice to treat it as conf!town without really scrutinizing either how it did (or didn't) fit into the setup or how his claim fit into the framework of \"omg my role is super important\" that he'd already established (and my goodness it didn't fit the outsize importance he'd pretended to have).<br><br>So in terms of setup, I think it was fine for balance.  Town had three HARD clears (and lest we forget, the masons got early pressure, so that very plausibly prevented at least one mislynch), scum had chances to make self-dooming fake claims (and in fact one did), and the game went down to the wire, with some good plays and some bad plays by both sides, and the result wasn't due to setup balance.  To me that suggests that balance was fine.<br><br>PS My apologies to all about the speed deadline error.  I'm glad that in the end didn't impact the result."}

There you made sense especially when Eagersnake was getting wagoned and suspected Boring so I had you as a townread pretty early on. You might say that you never defend partners before but there's a first time for everything and the way you dug your heels in and defended Sotty7 didn't feel genuine and it didn't show the same depth of thought I expected from you as town.
