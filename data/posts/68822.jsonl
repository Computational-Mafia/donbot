The only way to do that, is to look at the actions players take, and see why they would take them from a town POV, and why they would take them from a scum POV, and determine which is more likely.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cloud wrote:</cite>'' Because town needs information on the most important question of the game (who is scum), whereas scum is fully informed on that matter, your posts do not benefit town as much as they should.''<br>\n<br>\nCouldve just been<br>\n<br>\n''your posts do not benefit town as much as they should''</div></blockquote>I wanted to make the assumption explicit, as I wasn't in the mood to answer the question \"Why?\".<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cloud wrote:</cite>You acknowledged that people do use the random votes even tho you dont personally like it, why do you even fos someone for doing it then ? Just because you disagree with it doesnt mean its scummy.</div></blockquote>No, I acknowledge the existence of something called the Random Voting Stage. That name is a bit of a misnomer, though. It should actually be called Arbitrary Voting Stage. An arbitrary vote is a vote that may or may not have a reason behind it, and that therefore can be analysed. Arbitrary votes aren't great for starting discussion, but they can work. IAmInnocent and goodmorning placed arbitrary votes.<br>\n<br>\nA random vote, on the other hand, does not have a reason behind its target at all. It is verifiable for everyone that it was placed on a random player. Knowing that there isn't a reasoning, they are less likely to start discussion. Hoopla used dice tags, and then voted based on her result. That's a random vote, and intrinsically anti-town.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>BlackVoid wrote:</cite>By your theory, not voting at all is just as bad. Any reason you didn't comment on my and TwoFace's lack of vote?</div></blockquote>Someone who posts strong comments, but doesn't vote, does far more to get discussion started then someone who arbitrarily votes, without commenting at all. You two at least posted comments that others could react to.

If an opinion is convenient to hold on to, you can later say it was serious. If inconvenient, you can say it wasn't.<br>\nBut in this case that feels like a stretch. You voted on dice and then said you voted not for it which implied it was at least somewhat serious, as well as what you said about switching.

Anyone can realise the issue here; if someone is disingenuous and saying things they don't mean as town, you are not any different from scum being disingenuous and saying things they don't mean. This behaviour from town makes scumhunting difficult so it shouldn't be allowed on principle past RVS (is this still rvs?) unless it's very obvious to be joking, which evidently it was not. And it gives scum an out when people do find a slip up.<br>\n<br>\nIt also just annoys me, but that's because I am a uptight bastard who gets bothered seeing people all cheerful-like and having fun...

That said, I like your tone and for page five I've seen worst cases.  <br>\n<br>\nI don't want to step on Hoopla's toes because gambits are the name of her game.  I find her generally hard to get a read on in the early game so I tend to sort her town and let her out herself as scum as the game draws on.  It helps that I value her as an extremely strong town player and would really like to tag team on this game if she is indeed town.  Because of this I found Rask's initial case and vote on Hoopla weak, but most of it could be down to a lack of experience with her which could be understandable.  However, Rask's vote remains despite Hoopla's reasonable responses to his points.  <br>\n<br>\nI like BBT more for scum at this point.  He came in with a vote on Rask to start a wagon, there were already two other players with two votes at the time Blackvoid and gm.  It seems to be an attempt to sort Rask which comes quick and with no further elaboration.  I would have expected more considering the history they both speak to.  Feels like he started the wagon then panicked a little when it took off.  I also remember BBTScum being very no nonsense cutting to the heart of the matter, were as townBBT being more open.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: BBT</div><br>\n<br>\nRask - What do you think of BBT now?

Great job everyone!<br>\n<br>\nMore and more these days, I'm starting to believe that the first opening wagon that gets to L-1 or L-2 tends to be town a lot more often than random. Typically the less information in the game and the sooner it happens increases the likelihood of it being town. Why I think this is a trend is that at the beginning of the game any vote can be justified and there's no real information to go on, so there is more incentive for scum to plump existing wagons on town rather than their buddies. There's not really any incentive to distance heavily at the start of the game, because there's no punishment or scrutiny for voting town. Sure, scum still will vote each other from time to time, but there are more barriers along the way in order to achieve a L-1 or L-2 wagon on scum early, whereas when a town wagon emerges there's no hidden opposition ignoring it/voting it elsewhere -- everyone is considering it earnestly, as such, they tend to balloon quicker than scums. <br>\n<br>\nTo lynch scum, you need a lot of town zeroing in on the same wavelength or scum helping you. It's very hard to produce that perfect storm of town hivemindedness without genuine information that many players can agree on. And scum help is less likely early in the game, as they don't feel under pressure to distance themselves from each other -- convincing information pressures scum to distance. The reason for Raskol's wagon was decent, but I don't think scum helps us on this wagon very often (if Raskol is scum) and I don't think the reason is good enough to get five townies to vote him that often. It's easier combinatorially to assume Raskol is town and that scum have aided this wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have enough data to say for sure how pronounced this pattern is, but I think it exists and have been investigating it recently.

He came in with a vote on Rask to start a wagon, there were already two other players with two votes at the time Blackvoid and gm.  It seems to be an attempt to sort Rask which comes quick and with no further elaboration.  I would have expected more considering the history they both speak to.  Feels like he started the wagon then panicked a little when it took off.  I also remember BBTScum being very no nonsense cutting to the heart of the matter, were as townBBT being more open.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: BBT</div><br>\n<br>\nRask - What do you think of BBT now?  Is my meta outdated?</div></blockquote>\nLol. I don't have enough content to read BBT as of yet here, so your conclusion could actually be right, but for all the wrong reasons.<br>\nI'm pretty sure he isn't incompetent as to join a clearly growing wagon and not expect it to continue growing, or to \"panic\" from the l-2 and have that justify his next actions... I think your meta is really bad here. <br>\nFrom what I remember from my research BBT has no fear hardpushing mislynches, him at the forefront, no fucks given*. So to imagine him as an innocent scum babe not knowing what he was getting into and then overreacting/panicking from something like this doesn't fit at all.<br>\n<br>\nIf BBT is scum who actually wanted to lynch me, he wouldn't join the early wagon like this for the reason of \"wanting to get a wagon going\", but instead have built up a serious case and powerpushed it. Probably near mid-end of day as well for more likely results. He knows how to push, with or without case, so he wouldn't half-ass something he wants to get done; saying you vote for the sake of getting a wagon going early would inherently undermine that goal. <br>\n<br>\nIf he's scum his intentions would have been different than that and more sophisticated. The better theory is; he, as scum saw an opportunity there to join that early wagon, expect pressure and me to towntell and then the chance to be one of the first to call me town and then try to work with me, and get me onside against the others who have voted me. He would know I'd fight strongly against the lynch and give the opportunity that a turn like that would be plausible. In other words, the complete opposite intention as what you proposed. He knows from experience I'd have a hard time trusting him so this would be a chance for him to try to have a rapport/buddying with me through this; that would be the actual incentive.<br>\n<br>\nWhich realistically is a still a conspiracy theory... I could easily see this play from his as town too, and I can't judge as of yet. His default playstyle is very low information especially earlygame and there's a \"it's just day 1 I'm not overthinking things yet\" element I remember seeing from town-him. With this wagon though and pressure, I do look forward to seeing more in-depth reasoning and information though. It would be easier to judge the turn if it was explained why he townread me and changed his mind. In any case I'll need some more time on this.<br>\n<br>\nThis aside, I haven't read up fully yet, but I myself hope to find something I do think is probably scum to vote as opposed to \"well I don't know he ISN'T scum\" paranoia.<br>\n<br>\n*possibly not that different from his t game OOOH BURN *sizzle* <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\">", "time": "Fri Oct 21, 2016 7:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

If I'm following correctly, you townread from specific meta but wonder (and initially assumed) BBT may or may not have read for the same reasons. But I'd assume if you townread someone from specific meta you have with them, no one came to that read the same way as you, or even could have. You seem to partially realise this in the last quote but it's still a bit huh. In no universe would I think someone is reading someone the same way I am if I'm using super specific meta (which like, secret tells I've never shared).", "time": "Fri Oct 21, 2016 7:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

Okay, but I can't follow it without an explanation. The implication is this isn't random.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8439744#p8439744\">112</a> is after BBT voted and unvoted on me,gm says  \"I kind of want to vote Toffee now but I really don't want to forget about Victor.\". I think this justification is a little strange, I'm curious as to how the rvs post could warrant this suspicion over if you didn't like bbt's play around the wagon. Victor's 2nd post of the game is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8441130#p8441130\">162</a> which is afterwards so I have to conclude GM has a problem with the 1st.<br>\n<br>\nThen after victor posted more, gm explained his read on both bbt and victor as scum for not doing anything, and later that victor was far worse than bbt.

Things like dice tag voting are just reaction testing things she does.  He would then go on to push Hoopla's suspicion of gm which I felt was pretty obvious how strong that was.

For you to start the game with a dice vote and follow it up with a couple of whimsical posts feels to me like you went deliberately off meta in order to provoke reactions.

As you mentioned, you, me, and IAI also aren't posting much. Yet in the case of IAI, it's pretty clear that he's simply not been here. And with you and me, there is some actual content in the posts we do posts. Whereas BBT's four posts are all oneliners containing unexplained reads.<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I find it difficult to develop good reads from the last 10 pages. There's a lot of talking going on, but a lot of it is arguing on things that don't seem all that relevant, nor all that alignement indicative.

Overall, she hasn't given me any reason to be suspicious of her, but I can easily see scum her fake the level of townieness she's currently displaying. I'm currently townreading her, but mainly because each individual player has a better chance of being town then being scum a priori. <br>\n<br>\nMaria is a bit of a spamposter. Coming from chat mafia into games with 2 week deadlines will do that for you, I suppose. As for a read on her: I don't have much on her either, sorry. The game I played with her where she was town, she completely flipped out when she felt she got unfairly pressured. The game I played with her where she was scum, I mainly remember the way she argued that a townslip made by her scumpartner could have been an intentional slip, and managed to do this in such a way that the argument was completely ignored. Nothing of the sort has happened in this game yet, so the only thing I can tell you is that her tone here seems to be generally consistent with what I saw in her town game.", "time": "Sat Oct 22, 2016 6:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

But I didn't like his accusation that MariaR was fencesitting on Sotty7 because I had the exact same reaction as MariaR did to Sotty7's post. <br>\n<br>\nBesides that, he made two separate accusations: He accused MariaR of fencesitting on Sotty7 in the event a wagon takes off. This implies that Sotty7 is town and MariaR is looking to opportunistically join that wagon. He also accused MariaR of trying to \"sync\" her reads with Sotty7 which is a buddying accusation which also only makes sense with Sotty7-town.<br>\n<br>\nWhile I can buy that some people have reads independent of everything else, the bulk of BBT's MariaR suspicion seems to be based on how she played around Sotty7. So, it's unbelievable for me that he's happy to lynch either one.

Your read on BBT is a little weird in retrospect. You say you expect better from him as early as page five. Then, you say that BBT was at least better than Victor for spending time on his Rask read. But all BBT had done up till that point was pressure Rask, back off and call him town for no reason. I can't see how he was better than Victor here especially since you seem to expect more from him.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's your take on the competing wagons of BBT and Sotty7. You spent the early game throwing suspicion at BBT but he always takes a backseat for you, first behind Victor, now behind Sotty7. I dislike everything about your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8452995#p8452995\">528</a>. You quote posts of BBT where he says he needs time to invest in the game and call it an okay answer. If someone is inactive, it already means that they don't have time for the game. BBT showing up and saying that is a very mundane answer and I don't understand what you found okay about it. You even go so far as to tell Victor to \"leave off Toffee\" which makes zero sense given Toffee is a scumread for you.<br>\n<br>\nWhy do you even suspect Sotty7 anyways? I don't think you've given any reason for it. Given BBT is explicitly a scumread for you, I find your preference of the Sotty7 wagon highly suspect.<br>\n<br>\nI also have a hard time understanding your townread on me. You call me town early but then cast suspicion on me for \"trying too hard.\" You make a few vague accusations that you don't fully explain. Can you tell me what you meant in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8441128#p8441128\">161</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8442426#p8442426\">224</a>? After that, I call you town and then there's no mention at all about my previous \"tryharding,\" you just townread me back. It looks like you think you can pocket me because I was townreading you and there's no progression there that makes sense from a town POV. I found it odd that you refute my townread on you despite reading me as town. Your other reads (like on TwoFace for not getting a joke) also feel really weak.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I don't feel comfortable at all with the Sotty7 wagon although I want Sotty7's answers to my questions anyways.

She does leave her BBT read swinging in the wind opting instead to push on Victor, who I think is very likely town.

Here we go.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAs a veteran irascible asshole, let me assure you of two things.  First, you don't necessarily change because you're scum.  Second, being townread is simply a tool to lynch scum.  If people town read you they're more willing to listen to you, if they're more willing to listen to you, they're more willing to vote with you.  Certainly we none of us think Victor is ambivalent about who gets lynched, yes?  <br>\n<br>\nSo early on Victor was getting significant pressure.  A feud with GoodMorning, several votes, people pushing him, etc.  He had to defend himself.  Then it tapered off.  What did Victor do?  He tapered off.  It's not like any of his comments were particularly insightful or probing earlier, but after the town read?  He didn't try and sell a single person on voting GoodMorning.  He just was happy to leave his vote there until the \"oh gee, I guess I better join the wagon under duress\".<br>\n<br>\nThat's supremely weak.  You get town read, you use it to smash home wagons on scum.  You don't sit there and wank off about it.  Even useless prickly people like Furcolow try to push wagons home on people they think are scum (yes, Furcolow was supremely bad at it, but his inevitable detonations were because no one would listen to him).  Victor prickles, but then backs down.  It's weak as hell.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you want to talk since then, he's been the most passionate about how we shouldn't shoot IAI.  That's funny.  He's been on site since 2013, he's very well aware that many extremely strong players have the philosophy that vigs should default to shooting useless lurkers precisely because they have no content and its hard to read them.  This is not a controversial opinion or one that is rarely voiced, it's very mainstream, and IAI is the prime candidate of this town under that.  The \"at least people would have to take a stance\" thing is super weird.  Does he think that scum wouldn't bus IAI?  It's not like he's playing well at all.  It just seems an attempt to preserve IAI's life without actually doing much that would commit him one way or the other.  It's a very weird stance to take.  More interestingly he didn't even argue the scum should shoot Goodmorning.  He just wanted it to be not-IAI, he didn't even think of Goodmorning getting shot.  That's very, very odd for someone who is so strongly reading her as scum.  He's strongly reading her, but he isn't really willing to push her and doesn't even think of having a vig shoot her?  That's downright off. <br>\n<br>\nSo as to why I'm scum reading him, yes.", "time": "Thu Oct 27, 2016 3:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

As a result I've probably skimmed a few of your posts.  But honestly your reasoning in 565 is weak.  \"You should focus more on X than Y\" is silly.  It basically boils down to \"in my opinion X is scummier\" and unless you think someone is transparently manufacturing reasons to make reads, it's a point so weak it's non-existent (protip: everyone is inconsistent if you squint hard enough.  Yes, even you).    I mean honestly your entire case is \"she's scum with you\" which I know factually isn't true.  Sooooo... yeah.  It's just factually not a thing that is true.  If that's it, I can rest assured whatever else happens you're not mislynching her, so I think we're good on this one.  <br>\n<br>\nHey, wanna see something interesting though?

That's funny.  He's been on site since 2013, he's very well aware that many extremely strong players have the philosophy that vigs should default to shooting useless lurkers precisely because they have no content and its hard to read them.  This is not a controversial opinion or one that is rarely voiced, it's very mainstream, and IAI is the prime candidate of this town under that.  The \"at least people would have to take a stance\" thing is super weird.  Does he think that scum wouldn't bus IAI?  It's not like he's playing well at all.  It just seems an attempt to preserve IAI's life without actually doing much that would commit him one way or the other.  It's a very weird stance to take.</div></blockquote>\n\nPassionate? Off like one or two posts. Again, you're reaching here. IAI is a bad vig because his death tells us nothing. If you think he's scum (and you seem to be suggesting it quite heavily here) then push his wagon. <br>\nAlso, if you had reread thoroughly you'd see he was vla for a largish chunk of the game, so the lack of content arguments are null.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>More interestingly he didn't even argue the scum should shoot Goodmorning.  He just wanted it to be not-IAI, he didn't even think of Goodmorning getting shot.  That's very, very odd for someone who is so strongly reading her as scum.  He's strongly reading her, but he isn't really willing to push her and doesn't even think of having a vig shoot her?  That's downright off. </div></blockquote>\n\nWell obviously I don't think scum will shoot my scumread :p<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, you were advocating an IAI shot which I think is a bad idea.

She made a weak initial push on me, one of the inactives. After I kind of shut that down and she failed to get any traction she moved away, but after interest in me organically sprung up she was back to voting me. It felt more like she was scum who had me as one of her own designated scumreads than town actually convinced I was scum.<br>\n<br>\nBut with Maria kind of pushing back on most of the others' reasons for scumreading me (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8462738#p8462738\">656</a>) I do feel better about her.", "time": "Fri Oct 28, 2016 2:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

If Sotty is scum, then I'd say it points towards Victor town, since she'd have had to have made a conscious decision to support his towniness, and then left him off her reads list after specifically deciding how to treat her buddy?  If it was most other players I'd dismiss the possibility out of hand, but Sotty might think to do that.  Regardless, I think that the more likely explanation is the simple one.  Sotty is town, she thought of some town reads off her head when she was asked, she didn't think of victor.  <br>\n<br>\nAs for the buddying... I honestly don't see it.  Buddying is like \"oh you're such a strong player\" only not quite that transparent.  She says she thinks Victor is town.  I mean that's not exactly buddying, I might think someone is town but think their posts are shit (see: ClownFucker)", "time": "Sat Oct 29, 2016 6:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

So, how are you saying that the BBT/GreyICE wagon is going through without resistance when all your scumreads are either on the Sotty7 counterwagon or said that they would join it?<br>\n<br>\nYou also said having time to assess a claim is good. But to get claims, you need to put someone at L-1 with intent to hammer. If you unvote because you are afraid of a hammer, you won't get claims so I found that counterproductive because you'd be delaying a claim from someone that the majority including you agreed was a good wagon.", "time": "Sat Oct 29, 2016 7:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

Good Morning to did not have one positive post either. BBT was the only of my scum reads to have a good post, and it was for his early vote on the Rask wagon since I saw something there early on. Of course Rask has since been more townie, so that one post doesn't offset the number of bad posts/scum tell that slot dropped.</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm sorry, but how at all is this a useful reads list? And then bragging about it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8464598#p8464598\">780</a>? You literally have no justification for anything. The only two actual references to something that's happened are something scummy you thought hoopla did (while you are townreading that slot) and something towny you though BBT did (you are scumreading that slot).<br>\n<br>\nNow you can say you have this magical list and you aren't going to share it because \"they'll stop dropping those scumtells\" but that makes your accusations 100% useless. Especially considering you go against that in the quoted post - you do give an example of something scummy that Hoopla did. So give evidence or stop parading around as some town paragon. Even if GI and I are scum (which I'm not, and I don't think GI is either) and we would purposely stop dropping these scumtells, it doesn't mean they don't already exist in thread as evidence.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8464771#p8464771\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8464771#p8464771\" data-post-id=\"8464771\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 795</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1495\">Sotty7</a> wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8463995#p8463995\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8463995#p8463995\" data-post-id=\"8463995\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 754</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26257\">Jaack</a> wrote:</cite>This feels contradictory.

I push Twoface hard and we have an extensive back and forth that could have easily became a death tunnel.  I am interacting and questioning twoface who starts off answering me and then just really falls back to insulting and taking pot shots at me.

Vote them then disappear for several pages and never interacting or questioning them again like you have been doing with me?</div></blockquote>\n\nUpon further examination, I will concede this. I didn't originally feel as if your discussions with TwoFace were particularly productive and it felt more like you were biding your time until BBT came back and you could focus on him again. On a second read, I don't think you're pushes on TwoFace are as intense as your pushes on BBT, which does give me pause, but it's the smoking gun I considered it before.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the shade on me, I get it. I screwed up by being lazy and not participating for a good section of this game. If I get lynched for it that's on me.

{"number": 883, "id": "8465928", "user": "BlackVoid", "user_id": "28560", "content": "@GreyICE, okay let's talk. I'm assuming you are town. From my previous list, I'm still townreading Victor, IAI, TwoFace, goodmorning, Jaack, and Cloud. I need to think on Sotty7 a little but probably town. I think MariaR is unlikely to be partnered with Hoopla so conditionally town.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves Hoopla, Rask, and MichelSableheart's slot who I think is the scumteam if you are town. Is there a reason you have Rask as such strong town? Quite frankly, I don't think a passing comment from Rask about him changing his playstyle is a towntell. All he said was \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Disclaimer, I'm on a loss streak and I'm going to be changing my style here a bit.</div>\" That's nowhere near as big as you are saying it is and is probably something he planned to do no matter what alignment he drew.<br>\n<br>\nAs for why I suspect him (this also answers MariaR's question): I think a lot of his early play feels contrived. After the wagon formed on him, he went through each vote dissecting them when it was basically a semi-RVS wagon. So early in the game, it didn't make sense to go through each vote as opposed to just pushing whoever he thought was scum. It looked like he was trying to do the towny thing and \"analyze\" the votes on him. <br>\n<br>\nI know you start skimming once you townread someone but I really think Rask's early posts are worth a close read. Look at his Hoopla push in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8438367#p8438367\">70</a>. It's entirely nonsensical. Hoopla never justified a vote on him based on associatives. I think he's overselling his Hoopla scumread. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8438634#p8438634\">92</a> is a bit of a stretch. \"Am I in the twilight zone\" looked fake in context. His complaints about Hoopla's playstyle also seem overdone.<br>\n<br>\nI think Sotty7 is right that once Rask got townread, he faded out, not to mention he seemed to completely forget his scumread on Hoopla which suddenly resurfaced. <br>\n<br>\nWhat does he do now? He white-knighted you over the past couple of days. But when your wagon stalled at a critical point and it didn't look like it would go through without his support, he floats paranoia about how good you are and how he could be wrong. He is setting up to vote you closer to deadline while giving lip-service to Hoopla to appease you. But his vote ultimately falls on Victor who I'm reading as town. So, what am I missing? By the way, I think you are tunneling a bit on Victor and IAI.

I like to move around my vote a lot, build wagons and then promote compromise early in the game because too often players won't relinquish ego and create stalemates that last until the eleventh hour and then suddenly any vote can be justified in a scramble.

Arguing over inane shit all Day that gets thrown out the window after claims and flips isn't my modus operandi, and I'm confident the reason why you so frequently read me as scum when I'm town is largely due to playstyle differences. We haven't played together for years and I think I've become more radical in my beliefs (especially my D1 beliefs), and I also think your scummeta of me might be stale. I actually haven't been scum in two years and have no idea how I'd play it, so it beats me how you know my scumgame so well.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open, and don't want to get into a big argument about this.

I like to move around my vote a lot, build wagons and then promote compromise early in the game because too often players won't relinquish ego and create stalemates that last until the eleventh hour and then suddenly any vote can be justified in a scramble. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the best/most alignment indicative stuff that happens on D1 happens post-claim, and you'll suddenly see the names in everyone's super solid <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"ALRIGHT GUYS, THE SCUMTEAM IS X, Y AND EITHER Z OR J\"</div> type posts change dramatically, and then again even more once we get flips. <br>\n<br>\nYou're under the delusion that you can solve the game D1 every game, whereas I value cohesion, compromise and securing an informative lynch that isn't just last minute scrambling. I think this is my best way to help the town instead of fooling myself I am nailing half the scumteam from spurious analysis. You are hyperbolic with the declaration of your reads whereas I value transparency about the strength of one's reads -- mine aren't strong at the moment, so I'm not going to pretend they are. <br>\n<br>\nD1's are probably the main reason why I don't play much mafia any more, because reaching a compromise and organising a lynch on D1 is like pulling teeth, and it's laughable how many D1's follow this script. Arguing over inane shit all Day that gets thrown out the window after claims and flips isn't my modus operandi, and I'm confident the reason why you so frequently read me as scum when I'm town is largely due to playstyle differences. We haven't played together for years and I think I've become more radical in my beliefs (especially my D1 beliefs), and I also think your scummeta of me might be stale. I actually haven't been scum in two years and have no idea how I'd play it, so it beats me how you know my scumgame so well.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open, and don't want to get into a big argument about this.

Maybe try and pander to me and give me a top 2 or 3 in terms of sureness.

You admit quite freely that your day 1 play is absolute crap, and you have yet to have anything resembling a compelling scumread day 1.  <br>\n<br>\nAs for reading you as scum, it's the same way I did in the PYP game.  You play with a cold logic.  It is hard for me to read as town, but when the logical thoughts behind your posts don't add up then you're scum.  It's as simple as that.    At the moment, I think you read me as town, are aware that your reads are actually garbage, and are selling yourself that the cohesion is worth sacrificing a townie you might be wrong about.  Am I scumreading that?  Well you're knowingly voting someone you have a town read on.  Sorry if it leaves me conflicted.<br>\n<br>\nI'm sad to say I think you believe this.   Whether or not that's a town tell... eh, we both know your post is alignment neutral.  Suffice to say I believe that the chaos of day 1 is the heart of mafia - divining people's alignment based on their reactions.  The power roles and stuff come in later and muddy things up, and I do love the clarity of a good flip (oh how I love it), but the heart is actually reading people.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you're content to lynch me over Victor, I want you to come back after the game and think about the flips and which was right.

You're always trying to work me out through the lens of scum motivation. The problem with this is you'll always find something because we're so different. How do you think I play as town? Actually, why did you call me town when you first joined the game, when I had done even less at that stage? That doesn't make sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I agree with you that my post here is alignment neutral -- I'm not going to pretend I couldn't fake that as scum. But I also don't have a town read on you like you claim. I think your thoughts have value IF you're town, but like I said, I don't know how to read you these days and I'm happy to lynch you in lieu of other good options.

Hopefully I will get through to Grey and help him read me as town in future (if he is indeed town). I didn't/don't expect anyone else to read that/do anything with that post.<br>\n<br>\nAnyhow, a VT claim makes me a pause a little bit and if we had more time I'd look into Grey's past to see what his claiming history is like. Traditionally in mini normals, VT claims are more likely to be true, as scum tend to fakeclaim PR's, but this is a pretty good/experienced playerlist, so it's also possible he believes this could be a decent spot to fakeclaim VT as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not as confident as I was before, but since I'll be away for most of the Day, I'm not going to throw caution to the wind and jump on the Victor wagon that may or may not go through (and that may or may not yield a more convincing claim that I can't switch back from).

Soooooo... why might she be town despite her voting for someone she thinks is town, and acting like scum?  <br>\n<br>\nThere's a form of toxic thought process that goes like this: \"anything I'm bad at isn't important\".  You see it all the time.  How many tech guys/computer programmers have you seen whine about all the unnecessary social stuff that happens in the office?  They're bad at it = it's not important.  How often have you seen people dismiss computers and treat them as meaningless because they're bad at them?  Have you ever heard someone put down other majors, complain about needing to write things for science classes, or talking about how math can be done by computers in English?  They're engaged in this thinking pattern.  \"If I can't do it, it must not be important.\"  <br>\n<br>\nHoopla is terrible at day 1 shit.  Has she degraded to the point where she's so trapped in a toxic thought loop that she's effectively playing like scum while as town?  Unfortunately her last post brought up that distinct possibility.  <br>\n<br>\nFortunately there's a way for me to check this.  Meta dive.  Calcified thinking is one of the few things that's meta diveable, because it's impossible to hide.  A toxic thought process is terminating to creativity, it won't disguise itself because its incapable of doing so.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8070543#p8070543\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: Mini Normal 1809: Game Over</a><br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hoopla wrote:</cite>ok, i have RETURNED<br>\n<br>\ni've done a quick read over the pages i've missed and the main concern i have is about the lack of serious wagons that have been generated. a lot of people are posting noise and are not attempting to further the game through their votes, which is bad given we've already used 30% of day 1's allotted time. the most important things that happen on day 1 post-claim, and we NEED time to analyse that/potentially switch and create a counterwagon or whatever else. so start voting people who are realistic wagons.<br>\n<br>\non this topic, i'm not sure what to think of elyse. initially i had her as quite town before bbmolla decided to conftown himself, and though i still find her zeal for that vote OK and not suspicious, it is concerning that she talks about willing to compromise and search for new targets yet has done nothing in the last 8 pages and STILL hasn't unvoted bbmolla despite acknowledging he isn't going to happen today.<br>\n<br>\ni'm liking the composition of the vedith wagon: bbmolla, cmitc1 and house make for a fairly town trio, so i am going to jump on board given i don't have a town read on vedith.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: vedith</span><br>\n<br>\nmore to come...</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd... sadly this is the same thought-terminating schlock that I see this game.  Unsurprisingly Vedith was lynched day 1, unsurprisingly he was town.  So I am faced with the possibility that Hoopla has simply become trapped in a toxic loop.  <br>\n<br>\nNow if Victor flips scum then you have to re-evaluate, because her Jack-&gt;Me slide is definite positioning play from Hoopla, and she just wrote three paragraphs trying to sell me on her being town.

He self-consciously calls himself out for doing something scummy in three, which explains the motivation for <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">(2)</div>.  He wants to add more content so he's not going to get scumread.   <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">(4)</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">(5)</div> are just fluff, although the fake thing on Victor is either a good catch or something you say as insurance when your buddy flips.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">(6)</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">(3)</div> are just a waste of time other than his own self-scum read.  Breaking it down... I wouldn't be sad if he was lynched on the basis of this post alone.<br>\n<br>\nSo why am I reluctant?  Because some of this stuff is pretty town.

I push Twoface hard and we have an extensive back and forth that could have easily became a death tunnel.  I am interacting and questioning twoface who starts off answering me and then just really falls back to insulting and taking pot shots at me.  I pushed his voting behavior, I asked him for several reads a couple of pages back that he still hasn't provided.  What would you consider \"pushing a scum read\"?  Vote them then disappear for several pages and never interacting or questioning them again like you have been doing with me?</div></blockquote>\n\nUpon further examination, I will concede this. I didn't originally feel as if your discussions with TwoFace were particularly productive and it felt more like you were biding your time until BBT came back and you could focus on him again. On a second read, I don't think you're pushes on TwoFace are as intense as your pushes on BBT, which does give me pause, but it's the smoking gun I considered it before.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the shade on me, I get it. I screwed up by being lazy and not participating for a good section of this game. If I get lynched for it that's on me. But that fact that you keep bringing up every time I try and do something now is counterproductive. Well, at least it's detrimental to me trying to contribute. Just because I had a bad start to the game doesn't mean I can't have something to say now.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is also town as fuck.  The \"shit or get off the pot\" attitude is fucking town.

If an opinion is convenient to hold on to, you can later say it was serious. If inconvenient, you can say it wasn't.<br>\nBut in this case that feels like a stretch.

Anyone can realise the issue here; if someone is disingenuous and saying things they don't mean as town, you are not any different from scum being disingenuous and saying things they don't mean.

I've already explained how she stalled it. So go look at the VCs and see where sotty had 4 votes with hoopla on it. Then go forward and see her switching to bbt for a bad reason. And you'll see her stalling the sotty wagon. She's also been trying to downplay the sotty wagon trying to act like the resistance against it doesn't mean he's scum which is actually the opposite of almost every scum lynch I've seen. Strong resistance usually means scum. The fact she doesn't recognize that is sketchy.<br>\n<br>\nI disagree about your comment about speculating.", "time": "Tue Nov 01, 2016 11:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

I was happy enough with my scum read of Grey to stay committed.  When he first came in I was willing to give him time, Hoopla's unvote provided him that.

You are going to have to dumb this down for me a bit because it's apparently going over my head.</div></blockquote>\nThere are a ton of different play styles on mafiascum and a lot of them are very different to mine and what I would consider \"optimal\" play.  Doesn't mean their way of play is any better or worse than mine, just means I need to try and read based of how they play, not how I would want or expect them to play.<br>\n<br>\nWith that in mind, Maria comes across as a very fluid type of player.  I haven't played with her before and I am not very good at reading this style of play which is why it took me so long to commit to a read of her.  Maybe it helped that she was pushing and voting for one of my scum reads at the time Jaack.  I felt like Jaack's panic to the vote was disproportionate to the pressure coming from Maria.  It felt like she voted him in an attempt to see if a wagon would start there and kick something going that wasn't Grey.  It didn't kick off, I would say mostly because Grey didn't move his vote.  Maybe I was reading too much into this since Maria never really claimed this was her plan, but that's how it looks to me looking in.  <br>\n<br>\nThe tone thing is mostly a gut reaction.  She feels relaxed and at ease which makes me think town more than scum.  There is a lot of fluff in the ISO but there are also reads.  She comments about the BBT wagon, on me, on Rask.  The Sable vote was pretty bad, but the Jaack vote looks good to me and the Victor push makes sense if she was town reading Grey which is what it looked like at the end of the day.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Maria - </div> What's your read on Cloud?

There were competing wagons extremely close and a lot of people on the fence, you wanted victor lynched and greyice not-lynched, but thought it was a waste of breath to comment, really?

Just because some players had strong townreads it doesn't mean no one would have listened.

You seriously expect me to believe that.<br>\n<br>\nSure after GreyICE, Maria etc had voted me, there's no need to convince them. But there was a long period before that yesterday where my wagon wasn't happening and you were doing nothing to change that. It's that period where you should have been trying to make the wagon happen. I felt it was pretty clear it was that period and not the end of day I was referring to.<br>\n<br>\nLet's actually remind ourselves how we got here. You started ignoring my posts after your ragewall (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8444783#p8444783\">316</a>). At that point I had two votes on me, yourself and TwoFace. You claimed in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478309#p8478309\">1114</a> that the reason for your apathy yesterday was because you didn't think you could convince people to vote Victor. Yet the fact people eventually voted me shows that simply isn't true. Furthermore you couldn't have known how people were going to vote without at least trying to engage with them. There's plenty of things you could have done to help move my lynch forward (providing a compelling case for example).<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me back to the rest of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8479929#p8479929\">1177</a> which you didn't bother responding to. You are supposedly so certain I'm scum you can stop bothering to read my posts. Yet when needing to make a case it comes down to the fact that you didn't think my opening post was that great and apparently I'm infuriating when I do horrible things like question you and try to get you to explain yourself.", "time": "Sat Nov 05, 2016 9:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1200", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

It's that period where you should have been trying to make the wagon happen. I felt it was pretty clear it was that period and not the end of day I was referring to.<br>\n<br>\nLet's actually remind ourselves how we got here. You started ignoring my posts after your ragewall (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8444783#p8444783\">316</a>). At that point I had two votes on me, yourself and TwoFace. You claimed in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478309#p8478309\">1114</a> that the reason for your apathy yesterday was because you didn't think you could convince people to vote Victor. Yet the fact people eventually voted me shows that simply isn't true. Furthermore you couldn't have known how people were going to vote without at least trying to engage with them. There's plenty of things you could have done to help move my lynch forward (providing a compelling case for example).<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me back to the rest of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8479929#p8479929\">1177</a> which you didn't bother responding to. You are supposedly so certain I'm scum you can stop bothering to read my posts. Yet when needing to make a case it comes down to the fact that you didn't think my opening post was that great and apparently I'm infuriating when I do horrible things like question you and try to get you to explain yourself.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo youre sring him for not properly pushing on you, aka his scumread?", "time": "Sat Nov 05, 2016 9:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1200", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

You said a fair bit about what other people said about him, but your comments on greyice alignment were pretty weak and had very little analysis. Talking about him was very far down the list for you, given he was the biggest talking point for a huge part of the day.<br>\n<br>\nOkay so. People still fail to see what I'm getting at, I haven't seen that much focus here. Breakdown.<br>\n<br>\nEarlyday<br>\nMidday<br>\nLateday<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Earlyday</div> you voted victor and said your piece there. For the rest of the day you barely mention him beyond answering questions people asked you about why you voted him, but nothing about anything he did since earlygame, the \"I stopped reading his posts\" you said. Still absurd. The vote itself is somewhat murky to me, that you really hated his rvs and entrance for not talking about/addressing bbt wagon that much. Which is a little ironic considering what you've done since.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Midday</div> the greyice wagon was in fullswing, and had almost no opposition. Though it begun before greyice arrived, people stayed on after seeing what greyice said. No one would have expected any other wagon or lynch at that point, maybe jaack, but not victor. This is when you commented a little on greyice, and even then really not a lot. You had statements such as \"IAI is scum pushing grey and I don't like this\" which IMPLIES you would think grey is town but you didn't \"back up\" the read in the sense that you didn't ever come out and say \"I think grey is town\" or anything explicit. I have to give the benefit of the doubt and try to look at things from a gm-town perspective, and gm-town saying those things would have townread grey; but your later actions don't line up with that at all either. More accurately they line up with you not having a real read on either greyice or victor which is why you seemed to not care and used the situation to try to setup for d2 instead. To people reading this: ctrl f \"grey\" in his ISO. Mainly, you cast doubt on people for their approach around the wagon (interestingly enough NOT victor's greyice vote/stance though), which reads to me as expecting the lynch to go through with your hands clean of it and then getting those grey scumread next day (most notably IAI). No like, complaint about your townread being wagoned by victor+iai, not any motion to do a counterwagon beyond \"hey if a wagon on iai got going I COULD go on it\", but okay, I guess it makes sense because at this point it didn't look like any other wagon would be viable at this point!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lateday</div> a viable counterwagon approaches! Victor takes off, it gets to l-2 at one point, and spends several days as a wagon nearly as viable as the greyice one, up until the moment he claimed mason. Keyword, this gamestate lasted several days, 30 october maria and I voted, to 02 november, that's 4. It was not a very fast event that you missed or anything like that. You were there. Here are the posts made while victor, supposed scumread, was a competing wagon of greyice, supposed townread.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8465946#p8465946\">884</a> -  \"I'm just trying to engage you when it comes to Victor to try and understand where you're coming from\" you call super slimey - when you legitimately were tight on details there, stopped talking about victor at a certain point and hadn't said much since, so it's a valid question: wtf? Sotty shade, hoopla shade, then complaining. To be fair, small comment about people joining victor wagon at the end.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8466555#p8466555\">890</a> / <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8466738#p8466738\">892</a> - as an aside, I have a theory that gm-scum perceived IAI actions as extra scummy/antitown because as scum she knew the whole time that what IAI was super hard pushing was a mislynch.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8470052#p8470052\">984</a> - I think the gist of this reply to BV is \"town and scum can hardpush cases so you should not townread IAI for hardpushing\". This is okay - blah maria - THIS one is rich, what gm says to hoopla, \"hoopla why are you giving long playstyle lectures instead of campaigning for someone to be the last vote on the grey wagon?\". It's literally what gm does by addressing all these random topics INSTEAD OF GREY/VIC and ESPECIALLY \"campaigning for someone to be the last vote\". How does town-gm say this and at the same time no lightbulb turns on or anything. Gm at no point since early/midday tries to get someone on, not beyond weak statements like hmm it would be nice if it happened I guess. But beyond that, this is somewhat sinister; gm is asking hoopla why she isn't getting more votes onto greyice at the end of the day. This is effort which probably does contribute towards that end. In a way, the gm encouraged grey's wagon a bit with this and an earlier comment about it being \"inevitable\", probably about the same minuscule amount as she put towards encouraging the victor wagon. And again, she's fully conscious of it as a possibility given this exact comment, just not interested.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8472025#p8472025\">1050</a> - matter of fact response to greyice over some differences. CONTEXT: Deadline is closing, greyice is ranting, near-lynch, and giving his \"last reads\" in a fury, creature fakehammered. Victor lynch still possible though. Calm, unphased as fuck post from gm given everything. You're talking to your townread who's about to die, even if you already accepted it as \"inevitable\" long ago despite the VCs, and didn't think it was worth it to even read victor's posts let alone judge them any more, ignoring all that, you're just whatever with grey dying. This is what gets me, as benign as it looks this part sums up gm's play around the 2 wagons; indifferent. As town there's any given number of reactions you'd have, things to be focusing on, anything; from your point of view this day is supposed to have been a failure, a not-good outcome. I think gm is unfettered because she's scum, her play fits her being perfectly fine with that situation as it's a win for scum-her, a positive outcome, and her priority that whole time was already thinking to d2.</fieldset><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8480317#p8480317\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8480317#p8480317\" data-post-id=\"8480317\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1194</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20055\">goodmorning</a> wrote:</cite>NOBODY WAS ON THE FENCE.

In early-midgame she then stopped reading his posts because well who cares. Greyice begun to be wagoned and gm pointed out some problems in the people wagoning him, mostly IAI, but really quickly goodmorning saw the greyice lynch as inevitable and thought it best to comment on other things. When there was renewed interest in the victor wagon, goodmorning didn't feel it was a priority then reading his posts either or campaigning for that, despite pointing out hoopla not having campaigned for greyice lynch. \"Also: showing up and talking about something I'd already made up my mind on would have been very boring indeed, and useless. Far better to post thoughts on a wide range of subjects so they can survive my inevitable death.\"[<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478858#p8478858\">1144</a>]. When the victor wagon was l-2 and a realistic lynch to greyice and greyice was pouring his heart out, goodmorning didn't find it a priority to make some noise about her townread being lynched with no of her scumreads on the wagon; perhaps the vig would shoot IAI as she asked, she maybe thought. Goodmorning calmly addressed side topics and had one post to greyice questioning two of his statements in a matter of fact way, but this was okay because goodmorning had been in this situation all the time and so she's used to it or something and doesn't see the value in defending townreads or campaigning for the last vote or two onto a scumread who is the counterwagon. Actually, similar to not reading victor's posts anymore, goodmorning didn't notice the gamestate, that the wagons were close or that anyone was \"on the fence\" through incompetence rather than maliciousness, and she just assumed nothing changed from earlier from her \"inevitable\" early-midday judgement.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Conclusion</div>: I am disgusted I have to consider this, but stuff like this has happened a few times. But those few times were newer players or hard-lurkers/really weird players. The problem is goodmorning is an experienced player, I've seen her queue for IC a few times I believe, I don't see a veteran player that wouldn't be capable of doing all this. I still have to meta and I'll do so tomorrow, but it'll be very disappointing if this is her townplay. That said even if one's townplay is proven bizarre/scum-ish in all these different ways that doesn't somehow clear her but just makes those specific tells nai. But hopefully the meta analysis would find some substantial tells in that case then.</fieldset><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">The case for gm scum<br>\nGoodmorning voted victor for rvs because it was easy. Gm keeps the vote and says victor's next posts are bad [but doesn't go into detail] because that's easy as well. Gm answers questions and responds to victor when necessary, but at one point starts ignoring victor out of scumlaziness. With greyice being a wagon gm uses it to cast a ton of shade onto people while not trying to divert it because she wants to leverage the ml into more tomorrow, something you can't do for a wagon you're on. She uses the reasoning that the lynch is probably inevitable anyways, which is reasonable at that specific time but she uses it for the rest of the day even when it's clearly not the case because it's the simple and an easy defense. With greyice and victor both being wagons gm doesn't particularly care which go through, her actions and focus onto minor/side things because she didn't care for any responsibility or attention from that. Out of casting doubt onto people for how they wagoned greyice, she had to assume a stance of appearing somewhat opposed so it made sense, but she didn't really care what outcome came of yesterday. Her mind was already onto what she's do afterwards.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Conclusion:</div> This fits a lot more, especially considering gm's play around the very late parts of the day. In terms of emotion she just read completely unperturbed by her townread having a meltdown, getting lynched in front of her with her two scumreads on the wagon, it's just so flat and unconcerned. It's not as obvious as it looks like because she's still commenting on things and contributing, so I can see scum-gm thinking it's fine acting this way as the activity is still acceptable, but it's just the focus and priorities don't make sense when you look at them closely. This explanation if nothing else is a lot simpler and so I think more likely.</fieldset>", "time": "Sun Nov 06, 2016 4:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1250", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

My point was there wasn't much reason for scum-gm to push victor over greyice, as though greyice did townread gm he was still a potentially threatening player to scum overall; my point was there were reasons scum gm would be happy to have that happen as well. Casting doubt and have grey go through was better than the scum-alternative choice for gm, is my point; assuming victor town if he had been lynched instead it wouldn't have been as easy for goodmorning I think, not having it go through means she didn't have to change any stance. Not to mention that outright scumreading/pushing greyice would have potentially put gm in the firing line of him or others and invited people to ask questions there. I can see the point that she maybe could have just kept a minor scumread on greyice with BBT's play as reasoning, but I don't think it's by any means that simple.

I'm very curious about those who claim scum do this all the time, because I rarely see it... at least not in mini normals where balance can be judged upon massclaim. Two mason fakeclaims will stick out like a sore thumb in a sea of PR claims if they are indeed fake. The most likely situation is we have two masons and one other good PR or two masons and two weak to middling roles. There's pretty much never two masons in a town with three or four other PR's, so we can easily tell later in the game if the mason claim is fake. So, everyone should just drop it until massclaim occurs... which we'll be doing the Day before mylo/lylo.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, while I'm catching up, I see there is a goodmorning wagon and how could I not take that opportunity?

My point was there wasn't much reason for scum-gm to push victor over greyice, as though greyice did townread gm he was still a potentially threatening player to scum overall; my point was there were reasons scum gm would be happy to have that happen as well. Casting doubt and have grey go through was better than the scum-alternative choice for gm, is my point; assuming victor town if he had been lynched instead it wouldn't have been as easy for goodmorning I think, not having it go through means she didn't have to change any stance. Not to mention that outright scumreading/pushing greyice would have potentially put gm in the firing line of him or others and invited people to ask questions there. I can see the point that she maybe could have just kept a minor scumread on greyice with BBT's play as reasoning, but I don't think it's by any means that simple. For starters, other scum on the greyice wagon would incentivise gm to have held this stance as an alternative.</div></blockquote>\nBut doesn't it work just as well for scumGM to say the lynch is inevitable, reason a switch to Grey and have a Victor vote in her back pocket to go back to?  Your case reads pretty well really until you get to your conclusions.  A lot of it seems based on how you personally would have played either side of the situation.  Bringing up GM's experience and saying you are disgusted this might be an option for her play is pretty manipulative.  Players make mistakes and players have different styles.

TwoFace was nightkilled over a claimed mason. There is a reason. Who did TwoFace push end of Day 1.....Sotty and Hoopla. Pretty sure he pushed Sotty almost all of D1. Guess who Sotty parked her vote on most of D1....yep BBT, then TwoFace, then BBT.....can I do some vote count analysis and change my reads? So take your \"no real reasons\" and shove it<br>\n<br>\nOh and psst....remember I strong town read Hoopla D1 too, don't forget that cause I also scum read her now too...<br>\n<br>\nAnd once again, check the facts. I was one of the first posters to go at it D2...did you gloss over the whole Cloud/IAI back and forth start of D2.

Blackvoid and Jaack are the only two \"legit\" votes on me.

Jaack's vote is based off reasons that date back to day one that I still think are pretty suspect.  Blackvoid is a strong town read of mine, I do like his logical thinking and our reads tend to match up everywhere else.  I think he has settled on me lately and has done very little to pressure me in any shape just resorting to banging the drum.  Jaack I suspected pretty hard day one, but that has dampened a bit today.

The idea that I might have to claim because of lazy votes pushing me to lynch for little reason is really starting to piss me off.  I keep trying to push my points but are making extremely little headway with very few in the player base willing to to interact with me.

For realz???<br>\n<br>\nI started off the today all but announcing to the world that I was going to vote either you or Hoopla. I waited to see how you two reacted. You voted Rask. She voted GM. I didn't like either of those votes. (Hers was a little better than yours.) Neither seems willing to vote the other which only reaffirms my read on both of you. If one of you had voted the other, that would have been very telling. But the way I see it, both are prob scum and neither are willing to bus.<br>\n<br>\nYou've played with scum IAI. Heck you nominated me for a scummy if I recall correctly after our first game. Then we played Zachtown in the Mountains. Which was all over the map IAI? It's not even close. Town Sotty would know my meta, know my cool play as scum and my erratic, don't care if I get lynched play as town.<br>\n<br>\nI respect the heck out of you. I would never vote you day 2 of a game unless I was pretty sure you were scum. You are one of the feistiest toughest town players I've ever played with. You scared the heck out of me that first game. I'm not seeing that at all. I'm seeing a very tame Sotty, not aggressively pushing wagons on your scum reads, but instead trying to subtly discredit me by accusing me of being all over the place when you would know that is my town play. Remember my meltdown in the Mountains game against Ben, where I self voted. Would you consider that \"all over the place\"?<br>\n<br>\nInb4 WIFOM change in meta play etc blah blah blah", "time": "Wed Nov 09, 2016 3:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1400", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

That said, I like your tone and for page five I've seen worst cases.  <br>\n<br>\nI don't want to step on Hoopla's toes because gambits are the name of her game.  I find her generally hard to get a read on in the early game so I tend to sort her town and let her out herself as scum as the game draws on.  It helps that I value her as an extremely strong town player and would really like to tag team on this game if she is indeed town.  Because of this I found Rask's initial case and vote on Hoopla weak, but most of it could be down to a lack of experience with her which could be understandable.  However, Rask's vote remains despite Hoopla's reasonable responses to his points.  <br>\n<br>\nI like BBT more for scum at this point.  He came in with a vote on Rask to start a wagon, there were already two other players with two votes at the time Blackvoid and gm.  It seems to be an attempt to sort Rask which comes quick and with no further elaboration.  I would have expected more considering the history they both speak to.  Feels like he started the wagon then panicked a little when it took off.

Several people were willing to move over but it never really surfaced.  If we're going to talk about counter wagons, that one had the potential to explode and yet it didn't.  The meta thing could be a good point, I just find his poking on Maria about why she didn't engage him to be a little disparate and it doesn't match with his \"world view\".  I have asked him a couple of times why he hasn't engaged me and he keeps shrugging it off as if it's nothing about nothing, why is he so keen to get an answer from Maria?  Doesn't add up to me.<br>\n<br>\nRask's buddying of Grey in the last page or so is really the only thing lately that has given me pause about that slot.

He is voting me for my use of the word stuff.  He repeated this reasoning in a recent post and it's just awful.  Since then he has just sat on my wagon and thrown out more crap about the counter wagon (something you are scum reading Maria for) and done very little to attempt to read me.

You are going to have to dumb this down for me a bit because it's apparently going over my head.</div></blockquote>\nThere are a ton of different play styles on mafiascum and a lot of them are very different to mine and what I would consider \"optimal\" play.  Doesn't mean their way of play is any better or worse than mine, just means I need to try and read based of how they play, not how I would want or expect them to play.<br>\n<br>\nWith that in mind, Maria comes across as a very fluid type of player.  I haven't played with her before and I am not very good at reading this style of play which is why it took me so long to commit to a read of her.  Maybe it helped that she was pushing and voting for one of my scum reads at the time Jaack.  I felt like Jaack's panic to the vote was disproportionate to the pressure coming from Maria.  It felt like she voted him in an attempt to see if a wagon would start there and kick something going that wasn't Grey.  It didn't kick off, I would say mostly because Grey didn't move his vote.  Maybe I was reading too much into this since Maria never really claimed this was her plan, but that's how it looks to me looking in.  <br>\n<br>\nThe tone thing is mostly a gut reaction.  She feels relaxed and at ease which makes me think town more than scum.  There is a lot of fluff in the ISO but there are also reads.  She comments about the BBT wagon, on me, on Rask.  The Sable vote was pretty bad, but the Jaack vote looks good to me and the Victor push makes sense if she was town reading Grey which is what it looked like at the end of the day.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Maria - </div> What's your read on Cloud?

So far we've had one mislynch, but if sotty is scum, like cloud seems to think, there's no real reason to make this kind of statement. This also looks like excusing himself for not getting nkilled, which isn't something town should be thinking about, especially at this point in the game.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the second half of this post makes it look like he's not currently scumreading sotty at all and just wants a claim. I don't know why town-cloud would be so desperate for sotty to claim if he wasn't actually interested in lynching her, as he said previously.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I just see a lot of stuff from cloud that doesn't make sense from a town mindset.

Neither TwoFace nor I would have been very likely mason partners for victor (I was voting him at the end of the day and TwoFace had a pretty nasty back-and-forth with victor). If sotty was a role cop, that would mean scum had two assets to find a mason and used neither of them for that purpose. I find that hard to believe.<br>\n<br>\nI guess sotty could be a scum tracker with victor as a mason, but I definitely can't see sotty as a scum role cop with victor as a mason.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still concerned with cloud. It seemed like for most of the game whenever someone gave the slightest whiff that they thought he could be scum, he would immediately start scumreading them back, but <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8496897#p8496897\">1447</a> seemed like a big shift away from that. My mental narrative is that I actually hit something that scumcloud knows is legitimately scummy and could stick and he shifted to damage control, but I'm struggling with where to go further with this.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the Hoopla wagon and related breakdown of the sotty wagon, I'm actually feeling more confident in sotty being scum at this point then I was when I unvoted (where I was starting to doubt myself due to cloud's activities). D1, the BBT/GI wagon stalled and people unvoted on occasion, but it never collapsed at any point. The sotty wagon, meanwhile, collapsed as soon as I unvoted and started looking elsewhere. I think that points to some scum bussing but looking for an easy out. There's a lot of 'not totally buying that claim but whatever' going around as well which I think feeds into that theory as well. As for hoopla herself<br>\n<br>\nI think lynching sotty is probably our best option at this point. There's been too much doubtcasting on sotty's claim to make it a neccessary target for scum N2 if she is town.

I tried to work out why you as scum would investigate me in anyway, and came to the conclusion that if scum had a rolecop and targeted me with it last night, than victor is likely lying about being a mason, as I would imagine that scum would use their rolecop to try and find the other mason.

I'm currently reading her as null because I felt a lot of her D1 was solid town stuff, even if she was wrong about both GI and me. But her D2 has been lacking to say the least. I don't really like the opening of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8485676#p8485676\">1266</a>. It feels a little revisionist - there was nothing about BBT's D1 that made that slot doomed other than town apathy to finding a decent alternative. Seems a bit like she's trying to distance herself from participation on the GI wagon, but it's not a smoking gun to me. In general, there's a lot of that in Hoopla's posts. Stuff that could be from scum, but nothing that makes me compelled to vote.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not super convinced of her being scum though. I'd much rather lynch sotty or cloud today, but it seems I'm alone in both cases. I can at least understand why people are unwilling to vote sotty due to her claim, but I really feel that people are giving cloud to much leeway due to his playstyle.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also concerned that currently 100% of the Hoopla wagon is made up of people on the GI lynch.

I'm not in love with scum-hoopla but she's none too high on my town reads either.<br>\n<br>\nThat all being said, your scum read on me predates my hoopla vote by weeks. You should have more than that.<br>\n<br>\nMoving right along, you say I only show up when it's convenient for me? Wouldn't it have been convenient of me to allow the sotty wagon to go through? Wouldn't it have been convenient of me to lynch GI yesterday when I was option number 2? I don't really want to self read, so give me concrete examples of me showing up only when it's convenient so I can tell you why you're wrong.<br>\n<br>\nAnd it's not like you've done anything worthwhile this whole game. While you've been scum reading me the whole game, the only two times you've actually given reasons are when I've pried them out of you. You haven't done anything to change people's minds regarding BV, your other scumread either.<br>\n<br>\nI'll admit that I haven't posted as much as I like, but I try and get something accomplished with every one of my posts. You've had hard scumreads on two players for most of this game but have done nothing to see those through.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, this counterwagon garbage again. First of all, it's patently false - Hoopla was a wagon today before I was. But it doesn't matter which came first, what matters is the quality of the wagon. And while I might not be in love with the hoopla wagon, the reasoning for its existence is infinitely better than the reasoning for mine.<br>\n<br>\nI think your town Maria, but you're dead wrong on me.", "time": "Tue Nov 15, 2016 9:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1600", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

So, of all your reads I'd be most inclined to lynch Sotty, but that would probably just be based on the claim alone which sounds fishy to me.

She obviously always claims Tracker as town Tracker, but now that I think about it, given we probably have two mason claims, there's likely only one or two other town PR slots, but there's three scum slots remaining, and since she claims something like this as scum almost always, it's actually more likely this claim comes from scum just from the number of scum left vs. number of PR's left.<br>\n<br>\nI also think Jack is a decent chance of being scum, so I probably wouldn't switch unless something with a real shot of going through occurred.", "time": "Tue Nov 15, 2016 3:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

Being widely townread also means he's unlikely to get lynched unless he's caught through a night action which is more reason to pick him.<br>\n<br>\nI also think you're acting a little intentionally ignorant.

I even got pushed pretty much only by jaack this game, someone she voted, and when she comes back from afking she ends up fosing her fos's fos, makes 0 sens to me at this stage of the game. IMO, shes mafia or pr and acting weird as fuck because of it, this is her vt play. i also dont give a shit about what you think about outing pr reads, it does help me when i reread myself<br>\n&gt;Still think bv is town, slight paranoia.

Between the two, I'm going for Sotty7.<br>\n<br>\nFor Creature, I'll briefly address the claim point - I do think leaving PRs alive is a good idea in general but since we have a Mason claim already, Sotty7 could make it through at least a couple of days before she's expected to answer questions about being nightkilled so best to just go with our reads now.

The third one doesn't make sense. If Sotty7 is scum, then we've got a scum flip, we are one step closer to a win and you can push GM then. If she's town, then my bussing theory would no longer apply.<br>\n<br>\nBy the way, it wasn't my intention to demotivate you. I tend to make prolonged pushes and not let go when I lock onto someone. If you want to talk about why your GM-case hit alarm bells for me and why I was scumreading you for it rather than GM, I can explain my internal thinking more. I touched on it a bit in my reads list though.<br>\n<br>\nRight now, GM has been sliding down my town-scale a lot so I'm considering that you might have a point there. I still think a Sotty7 flip is pivotal to solidifying my reads. There were three wagons D1. We know GreyICE was town and Victor very likely is too. Sotty7 is the unknown. We know she pushed very hard for the BBT/GreyICE lynch. We know BBT hard-scumread her before replacing out. We know TwoFace wanted her flip really, really badly and winded up dead N1. We know that she investigated her other threat. Hoopla's right that in her place, scum would almost certainly claim PR. All of this tells me Sotty7's flip is integral to figuring out the game and is a very, very likely scumflip. That's where I'm at and that's why I'd really rather not let go of Sotty7.", "time": "Wed Nov 16, 2016 1:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

But we sort of self-select ourselves into just lynching a VT if we assume scum always claims PR in that spot and we're unwilling to lynch a PR claim.

A Tracker claim is never really provable, could be scum aligned or a Mafia Role Cop and is just much harder to evaluate from setup spec as it's a weak-ish investigation role that's existence could go either way if the setup is something like Mason/Mason/Doc or Mason/Mason/Doc/Tracker.", "time": "Wed Nov 16, 2016 2:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

I feel like the Sotty flip pretty much ensures BlackVoid is town, to the point that any suspicion of him borders on conspiracy theory and I'd be willing to put the game on the line on him being town. Given Jack also looks quite now from that flip, I just don't see BlackVoid taking the line of derailing a town-town wagon battle between Jack/myself and redirecting it onto scum. There were plenty of ways to look good from your positions with regards to mine/Jack's wagon battle, but helping derail it onto scum well you have two mislynches available is some hardcore turbo-bussing that unnecessarily opens the game up for town. <br>\n<br>\nYou don't see it every game, but this could very well be the fabled all-town powerwagon that nailed Sotty. The only question mark I have is Raskolnikov, but at this stage I'd rather lynch off the wagon, as I don't think scum double-bussed Sotty and think there's 1-2 scum off the wagon. <br>\n<br>\nMaria's hard defenses of Sotty are a creative stance to take as scum and I'm not sure how adept and intune she is with current meta to make this play (it seems like nobody is too suspicious of her atm), and I'm inclined to believe she's the type that would probably find an opening to bus when the writing was on the wall for Sotty.<br>\n<br>\ngoodmorning working furiously to start counterwagons while the Sotty wagon is building (and largely ignoring it and not talking about it until asked) seems suspicious on the surface, and I hesitate to use this line of logic, but it's almost too obvious and I'd her to be more conscious of her reactions during that period of time. And if I'm scum and I'm seeing Sotty going down, I'm definitely not going to play the way goodmorning did - it just looks really fishy pushing unsupported counterwagons while the rest of the town lynches scum. I don't know, I might have to revisit that one later, but that's my initial impression.<br>\n<br>\nToday I'm probably going to lynch between Creature and Cloudkicker.

Rask did hammer grey d1 but she also tried to flip the sotty's wagon to hoop,gm and myself in about 2 pages spawn which is extremely scummy, all she did at the end of the day was ask for a flip, this is not town whos afraid to lynch pr, this is mafia whos bored that their partner is getting lynched or something like that.

I feel like the Sotty flip pretty much ensures BlackVoid is town, to the point that any suspicion of him borders on conspiracy theory and I'd be willing to put the game on the line on him being town. Given Jack also looks quite now from that flip, I just don't see BlackVoid taking the line of derailing a town-town wagon battle between Jack/myself and redirecting it onto scum. There were plenty of ways to look good from your positions with regards to mine/Jack's wagon battle, but helping derail it onto scum well you have two mislynches available is some hardcore turbo-bussing that unnecessarily opens the game up for town. <br>\n<br>\nYou don't see it every game, but this could very well be the fabled all-town powerwagon that nailed Sotty.

And if I'm scum and I'm seeing Sotty going down, I'm definitely not going to play the way goodmorning did - it just looks really fishy pushing unsupported counterwagons while the rest of the town lynches scum.

I know BlackVoid and Raskol have been the key players entertaining associations, so I want them to tell me why Jack-scum doesn't make sense now? He was very influential in getting the successful Sotty wagon going yesterday, after vote-parking on her most of D1. But was there anything else specifically?<br>\n<br>\nLooking back, I don't think Sotty was all that scummy, and I find it strange her lynch was so heavily talked about even when other stuff was happening. It seems like the whispers for Sotty were artificially inflated with scum help and I think there may have been some heavy bussing of her throughout D1 keeping her in the limelight more than her play warranted. <br>\n<br>\nRaskol and Sotty had some colourful dialogue on D1 and on first glance that didn't look like scumtheatre, but Rask more than once uses his influence as a widely town viewed player to start linking players to Sotty.

I think this is suspicious given how willing he's been to hammer and get claims throughout the game, yet has found a way to dodge the Sotty wagon. <br>\n<br>\nIt may just be the EM playstyle belief regarding PR claims, but he makes sense from a PoE perspective where everyone else except Creature has a better reasons for being town based on their interactions with Sotty. Really, that's the most important thing that's happened in the game, so I'm weighting my opinions more based on how well they work with Sotty now. And put simply, the most universally agreed townreads and the masons were largely responsible for the Sotty wagon. The only blind spot is you or I guess Jack, but it regardless, it's difficult to see both of you as scum, so <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">at best</div>, I think there's only one scum on Sotty's wagon and probably none on it, although I have privileged information in knowing I'm town, and as such, can make sweeping conclusions about the wagon much easier as I know I'm still being considered in other's PoE's.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still going over who I want to lynch. I probably won't entertain my conspiracy theories today about you or Jack, but I kept having them and thought they were worth mentioning so I did. I think the game makes more sense when you consider it from a perspective that Sotty was always being pushed as scum, far more than her play warranted. But really, I think this sort of thing just happens to me when the game narrows down really quickly to a small pool of players. It just seems too easy. I am also warming to BlackVoid's suspicion of Maria, I'm not ruling goodmorning out and I haven't dedicated enough time to figuring out Creature yet either.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone seems to make up their mind much quicker later in the game which is funny, because I feel like I spend most D1's ready to lynch while nobody else does.

I haven't been scum in... literally years as I don't play much these days, so I don't even know how I'd approach it any more. We both used to be considered to have strong scum games (actually I think people still see Sotty as a very strong scum player). My biggest strength was my ability to boss games around as a town leader/key voice in the game and orchestrate things in a direction I wanted the game to go, whereas I think Sotty's strengths were more along the lines of very convincingly simulating her town game as scum, but these are all long ago memories that are hazy, nostalgic and simply not very meaningful beyond the surface.

Mason games (especially when the mason roles go to players that would ordinarily be lynched/not NK'ed without that claim quite often get well solved by PoE as better/townier looking players live deeper in the game than usual).<br>\n- The town hivemind has incorrectly zeroed in on Cloud and this game isn't as solved as we have been lead to believe today, and everyone's reads need a massive reevaluation because I feel like the PoE well might be poisoned if Cloud is wrong.<br>\n<br>\nThere are too many universes where Cloud is scum and an easy win is around the corner, sooooo I think playing the percentages and lynching Cloud today is wisest, and I'll let go of Creature and the conspiracy theories dogging my subconscious for now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So, Cloud.

I haven't finished but here's where I'm at so far. You are actually my strongest townread outside of Jaack and Arona and the one I have the most trouble explaining.<br>\n<br>\nCloud's ISO is actually not too horrible. I specifically looked to see all the times he mentioned Sotty7 and nothing came off like he already knew her alignment. I really wanted his claim though since just letting him demand claims from whoever he wants while not claiming when he's at L-1 was bad and it feels like we're letting him get away with a lot.<br>\n<br>\nI think I might be cutting GM too much slack. She claims she's known for not bussing. But despite attacking Sotty7, she never once voted her. She voted Victor who is town on D1. On D2, she kept her vote on IAI who's also town. For a brief moment, she switched to Hoopla, then Rask, then back to IAI. D3 she's voting you who I think is town. So, I don't know, that's one too many bad votes, and she never votes Sotty7.<br>\n<br>\nStill need to ISO Rask and search for mentions of Sotty7. I'll get back to you on that. You seem to know him well, what do you think?<br>\n<br>\nMariaR is the one I have no reason to believe is town so that's who I'd be most comfortable lynching. Saying you, me, and Jaack are scum is a pretty big stretch and I'm closer to thinking she's doing it to get towncred than because she actually buys what she's selling. There's also that D1 behavior where she complained about the GreyICE wagon (why is there no counterwagon? Is no one bothered???)

She was heavily fosed for 2 days and she was going down, i dont see 1 mafia hard defending her (Mariar) + 1 coasting the lynch, or 2 coasting, it just makes no sens to me considering Sottys play and how the day happened.<br>\n<br>\nSo imho, if MariaR is town, at the very least 1 mafia bussed imo, that is -&gt; Hoop BV Crea Rask. <br>\nAnother read i have is that MariaR and BV are just not a team imho, they can be both scum this game. MariaR wouldnt continually pushed BV whos in a somewhat townread position rn (at least by the clears), no reason to discredit your partner on ml either, so -&gt; BV and MariaR not 2mafias.<br>\n<br>\nNow, if mariaR is mafia -&gt; BV should be town and vice versa<br>\n<br>\nNow heres my personally reads<br>\n<br>\nI do think mariar should be town if she didnt completly hard buddied a scum partner who was tote getting lynched, if she did then the game should be easy with her scum flip but i personally believe that her play from d2 was town and that she actually believe sotty was town. Her votes counts also doesnt reflect scum intention, shes also starting to towntell recently and BV outed several horrible lines and isnt being consistent in his townyness. <br>\n<br>\nI also do think that GM should be town here, imo his d1 tone was on point, i liked a lot of his posts and his voting pattern just looks reckless af and i dont see mafia coasting with those votes all that much, theres also the IAI vote considering mafia already picked mason read the guy<br>\n<br>\nThats leaves Crea Rask BV Hoop<br>\n<br>\nCrea just unvoted on me which is imo fairly towny, he also townread me for the entire game and other stuff but hes somewhat hard to read since low infos, he also doesnt look like hes with rask for the meta read out of the blue<br>\n<br>\nRask scumtold a bunch of times but also towntold recently. I personnaly do not believe shes the same as the town game we both played recently for one bit. Also creature outing the very same kind of meta read i had on her should be enough for me to tr him because we had about the same read. I do think shes scum and her GM push is bad<br>\n<br>\nHoop idk, have to reread. BV had flip floping reads on him for a while and i dont know how to read that if BV is scum. He also corrected BV on stuff that were wrong and outed good lines<br>\n<br>\nBV towntold early on but made various terrible posts later on and had inconsistent logic on his own play, also hes pushing on mariar when i do think shes town.<br>\n<br>\nMy stance atm is <br>\n<br>\nCrea/rask not a team<br>\nMaria/BV not a team (pretty fucking sure)<br>\nHoop/BV not a team<br>\n<br>\nRask is mafia, Mariar is town, Gm is town<br>\nBv is mafia over hoop for recent play", "time": "Tue Nov 22, 2016 1:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=2250", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

I'm saying it's hard to explain my read on him because of how he posts but I'll give it a go. <br>\n<br>\nFirst, there's my point on MichelSableheart - the way he asked me for opinions on you/Victor/GM/TwoFace and then went back to read with those in mind was probably town. Counter-intuitively, I think town are actually more receptive to listening to others and working with people. I don't think he'd be so blatant about buddying me as scum and he could have approached your conflict in other ways, ones that could be advantageous to him but his approach felt sincere. <br>\n<br>\nNext, there's Creature replacing in and sort of doing the same thing D1. He said he'll help me push any other wagon as long as it's not on him. I think that's something scum would be too self-conscious to say. But if he's town and had me as a strong townread, I think he'd say that. <br>\n<br>\nThen, there are his actual reads which aligned with mine pretty closely. I'm a little bothered that his four scumreads were the exact same ones I had but I don't think they were unreasonable. He scumread Sotty7, and had no hesitation in voting her. He did say PR-claim means we should wait but by itself, that's not telling. It seems to be common wisdom to leave PR claims alone for a day. The way Cloud did it struck me as scummy because he seemed so invested in Sotty7's survival. Creature didn't seem that way.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, there's Sotty7's push on him. I think his vote on the wagon came across as easily attackable because he didn't give any reasons. It seemed more like that she was taking advantage of a townie who put down a weak vote on her as opposed to cross-bussing.<br>\n<br>\nCan we discuss your read on Rask?

Its not an actual crumb imo in the sens of it but i remember i tried to push the idea to actually test the tracker because Sotty couldve proved to me, i said that many times.<br>\n<br>\nMy whole d2 reason not to lynch sotty was because i wanted to be on her that day and maybe try to track outside, if this happened i wouldve crumbed who i was going on [sotty] to possibly clear her and wins a ml since we wouldnt have to lynch sotty anymore because she was virtually scumread by most of the town, that was essentially my plan. Also from slight setup meta on specs, i believe that town masons + track + weak-ish proctective role did made sens since theres over 1 investigative and 1 protective in most setup. <br>\n<br>\nI also wanted to further get reads from a lynch outside the sotty claim because imo it was optimal in every way. <br>\n<br>\nIf i was on sotty and i get killed for it, sotty is clear, we win ml, her track is considered true++. I also seriously doubted that i wouldve been killed while not bodyguarding if Sotty was mafia, because i hard defended the shit out of her, not reason ti nightkill me the mason claim. <br>\n<br>\nIf the flip outside her was incriminating Sotty i wouldve probably no bodyguard or on the mason claim, idk i didnt actually think too much about it but that was essentially my state of mind.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why i didnt want to full claim is because i expected to trade myself at somepoint in the game with another pr or a clear, claiming here just kill me pretty much and makes me completly useless.

Claim reliability/trustworthyness vs flexibility for faking. Town vs scum benefit. If town claim PR they are already a massive RB/kill target whether they soft or hard, the difference here is generally not huge barring things like BP or PGO(rare). Scum OTOH have huge benefit from waiting for a fake another day especially with extra theorycrafting/planning and if they have an info from their own information-gathering role to supplement.<br>\n2. Scum have more setup deductive powers than town (given they know their own power) and can guess fairly reliably from a soft whereas town are in the dark and focus on other things. Leveling-the-playing field principle which is along the same lines as what makes massclaim powerful.<br>\n3. If you're town and your role had any information (I don't know what level of competency you have and can't trust your decision making) it would all have been lost on death.

I believe that the sotty/bv ineractions were and could easily be mafia interactions since BV unvoted a bunch of time and some of his posts seems really inconsistent with a hard sotty sr. It seemed like he bussed to be consistent with his read as town!BV which his actions/behaviors did not match it. Being consistant when you antagonized your partner is also a way to strenghten your town position since he literraly lynched a mafia pr-claiming, something that is really ballsy imo so everyone would believe he hard sr her right ? I think that town!BV wouldve been even more consistent with his reads on sotty as per votes and the wagons, i also think that EVEN SO he wouldve been more careful about lynching a pr claim. <br>\n<br>\nThe wierd interactions, speech/behaviors non-matching but still ends up lynching a pr claims all points to scumplay imho, maybe im confbiasing too but this is the general feeling i got, maria also relieved good points. So its not more as to get towncred but to be consistent + solidify position, he literally got hammer on me today because of it and if hes mafia, theres no reason to hammer me here when he can just night kill without a loss of cred yknow.", "time": "Wed Nov 23, 2016 2:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=2525", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

{"number": 2565, "id": "8547772", "user": "BlackVoid", "user_id": "28560", "content": "Okay, so try as I might I'm just not seeing GM as scum. The wagon has given me the reactions I needed so that's good. Apart from the stuff I mentioned about her back and forth with Sotty7 on D1, there's also the really early interactions where she says something is off with BBT and Sotty7 immediately agrees with her and pushes him. I hate that she cast around for counterwagons at the last minute during Sotty7's lynch but I just don't get the feeling that she already knew Sotty7's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nI'm leaning more towards Rask. Here's my problem with Rask: reading him in ISO, there's never a point where I feel that him and Sotty7 are definitely not partners. He suspects Sotty7 early, cuts through her BBT scumread and votes her. Then he colors a wagon with Sotty7 as his strongest scumread but leaves open room for her being partnered with GreyICE. Then quickly moves over to Victor even though Victor was apparently a townread (a \"fringe townread\" but a townread nevertheless). The funny thing is, he does everything he can to work with GreyICE to push a counterwagon despite throwing around Sotty7/GreyICE team possibilities. I think he wanted towncred for being against the GreyICE wagon while at the same time leaving him lynchable if Sotty7 flipped. I'll add that Hoopla is right that him saying she wasn't doing anything to \"pressure\" Sotty7 may indicate a partner tell.<br>\n<br>\nThen D2, he spends most of his time pushing GM. Some of his points are accurate - GM did in fact do nothing when GreyICE was getting lynched and she posts in a way that can be difficult to parse and understand at times. But there's no smoking gun, and no passion in this push. He is quick to switch over to Sotty7 when the counterwagon picks up. If he was so sure GM was scum, I think he'd be resisting the Sotty7 counterwagon but it feels almost like he knows she's scum and is being very, very careful not to look bad from a Sotty7 flip. There was one small place where he said he assumed Sotty7 was a mason that I thought looked like a not-partner tell but I don't think it's beyond him to fake. Hopping onto Sotty7 late D2 with \"oh, yeah GM could be a partner\" just mirrors his D1 where he pushes Sotty7 as a potential BBT/GreyICE partner.<br>\n<br>\nThe final straw for me that sealed it was that a lot of his points are regurgitated from others. For example, Victor was the one who brought up the fact that he was doing more than BBT so GM shouldn't suspect him. He also complained about GM not reading his posts. Rask brings up both these points in his GM push. This is more of a general trend in Rask's posting. There were times when I really liked his posting but many points he brings up are unoriginal and when I read the thread, I realize someone else had made that argument before (one example I'll give is that he came up with a paranoid theory that BBT and Sotty7 were together <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">after</div> I suggested that they could be scum vs scum counterwagons). I've tried to see his POV but I just can't get behind his reads. GM does all the wrong things like voting Rask when scum was about to be lynched but she just <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">doesn't fit </div> as a Sotty7 partner in the same way Rask does.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Raskolnikov</span>", "time": "Fri Nov 25, 2016 7:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=2550", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

He insists it has to be two of GM, Hoopla, and MariaR but none of them make sense. GM's interactions with Sotty7 look bad but really aren't bad which I think Rask is ignoring. He's basically taking some of the annoying things GM is doing and calling them scummy.

Hell, even I did it yesterday. It's clear these tells aren't as reliable as they have once been (I've often found these tells to be pretty town looking in the past), and I don't know which ones to discount and which ones to consider valid. The fact that everyone is doing it makes me want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and just call them all null. <br>\n<br>\nOf everyone's I think I find gm's least convincing because it's happened after everyone else's and she's witnessed firsthand in this game how the players perceive these sort of things.

It's getting to the point where most of the players have made a lot of convincing posts, or situations have transpired where I'm questioning why they'd do that as scum. It's hard to really know what is meaningful information right now. <br>\n<br>\nThinking about it more, I am starting to get concerned that the only support I can get for Creature seems to be from fellow Apples, as they may just be doing that for survivalist reasons as scum. The Cloud claim fiasco notwithstanding, BlackVoid has still been the most reasonable player in the game, and his recent posts about Rask have summarised a feeling about him I've also had for a while, where Rask's actions seem to have knowledge that Sotty is scum and he is making sure he is preemptively positioning himself well in his actions/stances/attacks in case she flips.<br>\n<br>\nI think townies occasionally will accidentally find themselves in incriminating interactions with scum who end up flipping (it's hard to not when you don't know who is scum), but you can exonerate them based on the thought that they probably didn't know that player would ultimately flip scum. I think the lack of these situations from Rask paints a picture of a well calculated and if I'm honest, brilliant exhibition of positional scumplay, but like BV says, there is an undertone of implicit knowledge that Sotty is scum.<br>\n<br>\nThis isn't in slamdunk territory for me, but I find it more believable that Rask got himself into pretty good positions as scum over say, goodmorning getting herself into pretty bad looking positions upon a Sotty flip.

I have a hard time seeing a scumteam outside of Rask. The only one I can see is Creature and MariaR but it's a bit iffy. There's also the IAI nightkill. IAI mildly suspected Rask saying that he thought Rask was just telling him what he wanted to hear which is exactly how I felt about Rask at times. If no one sticks out as obviously scummy, I think it points to one of the better players being scum and Rask and Sotty7 fit as a team extremely well.

But then immediately he accuses Hoopla of not pressuring Sotty7. He doesn't outright say it but the implication is that he thinks Hoopla and Sotty7 are partners and that Hoopla is distancing from Sotty7 but not really pushing her. So, that post is made with an underlying assumption that Sotty7 is scum. <br>\n<br>\nThat's the core of my Rask suspicion summarized into a single paragraph.

Her townreading Rask back after his case on her is really weird and she put the onus on me to explain why Rask's case on her was scummy.

I didn't find anything suspect in her progression there, Victor was her top scumread so it doesn't bother me that she never moved off of the Victor wagon especially when GreyICE replaced in and started hard-pushing it.

I'm less sure about Rask as I was yesterday and don't even know who a good partner for him is. I don't think he posts so manically and frantically if Jack is his partner - what's the point when you know you probably have the game in the bag and can compromise onto so many wagons? Really, all of Rask's partners are pretty weird. Creature is a strong connection, goodmorning was a turbo-bus yesterday... I guess Maria makes the most sense with Rask, but even that's, eh. I think it's just Rask's playstyle I can see him doing something creative or awesome as scum and when I can't figure who it'd be without him in it, it makes me want to delve into the paranoia. It's why I'm considering Jack also.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think Creature/Maria or goodmorning/Creature are a thing, so goodmorning/Creature is the only team that makes sense (and maybe Rask/Maria) without something really weird going on. Even now goodmorning wants Creature dead tho, soooo I don't know. When I flesh it out like this, I kinda see why people think I'm suspicious.

I'm still agonizing over this although you can't tell from the way I make pushes and I have D1 open in a separate tab looking for anything that might contradict you being scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't have a strong townread on Hoopla and it's possible that when she saw herself and Sotty7 both being pressured, they decided a one-way bus of the person who made a PR claim was their best shot. But there's still the way Sotty7 buddied her on D1 and Hoopla never buddied her back that makes me think it was Sotty7-scum and Hoopla-town. I also think that Sotty7 enlisting MariaR's help in pushing Jaack and using her Jaack push as a reason to townread her is something scum do to town. That's more likely than two scum just deciding to push Jaack and townreading each other for making the same push. That leaves us with GM. I'm still looking for any indication that might point her way and coming up short.</div></blockquote>\n\nBV before pussying out<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553062#p8553062\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553062#p8553062\" data-post-id=\"8553062\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2775</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27008\">Raskolnikov</a> wrote:</cite><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=65286\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=65286</a><br>\n<br>\nEveryone fucked up early but at one point d2-3 scum mutually hard pushed each other.<br>\nI preferred lynching the scum I felt more confident on than the other one, but compromised on the other one in meh fashion for the d3 lynch as I saw them as possibly both scum anyways.<br>\nAnd I looked really bad as a partner in that case for that preference.<br>\n<br>\nThis guy MagnaOfIllusion just came in before that lynch and was CONSTANTLY pushing me on associations and scumteams for the rest of the game and it was annoying as fuck because it was all earlygame stuff I couldn't say a word to, and eventually the lynchpool d4/pre-lylo boiled down to me and another person I KNEW was town but I had to lynch them over myself because those were the only two options this guy even allowed.

GM started that yesterday I think and MariaR latched onto it. I've been townreading Jaack independent of Sotty7's flip and with that flip, I just don't see any way Jaack bussed her the way he did. The Jaack suspicion is likely coming from scum who don't want to get eliminated quickly based on pairings. Based on today's posting, Cloud has been my strongest townread along with Jaack... which isn't really helpful since I was virtually certain they both were town anyways.<br>\n<br>\nWe've got a pool of four: MariaR, Rask, GM, Creature. Here's what I want from each of you. Make a case on who you think the scumteam is, based off of interactions with Sotty7 as well as each other. If you are town, you know that two of the remaining three are scum. Who is it?<br>\n<br>\nI'm not happy enough with Rask's \"I'm pushing GM and none of the non-GM teams work.\" Because GM-Creature doesn't really work as GM was pushing him all along and he seemed completely certain that Creature was town anyways. From his POV, it has to be GM/MariaR but he isn't pushing MariaR.<br>\n<br>\nMariaR's strong townread on Rask is bordering on improbable. If she's town, she should know that scum are two of GM/Creature/Rask but suddenly decides to bring Jaack into the lynchpool.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like GM's suggestion of telling us to lynch her today. If you are town, you are wrong on one of your townreads on Rask, and MariaR. It would be really helpful if you could point out where you think you went wrong.<br>\n<br>\nCreature - what do you think of Rask now?

I can't see MariaR trying to power through a lynch on her partner when it would clear Rask and leave her and Creature as the most likely two next lynches. I also didn't really see MariaR, GM, and Sotty7 as a team co-ordinating that early BBT push all together. I doubt it's GM and Rask not only for the obvious reasons but because of GM's D2 vote on him. <br>\n<br>\nSo, does GM/Creature make sense? I don't know. GM parked a vanity vote on Creature while Hoopla and Jaack were being run up. Then continued to try and push Creature when Sotty7 was getting lynched. But if she was focused on bussing, why not bus the partner that already claimed and would likely be lynched anyways instead of focusing on the one who would be more likely to make it through? The obvious explanation I can think of is that she didn't think Creature was likely to get lynched that day. She only started casting around for Rask and IAI wagons when Sotty7 got heat.<br>\n<br>\n@Fitz, yeah I just want to see how you replace in when you have lots of pages to read.<br>\n<br>\nCan you also clarify for me what exactly you did upon replacing in.

Obviously, I agree. Where we disagree on is who the scum actually is. I've read over GM and I'm conflicted but still see some of her Sotty7 interactions as weird to come from partners. You had a similar degree of certainty when you pushed Hoopla. Even if you are town, you could be wrong and I don't think going with your most certain read day after day even when you are wrong is viable from my standpoint. I don't know your alignment.

MariaR also uses \"meta\" to read you without explaining why your meta here is your town meta. I don't think it is at all unlikely that Creature and MariaR are partners.

Mariar also proved that she buddied sotty so she mightved buddied rask too, rask didnt want mariar until late in the day and i think it was just a strategic slight bus. I still believe that creature isnt with mariar for the whole day, the voting pattern would need paranoia for me to make them as mafia here, so again, it all points to rask/fitz. BV counted on me to lynch rask on lylo, the thing is, i wont survive to lylo and jack wont lynch her. I also think that jack kind tr creature (like i do from the flip) and would lynch fitz in the case that rask flip town, which all works out considering my reads that creat/mariar not a team, fitz/rask not a team and jack town.

Reading through this morning from when I replaced in to the game up to now though has me thinking the last scum is Rask.<br>\n<br>\nIf Rask is scum...she's already shown a propensity for bussing (ex Sotty) so a Maria hammer is within reason.  Though up to Maria's hammer yesterday Rask had only voted Maria once...with her first vote of the game (RVS?).<br>\n<br>\nRask has never voted Creature in this game and yesterday when Creature got to L-1...if Creature is town...then Rask would have taken a lot of shit for hammering someone she has been town reading (?) most of the game.  This was blatently spelled out to Cloud when he told Rask that a Creature townflip would essentially be a scum claim by Rask.  This prevented Rask from hammering her town read and only left 2 options.  Me (who wagon momentum had petered out) and Maria...who was looking like a shoe in with both BBV and Cloud on it (along with me).   Speaking of along with me...If I was the last scum this same point regarding Rask and a Creature hammer did not apply to me.  As mentioned earlier...if any of you put any stock in meta, I absolutely would have hammered Creature to save a scum partner.  Rask did not have this luxury though and went for the 2nd scum lynch.  Not as good as getting a mislynch but if the lynch was inevitable she might as well get some town cred.<br>\n<br>\nI also feel like a lot of the things Rask (and Creature to be fair) have said/pushed today have been trying to use NAI events to push suspicion towards me.  But Rask's push seems more thought out than Creature's.  I think Creature is shooting from the hip without much thought or filter whereas Rask is trying too hard to push a bs case.<br>\n<br>\nI hope Rask is today's lynch and the game is over.

{"number": 3830, "id": "8623436", "user": "mhsmith0", "user_id": "27591", "content": "wrt setup, I think the comparison to open setup friends and enemies is appropriate (fwiw original setup was wackier than this but 9v3 with extra explicit town power was rejected <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">  )<br>\n<br>\nin terms of friends and enemies, it's an open setup, and masons are confirmed.  In this game, it's not an open setup, but the masons are ALSO confirmed.  This is substantially different than, say, cop/doc/1-shot BP (or whatever the three town prs might be), where it's realistic that one of the claims is simply lying.  So in both this setup and that open setup, the masons are automatically confirmed, which means that one of the two standard advantages for town of open setups (actual PR claims are known to be real roles in the game) is irrelevant, espeically since it's virtually impossible for 3x masons to NOT be self-confirming (since only one can die each night, and it's a pretty notable advantage for town if all survive night one [which actually did happen]).<br>\n<br>\nMoreover, the secondary town advantage of an open setup (you can't fake-claim a random role as scum) was ALSO not really a big difference here.  On day 2, sotty claimed tracker (a fake claim that in many mini normals can be taken as reasonable and buy some extra time), and was lynched anyway (you can debatably make a case that her fake claim made it MORE likely she was lynched as it didn't fit in setup at all, even though she had no real reason to have known at the time that it wouldn't fit into the setup, which meant that it was town-POSITIVE that she ended up fake claiming the way she did).<br>\n<br>\nLater on, cloud fake-claimed 1-shot BG (and it's notable that his wagon was more \"just claim dammit\" as opposed to \"we really think you're mafia), and town made the conscious choice to treat it as conf!town without really scrutinizing either how it did (or didn't) fit into the setup or how his claim fit into the framework of \"omg my role is super important\" that he'd already established (and my goodness it didn't fit the outsize importance he'd pretended to have).<br>\n<br>\nSo in terms of setup, I think it was fine for balance.  Town had three HARD clears (and lest we forget, the masons got early pressure, so that very plausibly prevented at least one mislynch), scum had chances to make self-dooming fake claims (and in fact one did), and the game went down to the wire, with some good plays and some bad plays by both sides, and the result wasn't due to setup balance.  To me that suggests that balance was fine.<br>\n<br>\nPS My apologies to all about the speed deadline error.  I'm glad that in the end didn't impact the result.", "time": "Thu Dec 15, 2016 8:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68822&start=3825", "forum": "53", "thread": "68822"}

There you made sense especially when Eagersnake was getting wagoned and suspected Boring so I had you as a townread pretty early on. You might say that you never defend partners before but there's a first time for everything and the way you dug your heels in and defended Sotty7 didn't feel genuine and it didn't show the same depth of thought I expected from you as town.
