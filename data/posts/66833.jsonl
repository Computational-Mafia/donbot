Like, I expect you to be an adult.  There's a line.  Don't cross it.  Don't try to find it.  Thanks.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General Mafia Rules</span><br>1) All living players may post in thread when it is open (this is the day phase).    This includes players who were just lynched.  No other players may post for any reason.  <br>2) A lynch occurs when the majority of the players vote for another player to be lynched.  This kills the lynched player and ends the day.<br>3) All days will be followed by nights.  Each night will last 48 hours, and any night actions occur then.  <br>4) All living players with PTs may communicate in them at any time.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Night Rules</span><br>1) The Mafia kill is factional.  Any mafia may perform the kill, they must designate who they kill.  This is the only action that mafia member may take that night.  Submit kills in PT.<br>2) Any conflict of night actions will be resolved by following <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a>.   <br>3) Night actions may be submitted at any time after the day starts and before night deadline.  No late actions will be accepted.<br>4) VLA players are expected to submit their night actions before they go on VLA.  Nights will not be extended for VLA.  Players with factional abilities may submit any member of their faction to use those abilities, but the specific player has ultimate authority to their own actions if there is a disagreement.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Posting/VLA/Replacement</span><br>1) Post substantial content every 48 hours.  Failing to do so will result in a prod.<br>2) After too many prods (assume 3) you'll be automatically replaced.<br>3) You have 24 hours after being prodded (48 on weekends) to pick up prod and post.  Failure to do so means you'll be replaced<br>4) Replaced players may not post for any reason.  I will PM you to tell you you're replaced.  Feel free to yell at me there.<br>5) VLA shall be announced in thread (banners/signatures are not sufficient).  If your VLA exceeds one week or at moderator discretion, you may be replaced instead. <br>6) Replacements will receive all mod communication and role PMs their slot received prior to me announcing their replacement.  They will be allowed into any PTs (if applicable) at that time.  Original players will lose access to those same PTs.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting and day end</span><br>1.  Voting shall use an <a href=\"http://www.robandkriskris.com/votecounter/\" class=\"postlink\">automated Vote Counter</a>.  Please post all votes inside vote tags or bold tags on their own line.  I will make an attempt to accommodate nicknames and other names, but this is a courtesy and not necessarily going to occur.  It is your responsibility to make your votes readable to the counter, not visa versa.<br>2.  Attempts to manipulate the above (such as fake voting, fake hammering, etc.) may result in the moderator manually counting the vote and finishing the lynch.  It <span class=\"noboldsig\">will</span> also result in a warning or a force replace.  Please don't manipulate the vote friends.<br>3.  The votes become locked when there are more votes on a player than half the living players (ex 5 if 8 are alive, 3 if 5 are alive), or at least half the players vote to no lynch (ex 4 if 8 are alive, 3 if 5 are alive).  At this time you may talk freely until I lock the thread, but no votes can be changed.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Modkill</span><br>1) Any attempt to use mod communication (including role PM structure, time stamp, etc.) to determine alignment will result in immediate modkill.  No warnings.  Don't do it.  Don't try it.  I will happily answer all questions about what you can say in PM.<br>2) Any issue that can be resolved without modkill will.  Modkill is a last resort to preserve game integrity.<br>3) Modkill will never be beneficial to your faction.  Don't game the system.<br>4) Do not beg for modkills, replacements, etc.  I am not a player in the game and will answer only questions about the actual mechanics of a game.  Anything else can be addressed in PM.  <br><br>Sample VT PM:<br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">You are town.  This is your role:<br><br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Townie\">http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Townie</a><!-- m --><br><br>You use the mechanics described in the 'normal' section of the wiki.<br><br>Confirm with your role name</fieldset>"}

Also, love the point that Snork made about Mecha's questions toward Chumba looking like busy-work more than anything.<br><br>Null reads are just people who didn't post enough yet or nothing in their posts does anything to sway my opinion of them one way or the other.<br><br>I don't like Kappy's posts at all. They don't ring scum all the way, but they also don't contain any real substance and just seem to distract from the matters at hand, very anti-town style. As for the whole self-voting thing, I looked at it as simply RVS and don't see much more behind it. As for Mecha, his argument with Chumba(as stated before) made him look pretty weak in my eyes. Almost all of his counters were BS and effectively countered by Chumba or others, and especially his statement about devil's advocate arguments not being invested in, which horribly misses the very point of devil's advocate. Devil's advocate simply brings up something to think about, from which more ideas can then be fleshed out of, which can then be acted upon accordingly(i.e. Forming tells, votes, etc.) The initial argument in a devil's advocate doesn't need to be invested in simply because investment suggests that the (initial) argument was put forward to be acted upon, which isn't the case. Meant for expansion more than anything.<br><br>As for Sick, didn't like his responses to Persivul about his contradiction. He's either not reading the latter half of Persivul's argument, or is ignoring it on purpose. Either way, no good. Don't like the slip and don't like the arguments(or lack thereof) used to conceal it.<br><br>With all that being said:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sickofit1138</span>"}

People can be not able to turn up for a day. People can miss game start pms. If you are later into a game and someone is showing habit of lurking, sure, try to get them more involved. More discussion is good. And it might be scumlurking afterall. But what good is putting a vote on someone who may not have looked at the game thread yet and might then start posting town without your encouragement. I think you are voting someone for something that is currently null over people you say you think have been scummy. And I think if Dierfire now turns up and is a model citizen it sounds like you are setting yourself up to get towncred from it because you were voting them to \"get them to contribute\".<br><br>I'm not being obtuse. I think right now you are more worried about looking good than finding scum. I think this is indicative of scum motivation. I don't think 'not being available' is a good enough reason for worrying about looking scummy because I think you could have just said you wouldn't be available for the rest of the day and not removed your vote and that would have been a fine reason not to immediately reply. You admit you were worried about being implicated by a highly unlikely event. I don't get why you would be seriously worried that happening as town. Even supposing you were I don't get why town would be worried about catching flak for persuing something they think is scummy. What is the town motivation for self preservation over hunting scum? <br><br>pedit - ooh, I do have to agree with karnos about this. I hate that line from sickofit too.

Don't seem to have differed much since then.<br><br>As for Sick, I like this post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=138#p138\">#138</a> because he finally replies to Persivul with a fine explanation for the contradiction about the whole wagon issue. As much as I hated the contradiction, I hated it even more that Sick never posted an explanation or reply to Persivul about that, but he finally has. Good for him. Also like that Sick pointed out that Persivul has his own glaring contradiction that has yet to be addressed(more on that in a sec). Didn't like that Sick was so quick to put up scenarios for lynching either him or Persivul, but that came off as fustrated townie more than anything. As for Shady, I like his replies to Persivul, seem very effective and full of good content. Although, I have to disagree with Shady about town voting up someone via weak reasoning, because as Persivul pointed out, weak reasoning is all that the town has in the start to go off anyways, and a vote in that regard can help push for something more out of the player being voted on. Such as good counters, explanations, etc. But that disagreement is neither here nor there. Snork because of reasons previously stated. Hasn't posted since then anyways.<br><br>As for nullreads, I do have two exceptions who are on the fence either way. Kappy whose posts have seemed to increase(although still minimal) in content. Waiting to see what he has to say about Persivul vs. Sick as he said he would make a big (I'm also assuming great content filled) post on it. Depending on that post, I might go either way with him. And then Karnos who seems to be playing like a frustrated n00b townie. I like his point about 638 being multi-ball, good counter to Persivul in that regard. But his posts about Dierfire seem to be full of frustration that stems from lurking, or rather, lurking then coming back with a no content post. However, I do believe that Dierfire is having connection issues and don't mind giving him the 24 hours he wanted to contribute to the thread.<br><br>As for MechaGoomba, because of reasons stated previously but also because in his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=211#p211\">#211</a> in which he totally misses the Persivul contradiction pointed out by Sick. Also, Sick HAS said something about it by asking Persivul to address it (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=142#p142\">#142</a> which seems only reasonable as Persivul asked the same thing of Sick with his own contradiction. Don't like that Mecha doesn't pick up on these things, as the same thing happened to him in his argument with Chumba, in which Chumba pointed out the reading issues. Reading the preview, I see that Mecha has said that he assumed that the contradiction was before post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=57#p57\">#57</a> even though he supposedly read Persivul's whole ISO, so still not sure how he missed it even WITH that assumption.<br><br>And finally, Persivul. I had a nulltown tell on him for pointing out the Sick wagon contradiction, but as pointed out above, that issue seems to be addressed(imo) and he seems to be beating a dead horse. On top of that, he's doing EXACTLY what caused me to put Sick into my scum tell. He hasn't addressed his own contradiction pointed out by Sick even though Persivul has even replied to Mecha(in the time I was typing out this post) explaining what Sick is calling him out on. That just comes off as dodging, big time. No bueno.<br><br>Therefore:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Sickofit1138</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Persivul</span>"}

Also, the read on ShadyHood (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7987531#p7987531\">151</a>) is good (and how many Mafia players look up the ages of other players?) and the use of previous games to read players (Sickofit1138 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7987520#p7987520\">150</a>, karnos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7988323#p7988323\">185</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7988514#p7988514\">190</a>) requires a degree of effort that I'd say reflects an attempt to read other players.<br><br>I'm reading Chumba as Town. The vote on Kappy in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7984794#p7984794\">29</a> is fine; ideally Town players would never do what Kappy did there. Following that push in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7984975#p7984975\">43</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985037#p7985037\">46</a>, and beyond feels strong. I believe her when she says that she interpreted Sickofit1138 as being open to a future wagon rather than trying to create one (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985196#p7985196\">60</a>), especially given her rather specific definition of a wagon. It's difficult for me to explain exactly why, but in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985303#p7985303\">70</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985340#p7985340\">74</a> I do not read her as trying to defend Sickofit1138. Rather, I read her as commenting on a major feature of the game at that point (and so I specifically disagree with MechaGoomba in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985431#p7985431\">76</a> and subsequent pushes, but I don't believe that he's Mafia there because he revises his read in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985845#p7985845\">88</a>).

It feels more like Sick was trying to catch Persivul is his own little contradiction, which I think he did. Basically, Sick isn't claiming to be anything, just using Persivul's own logic against him. That's how I read it anyways.<br><br>Lastly, I find it odd that you don't like it when Sick is still pushing the contradiction issue with Persivul, but all of sudden you don't know what to make of it when Persivul was pushing onto Sick for his wagon thing even though you admit that Sick had cleared that up. If you're not sure about one person doing the same action as another person whose actions you don't like, that just seems like you're cherry-picking actions and reasoning based on the person rather than the actual action or reason.

Instead, you give me some irrelevant quote with a non-answer. And to answer qubixes, sort of. My suspicion on him was built from the contradiction argument by Sick, and so my vote was put to get a reaction/defense out of Persivul. It's basically the same thing that I did to Sick with his own contradiction. The difference here is that while I found Sick's defense good enough for me to unvote him, Persivul hasn't convinced me in the same way. If you read my responses above, you can see why I'm not convinced."}

Percy is at the top of a lot of people's townlists, and, without really good arguments, that doesn't seem likely to change. Why not push the wagon on karnos instead? They had plenty of opportunity to, since it was a pretty viable wagon, but they both ignored it until there was seemingly-damning evidence, and then only Kappy jumped on.<br>For that to make sense with Sick and Kappy both being scum, karnos would also have to be scum, and at that point we're talking about having fingered the entire scumteam day 1, which does not happen unless one of the players is a god of scumhunting.<br><br>I could potentially see them both being scum, especially given how Sick conspicuously ignores Kappy, but something about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I don't want to do preflip associatives if at all possible. Could you help me figure this out?</div></blockquote><br><br>Well, now that you mention it, karnos did have that weird on-and-off vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985166#p7985166\">55</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985176#p7985176\">56</a>! However, I don't think that we need to get that far ahead of ourselves. Kappy is behaving oddly towards Sickofit1138 and is suspicious regardless of whether Sickofit1138 is Town or Mafia. If we see Kappy flip Mafia then we can look again.<br>As for the question of why they would both move to Persivul as Mafia, my point is that they both had three votes and no other player had any votes (as of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7984768#p7984768\">27</a>). Kappy first moves not to Persivul but to Chumba (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7984811#p7984811\">30</a>), later moving to Persivul in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7984923#p7984923\">41</a>. So it wouldn't be the case that they both end up on Persivul out of some belief that he's the most viable wagon to push through to a lynch, but rather out of a belief that they can disengage from each other without seeming suspicious.<br>Anyway, you're right--one flip at a time."}

If anything, I think the first couple of posts are really all over the place, without really much care. I think as scum he would tread a little more careful. Also, he hasn't been too concerned so far with defending himself. Or trying to get himself buddied up with someone (maybe percivul somewhat). In general I feel he has been doing more or less his own thing so far. That said, I can be totally wrong, and I'll re-evaluate my read later on. One thing I should for sure do at some point is read/skim through the games he has played so far on this site.

He made it himself and he was going to defend it. He was invested in it. He knew he was right. Kappy, on the other hand, is throwing points out. Once he's made them, he forgets them and moves on to the next one. He has no investment in his cases.<br>One of these is a town player who believes they're telling the truth.

Also, nobody was really pushing sick at that point anymore either. Well, to me sick's push on percivul sounds over the top. I feel he is overselling his \"original\" case quite a bit. Of course that is part style, but it also makes it look like he has done more than he actually did. <br><br>Anyway, kappy might want to take over his own defense. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote><br>I have no idea what you're saying.

First off, my disagreement with Sick's analysis has nothing to do with Persivul dodging the question. I don't know why you're bringing that up as some kind of counter to my disagreement with Sick. If it wasn't a counter, then there was no reason for you to quote that part. Go reread what I wrote, then come back with a coherent argument. Secondly, as to your point about Persivul answering the question, no. It shows you probably just skimmed the whole 1v1 between Persivul and I where I CLEARLY said I didn't think his \"answer\" in post 165 was a logical one compared to Chumba's question in post 162 and explained why by lining the two up. Lastly, if we're being technical here about \"gaps\", then actually Sick's explanation for his wagon contradiction was explained by him in post 9. But even then, let's say that Sick took too long to answer the question, in my eyes, that's still better than not answering the question at all like Persivul.<br><br>However, let's use your point about Persivul actually answering the question in post 165 and <span class=\"noboldsig\">let's say</span> that it was a logical answer to the question, and that makes you satisfied with both Sick and Persivul in regard to their explanations. If we take that point, and apply it to the fact that Sick was willing enough to keep answering the question presented by Persivul and others over and over until it was finally cleared up, that reads as more townie to me as opposed to someone like Persivul who answered the question in one post, but wasn't willing to repeat it in more clear terms for us n00bs who obviously didn't see his answer clear enough. Why wouldn't Persivul just keep repeating his answer in a more clear way for these people instead of refusing to answer, and creating more confusion around it? Creating confusion is never a townie thing to do. I don't care how frustrated you are with the situation. Adjusting your explanation to fit other people's understanding is never a bad thing, and that's what Sick pretty much did and what Persivul didn't do.<br><br>You want to know how I know I'm right about that second paragraph? Because just look at you and Shady as examples. You clearly understood Persivul's totally logical answer to the question, amirite? Whereas Shady is still on about how Persivul has clearly not answered the question presented(post 323). Here, we see two different modes of understanding. What if Persivul simply chose to explain to Shady in a way that Shady could understand? Wouldn't that help dissipate the confusion?"}

I'm not too happy though that it seems once his wagon started to fade away so did his posting- A staggering 20 posts Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, final one explaining that he going away and will be posting even less frequently, and nothing yet today. More damning is the fact that his last 5 or so posts are totally game irrelevant, stuff like miss-posts and talk about hockey. Almost sensing that he was only acting town long enough to break away from a wagon- of course that didn't fully work, as he still has several votes to his name. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/scum</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">sickofit1138</span> started posting a bit weird in RVS as well, and almost immediately called out for some inconsistencies in his posting. Pushed hard for a bit by persivul, who eventually seems to be satisfied that sickofit is town. Yet the feeling isn't mutual, and sickofit continues to vote persivul. Also a few posts I really don't like, such as the one saying no town should vote me, only scum, or the one where sickofit offers that everyone should either vote him or persivul. While I don't think I should automatically view him as scum because of knowing his post style in prior games, that certainly doesn't confirm him as town either. <span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/null</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">mizzytastic</span> Almost every single post by mizzy is a question, prior to #123 where it goes into a more serious attack on me. I don't consider asking questions to be a scum tell, but it almost seems fake, like someone told mizzy to ask a lot of questions as scum so you look like you are town. Even #60, Mizzy's initial vote on me, just looks like a cheap copy of chumba's post #59 a minute prior. After #123, almost every post seems to be focused on me, until a Friday post announcing being away, and no posts at all today. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/scum</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">qubixes</span> Starts by asking questions but quickly moves to more complex analysis, initially with #175 where he votes me. However, unlike mizzy above this looks like legitimate original content, and there is no tunneling- later posts call out species, question the saru/persivul argument, some defending towards kappy (I don't fully agree with TBH, but it doesn't sound scummy), followed by getting a bit caught up in the whole kappy discussion for a few posts. <span style=\"color: #0080FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/town</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">chumba</span> Initial impression was that chumba is clearly town. Her vote on me #59 was real, unlike the nearly identical copy posted by mizzy. A few defensive posts after people question her for defending sickofit, but nothing that screams out scum to me there. Gets a little bit into it and then apologizes for posting so much, odd but not damning. Some interesting points towards persivul, but remains voting kappy. Gets a little defensive later and insists on parking her vote on kappy, and then replaces out. <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">town </span></span>(pending reads of replacement)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">mechagoomba</span> First post #76 is incredibly bad. Seems to be tunneled on proving that chumba is scum because chumba defended sickofit. I read #88 as another bad post... the logic used is that he is unvoting chumba because chuma's stubborn refusal to admit doing what she did proves she is town... I don't like the argument one bit. Almost sounds to me like mechagoomba wanted an excuse to unvote and just had to go with it when chumba refused to confess. After that, jumps on the wagon with mizzy voting me. Comments on my and mizzy's arguments a bit, and makes a remark about species having a \"pretty bad\" ISO. Goes on to question sickofit about his vote on persival and eventually votes kappy. #312 another terribly bad post from a town perspective, complaining that he can't read a post because it has typos, instead of responding to the content. #324 is also bad, just generally showing a lack of patience and refusal to re-explain anything- this IMO can be a scum tell, if you are simply posting what you truly belive it's easy to repeat a point multiple times using different words, but when you are making stuff up you need to make sure you repeat the exact same stuff each time to avoid contradicting yourself. #331 is bad coming from mechagoomba- note I was trying to keep this notes brief, but this just demands an exact quote \"Communication is a two way street. Both the speaker and the listener bear blame when miscommunication happens. To blame the listener (\"you're not reading\") when you're the speaker and blame the speaker (\"creating confusion\") when you're the listener is untenable.\" - I just find this statement coming from mechagoomba to be so ironic, given his earlier refusal to read a post because it had typos and his refusal to re-state a position instead demanding ShadyHood read the top post of the page. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/scum</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">snork</span> Very short ISO, not much to go on. Apparently because he was attending a nieces graduation (congratulations to your niece!), though even after his return we don't have anything new yet. Initial vote of kappy, with a switch to sickofit at #96 for not completely obvious reasons. <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/null</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">species</span> Another relatively short ISO. Lots of short posts asking a singular question or making a small point, reminiscent of mizzy's initial ISO before she started to tunnel me. No vote change since his initial vote on sickofit, which is odd. I consider it a scumtell when someone simply sticks with an RVS vote through, because what are the odds that the person randomly picked matches up with their best scum guess from hunting? I need to remember that isn't exactly the situation here though, because species came into the game late, first post was #97. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/scum</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">saru</span> Saru also started posting late in the thread, in this case at #111, right in with a reads list, and some opinions, sounds very towny. Voted persivul initially after catch-up. Has a little back and forth with chumba, and then gets into it good with persivul. Eventually apparently he has had enough from persivul to convince a vote switch to kappy, but also seems to still view persivul as a possible scum. More or less admits that he wants to pressure kappy, which sounds bad but might just be a noobish error, as pressure doesn't work nearly as well when you admit you are only voting to pressure. <span style=\"color: #0080FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/town</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">shadyhood</span> Another short ISO, and another player requesting replacement. I don't have a strong read on this guy and since he is replacing out I'm going to hold off and do his reads later when the new player for the slot has made sufficient posts. TBD<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">dierfire</span> I hate the prod dodge posts such as #166, but as a one-time thing I won't deduct points for it. The latest late-comer to the game. Another very short ISO, especially when you deduct his fake filler posts #166, #226, #290, #293(semi-content in this one), #354- that is a *lot* of filler. In his favor while he has few posts some are very detailed posts full of useful information. I don't have a strong read here either. I find his posting style very strange, it's like he isn't active in the thread, just periodically posting his admittedly detailed journal of thoughts. I've really never seen another player post exclusively like this, and I don't know what to make of it. <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">null/null</span></span>"}

I don't find this true in his town games.<br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">2</span></span></span> He is very conscious about how what he writes looks. Also didn't find many examples in the meta.<br><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">3</span></span></span> His reads list is long and basically a whole bunch of nothing/null. It reminds me very much of my own read lists when I was scum the first time (I also felt that I should give a list as scum to look townie). <br><br>So let's find some proof of the above shall we? Now that I have finished my quotes, wow there is a lot. Feel free to disagree with some of it that is perhaps a bit picky, but there is just so much that reinforces the picture imo that it can't be ignored. Maybe I was even feeling generous saying it's only 80-90%. I would suggest everyone to at least have a good look at Karnos, to see whether he is scum. I just put in too much effort to let it go to waste by being ignored.<br><br>I color coded them for convenience (see list). I might have gotten some colors wrong.

Mecha refuses to put the tiniest effort to respond to qubixes in 312 because of some typos. Mecha refuses to respond to ShadyHood, instead lazily asks him to reread the post at the top of the page. And then Mecha has the audacity to complain about miscommunication to Saru. Yes, he covers his ass by saying \"miscommunication is not alignment indicative\", but that just begs the question why even bother bringing it all up? Talking about game mechanics, which some see as an easy scum strategy to avoid sharing real reads, this is a step worse than that in my book."}

I'm sure if you look at all my prior games in order, you would notice some evolution in my play-style.  You should also notice something in common among all my town games- I am initially scum read in almost every game, before eventually coming through without getting lynched. I have not been lynched in any game thus far, yet every game seems to start with a wagon on me.<br><br>....<br><br>My play has evolved from this. My early games I attracted a lot of negative attention early on, and so I tried to play more carefully at the start of this game. Obviously its not working out too well.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Overall, Karnos' wishy washy style of play compared to his last game does make me suspicious of him.</div></blockquote><br><br>My last full game was my scum game- you are reading me as scum because I'm not playing the way I play as scum?<br><br>Or are you talking about <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=66642\" class=\"postlink\">Open 640 - Mod Abandoned</a>? That was an interesting game, the majority of it was extremely polarized between GreyICE and me, until things just broke on day two because of mod miscommunication.</div></blockquote><br><br>Sorry, didn't mean to say last game. I was talking about the one I looked at, which was your second newbie game, Newbie 1700. <br><br>Anyways, taking a quick gander at your newbie games where you're town, you seem so confident. Macho and all. You even say yourself that in your first one, you were eager to lynch. <br><br>However, I noticed something big from your only scum game. I want everyone to go look at post 43 from Open 638, the game where Karnos is mafia. That post there rings eerily similar to the one Karnos made in this game about not wanting to lynch someone. Different reasons, with the Open one being cause you were scared to \"push a lynch onto a nice townie\" and this one being because \"I don't wanna be implicated.\" Reasons are different, but not by much. On top of that, both were backpedals on their respective lynches. Think about it. If as town, your so eager to lynch, then in this game you can clearly see why people think your scum. Your unvoting ability is pretty low when your town from what I've seen. However, when your scum, you tend to unvote and just generally backpedal a lot more. <br><br>Another big thing I saw in Open 638 is post 44 where you vote someone because they were hiding or in others words, lurking. Sounds similar to what you did when you voted for Dierfire in RVS, but then tried to justify it with the excuse that he was lurking.<br><br>I'm calling total BS on \"my play has evolved.\" Like Mecha said, don't self-meta. Your play in your town games have all stayed the same. 3 town games and only now it's different? What's the chances? Your play in your only mafia game lines up with your play in this game fairly well, so far. I don't see much evolution happening here to be honest. And as Qubixes pointed out, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that you changed your tone in this game as soon as he pointed out how your tone early on in the game was very different from your town meta. It seems like you're trying to cover up.<br><br>I'm not usually one to go off of meta analysis this much, or really at all, but I have a feeling with Karnos, it's pretty damn revealing. And, Karnos, if you feel I took a quote totally out of context in this post, feel free to point that out and provide some context. I will admit that I didn't really look at the games as a whole, mostly the ISOs."}

It comes across as trying to get someone scumread for something that isn't scummy.<br><br>Lurking is NAI unless you have meta on a person to say otherwise. Town lurk, it happens. People can be not able to turn up for a day. People can miss game start pms. If you are later into a game and someone is showing habit of lurking, sure, try to get them more involved. More discussion is good. And it might be scumlurking afterall. But what good is putting a vote on someone who may not have looked at the game thread yet and might then start posting town without your encouragement. I think you are voting someone for something that is currently null over people you say you think have been scummy. And I think if Dierfire now turns up and is a model citizen it sounds like you are setting yourself up to get towncred from it because you were voting them to \"get them to contribute\".<br><br>I'm not being obtuse. I think right now you are more worried about looking good than finding scum. I think this is indicative of scum motivation. I don't think 'not being available' is a good enough reason for worrying about looking scummy because I think you could have just said you wouldn't be available for the rest of the day and not removed your vote and that would have been a fine reason not to immediately reply. You admit you were worried about being implicated by a highly unlikely event. I don't get why you would be seriously worried that happening as town. Even supposing you were I don't get why town would be worried about catching flak for persuing something they think is scummy. What is the town motivation for self preservation over hunting scum? <br><br>pedit - ooh, I do have to agree with karnos about this. I hate that line from sickofit too.

It comes across as trying to get someone scumread for something that isn't scummy.<br><br>Lurking is NAI unless you have meta on a person to say otherwise. Town lurk, it happens. People can be not able to turn up for a day. People can miss game start pms. If you are later into a game and someone is showing habit of lurking, sure, try to get them more involved. More discussion is good. And it might be scumlurking afterall. But what good is putting a vote on someone who may not have looked at the game thread yet and might then start posting town without your encouragement. I think you are voting someone for something that is currently null over people you say you think have been scummy. And I think if Dierfire now turns up and is a model citizen it sounds like you are setting yourself up to get towncred from it because you were voting them to \"get them to contribute\".<br><br>I'm not being obtuse. I think right now you are more worried about looking good than finding scum. I think this is indicative of scum motivation. I don't think 'not being available' is a good enough reason for worrying about looking scummy because I think you could have just said you wouldn't be available for the rest of the day and not removed your vote and that would have been a fine reason not to immediately reply. You admit you were worried about being implicated by a highly unlikely event. I don't get why you would be seriously worried that happening as town. Even supposing you were I don't get why town would be worried about catching flak for persuing something they think is scummy. What is the town motivation for self preservation over hunting scum? <br><br>pedit - ooh, I do have to agree with karnos about this. I hate that line from sickofit too. Why should town stay out of your way if they think you are being scummy. Even if they turn out to be wrong isn't that what town is supposed to do?</div></blockquote><br><br>posts like this make me wonder why this day isn't over.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7987520#p7987520\" class=\"postlink\">post 150</a>, Persivul wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7987499#p7987499\" class=\"postlink\">post 145</a>, Sickofit1138 wrote:</cite>You know.</div></blockquote><br>OK.

This could be playstyle though so I'll re-ISO him in context of his other games. I think he's already at L-2 so I won't add my vote right now.<br><br>I don't like Snork's sole content post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985937#p7985937\">Post 96</a>). He townreads Chumba for weak theory reasons and is way too sure of the read. He swipes at MechaGoomba for \"busywork\" questions when I thought Goomba's questions to Chumba were pretty legitimate. It reads as if Snork decided he was going to buddy Chumba and started fielding away attacks on Chumba.<br><br>JohnnyFarrar (Shadyhood's replacement) is another possible candidate for scum regardless of what Karnos flips. He sounds way too certain about his scumflip repeatedly asking why Karnos isn't already dead and agreeing with pretty much every case on Karnos. The day is not even halfway done. It's been six days since the game started and we still have eight days left. A bunch of people either need to catch up or be replaced and there's plenty more discussion to have. I think it's obvious why we haven't lynched yet. I think it's partly just rhetoric but I find it very overblown and the confidence doesn't match up to what I'd expect from someone who just replaced into the game and is catching up. It sounds like he's pre-decided he's pushing Karnos.<br><br>Kappy is a player I'm very conflicted on. I think he was acting very loose and unself-conscious at the beginning (someone mentioned this already but I can't recall who) and I think that his free-flowing posts and constant vote changes were town. I dislike his evaluation of Sickofit vs Persivul though and there's a lot of stuff he completely misinterpreted (Saru pointed most of this out).<br> <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8001926#p8001926\" class=\"postlink\">post 453</a>, qubixes wrote:</cite>@Wingback Why do you read Dierfire as town?</div></blockquote><br>Mostly based on his entrance (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990182#p7990182\">Post 228</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990183#p7990183\">Post 229</a>). A lot of what he said in those two walls was stuff that I was thinking too. A couple of examples:<br><ul><li>His townread on Persivul matched mine and came at a point where Persivul was picking up a wagon. I was leaning town on Pesivul for the same reasons (because of how he was updating his read on Sickofit) and it's a point I would have brought up had Dierfire not beat me to it.</li><li>His difficulty in reading sickofit.

I didn't read the entirety of Open 640 but from an ISO of you and Ctrl+F Persivul, it seemed like he was scum with GreyICE and when GreyICE attacked you, he defended you leading you to townread him.

It's not something where I can point at one or two posts and say \"there, that is why he is town!\", just his general play overall seems like the play a town player should use. He pushed, voted, applied pressure, but when he got a response he thought indicated town he would relent and move to another target. I feel that a scum player would be more likely to ignore the response or act like it's not good enough and keep pushing for a lynch. I lied in the post quoted above.<br><br>The reveal that Persivul was scum in open 640 made me realize something. There are some players who are good enough that I won't be able to read them as scum, at least not without some pressure to make them adjust their posting style. At the time, there was a small wagon forming on Persivul, so I made the rash decision to vote him myself, with the above flimsy argument, in the hopes that persivul under pressure might post something I could read as scum.<br><br>This is actually what I was referring to in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7999057#p7999057\">410</a> - I didn't want to immediately state that my vote on persivul was entirely fake, because I was still hoping that he might feel slightly pressured and say something he wouldn't say otherwise.<br><br>Above said, I am obviously give up on that play.

I don't feel like the time before the flip is going to be of much use. For example this back and forth between you and Mecha is imo just filling up the thread and not actually getting anything done. I don't feel like anyone else is really getting anywhere either (me included). So unless someone else wants to push in a different direction, I think we're just wasting time. Saru is right that if the replacements would want something different, it might be useful to see what happens. Now, not so much. <br><br>If you are town, blindly pushing Mecha isn't going to help. I think you should be lynched Today pretty much regardless of what happens from now on. But if you're town and you want to help us after your flip, I think you should try and see if you can find any other pointers in this game, because I think your case on mecha looks pretty bad, i.e. I wouldn't follow it even should you flip town."}

(He voted Persivul and left him out of a readslist with a vague hint so that after some time passes, he could pretend to make this grand reveal that he was in fact townreading Persivul and this was an elaborate test in order to read Persivul.) I explained why this is unlikely based on Karnos's experience and skill level.<br><br>3) He is scum and faked the read entirely. (He opportunistically jumped onto the Persivul wagon hoping the mislynch Persivul. He omitted Persivul from his readslist with a vague hint. Why? Why not write up some fake reasons for scumreading Persivul? Karnos certainly doesn't seem like the type who is incapable of writing large volumes of text. Surely, he could have made something up.<br><br>Is this an accurate summary of the possibilities? If you are pushing that the third option happened, then why did he omit the Persivul read rather than make something up? I don't see the scum benefit here. But I do see why he as town would try to do a \"reaction test.\" Especially because Persivul was scum in a recent game and Karnos had wrongly townread him in that game so is understandably a bit wary on Persivul.<br><br>Pedit: Qubixes, are you arguing that #2 is what happened?"}

Which to me makes more sense as town as well. <br><br>As scum these kinds of reaction tests can be quite useful, because you can decide afterwards whether you like or not like the reaction depending on how the wagon forms. Or even decide whether it actually was a reaction test or not. In that sense it is a very flexible tool as scum; he could be planning #2 or #3 at the same time and decide later.

I had Karnos as a scumread all the way until the page this post showed up and I just want to say that if we're all going to be reaction testing and put out fake reads it's going to be hard to distinguish the townreads from the scumreads so please stop it. Karnos doesn't strike me as the kind of person to fake this as scum so while I still dislike the reaction test thingy, his explanation makes sense to me and he can be town. So can Wingback, but I already had good feels of sickofit at some point. Kind of popular reads I guess, I also like Persivul for town, but carefully.<br><br>Now that Karnos is a townread I need to reread some iso's, don't have strong scumreads. I'm not impressed with Dierfire at all so far, Shady doesn't impress me either but I did like Johnny's catch-up. Would like to see more from him. Species has next to no content at all but it's a small iso and not enough to actually call him scum for it but I'm very much looking forward to his replacement. Snork has even less posts but I get more townvibes from his posts compared to Species. <br><br>I don't like Mecha for focussing on Wingback while pushing Karnos. For one, if Karnos was scum I would expect him to either just fake changing his read from scum to town or not have such a detailed explanation for his reaction test at least. Also, Karnos has adressed Mecha and Mecha ignored that to keep pushing that Karnos faked a read. Why would any scum admit to faking a read? Even if it might be fitting to how you've been playing, you still do not want to put that seed into other people's brains. <br>I feel that Karnos saying he faked his read is a bit awkward, but I think what he means (and what showed from what he was doing) is he was actually townreading Pers but afraid/paranoid about being wrong. This happens, people get alts because of it. Anyway, he 'faked' scumreading Pers to get a more definitive reaction out of him hoping to ensure his read.<br><br>Mecha, what's your read on Wingback again?<br><br>Johnny, have any of your reads changed since your catch-up post?"}

(Reasoning below)<br>2) If Karnos and Wingback are aligned, likely the third is in the inactive pile based upon how a lack of a counter wagon has emerged. I want to see how the species slot responds in when replaced but the lack of a counterwagon concerns me. This game feels very odd. <br>3) I think mostly Persivul v Sick was TvT.<br><br><br>487 to 516 by Wingback is a very odd switch to suddenly town reading Karnos. Karnos's ISO is littered with things I cannot simply imagine a town player doing. For example I have not been in a forum mafia game in a very long time where a player intentionally forgets a read, has a confession time, seemingly multiple times, and has such a defeatist attitude. Town fights. It comes back from being slapped in the face and forces people to make reads and take stances. Karnos feels like a lukewarm player faking passion rather than an actual passionate player to find scum. <br><br>Let's break this down further. In 499 he has his confession time which is super scummy. Not only that he says he has given up on \"this play\" town do not have plays they lynch scum. 504 he then says he is going to withhold reads. Even if you suspect you are going to be lynched as a townie you drop reads, bombshells, something.<br><br>517 -- Is almost a backhanded insult/compliment/something. They imply that Karnos is not skilled enough to do it. However there were 0 suggestions that he had done anything of the sort. This makes me think that Wingback knows that Karnos is scum and looking for any reason to save Karnos.<br><br><br>This play is just too weird to be anything but the same alignment IMHO. <br><br><br>Dierfire  - I really like Dierfire's 558 and reasoning. It seems spot on. Looks like they are trying to figure out the game and analyze things. Town lean.<br>The Bulge (replaces Chumba) -- Scum lean -- see more below<br>Mathblade (replaces Snork) -- Me -- The towniest town to ever town<br>species -- Scum lean -- see more below<br>qubixes -- Strong Town lean -- Post 175 -- I think qubixes is spot on with the Persuval v Sick discussion. That feels like TvT ripping each other apart. I don't really understand how that got started anyway. I plan on rereading this tonight and seeing how that got started. The first person on the Karnos list according to VC.<br>Saru -- Strong Town lean -- Post 326 -- This post screams town to me. They read the argument presented, logically break it down, and reiterate their point in such a way that is clear concise and to the point. Side note: 330 made me laugh like hell. Thank you <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> As the McDonald's theme song goes...ba ba ba ba ba I'm lovin' it.<br>MechaGoomba -- Null read -- I like how he was towards the front of the Karnos lynch but at the same time this is what scares me. Mecha's posts in an ISO isolated seem fine but when I put them together in context I get the heebie jeebies. If I'm wrong about both Wingback and Karnos being scum together I'll be poking here. Hard. 388 specifically gives me a weird vibe. <br>JohnnyFarrar (replaces ShadyHood) - Town lean - At first I was reading their posts and like WTF -- They seem really arrogant and brutish at first. Almost something I saw with new scum but then there was a well thought out post that made me go, hey this guy is experienced...Which I looked at my notes and then went waaaaaaaaaaaaaat? Their play throws me for a loop. So I started looking for other posts to try to get an idea and short and choppy and brash seems to be their thing. <br>Kappy -- Null read --With how the wagon formed on Karnos and not Kappy benefit of the doubt here and they are a null read. I really don't like how they voted Karnos in 192 then hopped back on the wagon later though. 484 with you're welcome rubs me as almost sarcastic like a potential thank you for bussing? <br>Persivul - Very slight town lean -- Seems like newb town -- I don't like the sheep of Johnny but I do like the short and sweet statement on 406. I get similar mixed vibes from the Persivul v Sick drama but the vote pattern says probably town. <br>Masquerade (replaces Mizzytastic) -- Town derp -- Masquerade is probably either town derp or scum. I do not see what they are getting at in 542. 510 is one of the scummiest posts in Karnos's list. It is very defeatist. Of course town doesn't want to be lynched but if they are they want to make sure the scum are easy to find. But then Karnos is actively not pushing valid reads, not poking people or asking questions. It's all defense. How Masquerade gets town of of that I do not know AT ALL.<br>karnos - Very likely scum<br>Wingback (replaces Sickofit1138) -- I think they are probably scum with Karnos for the reasons above.<br><br>I know there's a lot of scum leans up there but they are conditional. Species is a scum read because of limited posts then are now being replaced. 121 seems off. They seemed like they wanted to throw shade on people for their RVS vote. This slot seems very scummy to me and will do so unless they suddenly popup with town play and with town tattooed on their ass for extra insurance.<br><br>Masquerade falls into that category of not much to go on. 51 and 20 feel like forced interaction between the two. Something feels off of it and unnatural. Furthermore the Mizzy slot votes Karnos early but that slot vote disappears. 146 furthermore feels wrong. JohnnyFarrar's predecessor made an argument about it and Mizzy was really weird in that. I don't see their logic on it at all. 177 also feels like a coach of Karnos. Coupled with Masquerade not voting what is obv scum in Karnos, they'd be the one I'd pick to fill out the likely third scum.<br><br>So overall I think the scum is {Karnos, Wingback, and one of Masquerade and Species} leaning Masquerade because of the Karnos not voting pushes it over. I don't think both could really be it as that'd be 4 scum in a 13P game which seems horribly unbalanced."}

In fact, presenting himself as a leader and assuming that he'll be nightkilled doesn't match up with his half-hearted semi-catchup and lack of activity since. A good majority of his catchup contained quotes of other people making cases on Karnos and piggybacking off of them. He doesn't give any of his own reasons and his catchup style of quoting people's posts and either approving or disapproving them doesn't take much thought or effort and is really easy to fake as scum. If someone replaces into the game, it means they have at least some spare time to catch up and Johnny not doing catching up on a short twenty-page game in over three days shows me his heart is really not in it. He doesn't redeem Shady's posts and in fact, it made me more confident that the slot is scum. Would like to understand what you are seeing here. I'm also interested in seeing everyone's comments on my read on Johnny. <br><br>Also, Masquerade's entrance re-inforced my townread on Mizzytastic. <br><br>@qubixes, I glanced through the towngames that Karnos linked in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8000039#p8000039\">Post 432</a> but didn't find anything that I could confidently say that this is the difference between his play as town and scum. The one scumgame he had was multiball which means he was genuinely hunting for the other team which makes it unreliable as meta. From a cursory glance, I noticed that he was pushing back hard on GreyICE in Open 640 as town but that was mostly him reacting to a very aggressive/ruthless push. He's reacted to Mechagoomba in a similar way but overall, I didn't find a smoking gun. <br><br>I think the push on him for worrying about being implicated in a mislynch doesn't take into account that while scum might be thinking that, it's very unlikely they would actually say it in thread. I don't want to keep rehashing the same argument as I doubt it'll convince you if it hasn't already. I do want to know if you are willing to compromise on any other player. JohnnyFarrar and Mathblade are good alternatives - explained Johnny above, I'll explain the Mathblade read in my next post."}

The scum are the biggest wagon and the two people defending the biggest wagon (me and Masquerade) and I at least have already received some blowback for sticking my neck out. Mathblade doesn't consider the possibilities that I could be town and right, or that I could be town and wrong, or that I could be scum defending a town-Masquerade. Obviously, I think I'm right but the way they narrow it down to both of us being the same alignment and adds Masquerade in for good measure looks very crude and not well thought-out.<br><br>Secondly, most of their reads are either based on Karnos or just completely arbitrary. The qubixes townread references the post where he voted Karnos (the bit about calling Persivul vs Sickofit TvT doesn't make sense either since Sickofit is my slot). The Dierfire townread was also because of the post where he voted Karnos. The Persivul townread for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7999028#p7999028\">Post 406</a> where he simply clarified a post is weak as Persivul made several posts in the game and had a lot of readable content. The Saru read for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7994327#p7994327\">Post 326</a> is similarly weak. This supreme confidence in a Karnos scumflip makes very little sense from the POV of a replacement who wasn't involved in the game and never came up with their own original reasoning for pushing Karnos (that's the major difference between how Mizzytastic and qubixes were pushing him and how JohnnyFarrar and Mathblade are piggybacking).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8013704#p8013704\" class=\"postlink\">post 566</a>, qubixes wrote:</cite>Also, you're using the competence argument on Karnos both ways.

I like that you are doing your own homework at least.<br><br>The Bulge (replaces Chumba) - MIA? I thought Chumba seemed pretty town, but since being replaced the bulge has not been very talkative. Literally only one post in the last 5 days. busy? hiding?<br><br>species - Totally MIA. If I were to follow my instincts, I'd say here is the scum right here, hiding in plain sight... but the meta here seems to be that MIA players are null/town, and focus on the hiders is apparently a HUGE scum tell. If he needs a replace, he needs a replace. If not, it's extremely suspicious to me that he has been hiding so long.<br><br>JohnnyFarrar (replaces ShadyHood) - I like what I have read so far. Not afraid to push, but not easily manipulated either. And I am not just saying that because he could hammer me if he wanted. Please catch-up and offer your input.<br><br>Kappy - Early on, I took kappy for a null/town who could be easily miss-lynched due to an immature play style. Since than inconsistencies pushed that read down, but I still don't think he is obvious scum. Maybe I am just hanging on to hope, because I sense that defending him is part of what brought a wagon to myself, I don't want to find out I was defending a scum.<br><br>Persivul - I've read him as town most of the game. I'd love to see his take on whats going on, not just on me.<br><br>Saved these for last, because they are sort of a special read IMO:<br><br>Mathblade (replaces Snork)-  Here is a scenario. replaces into a scum slot, seeing a big wagon on town, hit the jackpot! He just had to hammer a few nails into my coffin, and he has a free town lynch without the nasty scummy look from pushing a wagon from scratch. Based on my thinking now, this is the most likely scum on my wagon. Also: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013498#p8013498\">562</a> : LAMIST.<br><br>Wingback (replaces Sickofit1138)- I read sickofit a lot like I read kappy- a bit of an immature town player. With the replace in, and change of posting, I am reading this slot very differently. If mathblade is the scum on my wagon, this is the scum going for towncred by opposing the wagon. Of course, by saying this I might just push him to quickhammer me. I honestly hope I am wrong, I hope an actual town player is on my side here, but knowing I might get lynched in the near future I'd rather out this theory now rather than wait."}

I never said at any point that Karnos was a townie. I'm not voting for Karnos because I'm too unsure at the moment(that and because it's now L-1), not because I think he's town. Not sure how you came up with that. On top of that, my issue with you was mainly with you tying people to Karnos as scum if they ended up defending him. I see their defense as more cautionary than anything else. I don't look at it as they're defending their scum partner, but simply that they want to stop what they feel is a mislynch. Especially given that it's only D1, and that just seems too convenient that both scum are defending their scum partner. You can argue that their defense of Karnos is a stretch, sure, but I feel that those accusing Karnos are also kind of stretching because they seem to be going off of pure meta analysis. Or at-least that's how this started.<br><br>And I know what you might say, that it's not about meta analysis anymore, it's more about his recent play. And has Karnos' recent play been scummy? Sure. Especially with that really shitty push onto Mecha after the reads list. I even pointed this out. But I also feel that it's a side effect of him scrambling up a defense as fast as he can. I'd be damned if I didn't admit that I've had moments where I was town trying to hastily defend myself from a lynch and freaking out and not thinking about what I'm really trying to say, only causing me to dig a deeper hole for myself, just like it looks like Karnos is doing. On the other hand, I might be giving Karnos the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>At this point, I might just wait for a Karnos claim before I choose to do anything further.<br><br>P-edit: I have to agree with Karnos here that if Karnos is town, scum are on both sides of the argument here. I've been thinking about that for a while now."}

You are complaining that my reads have to many null reads, while MechaGoomba complaints that I have more scum reads than the total number of scum in the game (even though I actually had 0 scum reads, only some null/scum reads). For the record, I don't think I posted any reads in either of my newbie games until day 2 or later.

I don't know, I just get this strong feeling with him that he doesn't really care that much. So time to get to know Johnny a little better (look at his more recent games) He's more involved as town. I found 2 scumgames (I didn't go back too far, people change) and in one he died too soon but the other one is the game his playstyle rn resembles most for me.<br><br>@Johnny: You didn't seem too interested in the gamestate when Karnos was still being wagoned. You also haven't said anything about Karnos' claim. You got interested when you started getting votes. Or am I wrong?<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Johnny</span>"}

I don't think we should lynch him today. Pretty sure I've said as much.

My biggest problem here is imo not whether Karnos is Neapolitan or not. It is whether he is town or scum aligned. I don't understand, is there some hidden ratio here that makes Neapolitan &gt;80% town or something? Because I remember a discussion somewhere about (I think) the exact role, and how useful it is for scum. Could even be inspiration for the setup even, I guess. Also, you don't really get caught with it? So how do we determine which alignment Karnos is later on?<br><br>So what is the plan then if you let Karnos live? Let him claim VT's, not claim Role/Mafia. Then lynch him in LyLo? It feels like the benefit of this is rather marginal, especially compared to lynching scum day 1. Please explain me your plan in case Karnos is scum/Neapolitan."}

I also was scum reading Karnos at the time. By putting that there I realized I could try to figure you out early. <br><br>Now for the post I quoted. It is the Wingback paragraph that really sold me you were town. It wasn't that you were asking questions it was the how you asked them.

Completely ignores the fact that disagreeing with a player\u2019s analysis on why someone is scum means you read that player as Town.  Players can have crap reasons for scum-reading someone and pointing that out even if you scum-read that same players is very Pro-Town.  That is a very scummy insinuation.

Which is why, respectfully I asked that question to Karnos. I also wanted to see what prompted him to think that specific way.

I\u2019m not going to drill down to the most explanatory level on every post I make.  People complain about my post lengths as it so conciseness is of a premium.  So sorry, that\u2019s just not happening.  Mafia is a game of assessing intent and making intuitive leaps.  My expectation is that others are capable of doing so or will ask.  I don\u2019t think my original post was all that vague personally.<br><br>2. First I am reading karnos as scum and your hypothetical question was about my read on Johnny which does not hinge at all on Johnny being a counter-wagon.  That is your wording not mine.  The case about Johnny\u2019s wagon revolves around it not getting any traction when there is plenty of in thread evidence supporting Johnny-scum.  So I\u2019m not sure, given what I have already posted, why you have trouble seeing my Johnny scum case as not being heavily influenced by a hypothetical of karnos Town.<br> <br>3.  A No Lynch also benefits scum.  And given scum are in the significant minority a flash wagon at deadline does stand a chance of hitting one of them.  The extent of control  are implying scum have is somewhat overstated.  Also \u2013 why is a fizzling wagon on hypothetical Town a benefit to scum again?<br><br>4.  Um I responded in kind to you basically stating I didn\u2019t understand what was going on.   Your reaction to being called out on poor reasoning is a little bit out of proportion I think.   Given I did state a concrete opinion (Johnny\u2019s wagon disappated too easily this close to deadline to be Town) and your basically tried to doubtcast yourself (\u201cYou didn\u2019t understand why something happened so scum did it which is terrible\u201d) I\u2019m unsure why I wouldn\u2019t question whether you were actually trying to process motivations and reasons."}

There's more to it than that, although I'm having trouble phrasing how I feel. The essence is that Kappy's read changed with frequencies and degrees that should require stronger reasons than what he gave.<br><br>I have two questions about your second point. First, do you think that the case on JohnnyFarrar (your current vote) is substantially stronger than the case on Kappy? If you say that it is I will surely ask you why. The second question is, if you feel that my case on Kappy is weak, why were you concerned (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013728#p8013728\">569</a>) when I moved my vote away in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013189#p8013189\">558</a>? Some of that appears to have been a misunderstanding of my reasoning for voting for karnos, but the phrase \"abandon the push on Kappy\" doesn't quite sound as though you were thinking along the same lines there.<br><br>Your third point is partially correct; I didn't feel that I had anything contribute, so I went looking for something to do and found something by Kappy that I thought might warrant comment. I did want him lynched, though!<br><br>Mizzytastic is Masquerade now, right? I thought that his initial reason for reading karnos as Town was weak, but I didn't see anything suspicious about it. His point (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8020084#p8020084\">657</a>) that karnos might have claimed sooner if Mafia is fair, and I don't mind chewing on that for a while since karnos shouldn't be lynched today anyway. I've been reading qubixes as Town, so I disagree with his vote there (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021080#p8021080\">684</a>), but he's been casting suspicion at those on the karnos wagon, so it at least fits that thought process. His vote on JohnnyFarrar also seemed to be based on weak but not suspicious reasons.

The thing where you're as vague as you can possibly be until called on it is really annoying.<br>2) That statement assumes that a counterwagon would be needed. If karnos was town, mafia would be gleeful Math and Quib were trying to do their work for them. Given that you said your Johnny read is unaffected by whether or not karnos is scum, that doesn't really make sense.<br>3) This close to deadline, a fizzling wagon is a benefit for scum.

In a face to face Mafia game in Chicago there was a werewolf cop (Cheetory6) who claimed cop and no one CC'd and so everyone assumed he was town and then coasted to a victory. So yes. If I do not believe cop claims I want them lynched because they can and will fuck with you if you let them. <br></div></blockquote><br>Just because a bad thing happened once doesn't mean you have to be paranoid about it in every single future case.<br>How many times have you played in a game where an unCCed cop was town and provided useful results? I'd assume more than one.</div></blockquote><br><br>I absolutely should be paranoid. Paranoia is an excellent thing. It is about when to apply that paranoia that you are disagreeing with.  Yes the number of games where an unCC'd cop provided useful evidence is more than 1, but those unCC'd cops didn't crumb other roles and didn't do even a quarter of those things here. In the games where the cop was unCC'd and was scum (face to face games), we traded a townie for the sake of that information when we did it. Now I'm going to ask you: Is your site theory worth potentially a different townie being lynched? For me, I always evaluate the claim based upon how the rest of their play has been. If there is any shred of redeeming qualities I back off. However no one points to anything but the claim which infuriates me.<br><br>The other thing is I really don't like Dierfire's voting pattern further after their response to me asking. It looks like on post 510 that he crumbs vengeful. However, that is not the claim they ended up doing. The most likely result is that since the Karnos wagon was picking up steam that scum said to start dropping off power role crumbs.If he was really evaluating Karnos for role claims, why would he not be more suspicious when Karnos claims?  They then link to 657 in the following post as a post they agree with. <br><br>657 is an absolutely horrible post. Horrible. Masquerade says if they were scum they would have claimed sooner. More like if they were town they would have claimed the first time they were at L-1. Secondly, the lack of a counterwagon is a shitty argument here for two reasons. A) There were a fuck ton of replacements into the game. Arguing that there wasn't a counterwagon is ridiculous. Hell, if Masquerade really suspected me of being scum, the argument can be made that I was forced to bus Karnos(more on this later regarding Magna). If Masquerade really suspected me at that time I don't think Masquerade would have brought up the lack of a counterwagon followed up with lynched no matter what in the same post. Lynched no matter what would mean you'd look for scum bussers not a counter wagon. <br><br>This brings me back to Masquerade's posts: <br><br>Their biggest gripe was why I didn't bring it up when it happened. I only had minutes in order to get my posts out to try to understand because I was on VLA. I didn't have time to go into a wall into every little instance Masq was scummy. In general I pointed to their lack of passion and how they aren't pushing me. Then they come back and say they are okay to move back to Johnny if they have to for time. Again -- I did not ignore your posts. I either addressed them in another person's answer or they were no longer relevant. Their next post is about how they want my lynch. Apathetic again no reasons. There's no push. They aren't poking at what they find bad about my posts and trying to explain themselves to everyone. They are just \"I want this\" (paraphrase).<br><br>Magna then also tries to suggest that I could be bussing Karnos. This along with Wingback's 782 is sketchy as well as Masq's argument of a lack of a counterwagon is sketchy. I already FoS'd these two as a potential combo. This looks like a way to support having a read without actually having one. They also ask why I did not vote Masq in that slot. This is really telling as it looks like Magna is trying to get buy in from a player that seems mostly town read rather than actually having stances. That second paragraph is also bullshit. Claims do not move votes. People vote/unvote based on what they read. Secondly a gut town read when I was reading was just that. Gut. If something changes to give my gut indigestion, I poke at that thing til it no longer gives me indigestion or confirms itself as eternal bullshit spewer deserving of lynch. That town lean was before Dierfire started doing crazy vote shit.<br><br>Johnny Farrar is a town read based upon meta I have read and the current events in the thread. This lynch looks strongly like something weird is going on. IMHO Mecha's warning bells about the Johnny lynch are probably accurate. Furthermore, I don't like how when I suggested Masquerade and Magna's slot as scum and now they are both dropping shade on my slot while actively pushing other agendas or none at all. <br><br>If we don't lynch Karnos, we should lynch within these three IMHO. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Masquerade</span><br><br>I'm changing my vote to Masquerade because Dierfire looks to be making an effort while Masquerade is doing the exact same shit I called them out for in 784 and they have had 24 hours to give a reads list with actual stances in it. <br><br>Manga/Dierfire -- You should give a reads list as well. If Karnos is scum, then it is highly probable that I am wrong on at least one of you three. Do something other than respond. Breathe. Live. Right now for all three of your slots I'm having a hard time finding what you believe. (I was including Dierfire in this but they already said they were going to when I pressed preview for this post.)"}

I specifically don't want this to be a meta-read or an associative read, but that's what I have. For the former, I recall seeing previous games in which he was incorrectly lynched for being \"lazy\" (not my words). I don't want to try to track down whether there are variations in the way that that presents between his Town games and his Mafia games; I would rather judge him by his (eventual) actions. The latter is at least easier: his vocal support for lynching karnos (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8002047#p8002047\">469</a>) that is never followed by a vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021290#p8021290\">693</a> offers the justification that he didn't want to push something before catching up), combined with his comparatively weak reasons for reading him as Town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023792#p8023792\">755</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023841#p8023841\">760</a> are good examples--that a new Mafia player would not create such a claim and that Mafia players don't often claim their true roles) would make good sense from a partner if karnos is Mafia. They don't make as much sense if karnos is Town and JohnnyFarrar is Mafia; that level of specificity is not needed to avoid lynching a Town player making that claim. One thing that I can say is that enough players have made noises about suspecting me that JohnnyFarrar should not be Mafia if his partners are not among them (that is, if all players muttering about me are Town and JohnnyFarrar is Mafia, then the Mafia players are missing an opportunity).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Persivul</span> has not been as active recently, but I don't see anything suspicious in his posts. The reason for the vote on JohnnyFarrar (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8020108#p8020108\">658</a>) seems to be a lack of helpful activity, which is a weak but not suspicious reason. My impression from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990182#p7990182\">228</a> (Town) remains.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Wingback</span> was Sickofit1138. I agreed with most reads on entry in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8001906#p8001906\">452</a> (I noted the exception for the read on Mizzytastic in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8005418#p8005418\">494</a>). He's been more open to what karnos was saying than I am, but the perspective sounds plausible from a Town player. The reasons given for the vote on JohnnyFarrar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8020834#p8020834\">673</a> are essentially the same as above--a lack of helpful activity, which is easy to do as a Mafia player (reasons were given well before the vote, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013696#p8013696\">565</a>). I still think that I'd lynch Kappy first.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MagnaofIllusion</span> has written quite a bit recently. I don't know how I'd analyze the association with karnos (expressing suspicion while not wanting to lynch the claim is where I am as well, but is plausible to me from a few other angles). His reasons for voting for JohnnyFarrar are good--better than most others on that wagon. While he also presents the inactivity angle in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023711#p8023711\">750</a>, he additionally noted the possible association between JohnnyFarrar and karnos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023467#p8023467\">740</a> and some wagon dynamics in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8026303#p8026303\">785</a>). I'll call this a Town read.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">qubixes</span> has been as close to a \"gut read\" as I get for some time now. He appears to be voting for JohnnyFarrar because MagnaofIllusion persuaded him to do so (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023774#p8023774\">754</a>). I do not have a problem with MagnaofIllusion being the one to persuade him. In the spirit of avoiding confirmation bias I'll say that this is a weak read--but it remains a weak Town read.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MechaGoomba</span> also has reasons that are a bit stronger than average for being on the JohnnyFarrar wagon--essentially, that JohnnyFarrar is posting in a way designed to appear more analytical than it is (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8020176#p8020176\">659</a>). He acknowledges that some of the activity concerns are stylistic (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021508#p8021508\">716</a>) but appears to have determined that this game's activity is less constructive than others' (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8024408#p8024408\">769</a>). I recall agreeing with him during the wagon on karnos. This is a Town read.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Overall</span> I'm content to wait a bit longer to try to sort JohnnyFarrar. If no useful action emerges for me to analyze, then I'll concede that I have no specific reason to oppose the lynch. I'm reading most of the players voting for JohnnyFarrar as Town (of them, I'd lynch Wingback first).<br><br>That's it for tonight. The MathBlade wagon is next."}

I really don't like that this doesn't extend to reading JohnnyFarrar as Mafia--I think that someone basing such associative reads on the presumption that karnos is Mafia should be fairly suspicious of JohnnyFarrar for stating suspicion of karnos without casting a vote. From the perspective of wagon dynamics, I also don't like the suggestion that JohnnyFarrar is Town, three suspicious players (me, Masquerade, and karnos) are not voting for JohnnyFarrar, and two are voting for MathBlade. That seems a bit strange (\u00bfwhy are the Mafia players trying so hard to lynch MathBlade over JohnnyFarrar if both are Town?). There's enough here that I need to ask whether there's a good reason for MathBlade, as Mafia, to keep such focus on karnos and avoid the wagon on JohnnyFarrar.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Masquerade</span> I had read earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8027081#p8027081\">798</a>, Null at that time).

On the other hand, I feel that there are points to be made against MathBlade (certainly including some that Masquerade makes).

I don't read it as a crumb myself anyways.<br>Magna seems pretty convinced that Johnny is scum. Hates Math with a passion.<br><br>Anyways, I personally don't believe that Johnny is scum or even really all that scummy tbh. Most of what he's done has played to his meta in other games, only with less content. I read him as lazy/anti-town. Not scummy, but anti-town nonetheless. His laziness and just general lack of contribution annoys me to no end(look at my vote on Kappy &gt;.&gt;) and honestly, at this point, as much as I hate it, I'd be fine with a policy lynch. I just don't see Johnny helping town in any real form down the line. On top of that, I just don't see any real case for a lynch on anyone else(at the moment) and find it hard to see another wagon forming on someone else even if a case was made on them.

Also read a few towngames where he was playing from the start and he's always active and questions people. Scumgames are more interesting. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=61160&amp;f=100&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=18774&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Twin Trap</a> was a game he was in from the start and spent quite some time in catch up mode although never completely checks out like he did here. In the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=66246\" class=\"postlink\">Third Fortnight</a> which was a special 14 day game, he was there from the start but sometimes falls behind but makes an effort to get current and drive wagons on town away from his partner. Many at endgame commended him for his scumplay.<br><br>My impression of his play is that he's more naturally engaged as town but when he's scum, he doesn't just sit by and get lynched. He's definitely the kind that would put effort into digging himself out of holes that he might be in and coming through for his team. This game is completely atypical for him so that lends credence to the fact that he was genuinely busy whatever his alignment. I still find his confidence in the Karnos push in his catchup wall to be scummy. See below for some of the reasons I don't like the content that he did put it since his catchup wall. But he's not my strongest scumread. That honor goes to Dierfire and if we can get a wagon there, I'll switch over.

Do you have any actual scum reads?<br></div></blockquote> <br><br>To answer your activity question: yes, I was active in the game early on mainly because I felt like putting my reads out there and then the whole thing with Persivul and eventually Mecha. After that, I started feeling mixed on the whole Karnos wagon and put some of that in my posts and whatnot. After that, my activity dropped. This is mainly due to not having to really respond to any questions(such as yours) and having some trouble following the whole fight between Math/Magna/Masq. This will explain my lack of scum reads(more on that in a moment). I felt like posting something similar to what Mecha did in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8033268#p8033268\">849</a>, basically trying to tell people to focus on who to actually lynch rather than just having a crazy wall-filled back and forth due to the deadline, but then Mecha pretty much did it. It doesn't seem like it's had much effect anyways.<br><br>As for Johnny, yes I don't like the lynch on him and do think it is policy. I am unhappy with it, but at the same time, I guess I did play a part in that by choosing not to influence the game in a different direction while Johnny was being voted upon. And now I feel like most people aren't going to unvote Johnny at this point. However, the reason why I haven't tried to influence the game recently is because my biggest scum read up to now has been Kappy. If you look at my ISO, my scum reads progressed something like this: Sick -&gt; Persivul -&gt; Kappy. Karnos is not someone I'd put in that list because I stayed neutral on him after reading him as scummy. Anyways, so as Kappy was my biggest scum read, I didn't really see the point of trying to influence people to vote for him as that's a long shot and also because he's V/LA, which, while I hate it, real life does come in the way. I'd much rather Kappy come back and defend himself if a wagon ever did form on him(going back to my hammer/defense point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990676#p7990676\">256</a>) rather than just try to get people to finish him off while he was gone. This is in stark contrast to Johnny who seems to not really care about whether he's about to be lynched or not. Yes, he does ask if anyone has questions of him, but that seems forced. Similar to Kappy in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7997036#p7997036\">389</a>. I'd much rather see him contribute by putting out actual scum reads instead of making the excuse that he's only good at town reads. I just don't see Johnny coming in and trying to legitimately defend himself against the lynch whereas Kappy has shown(imo) that he is atleast capable of that. That's why I don't really care if someone hammers right now. I wouldn't say the same if it were Kappy. <br><br>As for my scum reads right now, I don't have any real strong ones. This is mainly due to not having a perfect grasp on the last couple of pages as explained above. Although, I do feel like most of the last couple of pages haven't really done much to move the game along. While it could be good stuff to look back on for reference in D2, D3, etc., as it stands right now, I feel like they were mostly a waste of time.<br><br>If I had to point out something I felt was suspicious, it would definitely be the Johnny wagon. That whole thing just seems so wrong. Too fast with too little reasoning, especially after the Karnos wagon disbanded. I understand why some town might vote him, due to frustration over the deadline and his lack of defense, but it also seems so easy for the mafia to just jump onto and run away with. Which reminds me of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7996465#p7996465\">380</a> by qubixes who said that scum might get caught lazily hopping onto a wagon. That seems ironic as qubixes unvoted Karnos and then lazily hopped onto the Johnny wagon with the shitty excuse that \"I reread the post again...it actually doesn't look so good after all.\" This is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023774#p8023774\">754</a>. Hilariously enough, he says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023649#p8023649\">747</a> that he doesn't feel strong on anyone besides Karnos. His unvote on Karnos didn't seem all too suspect, but his vote on Johnny seems so fucking sheep. Lazy. One could almost say....scummy. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\":cool:\" title=\"Cool\"> <br><br>So there you have it, no strong scum reads, but qubixes' vote on Johnny seemed scummy. Using his own logic too. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\">"}

I didn't even say you were some confscum or something. If you're really going to vote me due to me finding a single thing of you scummy and pushing on it <span class=\"noboldsig\">slightly</span>, that just shows how your overreacting. Too funny. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> <br><br>Also, nice vote of me and then unvote. Oh, so dramatic. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_surprised2.gif\" alt=\":o\" title=\"Surprised\"> The theatrics of it all. I love it. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> <br><br>And as to your point about not caring if someone hammers: good job showing you don't care to read. But no matter, I'll explain in another way, if I really have to. I don't like the Johnny wagon because I felt it was too fast and convenient. I make this point in my previous post. Your vote on him is scummy because your reason for voting him is absolute garbage. Other people on the Johnny wagon had fine reasons, not the best, but well enough to understand why they might do it. Your vote comes after you conveniently hop off the Karnos wagon when it disbanded, keeping in mind you were its champion. I'm calling total bullshit on you not feeling \"strong\" on Karnos as you were pretty much 100% sure he was scum no matter what, even after the claim, arguing for a scum neapolitan. Anyone reading your ISO from the Karnos vote to the Karnos unvote can easily see how you have extremely strong feelings for a scum!Karnos. Don't try to play the \"gut\" card here. It's too obvious.<br><br>And no, applying that logic to myself doesn't make me scum. My vote on Johnny is not me \"lazily\" hopping on as I point out that I think he's town even when I vote him. That's a policy lynch. No two ways about it. Scum don't vote someone right after they profess they think that person is town and just hope no one notices or something. Reason for a vote is important. And seeing as Johnny has been hammered by Masquerade who points out that he doesn't want to have to look for a lynch in the last hour of the game, I think it's safe to say that my point about frustration over the twice extended deadline has its merit. Persivul is another good example of frustration in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8034524#p8034524\">866</a>."}

The length of D2 can't be the reason you switch your vote to me given that you say you won't vote me on D1 because it'd be hard to push a lynch on me seeing as I was being town read.

But good try. +2 for effort.<br><br>Also, even if having 2 days left(plenty of time by the way, you even admit to that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8036337#p8036337\">900</a>) <span class=\"noboldsig\">was</span> a reason not to push a lynch for someone, then why even bother voting Dierfire in the first place?

Dierfire seemed like the next best possibility for scum, and Wingback (who I had a town read on) made a case on Dierfire which I thought was pretty good.

I don't know why you would suggest that. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">You can't have it both ways. If you thought that 2 days wasn't enough to push a lynch on me, then why even try to push a lynch on anyone at that point? Why not stay with your Johnny vote? The excuse that you \"gut\" read Johnny as town and that is why you unvoted is beyond weak. The unvote timing was way too coincidental seeing as we were nearing his lynch and I had pointed out how you looked suspect for even voting him. By the way, Wingback's case on Dierfire wasn't the fucking nail in his coffin. It was a good case, yes, but it didn't mean that he was all of sudden going to be the perfect lynch candidate in 2 days time. It wasn't like the majority of the town was scum reading him like crazy before or even after that case. Plus, even if some people did scum read him, you'd have to assume that people would be readily willing to jump off the Johnny wagon at the last second to lynch Dierfire. Looking back on it, that obviously wasn't going to happen. You could even argue that 2 days was more than enough time to see Dierfire slip up and then you could convince town to push a lynch on him. But if that were the case, the same would apply to me. I wasn't some angel to the town. Some people did have their doubts about me near the end of D1. The end of Wingback's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035461#p8035461\">894</a> is proof of that. The amount of effort needed to push a lynch on me vs. Dierfire wasn't really all that different seeing as both of us were at a whopping 0 votes when Wingback made the case on Dierfire. What was stopping you from making a similar case on me? Even if you weren't going to vote me, making the case going into D2 wouldn't have hurt.

So I answered it briefly, but correctly, no.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Then in this case, couldn't I just argue that your jump off the Johnny wagon was too \"delayed\" to be town?

My first thoughts wouldn't be Neopolitian cause I have seen town get lynched with that claim and I don't think its even a good role. I can't say what Kranos would do though cause I don't know how he operates as far as play style. His posts seem simplistic in style and in tone. Maybe its a facade but he doesn't seem like some master planner, unless his hypothetical teammates are, even so its some weird lies.<br><br>Meh, I don't think mathblade is on the target with it.

But I also don't see him as a bad player. Only experience I have with him is a multiball where we were on opposing scumteams. My buddy was lynched D1, I killed Karnos' buddy N1, town lynched me D2, and then I think they lynched Karnos D4. So I wouldn't call him a bad player, but I don't think he'll be making very complex plans.</div></blockquote><br><br>Don't take Karnos to be a master planner. Okay that is a read. However this point is fundamentally flawed as Karnos wouldn't have to be. Scum have daychat as was pointed out in the thread. So this point is a non point. Unless you are arguing that scum are ignoring daychat.</div></blockquote><br>No he would not. Do you think before every post Karnos makes he's going to have a chat with his buddies first?</div></blockquote><br>No he would not need to be a master planner."}

Some posts would lean one way and some posts the other. After looking back at the entire back and forth between us starting from the end of D1 up until now, I'm going to stick with my misguided townie read of him. He just seems to be trying too hard to prove his \"worth\" to the town. Nothing wrong with that. Most novice players who are town tend to play this way to feel like they've done a lot for the town. Unfortunately, as in qubixes' case, it can work against them.<br><br>Take his \"delayed\" argument against me for example. He pretty much is arguing that because I was \"delayed\" onto most of the wagons(which is the wrong word to use, by the way), that it seems to be a pattern of me jumping onto wagons late which is scummy. This makes no sense as the only \"wagons\" I was \"jumping\" onto were the Sick and Persivul ones at the very very start of the game. I've already pointed out that both were for reaction testing. He would have to prove that I wasn't reaction testing to point how that my votes on them were scummy. Reaction testing in the start of the game seemed to be the only thing that made sense to me, as it helped me develop reads of those two specific individuals who were being suspected the most. I came out of all of that with the conclusions that Sick felt like frustrated town to me, and that Persivul was null for me. <br><br>There are three major things wrong with the \"delayed\" argument. For one thing, when I voted Sick and Persivul, they weren't really wagons at the time. They were in no real danger of being lynched when I voted them. It'd be silly of scum to jump onto a wagon that didn't have much support behind it. Secondly, when I did vote them, I gave very <span class=\"noboldsig\">clear-cut </span>reasons as to why I was voting them. I presented my reads of the entire roster and gave reasons for them. Keep in mind, these were ALONGSIDE my votes. Notice how my votes were on the people I was scum-reading(reaction testing). And lastly, and my <span class=\"noboldsig\">biggest issue</span>(seriously don't ignore this), with him saying that I was just \"delay\" hopping onto wagons, is that <span class=\"noboldsig\">I NEVER VOTED KARNOS</span>. Keep that in mind. Because, if you look at it, out of the <span class=\"noboldsig\">entire thread</span> so far, the Karnos wagon was one of the <span class=\"noboldsig\">biggest ones</span>. The perfect one for scum to jump on without being noticed. The one that had pretty much all the support in the world save for Mathblade. Even Wingback eventually started suspecting him after vehemently defending him. What in the world makes qubixes think that as scum who apparently <span class=\"noboldsig\">loves</span> to delay wagon hop, I would not ever vote Karnos. Talk about the fucking jackpot when it comes to something like that. His wagon would have been the <span class=\"noboldsig\">perfect</span> one for me to join if I was doing what qubixes claims I was. Instead, I gave clear-cut reasoning as to why I stayed neutral on him. Keep in mind that qubixes literally admits to conf-biasing by saying he only town-read me for initially supporting his Karnos vote, but then scum reads me for everything before and after, when I was pretty much opposite of him on most things. 'Tis a sad mafia world we live in. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> <br><br>I was trying to show him how his arguments against me can be easily applied to what he's been doing too, but he didn't seem to get that. Actually, most of his arguments are generic as fuck. I could easily apply them to just about anyone in most mafia games. It's not uncommon for town to delay their vote on someone who's being pushed hard by everybody else. I'm not a fucking sheep. I look at all the arguments being presented and come up with my own conclusion, as I've said before. I have to take into account that a wagon could be started by scum. Among a host of other things. And as for the sitting back thing, like...<span class=\"noboldsig\">come on</span>. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">  That is such a nit-pick it's not even funny. It doesn't even matter because he admits to sitting back for the same reason I did as-well. So by his own logic, I'm town. So I see no reason I have to argue that any further.<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by apathetic town. He seems to be pretty engaged to me, regardless of the content of those engagements being god awful.<br><br>I'm not going to unvote him only because I'm curious to see what he will say to all this."}

When did you feel he was putting you under the most pressure?<br>Having an \"inside look\" at that sort of thing would be really important to me evaluating his conflict with you, specifically figuring out if it was the primary read he had that he latched onto or something he was pushing in order to avoid not pushing anything. That's the primary thing that would separate \"probably apathetic town\" from \"maybe apathetic scum.\"</div></blockquote><br><br>Ah, ok, now I understand what you mean. Well basically his recent read of me stems from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7996465#p7996465\">380</a> where he's friendly to me and gives me a little wink about how scum could be caught lazily hopping onto the Karnos wagon. This is important, because at this point, he town reads me for agreeing with his case on Karnos. Also because this reasoning of scum lazily hopping onto wagons is exactly what he accuses me of, but I accuse him of too. My accusation of him is more to show how his own argument is crap and can be easily used against anyone who \"lazily\" hops onto a wagon. Anyways, so he town reads me for agreeing that Karnos looks scummy(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8037139#p8037139\">924</a>) but then, he starts to question me by asking Magna why Magna was town reading me, as my voting pattern looked suspicious. Personally, I think he got annoyed at the fact that I was really the only person(besides Wingback, who eventually ends us suspecting Karnos anyways) that didn't push Karnos hard and I stayed neutral on him(which I provided my reasons for in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8014340#p8014340\">587</a>). His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023526#p8023526\">743</a> suggests this because he seems to suspect me of not voting Karnos(the biggest fucking wagon in the game) when I called Karnos suspicious. This obviously ignores my neutral read of him that I pointed out before his 743. That suggests to me that he pretty much hated anyone that didn't support his Karnos vote. It irked him to no end. He even admits to that. Regardless of whether he found them suspicious, people who didn't vote Karnos, he wasn't fond of. His town read of Wingback suggests that he's not equally applying his reading method to all players though. Hence, the conf-bias. He town reads Wingback, despite the defense of Karnos, but scum reads me, given that I said I was neutral on Karnos, but never really defend him. <br><br>This is where the conf-bias starts to take a life of it's own. Look at the end of my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035756#p8035756\">895</a> where I call out qubixes' vote on Johnny as scummy. Keep in mind, I was calling the <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote</span> scummy, not the person. Because even up to that point, I had a weak town read of him, so it wasn't a <span class=\"noboldsig\">big deal</span>. The person performing the action is just as important as the action itself. But he made my scummy read of his vote a <span class=\"noboldsig\">huge deal</span> in his reply to me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8036328#p8036328\">898</a>. At this point, is when I think his read of me changed to pretty much solid scum. However, keep in mind, that he still votes Dierfire because he feels that I'm some unlynchable angel(which wasn't true). So I found it <span class=\"noboldsig\">REALLY</span> strange how he chose to vote me outright in D2, given that he felt Dierfire was just simply a better vote overall, regardless of the deadline. That suggests to me that over N1, he let his conf-bias of me being a \"jerk\" to him get the best of his read. I personally feel that he doesn't really think I'm some 100% scum, but he can't help but say that because he's angry. He uses the excuse that being a \"jerk\" is apparently a valid scum strategy, but he ends up contradicting himself here. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Think about it.</span> He points to me being some stealthy scum who loves to subtly hop wagons(which has been disproved anyways) but also I'm a scum who loves to use asshole tactics to his advantage. Don't you think that by being an asshole, I would get called out for it(notice how no one has) and I would be drawing a butt load of attention to myself? So how am I sneaky scum who subtly hops wagons and sits back, but then I'm also some crazy scum who loves to be an asshole to people? Being an asshole will get you nowhere. Regardless of your alignment. His scum profile of me contradicts itself.<br><br>As for pressure, I haven't felt any real pressure from him. Like I said, he has terrible arguments. I don't worry myself over someone who can't come up with coherent and non-contradictory arguments. I like to point it out to help them, but after that, the rest is up to them. He seems to be most invested in his \"sitting back\" and \"delayed\" arguments. Those are like his babies. He holds onto them, hard. But I've already shown why those arguments are contradictory to his scum profile of me and just plain bad in general.<br><br>I had a much longer post than this, but I decided to cut it down to really the main points of his read on me. Hopefully this answers your questions."}

I'm not really inclined to accept the wave of the hand offered in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8051624#p8051624\">1086</a>; acknowledging the changing read does not explain it. What was qubixes doing in those posts that was swinging the read so wildly?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The general reason for my read changing heavily on Qubixes was because of his vote on me right at the start of D2, which set off my scum read of him. I found it extremely odd that he would he vote me at the start given that he said he found you to be a much more viable lynch at the end of D1. The deadline can't be his excuse because he admits that it's not just the deadline that is keeping him from voting me, but also because he feels he can't lynch me regardless because I'm so town read. So what was it about N1 that all of sudden made me so lynch-able? Nothing that I see suggests that all of sudden I've become the scummiest candidate for the majority of people. Why do you think I suggest that he was just randomly voting me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8045930#p8045930\">936</a>, when it seemed clear that by his own thought process, he should have been voting you at that time. Everything from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8045930#p8045930\">936</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8050847#p8050847\">1042</a> is me scum reading him. Although, even through all that, my gut said misguided townie but my brain said scum. After looking back on it all starting from the end of D1, I decided to go with my gut since it's just subconscious logic. I feel that someone like qubixes, if he were scum, wouldn't really play the way he has towards me. I feel like his reaction to me calling his Johnny vote scummy was genuine town frustration. Maybe he felt like he was being singled out of the wagon and found that unfair. That's what I'm starting to think. Me calling him \"obvious mafia\" was aggression, similar to what I did with Persivul in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7991225#p7991225\">283</a>.</span><br><br>In general I don't find that Saru appears to be attempting to discern alignments. I see few questions or directed interactions with other players that would indicate a proactive attempt to solve the game; rather, Saru seems to be reactive in all reads. This is potentially an explanation for some of those things that didn't display obvious nefarious motivation; these moves would support a reactive, coasting style.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I think early on I was trying to discern alignments. It is true that more in the middle and end of D1, I played more reactive. But I think my explanation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035756#p8035756\">895</a> explains as to why. It sounds like what you're really trying to ask me is who my scum reads are at the moment, which I'll provide in a later post after I look over some ISOs of certain players. The back and forth between qubixes and I kept me distracted.</span><br><br>I partially reviewed qubixes and Persivul in order to solidify my read here. I am reassured in some things that I found and am moving them to lower priority for reading.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Are your reads on them the same as they were in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8029096#p8029096\">804</a>, or was that just in relation to the Johnny wagon?

I have reread Wingback's ISO more times than I can count trying to find where and why Masquerade votes Magna here. The biggest thing they left was Dierfire was scum. Yes, they provided cases but why would Masquerade say just check Wingback's ISO. Something seems fishy that they are lazy when they vote me but then never give an argument. They did the same thing with Magna. Yet they give reasons on Quibixes? <br><br>Something seems horribly off there. Why are they only making efforts on explaining reads about certain players?<br><br>For Quibixes it would be 175 -- It feels fake. Especially the words \"now that I think about it\". It invalidates everything they said in the prior part of the post as they were not thinking about it. The juxtaposition/word choice feels like some strategic move here. If Karnos is town (which is a really difficult pill to swallow) then I would go over their entire ISO again looking for things that give that same strategic vibe.<br><br>At the same time I don't see them as scum together. Masquerade v Quibixes (for the short time it was) felt wrong and I never understood why Masquerade moved their vote.

Maybe Firebringer's slot in the mix. I really don't like how Firebringer is coasting here. Their recent post is they could vote Magna for voting their town read.

This raises my suspicion, because I think that it suggests emulation of a thought process not organic to Saru. I looked for previous games and found nothing useful, sadly (I wandered through the ScoreHero forum from his Wiki page and found nothing, I found <a href=\"http://z10.invisionfree.com/ScoreHeroMafia/index.php?showtopic=88\" class=\"postlink\">a game</a> by Saru786 on MafiaHero in which said player died without posting, and then I gave up because I felt that the time delay would make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I would not try to look at ScoreHero or MafiaHero to understand my thought process as it stands today.

My more important observation is that your tiered lists of reads have vanished. Why is that?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>At the time of the extended argument with Persivul over \"contradictions\" (between <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990676#p7990676\">256</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7994679#p7994679\">337</a> or so) I was reading Saru as Town for nebulous reasons. On further review I attribute this to tone; Saru maintained a focus on certain things (whether Persivul answers his questions, mostly) that I interpreted as aggressive and therefore more likely to come from a Town player. I no longer endorse that position; Persivul was one of the leading wagons at the time, so I could easily see the narrow focus (at times divorced from identifying motivations behind actions) as representing a desire to maintain position on a wagon. However, Saru leaves the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7994679#p7994679\">337</a> to join the wagon on Kappy, which reached L-2 with that vote. This was not a vote from nowhere (Saru expressed suspicion of Kappy in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990569#p7990569\">237</a>), and was not closely preceded by any other changes in votes, so I don't attribute that move to any nefarious motivation.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes, Persivul had some votes on him at the time, and I felt I could push him on something to see how he would react. I'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"maintain position\" on a wagon.

He later (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8023765#p8023765\">753</a>) states that he removed his vote after MechaGoomba cleared up a misunderstanding (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7991866#p7991866\">300</a>) but does not indicate why is reading Persivul as Town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Good content doesn't always equal town.

You said that Persivul had \"good stuff throughout the thread\" and I find it hard to believe that you meant anything more nuanced than \"content likely to come from Town\" there.

There's a possible exception if the wagon was entirely composed of Town players, in which case the Mafia may have collectively decided that votes would eventually be needed there.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Just curious, do you think that the Johnny wagon was all town up until my policy vote on him?

What was qubixes doing in those posts that was swinging the read so wildly?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The general reason for my read changing heavily on Qubixes was because of his vote on me right at the start of D2, which set off my scum read of him. I found it extremely odd that he would he vote me at the start given that he said he found you to be a much more viable lynch at the end of D1. The deadline can't be his excuse because he admits that it's not just the deadline that is keeping him from voting me, but also because he feels he can't lynch me regardless because I'm so town read. So what was it about N1 that all of sudden made me so lynch-able? Nothing that I see suggests that all of sudden I've become the scummiest candidate for the majority of people. Why do you think I suggest that he was just randomly voting me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8045930#p8045930\">936</a>, when it seemed clear that by his own thought process, he should have been voting you at that time.

Although, even through all that, my gut said misguided townie but my brain said scum. After looking back on it all starting from the end of D1, I decided to go with my gut since it's just subconscious logic. I feel that someone like qubixes, if he were scum, wouldn't really play the way he has towards me. I feel like his reaction to me calling his Johnny vote scummy was genuine town frustration. Maybe he felt like he was being singled out of the wagon and found that unfair. That's what I'm starting to think. Me calling him \"obvious mafia\" was aggression, similar to what I did with Persivul in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7991225#p7991225\">283</a>.</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>As I understand this, you are saying that this is a \"gut read\" based on things like tone/frustration.

My more important observation is that your tiered lists of reads have vanished. Why is that?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">My tiered lists of reads have vanished because you don't know how to read. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> If you don't agree with my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035756#p8035756\">895</a>, then that pretty much means you don't believe in your own reasons for being so inactive. Anyways, I chose not to put out a list of my reads after the whole Karnos thing(where my activity dropped) because replacements started becoming an issue for me. I've said this already. It became hard to follow who was replacing who. The big walls weren't helping either. It doesn't look like I'll be putting out a reads list until the weekend since even more people have replaced out. I've never been in a game like this. Funny enough, you admit to having the same problem. Notably, you haven't put out an actual tiered list of reads the ENTIRE GAME up until NOW. Seems like Wingback's case really lit a fire under your ass. Even more funny is the fact that your entire ISO is absolute reactive and coasting garbage. You don't try to discern alignments at any point. You mostly just agree or disagree with other peoples' statements and you basically only answer questions directed at you and then vanish until another comes up. You've been tunneling Kappy so hard the entire game, it's not even funny. Part of your coasting agenda, it seems. Qubixes has pointed this out. Can you please point me to more than one post where you were PRO-ACTIVELY trying to discern alignments? I can't find it anywhere in your ISO. I find it suspicious but not surprising that you've picked up your activity level in D2, mainly after the Wingback case. Not looking so hot. Even some replacements have, at this point, put out more content than you. For shame.</span><br><br>I mean that I could see your actions from a Mafia player who decided to be on the Persivul wagon and then went looking for reasons to stay there.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Except this makes no sense unless you can somehow prove that I wasn't actually reaction testing either Sick or Persivul. If I decided to be on the Persivul wagon AND THEN looked for reasons to stay on there, why would I list my reasons for voting him when I actually do vote him? I didn't \"look\" for reasons, I already had reasons.</span><br><br>I don't find this explanation consistent with your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8002001#p8002001\">468</a>. You said that Persivul had \"good stuff throughout the thread\" and I find it hard to believe that you meant anything more nuanced than \"content likely to come from Town\" there. JohnnyFarrar asked for a Town leader, and you gave him the name of a Null read without further embellishment?<br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">Are you really trying to tell me that scum can't become the town leader? Or just about anyone, regardless of alignment? I don't even think town leader is something that the town should have unless they're a conftown who is experienced at scum-hunting. Even then, leaders make mistakes. It was merely a suggestion, in other words, I didn't take it too seriously, and I didn't expect anyone else to either. Me saying that Persivul has \"good stuff throughout the thread\" isn't me saying that he is town. Once again, good content doesn't always mean town. Don't know how to make that clearer. If you don't agree with that, well then too bad, I'm not going to try convince you otherwise.</span><br><br>Aye, I'm still having the \"too many players as Town\" problem. I'm considering that the wagon may have been all Town, but I'll keep thinking about it as I reevaluate.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"Too many players as town.\" In other words, you're having a hard time with scum-hunting. Which means that you're not being pro-active. O SHIT! LOOK! SCUM! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"></span><br><br>As I understand this, you are saying that this is a \"gut read\" based on things like tone/frustration. What I don't understand is why your \"brain read\" was Mafia. Why would a Mafia player be especially likely to vote you rather than me at that point (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8045834#p8045834\">935</a>), having stated suspicion of both of us?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">That's why I said I think my brain read is wrong. He seems to be doing too many contradictory things. He seems like a player who would play solid scum, imo. To see all the mistakes, I'm getting the feeling he's just not thinking about what he truly wants as a frustrated townie. His attitude towards me ever since I've called him out on the Johnny vote only makes me feel this further.</span><br><br>I think that your explanation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035756#p8035756\">895</a> answers a question of activity level, but my question is one of proactivity--that is, whether you are attempting to discern alignments. You should be doing more than answering questions directed at you.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hypocrisy 101. I guess since I've not been pro-active, and you think I'm scum for that, then that means you're scum too? Through your own logic? Go read what I wrote in my first response, above.</span><br></div></blockquote><br><br>Responses in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold.</span> I have a good feeling that Dierfire might be scum. Trying to grill me on being inactive while picking up his own inactivity by doing so is terrible. I'm going to hold off voting until I see something from qubixes in regards to my responses to Mecha about him. Also because I need to time to look back at ISOs. All these replacements are starting to make me lose track. I'll probably put out an entire reads list similar to what I did in the start of the game, on Saturday."}

I don't think that we're discussing the same thing when we discuss tiered lists. In your first two posts, you created lists of this format:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7986767#p7986767\" class=\"postlink\">post 111</a>, Saru wrote:</cite>{Chumba, Mizzytastic}<br>{Persivul, Snork}<br>{Everyone else}<br>{Kappy, MechaGoomba}<br>{Sickofit1138}</div></blockquote><br><br>Based on the fact that you used this format at the beginning of your first two posts, I assumed that it would be one of the primary ways that you organize your thoughts. Since then it has not reappeared. I am suspicious of this because it makes it seem that your method of organizing your thoughts is not consistent and perhaps that these lists were fabricated.<br>Obviously I do not agree that a lack of tiered lists in general is suspicious (else I'd be pursuing players who never posted even one). Your attempt to note that I haven't put out a list of tiered reads in response looks like \"counterpunch\" here and increases my suspicion.<br>I disagree that I've only been agreeing or disagreeing with other thoughts. As examples of things that I've done proactively (by which I mean things that I do to help me read other players--also note that I make a distinction between activity, which is reflected in things like post counts, and proactivity, which is reflected in the content of those posts), I offer: my questions to Kappy in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7995159#p7995159\">355</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7997720#p7997720\">394</a>, trying to understand the read on Mizzytastic that Wingback gave (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8005418#p8005418\">494</a>), looking into old games of karnos to see whether his phrasing in his own \"counterpunch\" was stylistic (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013189#p8013189\">558</a>), working to lock karnos into a claim (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8018950#p8018950\">642</a>), prompting JohnnyFarrar for content to read him better (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021469#p8021469\">712</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021528#p8021528\">720</a>), probing for reasons why MathBlade didn't use associations with karnos to read JohnnyFarrar (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035394#p8035394\">892</a>), and discussing your read on qubixes (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8053457#p8053457\">1101</a>).<br>You said that you read my ISO and didn't find anything proactive; did you read these and dismiss them?<br><br>2. I'm not interested in arguing about definitions of \"Town leader\" but I do want to compare your stated definition to your actions. JohnnyFarrar asked who was \"Town leader\" and you gave him the name of a Null read (Persivul) without further elaboration. If you feel that \"Town leader\" can be of either alignment, why did you not mention a read on Persivul to JohnnyFarrar? Would it not have been important to say whether the \"Town leader\" was a Town player or a Mafia player if you're using a definition that makes both equally likely?<br><br>3. You're saying that your \"brain read\" on qubixes was wrong. I want to know what reasoning you had at the time, for which is not sufficient to tell me why you're reading him as Town now."}

And looking back at his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8054785#p8054785\">1136</a> it's atrocious. He is simultaneously giving a reason for his votes not matching his reads (having me as townread because Math is a scumread but then voting me oh I'll just quote it<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8054785#p8054785\" class=\"postlink\">post 1136</a>, karnos wrote:</cite>You aren't wrong about one thing, I did think Masq was likely town based on Mathblade being scum, and I do still think MathBlade is scum. But I try to be realistic, my scum reads aren't actually going to flip scum 100% of the time, and my scum reads aren't going anywhere without support from other town.

If Karnos is town then you and Titus gotta be scum together for reopening the Karnos question when everyone else in the thread shut it down. Yet if you are town and I already have a townread on Titus so it is more likely that I am right. Gah. I wish I knew if you were town and I somehow convinced you or scum and fucking with me.<br><br>Excuse me while I go over into a corner, scream Karnos is scum, have the wall do nothing in response then come back here.

I'd be ecstatic if I could predict scum with 60% accuracy. Given the design of most mafia games, 60% accuracy for town would be a guaranteed win for them. Even 50% read accuracy is enough to win the majority of times. Now, if you look at the overall statistics of the games here on mafiascum, I think you will find town doesn't win the overwhelming majority of the time. The sad reality is that most town players predict scum with 30-40% accuracy <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at best</span>, resulting in some town wins mixed with some scum wins.<br><br>I always keep that in mind when reading players, which is why I am not going to give you a free town read just because I have a scum read on someone opposing you in the thread. As sure as I am about MathBlade, I know that my overall success at predicting scum is probably worse than 50%, so there is still a fair chance I am wrong. And if I am wrong about that, you can certainly be scum.<br><br>&gt;Why would anyone lie about something that's so easy to check?<br><br>That is the thing. I did check, and if I ignored the discrepancy once I noticed it I would be essentially repeating your lie. I have a responsibility to the rest of the town players to point out a contradictory statement such as the one you made. Judgement, as to whether or not it means anything, I can't say. I thought it might mean something. My sole vote sitting on you wasn't going to get you lynched and nobody else seemed to care, so perhaps I was wrong.<br><br>But now you brought the issue back up, it's almost like you wanted me to tacitly \"lie\" by accepting your false statement without calling you out on it. Why would <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I </span>lie about it, given that I knew the results of the game? Why would I withhold that information to the rest of the players?

Since then it has not reappeared. I am suspicious of this because it makes it seem that your method of organizing your thoughts is not consistent and perhaps that these lists were fabricated.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I understand what you're trying to say here, but the assumption is wrong. I didn't use it as a way to organize my thoughts, but, more to show people why I felt the way I did about certain reads. I felt it would be a good way to see what people thought about my reads, but much to my chagrin, no one really commented on it. My lack of tiered lists after that is explained by this. Because after that, I saw my attention going to specific people rather than a general view of things. I'm pretty sure the point of a reads list is to be as general as possible to help you discern alignment by peoples' reactions to it. But, of course, some might use it to organize their thoughts, but that wasn't my specific purpose with those reads list early in the game. Seeing as I had felt that Persivul was scum from my reaction test, I pursued him. However, after my argument with him, I felt null. Therefore, I moved onto my next scum read, who was Kappy. And then so on and so forth. Basically, the reads list really served as a starting point for me to focus on certain people as the game moved along. Seeing as my reads hadn't changed too drastically by the time Wingback questioned me about activity, I saw no point in a reads list. However, as it stands, I'm going to put out a similar tiered reads list somewhere around Saturday because I feel the need to put out my thoughts about what has been happening recently with the Math wagon and so on, since I've been distracted. Also, because, my reads have started to shift pretty hard on certain people.</span><br><br>Obviously I do not agree that a lack of tiered lists in general is suspicious (else I'd be pursuing players who never posted even one). Your attempt to note that I haven't put out a list of tiered reads in response looks like \"counterpunch\" here and increases my suspicion.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes, you not putting out a list of tiered reads UNTIL I ask you to looks suspicious. Putting out a reads list doesn't seem to be the way you play naturally. It's not organic to you or your thought process. Therefore, the fact that you hastily put one out at the moment I ask you to seems contradictory to your own play-style and thought process. Why put one out NOW instead of just saying that you don't really see the need for a reads list? However, if you did see the need for a reads list, why didn't you put one out in D1? Most of D2 makes me feel that you've been scrambling to not only up your activity but also your pro-activeness. I'll explain why I don't think you were being all that pro-active as you claim to have been in D1 more in-depth in my read of you.</span><br><br>I disagree that I've only been agreeing or disagreeing with other thoughts. As examples of things that I've done proactively (by which I mean things that I do to help me read other players--also note that I make a distinction between activity, which is reflected in things like post counts, and proactivity, which is reflected in the content of those posts), I offer: my questions to Kappy in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7995159#p7995159\">355</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7997720#p7997720\">394</a>, trying to understand the read on Mizzytastic that Wingback gave (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8005418#p8005418\">494</a>), looking into old games of karnos to see whether his phrasing in his own \"counterpunch\" was stylistic (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013189#p8013189\">558</a>), working to lock karnos into a claim (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8018950#p8018950\">642</a>), prompting JohnnyFarrar for content to read him better (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021469#p8021469\">712</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021528#p8021528\">720</a>), probing for reasons why MathBlade didn't use associations with karnos to read JohnnyFarrar (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035394#p8035394\">892</a>), and discussing your read on qubixes (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8053457#p8053457\">1101</a>).<br>You said that you read my ISO and didn't find anything proactive; did you read these and dismiss them?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Most of these things you point out, I've already looked through, and, yes, I dismiss most of them as being not pro-active, for several reasons. This will be explained in my read of you on Saturday, as right now, I don't think this reply to you is a good place to do that, seeing as most people wouldn't really care to read this thoroughly since it's addressed to you specifically. Plus, it would be just making this wall bigger than it already is. And it seems most people aren't fond of walls.</span><br><br>2. I'm not interested in arguing about definitions of \"Town leader\" but I do want to compare your stated definition to your actions. JohnnyFarrar asked who was \"Town leader\" and you gave him the name of a Null read (Persivul) without further elaboration. If you feel that \"Town leader\" can be of either alignment, why did you not mention a read on Persivul to JohnnyFarrar? Would it not have been important to say whether the \"Town leader\" was a Town player or a Mafia player if you're using a definition that makes both equally likely?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'm not sure what you're asking here, to be honest. Yes, a town leader can be either alignment. My read on Persivul at the time was null. Why would I say whether the town leader was town or mafia? Doesn't null imply that they can be both equally likely? Johnny could easily have gone back and checked my read on Persivul himself. I have no reason to tell him that unless he specifically asked, which he didn't. The player I chose as town leader makes sense with the definition. Honestly not sure what you're on about here.</span><br><br>3. You're saying that your \"brain read\" on qubixes was wrong. I want to know what reasoning you had at the time, for which is not sufficient to tell me why you're reading him as Town now.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The reasoning for my brain read itself or of it being wrong? I'll address both I guess. My brain read was because I felt he was over-reacting and being too contradictory. My gut read was telling me that those contradictions were too numerous and obvious to be coming from scum. Also, that it seemed his over-reactions were more from anger/frustration towards me on a personal level rather than a scummy one. Therefore, I felt my brain read was wrong.</span><br></div></blockquote><br><br>Responses in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold.</span>"}

This raises my suspicion, because I think it suggests emulation of a thought process not organic to Dierfire. It makes it seems like his method of organizing his thoughts is not consistent and perhaps that this list was fabricated. Ahem, sound familiar? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br><br>Anyways, one of the big things for me, is the Karnos vote, unvote, vote, then unvote. This is terrible on so many levels. I have a good feeling Karnos might be scum with Dierfire(see my Karnos read) and I think this lines up with that. Keeping in mind that scum have day-talk, I think his whole unvote and re-vote business shouldn't be surprising. It seemed very unlike him compared to the rest of the game so far. His \"partial\" explanation of it all in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8026998#p8026998\">797</a> is also equally terrible. Why are we even allowing \"partial\" explanations of such scummy stuff? Partial suggests that he's hiding something else in regards to the explanation(I would love to know what that is), or that he knows his own explanation isn't good enough to pass as town, but he has no choice but to give one. So \"partial\" excuses its terrible reasoning. Plus, the explanation even points out that he wanted to lock Karnos into a claim. I think he got an easy 2-in-1 by not only locking Karnos into a claim(as planned), but also by potentially getting town-cred for being the one to do it.<br><br>As for the actual voting itself, the first one comes in at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013189#p8013189\">558</a>, where he gives a weak meta-read of Karnos as justification for voting him and it puts Karnos at L-2. This is probably bussing to make him look good/distancing. However, I don't think he was expecting Mathblade to swoop in and put Karnos at L-1 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013498#p8013498\">562</a>. So when he comes back the next day, he chooses to unvote. Knowing that scum have day-talk, this makes sense. The unvote gives time for him and the other partner to explain to Karnos what to claim/how to go about it, since it seems Karnos really isn't all that experienced. Dierfire, on the other hand, seems to have quite the experience under his belt. Anyways, when he finishes telling Karnos what to do, he votes for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8018950#p8018950\">642</a> to obviously get that planned claim out. Once the claim is out, the subsequent unvote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021442#p8021442\">704</a>, as planned. I would also like to note that Dierfire's explanation for his vote on Karnos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8018950#p8018950\">642</a> is very unlike him, from what I've seen so far. That statement \"I'm still not entirely sure what's going on here, but I think that I know enough\" feels like something forced/planned. I don't think town!Dierfire would say something like this. For most of the thread he seemed natural in his explanations for votes or un-votes. But when it came time for the Karnos vote/unvote, he seemed to get very uneasy and out of his element. I doubt town!Dierfire contemplated so hard about Karnos that he forgot how hes been playing for the majority of the game. It was all too sudden.<br><br>As a side note, him asking Mathblade in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021563#p8021563\">724</a> \"What was weird about it?\"(referring to the Karnos vote/unvote thing) is scummy as shit. How would town!Dierfire not see how people wouldn't find that weird? Really? The reasonable and townie thing to have done in response to Mathblade would have been to (fully) explain why he did what he did. Not ask what was specifically weird about it. By asking specifically, he allows himself room to talk about only certain aspects, rather than have to give a full explanation, as that might sound strange.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7990182#p7990182\">228</a> - Look at Persivul read.

Never factored it into his read of Wingback either. Not pro-active because if you're just going to ask a question and never reply to it, where is the \"discerning alignment\" happening? To just give out random questions and then never follow up is pretty damn suspect. It feels that you are giving questions just to show you're being pro-active and active in general, and that the questions don't really mean anything.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8013189#p8013189\">558</a> - He says that he is pro-active for looking back into an old game of Karnos where Karnos was town to see if Karnos' wording in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7996515#p7996515\">382</a> matches up to a post in that game. The first issue is that I see Karnos as scum with Dierfire, and so in this scenario, it just seems like Dierfire trying to find anything on Karnos to vote him to bus/distance. Doesn't want to stick out like a sore thumb with a useless vote on Kappy. Second issue is that Dierfire contradicts himself here. He says that the post he pulled up from the town!Karnos game has \"similar wording\" but then says that it is \"slightly different\" in that very same post. What?<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8018950#p8018950\">642</a> - This vote is addressed above and why I think it's not pro-active is also found above. To summarize: He says he wanted to lock Karnos into a claim. But, of course he'd want to lock Karnos into a claim. It's a claim that he probably gave to Karnos himself(more on this above). He was was hoping and probably knew from experience that such a claim would get votes off Karnos. Karnos was gonna be L-1'd eventually, and to be the one to do it and claim credit for it comes off as LAMIST and something he could put in his back pocket to use as evidence of his fake pro-activeness.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021469#p8021469\">712</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021528#p8021528\">720</a> - Asks the question to Johnny about who he scum reads, and Johnny answered in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021562#p8021562\">723</a>. Doesn't reply to answer. Never makes it into his read of Johnny, or factors the reply into it. Explained above why not pro-active.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8029096#p8029096\">804</a> - His read of Johnny is a whole lot of nothing. Tip toes around Johnny harder than Jerry does around Tom. Seems like since he was pushing the Kappy vote(easy mislynch), he didn't see the need to vote Johnny as it seemed Johnny would be hammered sooner than later at that point. By keeping his vote on Kappy, who was inactive at the time, it would be an easy excuse not to vote Johnny. He didn't want to be on the Johnny wagon for obvious reasons. He even alludes to not opposing the Johnny lynch, but never seals the deal with a vote.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8031200#p8031200\">823</a> - Promising to read me is important here. Since he knows Johnny is going to be hammered soon, he needs to set up his D2 actions accordingly. I was universally town read going into D2, and he probably felt he needed to change this. Presents a case on me, suspects me pretty hard, but doesn't vote. Why you might ask? Simple. He saw the Mathblade wagon piling on and knew that would be the easier mislynch. Also because his case failed pretty badly. I'm not sure anyone looked at it and thought \"oh Saru scum\" as he was hoping. Qubixes might have(although he never commented on it), but that's besides the point. Qubixes was already reading me as scum, and he would have conf-biased hard because of that anyways.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035394#p8035394\">892</a> - This is maybe the closest thing I can think of to being as \"pro-active\" as he claims. But, even then, it is weak. He asks a question to Mathblade and Mathblade answers(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035455#p8035455\">893</a>). He then indirectly replies to Mathblade's answer via his reply to Mecha(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8048029#p8048029\">1006</a>) by dismissing it as \"abstract meta-defense.\" Basically, he never refutes Mathblade's point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035455#p8035455\">893</a>. He simply chooses to dismiss it outright without any real reasoning.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8047938#p8047938\">1003</a> - This is terrible. Surprised this went unnoticed. He tries to fix up a DEAD Wingback's point about him in Wingback's case against him. Like seriously? What's the point in trying to fix a SINGLE point made in a dead person's case against you? That just comes off as paranoid. Why not just address it directly to other players, instead of taking the roundabout way? Actually, better yet, why not just address the whole case instead of just a single point? He already took the effort to address one point, why not the others? I think he's happy no one has really brought it up against him. Firebringer alludes to it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8046162#p8046162\">950</a>, and Dierfire asks Firebringer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8047987#p8047987\">1005</a> if he even read the case by Wingback. Firebringer never responds, but to even ask that question instead of asking WHAT Firebringer felt were good points made by Wingback, seems like he is avoiding addressing the case in general. By not asking what the good points are, Dierfire can avoid having to counter them and just draw attention to them in general. Similar to asking Mathblade what was \"specifically\" weird about his Karnos vote and unvote fiasco(explained above).<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8061021#p8061021\">1218</a> - Looks like some scum thought process slipping out by mistake. \"Although I can't recall any posts that sound like they were written in collaboration.\" It's hard to tell whether he was talking about his own posts here, or other peoples' posts. However, that doesn't really matter, because it's the thought that counts. For him to even say that \"can't recall any post that sound like they were written in collaboration\" suggests that he is genuinely curious as to whether his or his scum partners' posts were sounding too buddy-buddy. He didn't even have to be legitimately worried about ACTUAL collaboration. It is more likely he was worried that he might have been sounding too buddy-ish to one of his partners somewhere along the thread and hoped Math or someone else could point it out so that he could fix it, because it seems obvious that he wasn't willing to refute it.<br><br>All that being said, I'm pretty damn positive <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Dierfire is scum.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Firebringer</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Firebringer(replaces Chumba and The Bulge) - My read on this slot is mainly based on Firebringer's actions seeing as Chumba replaced out early on in the game and The Bulge was never really active. Early on, I did read Chumba as town because her questions seemed to be genuine scum-hunting,  albeit with a little too much aggression(although she addresses this as play-style in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985877#p7985877\">93</a>), as her small spat with me starting at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7989450#p7989450\">216</a> indicates. However, I thought this because I felt her counters to Mecha were pretty good and that Mecha's questions towards her seemed like busy-work, but looking back at Mecha's questions towards her early on, I can see where the claim of a reaction test makes sense(see my Mecha read for more). As for The Bulge, he didn't have much in the way of posts. He looks at Persivul vs. Me as TvT, then the rest of his posts don't really make much sense to me. So not really going to factor him into the read. As for Firebringer himself, the only noteworthy things are that he didn't choose to read up on the thread(I want to say NAI because of Johnny, but we'll see) and that he chose to vote Dierfire because that was Wingback's biggest scum read going into D2, where Wing flipped town. I feel that these two things match up in terms of thought process pretty nicely. For him to say he probably won't read the thread, but to quickly look at who the town flip chose as his scum target and then vote that person, seems to line up in terms of consistency. I can see how that might be a starting point. Admittedly, this isn't a good reason to view Firebringer as town or even null-town because that could have easily been a scum coming in, not willing to read the thread, seeing who the most likely target might be, and voting them. Seeing as scum have day-talk, I don't see how they couldn't just provide their own summary of events that occurred, which would save Firebringer the read and allow him a hop onto what seems like it could have been an easy lynch. Overall though, I'm not really leaning towards either one at the moment. I want to see more out of Firebringer, specifically, actual reasons to vote Dierfire and the reads list that he promised in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8057300#p8057300\">1171</a>. <span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Null read.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: MathBlade</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">MathBlade(replaces Snork) - Snork didn't really post anything of interest before replacing out. Not going to factor in anything about him into this slot read. As for MathBlade, I feel that her crazy hard push onto Karnos for the majority of the game is genuine town frustration. Not simulated. I just don't think scum would be this fucking irate over one person for this long. If this was simulated scum frustration, she would have most likely voted off Karnos in D2, which she did, but she would have also just dropped the Karnos thing altogether along with the unvote. This doesn't seem to be the case in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8060969#p8060969\">1210</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8065912#p8065912\">1252</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8065919#p8065919\">1253</a>. It seems like the wagon on her is mainly formulated because people just don't like her pushing on Karnos like mad even after the claim. So if that is the case, and Math is scum, she would have wanted to leave the Karnos thing to get the wagon off of her. But the fact that just keeps alluding to it makes me feel she genuinely wants to grill him and really doesn't care at this point if she gets lynched because of it. I have to admit though, this kind of tunneling, regardless of its motivation, is very anti-town, as it distracts from other scum targets and just scum hunting in general. While she is now looking at other targets based on her Karnos read, the fact that she didn't drop the Karnos thing much earlier annoys me, even if I think Karnos is scum. But at the end of the day, annoying is NAI, and I like that she is now picking up on other players besides Karnos. <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Medium town read.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: MagnaofIllusion</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">MagnaofIllusion(replaces Species) - Species didn't really post anything of interest before he replaced out. Not going to factor anything about him into this slot read. As for Magna, I feel that he is most likely town. He came in, offered to read the whole thread, gave a PROGRESSIVE reads list as he went along, and didn't sway on his push against his scum reads after they were presented. All that to me shows an effort to try to pro-actively solve the game. Also, whenever he asks questions, he follows up to the answer, and pokes and prods hard. Similar to Mecha. The one thing I want to address is this whole fight with Math, which seems to have started when Math said \"fuck your rules\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8024721#p8024721\">773</a>. That seemed to have set off an explosion between the two that has yet to heal. Most of their back and forth after that reads like TvT to me. It's just a bunch of theory being thrown around about the Karnos claim and if he should be lynched as an un-cc'd claim or not and so on and so forth. Then after that, they start picking at each other for misreps and just other petty things. It really bores me to no end. I almost want these two to get over it and hug/kiss it out and then focus on real scum. Overall, the fight looks insignificant to me, and Magna's play has been very solid so far. <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Strong town read.</span></span><br><br>Math and Magna, this is for you guys:<br><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5DmYLrxR0Y8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Qubixes</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Qubixes - Most of what I think about him is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8051624#p8051624\">1086</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8053448#p8053448\">1099</a>, and a nice summary is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8061060#p8061060\">1224</a>. <span style=\"color: #80FF80\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Weak town read.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: MechaGoomba</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">MechaGoomba - Looking back at my read of him as nullscum at the start(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7986767#p7986767\">111</a>), I had an odd feeling that the number of questions he was asking Chumba seemed like busy body questions, similar to what Dierfire has been doing.

On top of that, he chose to actively avoid Dierfire's and my questions to him, saying that his focus wasn't on mafia at the time in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7997839#p7997839\">395</a>. That seemed like an excuse to me at the time, but seeing as how he went V/LA and then just never came back, I guess he really wasn't lying. Anyways, how I felt about him before he replaced out doesn't really affect my Titus read here. As for Titus, she seemed to have stopped reading around page 11 due to walls. Seems to love brevity in her posts. I can't tell if the brevity comes from replacing into a game with 40+ pages and not wanting to read through it all, or if that is just how she plays from the very start of a game, regardless of alignment. Might have to check some old games on this one. She seems to read Mecha as scum because Mecha seems to not outright deny Titus' logic(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8055755#p8055755\">1146</a>) when it comes to scum reading him along with Math(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8070554#p8070554\">1268</a>). But, also to note, Mecha doesn't say either way whether he thinks Persivul could be scum with him and Math or not. I just find it strange that scum would do something like that. If Titus' scum-team is accurate, then Mecha choosing to say he understands why Titus thinks that way, is rather odd. I just don't buy that it could come from scum. Why put himself closer to his scum-buddies rather than distance himself from them? I'm just not sure I understand/follow the logic there. A more scummier thing for Mecha to have done their would have been to outright deny Titus and ask WHY Titus thought that Math and Persivul were scum-buddies with him. That way, he could potentially figure out how to stop looking like he was buddying with them. Overall, I can't really tell at the moment if this Titus logic is misguided townie or scummy.

However, ever since then, he has done little in the way of actual content, just putting out little quips here and there. Votes the Karnos wagon because he felt that Johnny's case on Karnos was good(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8002208#p8002208\">478</a>), and just never really provides his own reasoning. Jumps onto Johnny after the Karnos claim because apparently he felt Johnny made that Karnos case to look townie and then just be able to safely coast after the claim. This, admittedly, isn't terrible reasoning for voting Johnny. I can see where Johnny might look suspicious in that regard. However, I did note one big thing about Persivul in regards to the Karnos claim. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8026162#p8026162\">783</a>, Persivul suggests that Karnos should out \"not VT\" results. This sounds like scum right here trying to use their buddy Karnos to confirm their reads on certain townies as PRs and then they could safely NK them. If Karnos chooses to out a player with a \"not VT\" result(keeping in mind that the result is faked to fish for PRs) because scum suspects them to be a PR and instead they were a VT, then scum could just throw Karnos under the bus and get him lynched for \"slipping up.\" They will have used his power as best they could to determine who was a PR and wasn't, and could move on to pushing a lynch or NK'ing these people who they found to be PRs through PoE. This whole scenario though is probably not what is going to happen, or what is happening, seeing as Karnos claimed to be role-blocked. Instead, I can't see why scum aren't just telling Karnos to keep claiming to be role-blocked and that town will just believe him every time. It seems to have worked in D2. If town got too suspicious of this, and wanted Karnos dead as a result, it seems like scum wouldn't mind bussing and getting rid of him, as he would have served his purpose well for them. Anyways, I think that Persivul would make for a good second partner for Karnos after Dierfire. His replacement is going to have to work hard or do something really radical to make me change my view on this. <span style=\"color: #FF4080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Medium-strong scum read.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Masquerade</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Masquerade(replaces Mizzytastic) - Mizzytastic was a solid town read for me for her pro-active questions in the start and just general will to get out of RVS asap.

I didn't let this read of Mizzy influence my read of Masq when he first replaces her. Admittedly, I didn't even pay much attention to him early on, mainly because his ISO is all over the place and hard to follow. Even now, during my ISO read of him, I have a hard time understanding where he stands on people as it moves along. Lots of votes/reads changing pretty quickly. My head legit hurts. Seeing as I can't really make a determination based on most of it, I guess I'll read him based on the one big thing that stands out, which is his choice to hammer Johnny in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8036403#p8036403\">903</a> without a Johnny claim. I didn't really have a problem with this as I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8034734#p8034734\">874</a> and the second paragraph of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035756#p8035756\">895</a>. I can understand why he did it. I am very slightly town reading him for it because if he was scum, he would have been shooting himself in the foot with that hammer. Not enough people were up for a straight up hammer without a claim at that point. If they were, I can see scum Masq being the one to do it. But they weren't. What he did was way too risky either way. I would like to see a tiered reads list from Masq at this point in the game. I can't tell where he definitively stands at the moment. <span style=\"color: #BFFF80\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Very weak town read.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Karnos</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Karnos - I've felt null on Karnos for a while now. But looking at my Dierfire read, I think Karnos being scum with him isn't a far off thing. I'm not as gung-ho about lynching Karnos as much as MathBlade is at the moment, but I do think that if he throws out another \"No Result\" like he did today, he should be lynched. No results don't help us if he's town and if he's scum(look at my Persivul read for more), he's just getting away with it as MathBlade said he would on D1. Now, looking back at some of his posts, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985176#p7985176\">56</a> is clearly awful. The excuse he gives in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7987204#p7987204\">112</a> is paltry and contradictory. He says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7985176#p7985176\">56</a> that he didn't think \"Kappy [was] in danger of being quick-lynched\" which is fine. But then in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7987204#p7987204\">112</a>, he goes on about how he wouldn't be worried if the quick-lynch led to a Kappy scum flip but not a town one. That is some scummy thinking right there, no two ways about it. If he didn't think a quick-lynch was going to happen, why in the world would he be worried about Kappy flipping town? It shouldn't matter to him since the quick-lynch wasn't going to happen, as he says. Looking back at it, I feel like my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7999938#p7999938\">430</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8000161#p8000161\">438</a> weren't far off, and it feels like Karnos played like an over-defensive and paranoid n00b scum early on in regards to his responses to Mecha. Also, one of the huge things that help me to connect Karnos and Dierfire together is Karnos' <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8022730#p8022730\">731</a>. He says that he is \"curious to see how Dierfire responds\", talking about the vote/unvote thing that Wingback pointed out looked scummy from Dierfire. However, when Dierfire DOES talk about it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8026998#p8026998\">797</a>, Karnos never bats an eye at it. Like seriously? A person just did some huge scummy shit with you by voting you, unvoting, voting, then unvoting in a matter of 2 days and you don't point that out? Karnos had been pointing out petty shit from other players like crazy, but something as scummy as that from Dierfire towards Karnos, and Karnos doesn't give a damn? Why? I'll tell you why, because he's scum with Dierfire and that was all planned(look at my Dierfire read for more). Karnos doesn't want to draw attention to it, for obvious reasons. One last big thing is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8047294#p8047294\">994</a>, where the excuse Karnos gives about choosing Persivul over Masquerade doesn't hold up. He says \"Someone like Masquerade fit into the first qualifier, but I had my fear that he might be killed or jailed at night.\" How in the world would someone think this? Masquerade claimed VT in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8037015#p8037015\">922</a>. Why would anyone kill or jail a VT claim? That makes no sense. At first I thought Persivul was a good target too when Karnos said it, but realized I was conf-biasing because I was already thinking Persivul would be a good target right before N1 started. While I feel Karnos is practically scum, I don't think he should be our lynch for today. One because he is tied to a claim, and if he fucks up(which he probably will without Dierfire's advice), that is pretty much the end for him. So I don't mind waiting. Second because I feel that Dierfire is probably the \"leader\" of the scum team, if you will. Probably gives out the ideas and whatnot. Cut off the head of the beast, and it's dead. Karnos can wait in that regard. <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Strong scum read.</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dierfire</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">He is at L-1.</span>"}

Being null on someone and having a null read of them are two different things, imo. Being null on someone means you have no opinion/read. This usually only happens during the start of a game or when a slot is being replaced. Having a null read means their ACTIONS don't seem townie or scummy to you, but anything too drastic could easily switch your read of them either way. I don't agree with Magna's null read on Dierfire, but that's besides the point. He does have a read on him, regardless.</span><br><br>He never tried to improve his read on Dierfire when that wagon came up yesterday and today.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">This is true.

And he obviously scum reads you. That's why he calls it a \"counter-wagon.\" Once again, I see where he is coming from. At the same time, I feel he's not understanding your aggressiveness.

However, I would advise you to try your best to not let meta cloud your judgement. Meta is ok at times, but in a case like this, it might be best not to use it. Just focus on the here and now, that way, you can feel confident about your read on her. Titus seems to be an experienced player, so I don't see her having a hard time changing her meta from game to game, and that's why I didn't really choose to look at her past games in my null read of her."}

By choosing not to, they leave themselves wide open to being caught butt-fucking each other. That comes off as risky. Genuine question: do you think that Math and Mecha would be willing to do that here? Because, from my POV, Mecha has no real reason as scum to defend Math. He would only be making matters worse for himself, especially considering the fact that Mecha had no real suspicion on him UNTIL he chose to start defending Math. It just reeks of stupidity and n00b. I don't feel that Mecha is either of those. Also, if both Mecha and Math were looking for a mislynch at this point in the game, why in the world would they vote two different people? Math voted Karnos and Mecha voted Titus. Doesn't it make sense for them as a scum-team who are buddying to get a mislynch to send the game into LYLO(as you say) to be on the same wagon?</span>  <br><br>In fact this theory seems to directly undercut your Titus \u2013 Math theory as Titus is treating Math very clearly as bad Town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">No, because my point of buddying(in this case) is that it is a two way street. The fact that Math sees Titus as possible scum but Titus doesn't see Math as possible scum tells me that they're both not buddying. Only one of them seems to be doing so to help the other not get lynched. Plus, it makes sense for Math not to buddy up with Titus at this point since she has already pointed to feeling that Titus is scum. To switch now would be obvious. The thing to note, however, is unlike Mecha who is hard-defending Math, Titus is choosing to play it subtle. That's the big difference when it comes to not throwing out the scum advantage, as I point out above. Especially when she says \"maybe Math\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8102778#p8102778\">1388</a>  after she says that Math is \"obvious town\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8072839#p8072839\">1275</a>.</span><br></div></blockquote><br>Responses in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold.</span>"}

I feel that their frustration to the pushes on them is a town frustration.  Titus can't read me like always so she could be doing that or be trying to mislynch me.  In regards to (magna?) saying my callout of the hammer was bad, the hammer was bad because it was random when we still had some time for me to talk more (I declared intent but was planning on waiting at least a day) and their reasons for it seemed kind of bad.  I think if the hammer was scum that means Titus is scum because I remember very clearly in cyberpunk where Titus wanted me to derp hammer diamondsentinel with a sheep vote so I can see her directing that her as well.  The uncounterclaimed investigative is interesting, mass claim might be good since we are well in the game at this point.  That is where I'm at right now"}

The fact that Titus doesn't deny my accusation of her vote being opportunistic but instead chooses to give an excuse for it should be telling. Titus is like the master of excuses.

Town usually wants a lynch for their highest scum read, because they would be paranoid about lynching someone they felt was less scummy. Her choosing not to worry about which of her scum reads gets the rope makes sense coming from a scum. Scum KNOWS who is town and who isn't. They don't have to worry about putting their scum reads into a tiered list with levels and all that jazz. They would just be fine with lynching whoever they can get the chance to.

Has Dwlee's inactivity made you believe that he is as scummy as Mecha? Or that it has passed the threshold? From my understanding, you feel that Dwlee is scum because of his slot. Are you not willing to let Dwlee argue otherwise? Seeing as he is V/LA, it only increases my suspicion of you voting him in a scum opportunistic manner. For town who subscribes to your threshold argument, voting their scum read who is V/LA over voting for their scum read who isn't would be silly and they'd know that. Scum, OTOH, could care less. They'd want to vote the V/LA one because that one would be less willing to argue against their lynch. Someone like Mecha is hard for you to mislynch because he's putting in effort in try not to get lynched. Dwlee doesn't seem to be doing that. You as scum see the opportunity, and obviously grab for it. You get +1 points for trying to spin it though. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">"}

Your concern was that I did not have a Titus read. 1315 addresses that read. Being a decent person to my sister is really NAI. They are my sister.  The main thing here is everyone is reading Karnos as town. It is like as soon as the Karnos claim of Neopolitan happened everyone went \"nope\" they can't be scum. It is ridiculous and horribad site meta. A PR claim does NOT MEAN TOWN. So yes, I may have a conf bias pole up my ass so far it is coming up my head. But at least it's a consistent one and one where I am trying to figure out why everyone \"conf towns\" Karnos, because that is exactly what we are doing and NO ONE is acknowledging it except Dwlee a smidge.<br><br>If everyone is going to insist that we are not lynching Karnos today I want them to physically goddamn acknowledge why Karnos is town and why this is the proper course of action. Not just \"oh he said a person was confirmed town\". That could be their buddy. No, we said Karnos was going to be forced to do that in our walls  and then scum would have to kill them. I am trying desperately to stop town derp here but I cannot do it alone because scum will mislynch me."}

But as above shows, Town!MathBlade strongly implies that Titus is also town. The obvious implication being that there is no reason for town!Mecha to vote Titus while he is reading MathBlade as town. I'm just trying to figure out if town!Mecha realized his error, or if scum!Mecha realized the flaw in his reads.<br><br>If Mecha is indeed town, that leaves the scum pool as Dwlee, Firebringer, Magna, Saru.

So there is clear precedent for the idea that Persivul would replace as scum, the answer is a resounding YES.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8110986#p8110986\" class=\"postlink\">post 1519</a>, MechaGoomba wrote:</cite>Because I tell you right now, I see no reason for Math to tunnel a universal townread to the point where everyone scumreads Math for it when they could just NK karnos.</div></blockquote><br>I was assuming that scum avoided killing me because they thought they could get me lynched, or because they had a roleblocker (though my successful result last night disproved that theory). So I wouldn't say my survival proves anyone's innocence on it's own.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Saru wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8111594#p8111594\" class=\"postlink\">post 1523</a>, Titus wrote:</cite>Thoughts on Dwlee/Pers, Saru?</div></blockquote><br>Feel his slot was/is scummy.

Seemed consistent with a replacement's thought process. His frustration town read of MathBlade makes sense coming from a replacement as well. His recent posting has me scratching my head, he might want to explain that when/if he comes back. And he also might want to read up. Overall, the slot read is scummy but the person in the slot hasn't been all that scummy. Not my biggest priority in terms of a lynch.</div></blockquote><br>So Saru, you also think Titus is scum but Math is town? Why do you think scum!Titus would pass up a free chance to hammer MathBlade? I just don't buy it.

Then he explains his thoughts, which include a gem about how if the hammer was scum, that would make titus scum- great logic, except the hammer isn't scum. And of course there is the note I made above, that Scum!Titus had the perfect opportunity to hammer MathBlade and didn't.<br><br>So, Dwlee is scum, I don't see another explanation.
