{"number": 0, "id": "3411134", "user": "Meransiel", "user_id": "15429", "content": "<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Nobody had much to do in that placid, quiet neighborhood at the edges of Florida. The elderly living there led a boring, sedentary life much like the forum mafia nerds of today. Only with more quiet and less fapping. But, all reasonable not that bad things must come to an end via plot device and Murphy's Law, amirite? And so it happened.<br>\n<br>\nOn a frightful day of September 7th, 13 youth came in with their parents to join the neighborhood, each of them being sent an unanimous letter telling them that here is the place where they will fulfill their ultimate destiny, where they would be given a new shine, where they will skyrocket their careers. The old residents of the place, however, were not as excited - what with their emo hair, geeky glasses, loud music and the bad omen their number, 13, would bring upon the place. And they were not that far from the truth.<br>\n<br>\nThe weirdness started the next day, when a great oak came crashing down an old cat lady's house, killing five of her pets. She wasn't there to be hurt, but when she figured out that it's probably the newcomer's fault, she started screaming at the lot, ultimately succumbing to a heart attack because of stress. And that wasn't the only fatality - stray dogs were laying eviscerated on the streets. And the youth were waiting patiently in two large houses where they were accommodated, growing weary of the \"fame\" and fortune that WASN'T coming at their doorsteps.<br>\n<br>\nThen, the next morning, two things happened at the same time. Grumpy old Mr. Johnson was shot by a hidden sniper while he was walking his dog, and the youth received an anonymous call to get to the central square as fast as possible. Naturally, they made haste to get there as soon as possible, cash signs glowing on their eyeballs.<br>\n<br>\nThey were met there by a sleek black Lexus limousine. Polished rims, electrically opaqued windows, stickers on front depicting golden revolvers, everything you would expect...not from an economist. The next moment, the back door opened, and they were greeted by a bald man in a black suit with faggot white gloves. Giving them an insane looking smile, he started laughing his ass off. Then, without further ado, he took an Uzi from beneath his tuxedo and splattered one of the youth's brains on the street.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Meransiel - Strongman CPR Doctor</div>, Killed Pregame</div><br>\n<br>\nWhile everyone else was in shock and fearing for their lives, the murderer started talking, with a hint RP Brittish accent.<br>\n<br>\n\"Headshot biotch! Ya just got OWNED! And not just him, na. Ya'll meet your ends here, boys. Cause I'll tell you a secret. Not all of you are innocent lesbian nicepants. Na-ah! Some of you are with me. And those will make sure the rest of you - and the nice old people in the neighborhood - bite the dust. And MY ASS!\"<br>\n<br>\nBefore anyone else could react, he was back in his limousine and gone. But they all knew that wouldn't solve anything. They had to find the culprits, and fast. They came here united, bond by their common hate for stupid old people. But now they must investigate, and chase, and accuse, and lynch - and go One After the Other!<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\nSome Rules<br>\n0: I have all the authority as the mod, all of it. I promise to be as just, fair and consistent as humanly possible, but reserve the right to change anything in case I make a mistake.<br>\n1: Unless otherwise specifically specified (that's very specific) by me and only me, you may not discuss the game outside the thread. Doing so will result in a mod kill or replacement of all involved and me being a sad panda. In the same vein you may not quote any private communication from me or other players including PMs and quicktopic. Finally, you may not post the links to the quicktopics.<br>\n2: If you need my attention, either for questions or concerns, PM me or post in Orange Bold, I will be on the lookout for orange, bolded text and will respond to any querys in them as soon as possible.<br>\n3: Modkills will result in the mod-killed player immediately losing the game. I will also then take whatever action is deemed most detrimental (that is, worst) for the faction involved in the modkill, this may include ending the day early (for a town modkill), not ending the day (for a scum modkill) or anything else that seems appropriate at the time.<br>\n4: Blue is mine, you cannot have it.<br>\n<br>\nGameplay<br>\n5: Votes must be in bold and typed as so: Vote: PlayerName. I would very much appreciate the use of vote tags by typing [*vote]Name of Person[*/vote] without the asterisks (*'s). While i will accept any bolded vote, i may not notice votes that are not in the vote tags, so save yourself and myself some time and use them tags.\"<br>\n6: You do not have to unvote (using the unvote tags) before re-voting, but it is preferred as it will make my life easier and making the mod's life easier means a smoother game.<br>\n7: You may vote for No Lynch as he is immune to lynches and thus doing so ends the day without anyone dying from a lynch.<br>\n8: Lynches are reached instantly upon a majority (half + 1) of votes on a single player. If the timeline expires without a lynch being reached, no-one will be lynched and the game will proceed to Night.<br>\n9: If you absolutely must make a bah post, PM me the post before you post it, i will clear it or not. If i do not clear your proposed bah post, you may not make it.<br>\n10: Once a majority is reached the game enters the Twilight phase. You may continue to post during the Twilight phase, which lasts from the moment of majority to when i next check and lock the thread, but no votes made during the Twilight phase will be counted.<br>\n11: Standard MafiaScum rules apply. No secret codes, no invisible text and no editing posts. If you're worried that something you are considering may be in violation of these rules, PM me with a query about your intended action first and i will tell you if it's ok or not.<br>\n12: I will be using Natural Action Resolution to determine action results at night.<br>\n13: Any of the roles specifically listed as Normal on The Wiki. In addition, there may be one other role that does not appear on that page but does not use any explicitly non-normal mechanics.<br>\n<br>\nDeadlines and Such<br>\n14: Days will default to lasting 3 weeks. The time may be extended under certain circumstances, such as a late replacement.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">14.1: If deadline is reached without a majority vote, a No Lynch will occur and the game will proceed to Night phase.</div><br>\n15: Nights will end when i have recieved all night actions or when 48 hours have elapsed, whichever comes first. Players with night actions who do not wish to use those actions should send a 'no action' PM so as to not delay the night.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">15.1: If 48 hours elapse and a player has not submitted an action, that action is forfeit.</div><br>\n16: Avoid lurking. While it is technically a strategy, it only really ruins the game for everyone else. Any player who does not post at least once every 48 hours will be poked. If i have to poke a player too many times, or the poke is not responded to, the player will be replaced.<br>\n17: If you will be unable to post for an extended period of time (more than 48 hours) due to meatspace concerns, please notify me ahead of time either in PM or in the thread.<br>\n<br>\nOther Things<br>\n18: Mafia is an aggressive game, many players use aggression and\\or insults as part of their play strategy. There are, however, limits. If a player is acting inappropriately action will be taken. The line is rather fuzzy and situationally dependant, so if you're worried you might be going to far, you probably are.<br>\n19: First and foremost, mafia is a game. That means the primary goal is to have fun. HOWEVER, players who deliberately and knowingly play against their team's win condition will be frowned upon and probably replaced.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSample Townie Role PM<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>You are a Townie.\nYou possess no admirable qualities, just your vote.

Why do I not appreciate fencesitting? It shows a lack of care, being dead weight, etc (Ash is right, it's one thing I hate) and just makes it overall more annoying to get reads on which is why I hate posting when forced.  (If I had to go beyond Null since he's been busy, Scum)<br>\n<br>\nMonk: Well we know my previous suspicion before. The thing is with newer people in this game (Or at least a ton of meta's I don't know) it's harder for me to decipher... but I honestly haven't been leaning to Town on this one. The whole RVS thing feels forced earlier. (Slightly Scum, etc)<br>\n<br>\nHiraki: Okay, here's a better question: While he hasn't done anything out of the blue yet, how does he have so many town reads? I've never played with Hiraki, so I wouldn't know. (or for that matter most of you) Hilariously enough, at the same time, I'm leaning towards Town (Nothing strong, however)<br>\n<br>\nMute: I'm honestly feeling a town read out of this one. I can't find anything I dislike that makes him stick out. Maybe I need a more depth reason but he's providing out good content when he can post. (Town read, etc)<br>\n<br>\nFriend: Opportunistic. Previous Town Read... is turning into a really huge \"UNDECIDED\" - I'm really broke on this one so far, I'd still lean towards Town but I for sure need to analyze this again.<br>\n<br>\nWhisper: Much like myself, I haven't seen much of Whisper around (or for that matter, anyone around the weekend). I had a Town read before and the entire argument doesn't really flow many scum reads yet in the Friend/Emp/Monk RVS case way back.<br>\n<br>\nWhiskers: Flip flop flip flop eh... At first I was leaning towards scum with my read but then Town. I'd lean a slight bit more towards scum on this one now. If I kept posting content on this, I'd be going flop.<br>\n<br>\nAsh: Still null! Okay... Not really. Slight bit towards Town. Actually trying to push others who aren't vocally speaking seems more like TownAsh than ScumAsh. Everything else? I'm not feeling anything I'd go confident into. What <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">does</div> interest me however is how fast Friend brought off his lynch.<br>\n<br>\nKilljoy: I really can't tell with this. I can understand that he's busy but I haven't seen much on separate reasoning and the whole (At least to my understanding) \"Never playing on a Mafia site\" yeah. (Null: A slight Town lean if I  had to choose)<br>\n<br>\nEmpking: All of the posts are one-liners; really, leaning a slight bit more towards town, but my mind is honestly in a gutter with this one.<br>\n<br>\nZdenek: I would be half-okay with lynching you now for VCA. A few are suddenly trying to break off the wagon as pointed out, but I really don't know. There's not much sans for the Wagon that makes me believe you're town.<br>\n<br>\nI'll quote some stuff later as well especially since I need to get clear on a few things and pitch in a vote later.

If no for either one, or both, then using another game to justify a players actions towards any motivation is bad.

Therefore, imo, it makes sense to do a complete 180 and lynch the player that appears the most town. <br>\n<br>\nBasically, I'm not too keen on lynching seemingly scummy players on day 1 and day 2, because I think scum are out there acting town and doing their best to make town players look like scum, especially those that have that scummy vibe anyway.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat's because scumhunting at that part of the game is inheritantly flawed, and it always seems to be imo.

You don't need to deny it though. I think it's wonderful that you're a sadist. You shouldn't be hiding that; you should tell the world! You should put it on your resume, so that masochists will know that you're the perfect employee for them! I mean, you enjoy inflicting pain, they love having pain inflicted upon themselves...it's a match in heaven...the things you might end up doing may not be so pristine, but...well, as long as you're enjoying yourself, that's all that matters, right?

I mean, I meant to comment on it earlier, but I was enjoying replying to you so much that I forgot: this Day One was essentially everyone grasping that every single thing they could find, and acting like it was grounds for a solid argument. I found it silly trying to find some basis in all of that, and it's not like I know any of you particularly well, so I can't say something like \"X is scummy because X does this as scum\" or anything.

So he gets the benefit of the doubt. </div></blockquote><br>\nJust wanted to point this out briefly. Why do we all think monk is a bad player? He's playing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">differently</div> in this game than he did in the other game I played with him in, but he actually had something to fight against in that game. <br>\nTBH, I don't see a lot of scumtells from monk. Declared Town, by virtue of the fact that she's too dumb to scum. Then again, she played reasonably in Masquerade, where she flipped TOWN, so the different playstyle...? <br>\nTown until I can get Hiraki lynched. <br>\n-------<br>\nKilljoy makes a lot of votes. She also says Day 2 that Zdenek was her only read (and then proceeds to say she thinks I'm scum -___-). Her Epicmafia heritage is pretty obvious here. Killjoy, I'm not saying you're a bad player, but I'm saying EM conditions you to play a certain way (loudly and headfirst) and you are playing that way here. Not scum. (Therefore town.) <br>\nGilda's most recent post, she votes Ashblade. I'll go there next. <br>\n------- <br>\n<br>\n#131 (Ashblade's) <br>\nNow that I'm not in another game with monk (&amp;therefore, don't hate her for any reasons outside of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">this</div> game), this looks a little weird. Obviously I'm not sheeping it anymore. I can't put my hoof on it but this post is a little funny. <br>\nAs I said at one point, every post of his had game-useful content. <br>\n<br>\nFrom Ashblade's #272, Zdenek Also appears to be too dumb to scum. Ashblade certainly believes that. <br>\nKilljoy seems to sort-of agree with whispersilk's plan of \"lynch non-scum-looking players,\" and Ashblade (#441) seems to want to refine her plan-- since whispersilk said to do it on Day 1 AND 2, when Day 2 isn't really a useful option or one that makes sense. <br>\n<br>\nMeh, from then on, I see Ashblade's reasoning and he looks better and better-- he has content in EVERY post, excluding, like, V/LA announcements. Also, players like Killjoy look worse for things like Not voting me-- I called her out for this on my own, but Ashblade did the same thing. The fact that we think alike makes me think we're the same alignment. <br>\nTown. <br>\nNext is pseudo, who is the main reason Ashblade looks scummy at all. Ashblade keeps defending pseudo, idk why. <br>\n-------<br>\nPseudo doesn't post 'til #86-- page four... then does very little but stays kind of active. <br>\n<br>\n#285 is an omgus, correct? <br>\n#448 is bad, so bad. I guess he doesn't understand V/LA, and that's why Ashblade is willing to let him off the hook? Elsewhere in this post: fluff. <br>\n<br>\n#493, more fluff, explains away his uselessness/lurking as having a hard time reading the players. <br>\nHe then drops suspicion on chkflip for being scummy (doesn't look like bussing, and that was legitiamtely scummy/stoopid move on chkclip's behalf), and drops suspicion on Empking for throwing the vote out there and then voting monk (who had the same scum reads as Hiraki and Empking, apparently). <br>\n<br>\nChkflip remained scummy. What he did was scummy, no matter whether he was reading or re-reading. I'll go there next. <br>\nPseudo is on the scum-side of my reads. ((Btw, shouldn't Pseudo NOT be scum, due to join date, too?)) <br>\n------- <br>\nchkflip ISO: <br>\n#444: Votes for no good reason. <br>\n#446: Buddying, putting heavier suspicion on monk for that thing which is a meh-tell. <br>\n#449: Nice one-liner, bro. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS</div>: chkflip <br>\n...but why no vote? <br>\n#451: Fluff? But I agree, the M/S fluff is annoying. A Breadcrumb, maybe? While Pseudo's attacks on you don't look like bussing, your attacks on him do. <br>\n#452: Yeah, but why? <br>\n#464: Yeah, but WHY!? Why are you together, forming a team? btw, if you are scum, then you can pick some buddies out of  three townies and say, \"ooh, these guys are town.\" <br>\n#485: Protip: Do something, you lurking asshat. <br>\n#487: FUNNY!? you seemed to have made town-reads (for no reason, I'll add), and established <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">two</div> scum reads-- monk, and pseudo. But nice try. <br>\n#491: Since gilda technically didn't ask for WHY he had those town reads, this post is... okay, I guess. Still, just say who you replaced. you have the time &amp;effort to be a jerk, why not type the names out? It'd take less time. <br>\n#494: Doesn't matter, <br>\nBecause either way, all you were going to do was say monk was scum for the same thing. (#500.)<br>\n<br>\nSo, \"Emphasis on RE-reading, genius.\" and then \"What's the difference?\" <br>\n<br>\n#502: The difference is, if monk is really scum, then you'll have reads and reasons of your own. If you come to the same conclusion on your own, it's not really a sheep, is it? <br>\n<br>\nAlso, since you weren't finished \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RE</div>-reading, genius.\" because you \"read threads several times.\" you weren't ready to throw out a vote, so the fact that you were \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RE</div>-reading\" \"is moot, bro.\" <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">chkflip is scum.</div> Whom did he replace, Friend, right? I'll look briefly at his ISO next. <br>\n<br>\nAha, see, Friend I like. his posts about monk had substance and were reasonable. He also got into a scuffle with whispersilk, which I don't mind. Friend might have been a misguided townie, but chkflip is scum. Also, Friend is a very good player, so, he could hide his scumminess better? <br>\nFreind's scum-reads: Pseudo, ThirdKoopa, Ashblade. (Bussing, bussing, redherring?) <br>\n------- <br>\n<br>\nwhispersilk: <br>\nIs a bit of a jerk, defends monk pretty hard, I guess this whole \"monk's Thing\" was what made Empking tunnel on monk and what made everypont else call monk too dumb to scum. <br>\nIn #111 and before, Friend says, \"oh no, don't get me wrong: I think Silk is wrong, but town-aligned.\" <br>\nIn #128, Whispersilk says the same thing about friend, and in #130, unvotes him. Awwwwww. &lt;3 <br>\n<br>\nBlah, blah, two ISO posts = 200+Real posts, and those two are excuses for lurking/not paying attention to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">this</div> game. Then, in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">#403,</div> she brings out her asinine-sounding plan to lynch townies. Next five posts are explaining the same, and the last, #470, ISO #36, is whining that \"BAW, nopony ever listens to MEEEEE!\" and saying that there are vocal scum, but not saying whom.

You thought empking was scum. You thought NS was scummy enough to vote for him. Your read on chkflip is strange to say the least. First you didn't like him due to your gut, then you called his reaction to monk's gambit \"odd\", but then in the same post you say he is probably town. Today, you are calling him scum again. Either way, he was also on monk's wagon. You had an opportunity to vote for chkflip (a scum read) over voting for your town read, a town read that told you not to vote for him. Your vote on chkflip would have taken him to L-3, just one less that monk. After reading monk in ISO, I am confident he would have voted for chkflip instead of hammering himself, making chkflip equal in votes. You had a choice other than voting for your town read, but you didn't take it, and now you're shirking responsibility for your actions.", "time": "Fri Oct 14, 2011 4:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18987&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "18987"}

I agreed \"that I don't think monk is a good enough player to think that far ahead.\" I didn't say monk was a scum read. (Looking back, Friend's original post on this was because he didn't believe monk's \"trap\" was really a trap. I honestly don't currently remember my stance on that. Please, forgive me, it's been years and years.) <br>\n<br>\nThen, Friend and whispersilk were bickering, and I said, \"Friend's right,\" and Voted Whispersilk, something that Friend hadn't done. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3412889#p3412889\" class=\"postlink\">Bad post</a>. Implies that twisting is not a scum tell and then answers a question directed at empking, not her. One which was asked by Whisper, in case you're wondering.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, implies that Friend was twisting from, \"nervous and sarcastic\" to \"paraphrased and sarcastic,\" exactly like I said in that post. I also said that changing the tone of a post to fit one's claims is sometimes okay. I stand by that. I do it later (in your case against me, no less!) and here, I didn't feel Friend had changed the tone to one that was non-representative of monk's original posts. Friend condensed it, nothing worse. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413093#p3413093\" class=\"postlink\">Friend single handedly gets <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> to unvote</a> off of Whisper, but then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> proceeds to not vote anyone else, not even Ashblade, who her great friend Friend wants to kill.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">In short, was a pressure vote. Should I have voted somepony else after? Ashblade wasn't a strong case, I didn't vote him.

Her RVS theory link is bad because she isn't even doing it right and is completely missing the point. Then says she wants to lynch Monk, but how does that make any sense? First off, her vote is on ThKoopa. Second off, this post has NOTHING to do with monk at all. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I was justifying my removal of vote from whispersilk. It wasn't a particularly hard or serious vote. I wasn't incredibly trusting of Friend's reasoning (\"she's flail-town\"), so I was justifying it to myself. ((I know, I know, this was in response to ZDenek's post, but I didn't really know why she was town either.)) My reasoning? Friend's: She's flail-town, and Mine: she's newish, and I'm in RVS. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not doing WHAT about RVS righT? I'm missing WHAT point? IT was a link I had found just a few days before, (or maybe even that day), I posted it because it was great. ((btw, thank you for helping me find it again)) But how am I completely missing the point? <br>\n<br>\nI say \"I want to lynch monk.\" I was pursuing him on a line of questioning.

I read Ashblade as town for having content... doesn't that make sense? it makes sense to me. Posts without content are scummy; see chkflip. Therefore, on the flip side, posts full of content (not filler) are townny. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3417375#p3417375\" class=\"postlink\">Make no mistake, this is backtracking</a> on the Ashblade town read.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, it's not. It is, however, saying that, if I am sick of lurkers, and a player is not lurking, but posting content, I might be more inclined to favor them. I didn't back off, I didn't stop and say, \"Oh, yeah, well, I guess he's not a townread then,\" I just acknowledged that it might not be the best towntell, and I moved on. Ashblade remained a town read, and he remained a townread for that reason. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3418783#p3418783\" class=\"postlink\">Doesn't defend against accusations of faking content</a>, instead points out that Ashblade isn't faking content, which was never implied from the preceding post.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">I dunno what happened here. Looking at my argument for the \"content is a towntell\" thing, though, maybe I was pointing out that they were using lack of content as a scumtell and this was the reverse of that. I really don't remember and hindsight is 20/20, but that's the best reason I can come up with now. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421525#p3421525\" class=\"postlink\">Whiskers says she only has 1 read, and it is a town read on Ash</a>, AND that read is based off of having content, nothing more. Not what the content is, that is irrelevant!</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">There's another issue in this post, but I'll deal with the one you addressed: I had a townread on Ashblade for his posting of content (already discussed, I believe it's a valid towntell), I list whispersilk as nullscum here, I still don't like her from the Friend/WS fight, and then monk I had dealt with-- I just didn't have any strong reads one way or another. You all think ashblade was a stretch-- I could have grasped for straws to look like I had some great reads, but I didn't grasp at straws, and I didn't have great reads.

I don't even know what you're referencing here-- you're making this up? Putting words into my mouth? I didn't say anything here about not remembering a post...? or about having a 100% strong scum read on Zden. <br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> saying that Friend looked scummy for resisting the Zden wagon and hunting lurkers instead.

Right? </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424296#p3424296\" class=\"postlink\">Let the record show</a> that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> finds bad play scummy, and also somehow finds asking if there is a miller scummy. Overall, enough reason to vote; but it begs the question, why wasn't he a scum read at all earlier on? All of these posts are after the post where <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> has no scum reads. And she just pulls them out of her pocket with no indication of them when she voted.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I find bad play scummy, I find asking about a miller scummy-- so? what does a miller have to do with anything? Does that make me scummy, or are you just pointing it out for fun? He wasn't a scum read earlier on because I wasn't focusing and hadn't done an iso or a case or anything yet. You keep pointing out how vague and readless I am -- and I am. I am until I go and do the ISOs to please monk.  <br>\n<br>\nSecond: Because I pulled them out of an ISO, not my pocket. I went and found more reasons to be voting her-- I guess that's what you're saying is scummy? I voted her for the matters at hoof, then I built a case. <br>\nActually, looking back, I'd put it like this: \"Opportunistic case-building.\" Looks like I took the biggest wagon and expanded the case on it. <br>\nI felt Mute was in the right, I didn't have a vote out (I think?), and I voted against the other guy. Similar, in a sense, to my vote on whispersilk, except that this player already had a large wagon on him. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424542#p3424542\" class=\"postlink\">Lol? Unvotes again</a> but this time because Zdek sounds like she does when she is town who is being pressured? That's bad play, you can't use meta of two different people interchangeably. What makes this particularly bad is that you made a case against him, and he is your only recorded scum read, and you're going back on it because of this. Backtrack more off of town.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Why can't I use two metas interchangably? You can apparently use scumtells for all players, you can use towntells for all players-- let's put it like this: Acting the way in which Zden was acting, I felt like it was a town tell (like I act when cornered town). Universal across the board, right? Good thing I'll call it a tell now, instead of meta. <br>\nYeah, I did make a case. I also get cases made against me as town. What am I supposed to say here? </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3425206#p3425206\" class=\"postlink\">Nothing to vote over</a>? You have NO suspicions, and you feel that that was a scum move, then vote! You are just spreading seeds of suspicion everywhere without backing any of it up or committing. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Again, this is me being transparent.

I agreed \"that I don't think monk is a good enough player to think that far ahead.\" I didn't say monk was a scum read. (Looking back, Friend's original post on this was because he didn't believe monk's \"trap\" was really a trap. I honestly don't currently remember my stance on that. Please, forgive me, it's been years and years.) <br>\n<br>\nThen, Friend and whispersilk were bickering, and I said, \"Friend's right,\" and Voted Whispersilk, something that Friend hadn't done. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3412889#p3412889\" class=\"postlink\">Bad post</a>.

I also said that changing the tone of a post to fit one's claims is sometimes okay. I stand by that. I do it later (in your case against me, no less!) and here, I didn't feel Friend had changed the tone to one that was non-representative of monk's original posts. Friend condensed it, nothing worse. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">**</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413093#p3413093\" class=\"postlink\">Friend single handedly gets <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> to unvote</a> off of Whisper, but then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> proceeds to not vote anyone else, not even Ashblade, who her great friend Friend wants to kill.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">In short, was a pressure vote.

First off, her vote is on ThKoopa. Second off, this post has NOTHING to do with monk at all. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I was justifying my removal of vote from whispersilk. It wasn't a particularly hard or serious vote. I wasn't incredibly trusting of Friend's reasoning (\"she's flail-town\"), so I was justifying it to myself. ((I know, I know, this was in response to ZDenek's post, but I didn't really know why she was town either.)) My reasoning? Friend's: She's flail-town, and Mine: she's newish, and I'm in RVS. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I also am more experienced (I think) Than Whispersilk, but not on this site. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\"><br>\n<br>\nI'm not doing WHAT about RVS righT? I'm missing WHAT point? IT was a link I had found just a few days before, (or maybe even that day), I posted it because it was great. ((btw, thank you for helping me find it again)) But how am I completely missing the point? <br>\n<br>\nI say \"I want to lynch monk.\" I was pursuing him on a line of questioning.

I read Ashblade as town for having content... doesn't that make sense? it makes sense to me. Posts without content are scummy; see chkflip. Therefore, on the flip side, posts full of content (not filler) are townny. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3417375#p3417375\" class=\"postlink\">Make no mistake, this is backtracking</a> on the Ashblade town read.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, it's not. It is, however, saying that, if I am sick of lurkers, and a player is not lurking, but posting content, I might be more inclined to favor them. I didn't back off, I didn't stop and say, \"Oh, yeah, well, I guess he's not a townread then,\" I just acknowledged that it might not be the best towntell, and I moved on. Ashblade remained a town read, and he remained a townread for that reason. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3418783#p3418783\" class=\"postlink\">Doesn't defend against accusations of faking content</a>, instead points out that Ashblade isn't faking content, which was never implied from the preceding post.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">I dunno what happened here. Looking at my argument for the \"content is a towntell\" thing, though, maybe I was pointing out that they were using lack of content as a scumtell and this was the reverse of that. I really don't remember and hindsight is 20/20, but that's the best reason I can come up with now. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421525#p3421525\" class=\"postlink\">Whiskers says she only has 1 read, and it is a town read on Ash</a>, AND that read is based off of having content, nothing more. Not what the content is, that is irrelevant!</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">There's another issue in this post, but I'll deal with the one you addressed: I had a townread on Ashblade for his posting of content (already discussed, I believe it's a valid towntell), I list whispersilk as nullscum here, I still don't like her from the Friend/WS fight, and then monk I had dealt with-- I just didn't have any strong reads one way or another. You all think ashblade was a stretch-- I could have grasped for straws to look like I had some great reads, but I didn't grasp at straws, and I didn't have great reads.

I don't even know what you're referencing here-- you're making this up? Putting words into my mouth? I didn't say anything here about not remembering a post...? or about having a 100% strong scum read on Zden. <br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> saying that Friend looked scummy for resisting the Zden wagon and hunting lurkers instead. There you go, me acquiring reads. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424270#p3424270\" class=\"postlink\">Says zdek is being uncooperative</a> while in a conversation with him in which he is trying his best to cooperate with you. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Fuck, whatever, sure, MAYBE with ME. But I'm calling him out on going, \"fuck this, you're a jerk and I'm not answering your questions\" to Mute. UNCOOPERATIVE. Right? </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424296#p3424296\" class=\"postlink\">Let the record show</a> that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> finds bad play scummy, and also somehow finds asking if there is a miller scummy. Overall, enough reason to vote; but it begs the question, why wasn't he a scum read at all earlier on? All of these posts are after the post where <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> has no scum reads. And she just pulls them out of her pocket with no indication of them when she voted.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I find bad play scummy, I find asking about a miller scummy-- so? what does a miller have to do with anything? Does that make me scummy, or are you just pointing it out for fun? He wasn't a scum read earlier on because I wasn't focusing and hadn't done an iso or a case or anything yet. You keep pointing out how vague and readless I am -- and I am. I am until I go and do the ISOs to please monk.  <br>\n<br>\nSecond: Because I pulled them out of an ISO, not my pocket. I went and found more reasons to be voting her-- I guess that's what you're saying is scummy? I voted her for the matters at hoof, then I built a case. <br>\nActually, looking back, I'd put it like this: \"Opportunistic case-building.\" Looks like I took the biggest wagon and expanded the case on it. <br>\nI felt Mute was in the right, I didn't have a vote out (I think?), and I voted against the other guy. Similar, in a sense, to my vote on whispersilk, except that this player already had a large wagon on him. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424542#p3424542\" class=\"postlink\">Lol? Unvotes again</a> but this time because Zdek sounds like she does when she is town who is being pressured? That's bad play, you can't use meta of two different people interchangeably. What makes this particularly bad is that you made a case against him, and he is your only recorded scum read, and you're going back on it because of this. Backtrack more off of town.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Why can't I use two metas interchangably? You can apparently use scumtells for all players, you can use towntells for all players-- let's put it like this: Acting the way in which Zden was acting, I felt like it was a town tell (like I act when cornered town). Universal across the board, right? Good thing I'll call it a tell now, instead of meta. <br>\nYeah, I did make a case. I also get cases made against me as town. What am I supposed to say here? </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3425206#p3425206\" class=\"postlink\">Nothing to vote over</a>? You have NO suspicions, and you feel that that was a scum move, then vote! You are just spreading seeds of suspicion everywhere without backing any of it up or committing. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Again, this is me being transparent. I'm telling monk how I read it. I'm saying, \"This looked like this to me.\"</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">** Remember the part where I said it's okay to change the tone of a post to prove a point?

It was my first post of the game. I voted whispersilk because of some reasoning about something, and then votes pseudo, probably for RVS, probably bec ause he hadn't checked in. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Don't remember.

I agreed \"that I don't think monk is a good enough player to think that far ahead.\" I didn't say monk was a scum read. (Looking back, Friend's original post on this was because he didn't believe monk's \"trap\" was really a trap. I honestly don't currently remember my stance on that. Please, forgive me, it's been years and years.) <br>\n<br>\nThen, Friend and whispersilk were bickering, and I said, \"Friend's right,\" and Voted Whispersilk, something that Friend hadn't done. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">If monk could not think far ahead enough to where he could realistically set a trap, then the trap was fake. If he faked the trap and made up some excuse to vote in a blatant lie, he is most certainly scummy. I think it is safe to say that your stance on this was that you agreed that monk faked the trap. Yet... no vote.</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3412889#p3412889\" class=\"postlink\">Bad post</a>.

One which was asked by Whisper, in case you're wondering.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, implies that Friend was twisting from, \"nervous and sarcastic\" to \"paraphrased and sarcastic,\" exactly like I said in that post. I also said that changing the tone of a post to fit one's claims is sometimes okay. I stand by that. I do it later (in your case against me, no less!) and here, I didn't feel Friend had changed the tone to one that was non-representative of monk's original posts. Friend condensed it, nothing worse. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">**</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Okay, lets quickly review what happened.<br>\nFriend said that monk said :\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">LOL it was a trap Empking I've caught you as scum</div>\"<br>\nTo quote monk..:\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I set a trap, I didn't think you'd be the one to set it off, disappointing empking</div>\"<br>\nIn Friends' version there are two things we note that are different: Instead of a more calm, perhaps controlled tone (nervous wtf?) we get a more erratic and slang-versed tone. Also, \"i've caught you as scum\" is jumping to the conclusion that monk felt that empking was surely scum from that 'trap'. Do you still stand by your original decree that it was a modest change?</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413093#p3413093\" class=\"postlink\">Friend single handedly gets <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> to unvote</a> off of Whisper, but then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> proceeds to not vote anyone else, not even Ashblade, who her great friend Friend wants to kill.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">In short, was a pressure vote. Should I have voted somepony else after? Ashblade wasn't a strong case, I didn't vote him. Luckily, TK presented a great spot for my vote in like, the very next post. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Well the idea is that you vote who is most scummy. Ashblade case not being strong early on is fine because it is simply that; early in the game. If you gave credence to it, I'd expect you to vote Ashblade. TK's next post is irrelevant.</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413471#p3413471\" class=\"postlink\">So whisper is town because she's new</a>, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> is just a month older than Whispers, and claims to not be a noob. Her RVS theory link is bad because she isn't even doing it right and is completely missing the point. Then says she wants to lynch Monk, but how does that make any sense? First off, her vote is on ThKoopa. Second off, this post has NOTHING to do with monk at all. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I was justifying my removal of vote from whispersilk. It wasn't a particularly hard or serious vote. I wasn't incredibly trusting of Friend's reasoning (\"she's flail-town\"), so I was justifying it to myself. ((I know, I know, this was in response to ZDenek's post, but I didn't really know why she was town either.)) My reasoning? Friend's: She's flail-town, and Mine: she's newish, and I'm in RVS. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I also am more experienced (I think) Than Whispersilk, but not on this site. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\"><br>\n<br>\nI'm not doing WHAT about RVS righT? I'm missing WHAT point? IT was a link I had found just a few days before, (or maybe even that day), I posted it because it was great. ((btw, thank you for helping me find it again)) But how am I completely missing the point? <br>\n<br>\nI say \"I want to lynch monk.\" I was pursuing him on a line of questioning. I was scumhunting, even in RVS, which tied in to what I said before. <br>\nOther than that, idk why I was mentioning monk here. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Town don't need to overjustify something like an unvote. If you felt you were still in RVS, then you shouldn't need to do that. You just made up some excuse not to vote her. By the way, I am not going to go into detail here, but you are not following what TSQ necessarily wanted to happen with the actions you took. Post-Game I will though.</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413751#p3413751\" class=\"postlink\">Will wait to judge Hiraki until whisper flips</a> which is a bit strange because <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> is voting ThKoopa.

If you need to kill Whisper to read Hiraki, and you have no idea why Whisper is town, then vote whisper. Otherwise, try to read Hiraki as is. Going \"well, until Y dies.. not much I can do\" just looks like scum coming up with an excuse not to read a slot and make life easier on themselves.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3415055#p3415055\" class=\"postlink\">Votes for...monk</a>, basically a sheep of Ashblade, which is funny because ASHBLADE IS NOT VOTING FOR MONK.

There are only 6 posts in that ISO. And you stopped? This is practically a noncommittal read. Regardless, reads Ashblade town purely for having content.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Okay, well, I read four of them. #4 and #5 are walls. I read Ashblade as town for having content... doesn't that make sense? it makes sense to me. Posts without content are scummy; see chkflip. Therefore, on the flip side, posts full of content (not filler) are townny. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">If the inverse of all scumtells are town tells, then you get weird shit. For instance, it is a commonplace mafia tell that if one scumslips, they are scum. On the flipside however, if one does not scumslip, that is not a town tell; it is a null tell. Another example? Mafia are likely to be the ones who to mess up a PR plan. Does that mean that everyone who follows the PR plan is more likely to be town? No, not at all, it is a null tell, just like content.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3417375#p3417375\" class=\"postlink\">Make no mistake, this is backtracking</a> on the Ashblade town read.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, it's not. It is, however, saying that, if I am sick of lurkers, and a player is not lurking, but posting content, I might be more inclined to favor them. I didn't back off, I didn't stop and say, \"Oh, yeah, well, I guess he's not a townread then,\" I just acknowledged that it might not be the best towntell, and I moved on. Ashblade remained a town read, and he remained a townread for that reason. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">A less strong town read, you sounded confident when you declared that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3416365#p3416365\" class=\"postlink\">Ashblade was not scum</a> and literally voted someone for the sake of voting with him. You backed down from that though; a backtrack doesn't have to be a 180, but a 50 degree shift is important still.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3418783#p3418783\" class=\"postlink\">Doesn't defend against accusations of faking content</a>, instead points out that Ashblade isn't faking content, which was never implied from the preceding post.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">I dunno what happened here. Looking at my argument for the \"content is a towntell\" thing, though, maybe I was pointing out that they were using lack of content as a scumtell and this was the reverse of that. I really don't remember and hindsight is 20/20, but that's the best reason I can come up with now. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">That's called deflection, and that is what I thought you were doing.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421525#p3421525\" class=\"postlink\">Whiskers says she only has 1 read, and it is a town read on Ash</a>, AND that read is based off of having content, nothing more. Not what the content is, that is irrelevant!</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">There's another issue in this post, but I'll deal with the one you addressed: I had a townread on Ashblade for his posting of content (already discussed, I believe it's a valid towntell), I list whispersilk as nullscum here, I still don't like her from the Friend/WS fight, and then monk I had dealt with-- I just didn't have any strong reads one way or another. You all think ashblade was a stretch-- I could have grasped for straws to look like I had some great reads, but I didn't grasp at straws, and I didn't have great reads. Why lie? </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">What other issue? First off, I'm nipping this \"scum wouldn't do this\" gimmick in the bud. Town wouldn't do this because town would be scumhunting and getting real reads, especially true for someone who is active like you. Also, if you believe that this isn't a valid scumtell (it most certainly IS), then why did you FoS ThKoopa for having a bunch of null reads? He could have made up reads if he wanted to at the time of your posting. You definitely only expressed 1 read which you need to hold any commitment to in that post.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421838#p3421838\" class=\"postlink\">Asking for explanations of town reads on oneself</a> which is generically bad play. Honestly I'm confused. There is so much wrong with this ISO that people haven't pointed out, I feel like I'm missing something.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">How is that bad play? Are you making up theory just to condemn me? I'm not allowed to question it? Gee, mafia should buddy town players all the time, they're not allowed to question it! Am I getting this right? <br>\nI asked Zden (as an afterthought, perhaps), as monk had asked him a post or so earlier -- a request which Zden had ignored. <br>\nBut there was Mute, who said this: <br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3419041#p3419041\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3419041#p3419041\" data-post-id=\"3419041\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 167</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14598\">Mute</a> wrote:</cite>Whiskers and Empking are my stronger town-reads, and I've my eye on Friend. Everyone else is in the middle.</div></blockquote> I at least gave reasoning for my town reads. I didn't have many reads, but I had explained mine. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">I'm fairly sure that the idea is that you don't explain townreads (unless they directly conflict with your scum reads) as it gives mafia information that doesn't help find out who is scum. If scum know what you find to be townie, then they can manipulate you and you might not even realize it. But, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lets ask and see how the other players in the game feel on this subject</div>, as I was not expecting you to challenge that, and this is an axiom I learned on this site.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3423245#p3423245\" class=\"postlink\">Can someone spell</a> opportunistic scum?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Can somepony spell refusing to answer questions?</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">The worse part about that post is that later on, when he says he'll answer the questions, you go on to refuse him. You are condemning him and offering no chance of redemption.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424063#p3424063\" class=\"postlink\">You can't remember the post</a> that made you 100% have a strong scum read on Zdenek as opposed to your massive null reads not too long ago? Are you actually scumhunting?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Let's start here: When was I 100% sure of something? I don't even know what you're referencing here-- you're making this up? Putting words into my mouth? I didn't say anything here about not remembering a post...? or about having a 100% strong scum read on Zden. <br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> saying that Friend looked scummy for resisting the Zden wagon and hunting lurkers instead. There you go, me acquiring reads. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">That's not what I meant. I meant that that post was 100% the reason that you voted Zdenek. It was what caused your vote. You had him null before, then that post happened, then he was your top scum read. What % scum you felt he was is arbitrary, because you are likely to remember a very recent post that caused your vote. Especially considering zdenek immediately asked about 'which questions' you wanted answered in mutes' post.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424270#p3424270\" class=\"postlink\">Says zdek is being uncooperative</a> while in a conversation with him in which he is trying his best to cooperate with you. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Fuck, whatever, sure, MAYBE with ME. But I'm calling him out on going, \"fuck this, you're a jerk and I'm not answering your questions\" to Mute. UNCOOPERATIVE. Right? </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">So then you should have realized he had a personal despite not unlike the one you had with Monk. And even if he didn't, you stated that you found him to be most suspicious for not answering those questions. Zdenek saw that, and wondered what questions which he did not answer made you feel that way, so he could answer them. That is not at all unreasonable; you condemned him without trial, so to speak.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424296#p3424296\" class=\"postlink\">Let the record show</a> that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> finds bad play scummy, and also somehow finds asking if there is a miller scummy. Overall, enough reason to vote; but it begs the question, why wasn't he a scum read at all earlier on? All of these posts are after the post where <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> has no scum reads. And she just pulls them out of her pocket with no indication of them when she voted.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I find bad play scummy, I find asking about a miller scummy-- so? what does a miller have to do with anything? Does that make me scummy, or are you just pointing it out for fun? He wasn't a scum read earlier on because I wasn't focusing and hadn't done an iso or a case or anything yet. You keep pointing out how vague and readless I am -- and I am. I am until I go and do the ISOs to please monk.  <br>\n<br>\nSecond: Because I pulled them out of an ISO, not my pocket. I went and found more reasons to be voting her-- I guess that's what you're saying is scummy? I voted her for the matters at hoof, then I built a case. <br>\nActually, looking back, I'd put it like this: \"Opportunistic case-building.\" Looks like I took the biggest wagon and expanded the case on it. <br>\nI felt Mute was in the right, I didn't have a vote out (I think?), and I voted against the other guy. Similar, in a sense, to my vote on whispersilk, except that this player already had a large wagon on him. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Fair enough, you didn't notice. I must ask what you find scummy about asking if there is a miller in the setup; I will also ask if you honestly believe that it is okay not to have reads until someone asks you to ISO everyone.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424542#p3424542\" class=\"postlink\">Lol? Unvotes again</a> but this time because Zdek sounds like she does when she is town who is being pressured? That's bad play, you can't use meta of two different people interchangeably. What makes this particularly bad is that you made a case against him, and he is your only recorded scum read, and you're going back on it because of this. Backtrack more off of town.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Why can't I use two metas interchangably? You can apparently use scumtells for all players, you can use towntells for all players-- let's put it like this: Acting the way in which Zden was acting, I felt like it was a town tell (like I act when cornered town). Universal across the board, right? Good thing I'll call it a tell now, instead of meta. <br>\nYeah, I did make a case. I also get cases made against me as town. What am I supposed to say here? </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Okay, then tell me why town are considerably more likely to act as he did (explain how he acted as well) as opposed to scum? As for not using two peoples' meta interchangebly, it is because mafia/town tells are things done that the broad spectrum of mafia roles and town roles are more susceptible to do. Meta tells are different; they are things that a certain player is likely to do as a certain alignment. You can't take, for instance, Fates play in game X as evidence that I am scum in game Y.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3425206#p3425206\" class=\"postlink\">Nothing to vote over</a>? You have NO suspicions, and you feel that that was a scum move, then vote!

But whatever, if you felt he was lying about his gut read, then I suppose there isn't much else I can say here.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3432893#p3432893\" class=\"postlink\">Another misrep...</a> The conversation went like this: &gt;is there any reason to think mute is town? &gt;is there any reason to think that mute is scum? &gt;if you can't see by now why there is, then you can't read.</li></ul> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Uh, not, it didn't. Firstly, read what really happened, everypony, before you judge this one. <br>\nSecondly, I picked a particular phrasing. Rather than attacking Zdenek for Ad Hom and not explaining what questions of his weren't answered. I attacked him for phrasing it like that. <br>\nThis is what you wanted me to point out:<br>\n&gt;Is there any reason to think mute is town? <br>\n&gt;yes. <br>\n&gt;YOU'RE A DUMBASS AND I HATE YOU <br>\nThis is what I did: <br>\n&gt;Is there any reason to think mute is town? <br>\n&gt;yes. <br>\n&gt;Well, it's too early to tell.<br>\n<br>\nEither that, or you think I'm misrepping monk, which, if I was, somehow, I was doing it in a favorable way. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Uh what? I'm not sure what you're saying here. How do you get \"YOU'RE A DUMBASS AND I HATE YOU\" which is full of emotion and ad hominem from \"I'm pretty sure that you can't read at this point, and since you're probably town, that's huge shame.\" In fact, how did you get \"Well, it's too early to tell\" from that? My mind is blown; Do you realize that he was saying that monk can't read if he can't see why Mute is scum? Probably because Zdenek had been posting dirt on Mute throughout the last few pages.</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3433222#p3433222\" class=\"postlink\">Several issues here</a>: The fact that if Hiraki is scum that he'll keep dropping scum tells is irrelevant because that is true for EVERY scum, and is not a reason to not vote him at all. Secondly, you out Hiraki as likely PR, which is a bad thing to do from a town perspective. It's anti-town no matter how you paint it. Oh and you vote Zdek again; whatever happened to that meta of him being like you as town? Thrown out the window now that the wagon is getting full and you can jump on the mislynch?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, not necessarily. scum don't always drop scumtells, Hiraki has a kind of strong personality, and I guess he always drop scumtells to try to stay alive. <br>\nI pointed out that he may be a PR, and again, this is his playstyle. He acts like he's a PR trying to avoid getting NKed. If he didn't want to be thought of that way, he'd change his playstyle? (Since it IS his playstyle, it's not outting him any more than outting him as a likely PR in any other game he's played up to this point. I'm outting his playstyle and what it looks like.) <br>\nDidn't you discredit my meta of him being like me as town? Furthermore, scroll up on that page. Zden does some more scummy stuff and I re-vote him. The wagon is no more full than before. When I unvoted, the wagon went from 5 votes to 4 votes, when I revoted, the wagon went from 4 votes to 5 votes. In that part at the very least, you're making up stuff to say I'm scummy. Call me a fencesitter, wishy-washy, but it's not like his wagon grew 10 feet since I unvoted. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Okay, first of all, do you even know what it was the Zdenek was because accused of on that page? It was that he was saying people were scummy, but not voting them. The exact same thing that you've been doing all out this game. Only difference is that Zdenek had his vote in a credible spot the whole time he was doing that; he was actively scumhunting. Second of all, it doesn't matter if I think your meta is silly, because you did not think that, and it is your actions we are examining here. Thirdly, why would he drop scumtells to stay alive when dropping scumtells would further his death (hiraki)? How do you know it is his playstyle to act like a PR? How do you know that he wasn't actually a PR? Do you think that he assumes that town would not do something anti-town like try to out a PR?</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy response is in the green.", "time": "Sun Nov 20, 2011 6:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18987&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "18987"}

I agreed \"that I don't think monk is a good enough player to think that far ahead.\" I didn't say monk was a scum read. (Looking back, Friend's original post on this was because he didn't believe monk's \"trap\" was really a trap. I honestly don't currently remember my stance on that. Please, forgive me, it's been years and years.) <br>\n<br>\nThen, Friend and whispersilk were bickering, and I said, \"Friend's right,\" and Voted Whispersilk, something that Friend hadn't done. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">If monk could not think far ahead enough to where he could realistically set a trap, then the trap was fake. If he faked the trap and made up some excuse to vote in a blatant lie, he is most certainly scummy. I think it is safe to say that your stance on this was that you agreed that monk faked the trap. Yet... no vote.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Okay. That's a good point, I don't know why I didn't vote for him. You're right, and I don't know what happened. +1 point to you.</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3412889#p3412889\" class=\"postlink\">Bad post</a>. Implies that twisting is not a scum tell and then answers a question directed at empking, not her. One which was asked by Whisper, in case you're wondering.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, implies that Friend was twisting from, \"nervous and sarcastic\" to \"paraphrased and sarcastic,\" exactly like I said in that post. I also said that changing the tone of a post to fit one's claims is sometimes okay. I stand by that. I do it later (in your case against me, no less!) and here, I didn't feel Friend had changed the tone to one that was non-representative of monk's original posts. Friend condensed it, nothing worse. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">**</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Okay, lets quickly review what happened.<br>\nFriend said that monk said :\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">LOL it was a trap Empking I've caught you as scum</div>\"<br>\nTo quote monk..:\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I set a trap, I didn't think you'd be the one to set it off, disappointing empking</div>\"<br>\nIn Friends' version there are two things we note that are different: Instead of a more calm, perhaps controlled tone (nervous wtf?) we get a more erratic and slang-versed tone. Also, \"i've caught you as scum\" is jumping to the conclusion that monk felt that empking was surely scum from that 'trap'. Do you still stand by your original decree that it was a modest change?</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Hm... Yeah.... yeah. Even when you bring it back up with quotes and stuff, I don't think he changed the tone or meaning. \"I set a trap, I didn't think you'd be the one to set it off\" is the same thing as \"I've caught you as scum.\" Actually, in monk's version, there's also the unspoken \"you're my partner and I wish you hadn't set off my trap,\" but Friend doesn't include that. <br>\nFriend's version is jumping to the conclusion that monk felt Empking was scum from that trap-- monk <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> voting Empking. Haven't you been telling me to vote for scumreads? Whom else should you vote for? If you vote for scum-reads, and monk was voting, then yes, it could easily be inferred, that monk thought Empking was scum. <br>\nI don't think Friend made a major change. I support my previous answer. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413093#p3413093\" class=\"postlink\">Friend single handedly gets <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> to unvote</a> off of Whisper, but then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whisker</div> proceeds to not vote anyone else, not even Ashblade, who her great friend Friend wants to kill.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">In short, was a pressure vote. Should I have voted somepony else after? Ashblade wasn't a strong case, I didn't vote him. Luckily, TK presented a great spot for my vote in like, the very next post. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Well the idea is that you vote who is most scummy. Ashblade case not being strong early on is fine because it is simply that; early in the game. If you gave credence to it, I'd expect you to vote Ashblade. TK's next post is irrelevant.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">But I didn't give credence to it and I didn't vote for him. So...? <br>\nAlso, an point in your original argument here is that even after I unvoted Whipsersilk, I didn't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Re</div>vote anypony. I did in my next post (I voted TK), so that's incorrect. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413471#p3413471\" class=\"postlink\">So whisper is town because she's new</a>, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> is just a month older than Whispers, and claims to not be a noob. Her RVS theory link is bad because she isn't even doing it right and is completely missing the point. Then says she wants to lynch Monk, but how does that make any sense? First off, her vote is on ThKoopa. Second off, this post has NOTHING to do with monk at all. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I was justifying my removal of vote from whispersilk. It wasn't a particularly hard or serious vote. I wasn't incredibly trusting of Friend's reasoning (\"she's flail-town\"), so I was justifying it to myself. ((I know, I know, this was in response to ZDenek's post, but I didn't really know why she was town either.)) My reasoning? Friend's: She's flail-town, and Mine: she's newish, and I'm in RVS. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I also am more experienced (I think) Than Whispersilk, but not on this site. </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\"><br>\n<br>\nI'm not doing WHAT about RVS righT? I'm missing WHAT point? IT was a link I had found just a few days before, (or maybe even that day), I posted it because it was great. ((btw, thank you for helping me find it again)) But how am I completely missing the point? <br>\n<br>\nI say \"I want to lynch monk.\" I was pursuing him on a line of questioning. I was scumhunting, even in RVS, which tied in to what I said before. <br>\nOther than that, idk why I was mentioning monk here. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Town don't need to overjustify something like an unvote. If you felt you were still in RVS, then you shouldn't need to do that. You just made up some excuse not to vote her. By the way, I am not going to go into detail here, but you are not following what TSQ necessarily wanted to happen with the actions you took. Post-Game I will though.</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><br>\nI said here that I was justifying it to myself. My vote for whispersilk wasn't for strong reasons in the first place, my unvote wasn't strong, but then somepony came along and actually asked <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> she was town. I tried to kind of explain it-- it also was reason why I was unvoting so easily. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413751#p3413751\" class=\"postlink\">Will wait to judge Hiraki until whisper flips</a> which is a bit strange because <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> is voting ThKoopa. In fact <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> thinks that Whispers is town, so how long does Whiskers plan to wait?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\"><br>\nSo? <br>\n...what's your point here?</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Well... if you are waiting to judge X until Y dies, and according to how you feel now, you don't want Y to die any time soon, you are basically submitting to never judge X for possibly till endgame. If you need to kill Whisper to read Hiraki, and you have no idea why Whisper is town, then vote whisper. Otherwise, try to read Hiraki as is. Going \"well, until Y dies.. not much I can do\" just looks like scum coming up with an excuse not to read a slot and make life easier on themselves.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFBF00\">One of Hiraki, whispersilk, or me would eventually die, therefore solving the whole problem. I was in no rush, and I was basing a part of my read on him, on her. <br>\nIt was the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">only</div> part of my read, at the time.

Regardless, reads Ashblade town purely for having content.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Okay, well, I read four of them. #4 and #5 are walls. I read Ashblade as town for having content... doesn't that make sense? it makes sense to me. Posts without content are scummy; see chkflip. Therefore, on the flip side, posts full of content (not filler) are townny. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">If the inverse of all scumtells are town tells, then you get weird shit. For instance, it is a commonplace mafia tell that if one scumslips, they are scum. On the flipside however, if one does not scumslip, that is not a town tell; it is a null tell. Another example? Mafia are likely to be the ones who to mess up a PR plan. Does that mean that everyone who follows the PR plan is more likely to be town? No, not at all, it is a null tell, just like content.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Okay, but let's take it by a case by case basis-- actually, no, I have a better argument: <br>\n\"not committing a scumtell\" is not the same as \"doing the opposite of a scumtell.\" <br>\n&gt;It is commonplace that if one scumslips, they are scum. But if one <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">townslips</div>? Alright, you may say, but what is really a \"townslip\"? Can I change it to tells? If one \"scumtells\" they are scum? If one \"towntells,\" they are town? Since I have to change the argument to make this one work, I'll move on to the next one. <br>\n&gt;Mafia are likely to mess up a PR plan. <br>\n&gt;Townies are more likely to aid a PR plan. -- you actually say this is not true, but I disagree. <br>\n^^Sorry, all of this is very SoC. Ugh. ask me to explain if you don't understand: [not doing something] is different from [doing the opposite of something]. <br>\n<br>\nThe simplest way I can explain my townread on Ashblade is: He provided higher amounts of content:noncontent than other players. Though you may say content =/= protown, You have to agree that (in most cases)  noncontent = antitown. Right? Ashblade was towny in comparison. <br>\n<br>\nWhy does \"the nature of the content\" matter? It's game-content.

It is, however, saying that, if I am sick of lurkers, and a player is not lurking, but posting content, I might be more inclined to favor them. I didn't back off, I didn't stop and say, \"Oh, yeah, well, I guess he's not a townread then,\" I just acknowledged that it might not be the best towntell, and I moved on. Ashblade remained a town read, and he remained a townread for that reason. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">A less strong town read, you sounded confident when you declared that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3416365#p3416365\" class=\"postlink\">Ashblade was not scum</a> and literally voted someone for the sake of voting with him. You backed down from that though; a backtrack doesn't have to be a 180, but a 50 degree shift is important still.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Just because I didn't fight him and say it was the best read ever and that he was stupid, I'm backtracking? (that was a misrep.) What should I have done? I acknowledged monk's point and kept my townread regardless and moved on. </div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3418783#p3418783\" class=\"postlink\">Doesn't defend against accusations of faking content</a>, instead points out that Ashblade isn't faking content, which was never implied from the preceding post.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">I dunno what happened here. Looking at my argument for the \"content is a towntell\" thing, though, maybe I was pointing out that they were using lack of content as a scumtell and this was the reverse of that. I really don't remember and hindsight is 20/20, but that's the best reason I can come up with now. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">That's called deflection, and that is what I thought you were doing.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">That may have been. But they were calling me scummy, accusing me of the opposite of what I was giving Ashblade towncred for. If they didn't think my tell on Ashblade was serious, I wasn't taking their tell on me seriously. </div> <br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421525#p3421525\" class=\"postlink\">Whiskers says she only has 1 read, and it is a town read on Ash</a>, AND that read is based off of having content, nothing more. Not what the content is, that is irrelevant!</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">There's another issue in this post, but I'll deal with the one you addressed: I had a townread on Ashblade for his posting of content (already discussed, I believe it's a valid towntell), I list whispersilk as nullscum here, I still don't like her from the Friend/WS fight, and then monk I had dealt with-- I just didn't have any strong reads one way or another. You all think ashblade was a stretch-- I could have grasped for straws to look like I had some great reads, but I didn't grasp at straws, and I didn't have great reads. Why lie? </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">What other issue? First off, I'm nipping this \"scum wouldn't do this\" gimmick in the bud. Town wouldn't do this because town would be scumhunting and getting real reads, especially true for someone who is active like you. Also, if you believe that this isn't a valid scumtell (it most certainly IS), then why did you FoS ThKoopa for having a bunch of null reads? He could have made up reads if he wanted to at the time of your posting. You definitely only expressed 1 read which you need to hold any commitment to in that post.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">So? I FoS'd Koopa for having a bunch of nullreads in a post which was ten feet long. Here I (pretty clearly, I think) said, \"I only have this one read, none of my other reads are very good either.\" <br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">I'm going to tell you what I think, and it may not be true, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">iirc</div> I was fairly busy and my other games didn't need me to really think hard, unless this was at the same time as the last few Days in Mini 1234, in which it took a LOT of my time and I spent the time there, not here. </div><br>\nI simply didn't put much effort into this game at that point. I was lazy. I waffled on most of the players, and didn't hunt hard or collect any great reads, or pursue scum. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421838#p3421838\" class=\"postlink\">Asking for explanations of town reads on oneself</a> which is generically bad play. Honestly I'm confused. There is so much wrong with this ISO that people haven't pointed out, I feel like I'm missing something.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">How is that bad play? Are you making up theory just to condemn me? I'm not allowed to question it? Gee, mafia should buddy town players all the time, they're not allowed to question it! Am I getting this right? <br>\nI asked Zden (as an afterthought, perhaps), as monk had asked him a post or so earlier -- a request which Zden had ignored. <br>\nBut there was Mute, who said this: <br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3419041#p3419041\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3419041#p3419041\" data-post-id=\"3419041\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 167</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14598\">Mute</a> wrote:</cite>Whiskers and Empking are my stronger town-reads, and I've my eye on Friend. Everyone else is in the middle.</div></blockquote> I at least gave reasoning for my town reads. I didn't have many reads, but I had explained mine. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">I'm fairly sure that the idea is that you don't explain townreads (unless they directly conflict with your scum reads) as it gives mafia information that doesn't help find out who is scum. If scum know what you find to be townie, then they can manipulate you and you might not even realize it. But, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lets ask and see how the other players in the game feel on this subject</div>, as I was not expecting you to challenge that, and this is an axiom I learned on this site.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">It does find who is scum. I find it's nice to explain everything because otherwise there is the opportunity to be buddying badscum who declares a townread on a known town player, so when the flip rolls around, they say, \"see, see, I told ya!\" This is possible even with a reason, but with a reason, it's not <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">for no reason,</div> which means fake (which means scum). <br>\nIf you weren't expecting me to challenge this, why did you bring it up? </div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3423245#p3423245\" class=\"postlink\">Can someone spell</a> opportunistic scum?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Can somepony spell refusing to answer questions?</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">The worse part about that post is that later on, when he says he'll answer the questions, you go on to refuse him. You are condemning him and offering no chance of redemption.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">No. The scumtell was not answering questions. I didn't really care one way or another what the answers were, but I'd assume Mute did, since he asked them. The tell was, \"imma be a jerk and not answer questions,\" and \"im so sorry ill answer anything now just dont kill me plzzzzz!\" didn't fix it. </div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424063#p3424063\" class=\"postlink\">You can't remember the post</a> that made you 100% have a strong scum read on Zdenek as opposed to your massive null reads not too long ago? Are you actually scumhunting?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Let's start here: When was I 100% sure of something? I don't even know what you're referencing here-- you're making this up? Putting words into my mouth? I didn't say anything here about not remembering a post...? or about having a 100% strong scum read on Zden. <br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> saying that Friend looked scummy for resisting the Zden wagon and hunting lurkers instead. There you go, me acquiring reads. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">That's not what I meant. I meant that that post was 100% the reason that you voted Zdenek. It was what caused your vote. You had him null before, then that post happened, then he was your top scum read. What % scum you felt he was is arbitrary, because you are likely to remember a very recent post that caused your vote. Especially considering zdenek immediately asked about 'which questions' you wanted answered in mutes' post.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Like I said, it wasn't about the answers, but about the presence of the answers. <br>\nIf what % scum I felt he was is arbitrary, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why did you bring it up here?</div> <br>\nI bandwagoned onto Zden (not looking back, just assuming the worst), then looked through his iso and made a case. That is the scummiest way you can construe it. scumtell? idts...</div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424270#p3424270\" class=\"postlink\">Says zdek is being uncooperative</a> while in a conversation with him in which he is trying his best to cooperate with you. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Fuck, whatever, sure, MAYBE with ME. But I'm calling him out on going, \"fuck this, you're a jerk and I'm not answering your questions\" to Mute. UNCOOPERATIVE. Right? </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">So then you should have realized he had a personal despite not unlike the one you had with Monk. And even if he didn't, you stated that you found him to be most suspicious for not answering those questions. Zdenek saw that, and wondered what questions which he did not answer made you feel that way, so he could answer them. That is not at all unreasonable; you condemned him without trial, so to speak.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">I said I had \"a personal despite\" with monk. And that was Out-of-game. <br>\nHe said \"You're bad and I won't answer your post.\" <br>\nHe was suspicious for, and maybe I need to clarify: He was suspicious for refusing to answer questions, not for not answering questions. By the time I called him out for it, the damage had been done, he had already said, \"I'm not answering your questions.\" <br>\nUnderstand yet? </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424296#p3424296\" class=\"postlink\">Let the record show</a> that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> finds bad play scummy, and also somehow finds asking if there is a miller scummy. Overall, enough reason to vote; but it begs the question, why wasn't he a scum read at all earlier on? All of these posts are after the post where <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Whiskers</div> has no scum reads. And she just pulls them out of her pocket with no indication of them when she voted.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">First: I find bad play scummy, I find asking about a miller scummy-- so? what does a miller have to do with anything? Does that make me scummy, or are you just pointing it out for fun? He wasn't a scum read earlier on because I wasn't focusing and hadn't done an iso or a case or anything yet. You keep pointing out how vague and readless I am -- and I am. I am until I go and do the ISOs to please monk.  <br>\n<br>\nSecond: Because I pulled them out of an ISO, not my pocket. I went and found more reasons to be voting her-- I guess that's what you're saying is scummy? I voted her for the matters at hoof, then I built a case. <br>\nActually, looking back, I'd put it like this: \"Opportunistic case-building.\" Looks like I took the biggest wagon and expanded the case on it. <br>\nI felt Mute was in the right, I didn't have a vote out (I think?), and I voted against the other guy. Similar, in a sense, to my vote on whispersilk, except that this player already had a large wagon on him. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Fair enough, you didn't notice. I must ask what you find scummy about asking if there is a miller in the setup; I will also ask if you honestly believe that it is okay not to have reads until someone asks you to ISO everyone.</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">The miller thing-- did I make a big deal about this? I don't remember it. Anyway, there was a thing in another game. It could be considered trying to out a cop or something, I don't know. There was another game where there was a miller and it was weird that somepony would ask for miller claims here. Trying to get your friends to claim miller? maybe the cop, trying to eliminate targets? maybe somepony looking for an easy lynch or something. idk. There was no reason for him to believe there was a cop, it would be like if I said, \"Hmmm, Junpei, do you think there is a Serial Killer in this setup? There's no reason for us to think so, but do you think so?\" <br>\n<br>\nAnd no, it wasn't really acceptable for me to not have reads like I did. I have excuses for you, but the truth is, I should have put more effort into the game without having to be asked. </div><br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3424542#p3424542\" class=\"postlink\">Lol? Unvotes again</a> but this time because Zdek sounds like she does when she is town who is being pressured? That's bad play, you can't use meta of two different people interchangeably. What makes this particularly bad is that you made a case against him, and he is your only recorded scum read, and you're going back on it because of this. Backtrack more off of town.</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Why can't I use two metas interchangably? You can apparently use scumtells for all players, you can use towntells for all players-- let's put it like this: Acting the way in which Zden was acting, I felt like it was a town tell (like I act when cornered town). Universal across the board, right? Good thing I'll call it a tell now, instead of meta. <br>\nYeah, I did make a case. I also get cases made against me as town. What am I supposed to say here? </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Okay, then tell me why town are considerably more likely to act as he did (explain how he acted as well) as opposed to scum? As for not using two peoples' meta interchangebly, it is because mafia/town tells are things done that the broad spectrum of mafia roles and town roles are more susceptible to do. Meta tells are different; they are things that a certain player is likely to do as a certain alignment. You can't take, for instance, Fates play in game X as evidence that I am scum in game Y.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Firstly, you are incorrect because I can say that he was being a VI in a position similar to my VI play. It looked like me. <br>\nNow, aren't tells just a generalized meta? \"Mafia don't like to No-Kill\" gives us the idea that doctor-protects are cleared. \"Not knowing the setup is town\" is something that a town-aligned player did once, and then another one did, and the shared archmeta says that usually, a town-aligned player is less likely to pay attention to the setup. <br>\n<br>\nIn this case, it was, \"VIs are more likely to act wild and try to be everywhere.\" His post previous to my unvote showed him trying to defend and reconcile really concisely and quickly. I remember my VI play as being-- whan I am caught town, I try to throw out last minute cases and all my real suspicions and help my faction in any way possible before I die. <br>\nThat's one reason I hate players who get almost-lynched and say, \"welp, fuck you.\" Either they are scum, or they are bad people and I hate them personally. That's why I hate players like Hiraki (not as much), Empking (not as much), chkflip (but apparently only this game), and the way Nopony Special acted at L-2 (but not L-1, for some reason). They actively try NOT to help their factions. It's like, \"gee, I could help my faction, but I'm going to try hard NOT to.\" <br>\nZdenek didn't do that. He was New, and he was flailing, and I thought he looked like noobtown for it. My read on him in any direction wasn't very strong, so I unvoted. <br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3425206#p3425206\" class=\"postlink\">Nothing to vote over</a>? You have NO suspicions, and you feel that that was a scum move, then vote! You are just spreading seeds of suspicion everywhere without backing any of it up or committing. </li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Again, this is me being transparent. I'm telling monk how I read it. I'm saying, \"This looked like this to me.\"</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">** Remember the part where I said it's okay to change the tone of a post to prove a point?

At my old site, I'd always get townreads from players when I was scum.

He should also be willing to play the game. <br>\nIf... Zden is scum, what would keep Friend from trying to distract attention from him? Or even if Zden was town? This was Friend buddying Zden and trying to move a wagon off of him -- <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">to a lurker</div>.

But whatever, if you felt he was lying about his gut read, then I suppose there isn't much else I can say here.</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">I understand the importance of not voting randomly. I don't have any strong reads, or any reads at all, so I don't vote. I wasn't doing any fishing with my votes either. <br>\nI threw out some weak votes, and then drew them back in, because they were weak votes, and what's the point? <br>\n<br>\nI think that his gut read, if he is town, was based on Omgus. I think that his Omgus, if he is scum, was called a \"gut read\" because he had nothing else. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3432893#p3432893\" class=\"postlink\">Another misrep...</a> The conversation went like this: &gt;is there any reason to think mute is town? &gt;is there any reason to think that mute is scum? &gt;if you can't see by now why there is, then you can't read.</li></ul> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Uh, not, it didn't. Firstly, read what really happened, everypony, before you judge this one. <br>\nSecondly, I picked a particular phrasing. Rather than attacking Zdenek for Ad Hom and not explaining what questions of his weren't answered. I attacked him for phrasing it like that. <br>\nThis is what you wanted me to point out:<br>\n&gt;Is there any reason to think mute is town? <br>\n&gt;yes. <br>\n&gt;YOU'RE A DUMBASS AND I HATE YOU <br>\nThis is what I did: <br>\n&gt;Is there any reason to think mute is town? <br>\n&gt;yes. <br>\n&gt;Well, it's too early to tell.<br>\n<br>\nEither that, or you think I'm misrepping monk, which, if I was, somehow, I was doing it in a favorable way. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Uh what? I'm not sure what you're saying here. How do you get \"YOU'RE A DUMBASS AND I HATE YOU\" which is full of emotion and ad hominem from \"I'm pretty sure that you can't read at this point, and since you're probably town, that's huge shame.\" In fact, how did you get \"Well, it's too early to tell\" from that? My mind is blown; Do you realize that he was saying that monk can't read if he can't see why Mute is scum? Probably because Zdenek had been posting dirt on Mute throughout the last few pages.</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">\"You can't read\"? Obviously, the players in this game are capable of reading. \"You can't read\" is the same as, \"You're an idiot.\" So, it reads as, \"You're an idiot (ad hom) and since you're probably town (buddying), that's a shame. (filler)\" It's saying, \"since oyu don't agree with me, you're stupid.\" It also calls him town, which is similar to saying, \"You want to be my friend, don't you?\" <br>\n<br>\n\"You're stupid, but you don't want to be stupid, right? So agree with me, then you will be smart!\" <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI get, \"It's too early to tell\" from, \"at this point.\" Instead of going the route of, \"You're so stupid you can't read,\" <br>\nI went with the idea that, \"You don't think he's scum? Well, you can't read at this point, so of course not.\" <br>\nAsk for more detail. </div><br>\n<br>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3433222#p3433222\" class=\"postlink\">Several issues here</a>: The fact that if Hiraki is scum that he'll keep dropping scum tells is irrelevant because that is true for EVERY scum, and is not a reason to not vote him at all. Secondly, you out Hiraki as likely PR, which is a bad thing to do from a town perspective. It's anti-town no matter how you paint it. Oh and you vote Zdek again; whatever happened to that meta of him being like you as town? Thrown out the window now that the wagon is getting full and you can jump on the mislynch?</li></ul><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">No, not necessarily. scum don't always drop scumtells, Hiraki has a kind of strong personality, and I guess he always drop scumtells to try to stay alive. <br>\nI pointed out that he may be a PR, and again, this is his playstyle. He acts like he's a PR trying to avoid getting NKed. If he didn't want to be thought of that way, he'd change his playstyle? (Since it IS his playstyle, it's not outting him any more than outting him as a likely PR in any other game he's played up to this point. I'm outting his playstyle and what it looks like.) <br>\nDidn't you discredit my meta of him being like me as town? Furthermore, scroll up on that page. Zden does some more scummy stuff and I re-vote him. The wagon is no more full than before. When I unvoted, the wagon went from 5 votes to 4 votes, when I revoted, the wagon went from 4 votes to 5 votes. In that part at the very least, you're making up stuff to say I'm scummy. Call me a fencesitter, wishy-washy, but it's not like his wagon grew 10 feet since I unvoted. </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF40\">Okay, first of all, do you even know what it was the Zdenek was because accused of on that page? It was that he was saying people were scummy, but not voting them. The exact same thing that you've been doing all out this game. Only difference is that Zdenek had his vote in a credible spot the whole time he was doing that; he was actively scumhunting. Second of all, it doesn't matter if I think your meta is silly, because you did not think that, and it is your actions we are examining here. Thirdly, why would he drop scumtells to stay alive when dropping scumtells would further his death (hiraki)? How do you know it is his playstyle to act like a PR? How do you know that he wasn't actually a PR? Do you think that he assumes that town would not do something anti-town like try to out a PR?</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Okay, first of all, Zdenek was being accused of voting for a player who he said was scummy for meta <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">instead</div> of who he thought was scummy for in-game stuff. I didn't have a meta case on somepony, so I wasn't voting for it while calling other players scum. In fact, I wasn't really calling other players scum a whole lot either. <br>\nMy read on Zden was weak. little things here and there and I voted and unvoted. Yes. I flip-flopped. Cool one minute and lame the next. <br>\n<br>\nThridly, that's how Hiraki plays. HE plays in this way all the time. I have never seen him play another way. I don't remember if I had another game with him or something, I think I did. Look at his meta. He is often uncooperative and Snarky. He hasn't been evil this game (like chkflip and NS), but he still played normally. <br>\n<br>\nActually, scratch that, I'm absolutely sure I played with him in at least one other game. now: <br>\n<br>\ndropping scumtells doesn't farther his death. He looks scummy and scum doesn't kill him, but stays on the edge so that when scum (or town, for that matter) tries to make a case against him, there really isn't anything there. He's a very careful player. He doesn't drop scumtells, but he always looks like he might be lynched the next day. <br>\nIt's his playstyle because he plays like that. I don't know he's not actually a pr. He always plays like that. Maybe he assumes town wouldn't try to out a PR, Idk. Since he wasn't a PR, he probably didn't mind me calling him one, as it let him, a vt, draw the NK. </div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy response is in the green. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">And mine orange. </div></div></blockquote><br>\nSorry, NS.

Friends' version expresses far more confidence in the scumread than in monks' version is the problem... and the unspoken \"you're my partner and I wish you hadn't set off my trap\" is completely ridiculous, can you at least admit that?<br>\n<br>\n4. I just am of the opinion that at any given point, you should be voting your top scum read, so your periods of not voting to me indicate that you have no legitimate suspects. I see no reason not to think this, and therefore find it suspicious. <br>\n<br>\n5. Nothing for me to say here, I mean, people reading this will have to decide if that is just your personality (I'm not even sure how to describe that) or if you scumtelled. I honestly don't know at this point; it's not that you're bad, it's just that you are acting so completely different than anything I would expect from a competent player like you.<br>\n<br>\n6. This is bad too... like it's bad, and I can't argue it anymore other than to say that your point here is scummy. I mean it is flawed, and there's no way you should be content to go \"meh, hiraki and whisper may be scum, but i'll know later, so no biggie!\". I'm at a loss that you are so upfront about this.<br>\n<br>\n7. First off, you made the vote; I don't care if you painted a picture of picasso and then voted scum in your next post; you voted for monk and that is all that matters here. You 100% sheeped Ashblade, and that is called bandwagoning, that isn't how bandwagons normally form; you sheeped for the sake of just going with another player. Also.. \"I waffled to come off of the bandwagon, so your #1 negates your #2.\" that is so ridiculous... but this makes me suspect you less because it is such awful logic that it explains some things; particularly you don't look at the world in a similar way as me at all how I assumed. But regardless, the issue here is that waffling does not negate the bandwagoning. You waffled such that you bandwagoned. Even if you waffle off of the wagon, you still committed bandwagoning, and that does not erase with time.<br>\n<br>\n8. Okay, you have a point here, BUT: I believe that the content verus no-content is an exception to the rule which you provided (anti-scumtell = town-tell).<br>\n<br>\n9. I felt that you were moving from \"Wow, Ashblade is very town\" to \"yeah.. maybe ashblade isn't so town as I thought\", which is backtracking to a degree.<br>\n<br>\n10. Wow, that is frustrating to read. I once again don't know if you're serious or not. Ugh; point over, you deflected to 'prove a point that your tell is legit' by using your rule which has an exception, which is the point you were trying to prove!<br>\n<br>\n11. This isn't going anywhere; nothing I can say to that anyway.<br>\n<br>\n12. I expected you to concede to the point; I brought it up to show why I thought you were scum. As for the explaining town tells thing (my whole point), you win; I can't argue that you don't believe that it is a good idea to ask town tells of oneself. Generally though it is thought that if you ask how someone views you as town, you are worried about how you are received, and how you can act and appear to be town; which town shouldn't care about.<br>\n<br>\n13. WOW. So you admit that once an action is committed, it does not matter what happens immeditely afterward, as it is already done? Then how can you argue with me in number 7? I think I win 7; you can have 13 (by the way I'm not keeping track of points as a means to judge you)<br>\n<br>\n14. Another frustrating read... There were no answers, so there was no presence of the answers! It is the QUESTIONS to which 'mutes post' is of. That is what you were asked of, and that is what you forgot about. % scum is arbitrary because whether he is 90% scum to you or 40% scum doesn't matter because THE QUESTIONS CAUSED 100% OF WHY YOU THOUGHT HE WAS SCUM AT THE TIME.<br>\n<br>\n15. Sure, at this point, I'm not going to argue the same point over again.<br>\n<br>\n16. Okay.. but there was no way in hell he was trying to signal someone to claim Miller.. but whatever, this isn't worth wasting time on and we need to move on.<br>\n<br>\n17. Okay; fair enough.<br>\n<br>\n18. No, you are caught in this point; you should have voted here and you didn't.<br>\n<br>\n19. SO IT IS SCUMMY; POINT OVER<br>\n<br>\n20. Why is this answer different than 12?<br>\n<br>\n21. Well Friend thought he was scum flying under the radar without pressure, but whatever I can't argue this.<br>\n<br>\n22. Not bothering to argue this either, don't care enough about this point.<br>\n<br>\n23. I don't think it was meant to be that harsh, but whatever, you misread him.<br>\n<br>\n24. Ugh.
