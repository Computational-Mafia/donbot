On the one hand, she was saying she didn't like people voting without reason, then on the other hand she votes for you without much (any??) reasoning at all. Given your wagon was gathering pace (or so I thought), it stank of opportunistic voting. <br>\n<br>\nRe why I didn't jump on you? Partly the previous game experience I have mentioned, partly because I like to hang back a little more in the first few pages and watch behaviour (it identifies to me intention / where the angle of the game is being shifted in a neg-town way), partly because I simply had no reason to vote for you other than RVS, and to add speed to an RVS wagon isn't a very helpful move IMHO. I find RVS to be a very mixed bag, so I tend to stay out of it in favour of watching and seeing. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5962881#p5962881\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5962881#p5962881\" data-post-id=\"5962881\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 43</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11157\">KittyMo</a> wrote:</cite>I'm curious about what people think of her first post.

No.<br>\n<br>\nI genuinely considered ILF's vote on Kitty to be extremely opportunistic and very, very scummy.

Grib pointed out the townie \"slip\" and at first I was like \"oh god am I totally wrong?\" since last person I used that tell on was actually scum. However, last time that came up for me in a game the committer had 0 completed town games and so I was like \"welp that's kinda scummy and she's referred to an actual townie like that as scum before but not knowing whether you use that as a general term as town makes it an iffy tell.\" So I just ctrl+f'd all of Fairies's posts on MS with the word townie to see if she'd ever used that wording as town before; if not, obviously it'd have impacted my read on her. I think it's pretty fucking useful to know whether someone in past town games has used \"townie\" to refer to an unflipped person that they're actually suspicious of in the context of this; hence #86.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Octopus wrote:</cite> And why the 180 on Shinobi?</div></blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: your quotes of me</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965118#p5965118\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965118#p5965118\" data-post-id=\"5965118\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 86</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11157\">KittyMo</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nRe: Shinobi, he certainly didn't put much effort into defending Fairies so I'm not sure why that's the main thing being read into about him.

To me there's two things:<br>\n<br>\n1. Avoids hammering or pressuring ILF despite claiming ILF and Shinobi are scumbuddies. Persists on voting Shinobi despite the biggest reason being \"he jumped to ILF's defense\" -- while Boon isn't quite so heavy-handed as he acccuses Shinobi of being, isn't this sort of the same thing he's doing, by trying to distract attention away from ILF and onto another candidate? Even after finally going from \"ILF is highly likely scum\" in #81 to \"not really sure [about ILF]\" in #83, he still remains steadfast about trying to pressure Shinobi, while undermining his own argument (which is all predicated on ILF being scum in the first place!) (Note that he goes back to the scumbuddy argument in #98.) <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">There's two parts to this. One, if he's actually suspicious of ILF, and thinks Shinobi is her scumbuddy, why not keep the pressure up on ILF? She's obviously going to crack like a walrus if she's scum, and probably out her whole gang. Why switch to Shinobi there? Especially while promising to hammer ILF if necessary?<br>\n<br>\nAnd also, if you want to move pressure off of ILF and onto someone else, it's really easy here to make a better argument : That of Shinobi being scum who wants to look good by protecting a townie. Sticking to the scumbuddy theory is weird exactly BECAUSE he ends up destroying it himself, and is forced to \"let up\" on Shinobi when he finally sees it's getting him nowhere. </div><br>\n<br>\n2. The \"too townie\" read on Grib. I may be biased because to me it's obvious that Grib is town. But even if I was unsure, even if I was only 80% sure Grib was town, under no circumstance would I worry that my read was TOO townie. It reads as though Boon is willing to entertain some possibility that Grib is scum, if he hears other people are willing to follow that path. He does jump very quickly to the Oka wagon, but still doesn't have strong feelings of scumminess towards him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">And again, that's more because I just can't see any way Grib isn't town. Boon is less culpable of trying to figure out how Grib's role works, Oka and shiny are the biggest ones there, however.</div><br>\n<br>\nSo, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Shinobi</div>, what made you single out Boon over any of the other people we've been discussing?<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\naaaaaaand look what happens while I'm posting a text wall. The bjc wagon is a little ridiculous, don't you think? Say what you want about him being a horrible player (and I will), him screwing up and \"claiming\" isn't anything at all (as he's already shown he can't be trusted to act in the town's interest no matter which side he's on), and trying to get a wagon going on him because of it is ludicrous. ESPECIALLY OkaPoka, who \"wants to know how he was so confident in false claiming\" -- <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">there's absolutely nothing that so far indicates he IS false-claiming, and even if you want someone to step up and counterclaim him, WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THEY COUNTERCLAIM?</div> -- and I especially love the fact that not a mere six posts prior to that, he was hoping he could railroad Boon for the \"how do you know he's false claiming?\" <br>\n<br>\nMan I have never been so happy for my vote in a looooong time.", "time": "Mon Jun 23, 2014 3:47 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58162&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "58162"}

However, meta is a good way to get information to act on, especially on Day 1 when we have nothing else to go on other then people's posts. I'm pretty convinced that he is town now, though that opinion can always be reversed by additional information. <br>\n<br>\nAfter looking at BJC's posts, I think he's done a very good job at not saying anything at all. His posts are one-liners and generally just taking snarky cracks at people who attacked him. I think he's an okay lynch today, although I'm going to leave him unvoted for now to prevent mafia from jumping in and hammering. <br>\n<br>\nMy favored lynches at the moment are: <br>\n<br>\nBJC (He seems like a fairly good choice for reasons stated above and by others)<br>\nShinobi (I'm REALLY not a fan of \"I'm pretty content to be in the shadows\" in his 7th post)<br>\n<br>\nWe could also use today's lynch to test Grib's doublevote.

We can push our two most favored votes to L-1, and have Grib hammer them both. If he refuses, we can lynch one of the two without his help, then lynch him the next day if they come up scum. This would allow us to both confirm Grib's role as well as giving us twice as many chances of hitting scum. However, we also run the risk of losing two villagers right off the bat before night 1 even begins. <br>\n<br>\nI know it's a risky plan, but I believe that it's an idea worth considering.

If it's scummy to jump on a random band wagon then logically Boon was more scummy than Kitty.

I never said that Boon was not scummy at all, but the reason that I found him less so than Kitty at the time is because Kitty had already voted randomly, she voted Massive in her opening post. Switching that vote to me said to me that it was not a random vote (because why switch from one random vote to another one without even joke reasoning?).

He's a liability to the town<br>\n2. A bandwagon on me is still viable and I prefer the bjc bandwagon over my own (obviously)<br>\n3. I HATE how he plays and I honestly feel like people who refuse to contribute in games just so no one can get reads on them is against the spirit of the game and just makes the game worse and thus, should be policy lynched<br>\n4. His claim was obvscum to me. Let's look at his motivations for his claim:<br>\na. He's VT, maybe he's trying to redirect NKs to him. Why I think this is bullshit: because if a VT wants to redirect NKs to themself, they should act like an obvious TPR without going so far as to make it obvious that they're not a VT by claiming (because a TPR wouldn't claim so early because they don't want to die because TPRs are valuable)<br>\nb. He's TPR, maybe he was just trying to keep himself alive because he's aware that TPRs are valuable. Why I think this is bullshit: He was not close to being lynched. There was no need for him to do anything to keep himself alive besides maybe participate more. If he actually was TPR, he'd care about keeping himself alive enough to actually participate in the game to prevent a lynch on himslef.<br>\nc. He's some sort of role that benefits from being NKed, which would explain why he claimed TPR, because he was trying to make himself a target. Why I think this is bullshit: The correct play here would be to attempt to portray himself as a TPR without making it obvious that he's not actually a TPR (well, he would be in this case, but he wants the NK, so he's trying to get NKed). So basically, his actions should be what actions he would take as a VT. I don't buy this one bit.<br>\nd. He's scum, he wants everyone to back off of him and he knows he won't be NKed because he's the one doing the NKs. Why I'm now a little skeptical on this: if he's scum, he should be aware that his action was pretty stupid as both scum and town. If we assume he's intelligent, he shouldn't fall into the trap he made himself.<br>\ne. He's a jester, he wants to get lynched, and knows that making a play completely awful for town will get him lynched, especially if he was already a liability. Why I'm concerned about this: I hadn't considered this option prior to writing this all out. However, I don't know how likely a jester actually is, would someone with more experience tell me how likely it is we have a jester?<br>\n5. His overall lack of a defense makes me think that he honestly doesn't care. Maybe that's not alignment indicative, maybe this should fit into reason 1, but still, this point angers me.<br>\n6. I'm currently town reading everyone but him, and since he's the odd one out in this case, I don't know who else to vote. This is my fault though, I've been super busy recently and I haven't had the time to put as much effort into this game as I began to do in my previous two games (the two games before I was new and lost and didn't really contribute all too much [still more than bjc]). <br>\n<br>\nAlso, Grib, what do you think of the bjc wagon, besides \"lazy\"?", "time": "Tue Jun 24, 2014 2:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58162&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "58162"}

I don't care much about posting frequency (lurking can be for any number of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with the game at all). I care about content, and you haven't posted much of that at all. You don't need to post walls every post either, just post some reads or analysis. <br>\n<br>\nLiterally everyone is better after a lynch/daykill/whatever because it gives them something to react to and reevaluate their original reads with. That's no excuse for not trying. As a villager, I would rather see you post three to four reads (or analysis that's wildly off-base) and have every single one turn out wrong then have you sit there posting no reads and no analysis. When you post reads that later end up being incorrect, the village can analyze those reads, try to figure out your thought process, and maybe gain some information that could be useful to them. If you don't post any reads or analysis, then not only do you slow the village down in life, you prevent them from gaining information from your death. <br>\n<br>\n(the above, by the way, is why lurking is considered a scumtell by most mafia players)<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5971456#p5971456\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5971456#p5971456\" data-post-id=\"5971456\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 191</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23817\">OkaPoka</a> wrote:</cite>I ain't lurking.<br>\n<br>\nI am questioning and doing what I am asked.

Flavor is for entertainment purposes only and has nothing to do with the game state, or mechanics. Again, the flavor is solely for entertainment purposes.</div><br>\n<br>\nAs night descended each of our players went their own way. Some chose to lay low, waiting for daylight to break. Others decided that they wanted to control their own destiny and went looking for those who wish them dead. A few had much more devious plans for the evening. <br>\n<br>\nA warehouse stands at the edge of town, towering ominously over all that you can see. It is here that two of our players have crossed paths. Each man slowly walked towards the other, sizing up the other as they came closer and closer. It became quickly apparent that these men were not on the same side, and that only one of them would be walking out of the warehouse that night.<br>\n<br>\nWith a quickness that deceived the naked eye the two men begin to throw a flurry of fists, feet, elbows and knees. Neither man landed a blow; easily parrying the other mans attempts. Each man was as skilled as the other, and they both knew that this would not end quickly, or without a good amount of pain being inflicted on each combatant. One man ran towards the other but veered off at the last second. He launched himself into the air, running along the wall using it to propel him towards the other landing a solid kick to the opposition&#8217;s face, knocking out teeth and spraying blood into the air in a fine mist. The kick was followed up with a spinning backhand to the other side of the man&#8217;s face, spraying even more blood into the air. As the wounded man struggled to get his bearings his assailant wasted no time. Lashing out with a lightening quick kick to the inside of the leg the aggressor knocked the other man to the ground. Wobbling back and forth the man knew he had been beaten, but he refused to give the other the satisfaction of begging for his life. He knew that his struggle would only give hope to those who will miss him. He raised his head in defiance and saw the open palm coming up and in to crush his nose and push the cartilage into the brain killing him instantly. The other man muttered something under his breath that would understood to be a farewell to a worthy opponent.<br>\n<br>\nThe sun eventually rose, and not everyone was accounted for. The group split up and scoured the area to see where their missing members were. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Shinobi was found dead in the warehouse, beaten to a bloody pulp and laid out ceremoniously in obvious reverence.</div> While his death was being lamented by those who found him another group was making a commotion across town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">shinyskarmory had been found dead in an alley with his throat slit from ear to ear.</div><br>\n<br>\nShinobi, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Town 2-Shot Hider</div> was killed.<br>\n<br>\nShinyskarmory, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Vanilla Townie</div> was killed.<br>\n<br>\nDay starts now.<br>\n<br>\nWith 9 alive it will take 5 votes for a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nYour time starts now, and will last 14 days.<br>\n<span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2014-07-11 23:35:00)</span>", "time": "Fri Jun 27, 2014 5:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58162&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "58162"}

ILF in #183: One of the reasons to vote bjc is \"a bandwagon on me is still a possibility.\" At this point, ILF has one vote remaining on her (theelkspeaks) and there's one other viable bandwagon with some better-thought-out reasons than \"I don't like bjc's play style.\" If this is a legitimate concern, and you count it as a legitimate reason for voting for someone (I don't know that I do), why bjc over OkaPoka? In addition, all of her \"motivation\" points expect bjc to being playing in the town's best interests, which we already know he's not, and SHE knows he's not. <br>\n<br>\n6.

(Evidently it's the \"because gut\" post.) It's making me think two ways: <br>\n<br>\n(1) ILF, despite Boon saying otherwise, keeps getting scummier and scummier every time I reread. For example:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5964432#p5964432\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5964432#p5964432\" data-post-id=\"5964432\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 73</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23691\">I Love Fairies</a> wrote:</cite>Scummers really like to buddy up with town members so that when that town member flips town, the scummer looks good because he was associated with the member that flipped.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe first time I read it, she means it as a defense against why she wouldn't necessarily be scum if Shinobi is scum. In hindsight, I'm like, yeah, that's EXACTLY what you're doing in post #73 -- in reverse, though, by buddying up to Shinobi and saying his vote was \"probably RVS.\" <br>\n<br>\n(not to mention #73 now reads A LOT like ILF coaching Boon)<br>\n<br>\n(2) During Boon's initial Shinobi / ILF scumbuddy outing, Boon's reasoning for going after Shinobi and not ILF was essentially that ILF was scum (if and only if) Shinobi was scum. I still think normal behavior here is \"I think Shinobi and ILF are scummy, ILF is currently being bandwagoned, I don't care which goes first since they're both scummy, so I vote ILF.\" As Drew noted in #92, there's exactly four Shinobi posts at that point, none of which have much content, so it's hard to believe he's SO CONFIDENT in his Shinobi scum read that he'd refuse to consider other scum.<br>\n<br>\nBTW Boons:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965805#p5965805\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965805#p5965805\" data-post-id=\"5965805\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 98</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24184\">Boonskiies</a> wrote:</cite>@Drew  I was kidding about you being mafia.

But Shinobi had an ability that could potentially out scum (you know what a Hider does so I don't know why you're asking how a Hider could out scum?), but he was limited to 2 shots. It would be very, very stupid to use that ability with the full intention of keeping yourself alive, full stop. That would make more sense for a scum!Hider. He voted massive, promised to explain his vote later, but Oka was hammered out of nowhere. So if you want to talk about prior knowledge, I say it's very likely that Shinobi's target was massive. Shinobi died, which means he either targeted scum or shinyskarmory. It would appear to me it is much more likely he targeted massive.<br>\n<br>\nThere's always the chance that he Hid with shinyskarmory, but I doubt it. There's always the chance that there is a Serial Killer in this setup and they shot Shinobi, but I doubt it. There's always the chance that the moon is made of cheese, but I doubt it.<br>\n<br>\nMy guess is that the scumteam is trying to play it safe with the NK's, rather than getting rid of people who would be difficult to mislynch. shinyskarmory was a very safe kill.<br>\n<br>\nAre you suddenly afraid of lynching massive For Some Reason? You were sold on a massive/ILF scumteam a while back, no?<br>\n<br>\n@Drew-Sta<br>\n<br>\nBoonskiies/ILF scumteam? Maybe.

{"number": 456, "id": "6005778", "user": "Formerfish", "user_id": "21997", "content": "As the sun begins to set on the second day of conflict the town members take little solace in the fact that they have taken out one threat, knowing that more are still out there among them, hiding in plain sight. Of their original numbers, only eight remain. One town member breaks away from the rest of the group as darkness overtakes them, finding a need to be alone with his thoughts.<br>\n<br>\nThe man goes back to the warehouse and stands over the bloodstained floor, looking for any clue he could find that would help him in his search for those who wish harm to him, and his people. Looking over every inch of the space before dejectedly giving up, he finally goes on his way. Stopping in the alley for a moment to think about the other fallen town member he kneels down for a time saying a prayer under his breath. Suddenly a feeling arises in him and the buildings begin to close in on him, the residual heat from the streets becomes oppressive and breathing becomes more and more labored. Not knowing what to do, he looks around in a panic. Finally he spots something that he believes might help on multiple fronts.  Across town he sees a building that towers over the rest of the metropolis, dwarfing any other building around it.<br>\n<br>\nGradually making his way to his respite he thinks to himself that the building would be perfect for him to escape from the stifling streets, to get some fresh air, and to have a good vantage point to look over the city. As he is walking he hears a sound behind him, something that almost sounds like the scrape of a boot on the pavement. Turning around he sees nothing, and in the time he waits nothing presents itself to him. Straining his eyes in the dark to see, he convinces himself that he is just wound tightly, and there are no boogey men in the dark waiting for him and he moves on. Finally he reaches the building and makes his way to the top.<br>\n<br>\nThe view from the rooftop was stunning, and he was able to see for miles in each direction. He saw the warehouse, the alley and the area where the town members gathered during the day. Something begins to eat at him but he cannot pin it down. Circling around the edges of an idea he paces back and forth nearer to the edge than he realizes. A gust of wind blows hard and knocks him off balance. Stumbling, flailing his arms, he envisions his end coming from a simple gust of wind. However, he digs his heel into the gravel of the roof and finds purchase there. That was a close one, he thought. <br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately for him during the ruckus he failed to see the man in black slip out of the stairwell, and into the shadows. The man in black had been following him all night, keeping a good distance, well outside the man&#8217;s realm of observation. Once after they visited the alley he thought that he was caught when he miss-stepped and scraped his boot on the raised gutter. His heart had skipped many beats in the time he stood silent and stoic, waiting for the other man to resume his journey. His patience was well rewarded, getting the town member separated and completely alone. He watched as the other man stood on the edge of the roof, looking down at what could have easily been the fall that killed him. Without a sound the man in black crept up behind him, took hold of his collar and his belt, whispered something into his ear before throwing him clear over the edge. The man flipped over in the air and you could see the distress on his face, the last thing that ran through his mind before hitting the roof of the car below, blowing out all of the windows in a shower of glass, was &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know she had a brother.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Grib</div> was killed, he was the <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Town Doublevoter.</div><br>\n<br>\nWith 7 alive, it takes 4 votes for a lynch<br>\n<br>\nNot voting: theelkspeaks, bjc, Tattletale, Drew-Sta, Octopus, Boonskiies, Fat_Tony<br>\n<br>\nDay 3 begins now and will last 2 weeks.<br>\n<span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2014-07-23 22:45:00)</span>", "time": "Wed Jul 09, 2014 4:43 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58162&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "58162"}

We need to cover all bases so had to include it. <br>\n2. TT is genuinely mafia. We lynch, one mafia left, we work to get it right the next day and hopefully win the game. (This seems accurate, but has no team mate)<br>\n3. Boon is mafia with TT (which seems like a decent possibility) and they've been bouncing off each other a lot all game. Octo comes out with a Hail Mary investigation, and Boon is now bussing his partner to get towncred. (This one seems most likely - although I have found TT more affable and they have posted in a way I consider more town, I am still sus based off ILF's contribution.)

{"number": 529, "id": "6023964", "user": "Formerfish", "user_id": "21997", "content": "As another day is put to rest the town reflects on the lynching of one of their own. The men and women look at the faces left and wonder who among them really are to blame for the most recent loss. As their numbers dwindle the situation at hand becomes more and more dire, and scum needs to be found soon for the sake of the town. As the group begins to disperse and go to ground for another night Fat_Tony thinks that he sees a smile on one of the other group members faces. Confused by what he saw, Tony decides to follow the smiling player to see where they go, who knows maybe he will get lucky and find something out.<br>\n<br>\nSmiley walks off down an alley with Tony in close pursuit. Tony makes sure to stay to the shadows, using doorways to shield himself from view, and windows to get a better view while avoiding detection. Smiley doesn&#8217;t make things easy for Tony, multiple times he stops to light a cigarette, only to take a few drags off it look around and snuff the cigarette out beneath his shoe. Smiley used every move in the book to avoid detection. Doubling back on himself, stopping in front of shop windows to watch the people as they pass, walking against Don&#8217;t Walk signals. Tony knew that he had made the right choice to follow Smiley, for whatever reason he did not want anyone to know where he was going.<br>\n<br>\nIt felt like Tony had been following Smiley much longer than he actually had when Smiley turned a corner and was out of his sight for only a few seconds. Tony sped up to avoid losing his prey in the sea of people on the streets. Turning the bend Tony realized too late that this was exactly what Smiley was hoping for. Smiley had picked up the tail sometime before and was luring the man pursuing him closer and closer. The shocked look on Tony&#8217;s face was only changed by the punch thrown by Smiley that solidly connected with his chin. Seeing stars Tony could barely make out Smiley as they ran down the street. Taking every ounce of strength he had in him Tony rose to his feet and gave chase. <br>\n<br>\nTearing down the streets both of our players banged into pedestrians, knocking some to the ground, bouncing off others as they went. Tony ran with everything he had in him using the knowledge that if he lost sight of Smiley they would be in the wind for sure. Veering off of the sidewalk Tony jumped onto the hood of a car parked on the street and started to run on the hoods and roofs, gaining ground as he went. Smiley looked back and saw that Tony was quickly catching up to him, and ducked down the next alley that he came across. Tony followed him and saw that Smiley had turned into the first open door down the alley. Without a second thought Tony breached the doorway and found himself in the middle of a bustling kitchen filled with Chinese men, live chickens, smoke and open flames. The cooks were yelling in tongues that Tony could not understand, but he grasped the fact that they were yelling at Smiley who had just passed through into the dining room. Tony barreled through the men, catching hell from them as well, and entered the dining room. Smiley was there throwing tables out of his way as he moved towards the door. Running full speed out of the restaurant into the street Smiley ran right into traffic, jumping and sliding across the hood of a car that almost certainly would have ended his days. Tony had no second thoughts as he dodged the stopped vehicles keeping Smiley in his sights the entire time. <br>\n<br>\nSmiley ran down the alley in front of him, jumping onto a dumpster and launching himself into the air to grab hold of the raised ladder of the building&#8217;s fire escape. Using his weight Smiley was able to lower the ladder enough for him to climb onto the ladders rung and began climbing. Tony jumped onto the same dumpster and used the drain pipe on the wall to reach the fire escape. Only a flight behind Smiley, Tony redoubled his efforts taking the rungs two and three at a time. Smiley ducked into an open window and ran past a family at their dining room table eating a late supper. The family stopped in midsentence and stared at the commotion that interrupted their meal. A few seconds later Tony went by and the family had not moved, still staring in disbelief. Smiley was already at the fire door for the stairs and pushed the bar setting off a blare of lights and alarms. The door shut behind him and Tony knew that he would have to be more careful when approaching the door thinking that Smiley could be on the other side waiting for him to slip up again. Standing in front of the door Tony waited a second, and then one more before backing up to the wall behind him, dug his heel in and kicked the push bar as hard as he could. The door shot open revealing an open stair well. Tony looked over the railing and could see Smiley three flights below him. Jumping down entire half flights of stairs Tony made his way after his foe. <br>\n<br>\nWhen he got to street level and out the exit Tony did not immediately see his object of pursuit. Looking left he saw no sign of Smiley, looking right he caught a glimpse of the back of Smiley&#8217;s head as they ran down the entrance of the subway system. Tearing after them, Tony ran full speed into the subway tunnels. Tony was sure that he had Smiley cornered now and made his way to the platform where Smiley was assured to be. Tony looked over the platform and could not make out his quarry. Tony went to the edge of the inbound tracks and looked into the tunnel to see if Smiley had jumped onto the tracks trying to escape into the depths of the underground transit infrastructure. Seeing no signs of movement Tony went to the outbound side of the platform and looked to the left, and saw nothing. Looking to the right he only saw the lights of the oncoming subway car. Feeling dejected and confused Tony began to turn back towards the platform when he felt two hands firmly push him in the back. Before Tony could even register what had happened he became aware of the increasing glare of the lights from the subway car. Tony only had seconds to consider Smiley had somehow gotten behind him and caused this all to happen. Seconds slowed to a crawl and Tony saw his impending death with a Zen like clarity, seeing the light get brighter and closer to him before slamming into him, throwing him into the wall and crushing his skull beneath the train wheels and the rails. His death came so quickly that he was gone before the first scream was heard, and the person who caused it was not suspected in the least and was able to blend in with the crowd as they made their way steadily to the exit.<br>\n<br>\nFat_Tony has been killed, he was a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Vanilla Townie</div><br>\n<br>\nWith 5 players left alive, it takes 3 for a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nNot voting: theelkspeaks, bjc, Tattletale, Drew-Sta, Boonskiies<br>\n<br>\nDay 4 starts now, and will last 14 days.<br>\n<span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2014-07-31 00:30:00)</span>", "time": "Wed Jul 16, 2014 4:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58162&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "58162"}

{"number": 536, "id": "6029407", "user": "Formerfish", "user_id": "21997", "content": "For those still alive, the past few days and night have been hell on earth. Infighting, deceit, paranoia, murder and revenge have ravaged the town until it became a shell of its former self. Few temporary moments of happiness among the pain have allowed those who are left to find the strength to carry on and finish the job they set out to do, find fucking scum. Going into the night four players remain. Theelkspeaks, bjc, Drew-Sta, and Boonskiies are still alive and kicking. <br>\n<br>\nAs the day comes to a close the four remaining players sit around a blazing bonfire, remembering those they lost, drinking in their names, and cursing those who took the ones they cared about away. Names like massive and Tattletale are spoken with an obvious disdain, like being spit out when said. Knowing that there was one more scumbag between them left an uneasy tension hanging thick in the air. Most of them wondered if they would all be there come morning, one player knew that would not be the case. The final toasts were made, lingering goodbyes were said, and the players finally broke apart and went their separate ways.<br>\n<br>\nTheelkspeaks felt restless and chose to walk around the city to put his mind at ease. Walking down bustling streets feeling like he was completely separated from any of them, he tried to imagine how it what it must be like to be one of the uninformed. Ignorance truly is bliss, and if the people around him knew what was really going on in their city they would curl up in their beds and pray for the end. Families, couples, dirtbag teens loitering in convenience store parking lots, joggers, barflies all of them oblivious to the violence that was about to erupt in the streets. <br>\n<br>\nElk felt an electricity flowing through the air that threatened to light the night aflame. Glancing around Elk saw nothing noticeably out of order, and he continued on his way. When Elk started walking again he saw a reflection in the window of one a parked car of a man slipping out of a dark doorway, following him at a distance. Adrenaline pumped into Elks system, heightening his senses, putting a quicker step into his pace. It would have been unnoticeable a minute prior, but now Elk was able to hear the safety being taken off of a pistol. Elk took one more step before ducking behind the bumper of a mini van parked in the row of cars. As soon as he had ducked down a shot rang out, and the side mirror of the car behind him exploded. <br>\n<br>\nElk knew this was his time. One of them was going to die and fuck if it was going to be him. Elk drew his own handgun, a Shield M&amp;P, from the small of his back. The .40 caliber weapon held eight shots including one in the chamber, which should be enough for any trained owner. Elk took the safety off his own weapon, pulled back the slide to see the gun was fully loaded, peered around the back of the vehicle and took a shot in the direction he had last seen the mystery man. One.  Hearing the shot ricochet off the brick wall of the closest building he knew that he did not connect with anything. Elk let himself linger for a second franticly looking for his query without any luck. Taking cover just in time another shot was taken at him, hitting the body of the van he was behind. Lowering himself into a laying postion in the street, looking from under the van Elk pulled the trigger twice more trying to flush the other man out. Two, three.  Not seeing any movement Elk took off running towards the now abandoned convenience store, hoping to find better cover there. Pointing the pistol behind him as he ran he fired another shot blindly. Four. Running for his life Elk quickly covered the distance to the open door of the store. As he entered more shots rang out and the plate glass panel of the door shattered behind him. Elk quickly took stock of his surroundings. Coolers on the left, cash register on the right, fire exit in the back. Crawling he made his was out of sight from the outside of the store and went to the fire exit. Chained. Fucking great. Looking behind him he knew that going back out the front was not an option, and without any other windows he had to make due with the door in front of him. Elk took aim and fired twice, breaking the lock of the chain. Five, six. Kicking open the door into the alley he heard more gunfire from the front of the store. Elk wish he knew what the other man was carrying, so that he had a better idea of how many shots he had left to worry about. <br>\n<br>\nElk tore down the alley trying any door that he could. All of them were locked. Running further into the alley he worried that maybe this was his time to die after all. A bang echoed off the walls and something screamed past him clanging off a dumpster just ahead of him. Elk dropped into a roll and took cover, firing off a quick shot in response. Seven. Elk heard the other man cry out in pain. Elk slowly made his way back toward the other man finding him on the ground clutching his shoulder. Elk trained his weapon on the man before him and said, &#8220;Move one fucking muscle and I will fucking end you right here, right now.&#8221; The wounded man looked into Elks eyes trying to get a read on him. Seeing a glimpse of what he could only consider weakness the downed man raised his weapon. Without a second thought Elk pulled the trigger on his Shield. Click. Confused, Elk pulled the trigger again. Click. Click. Click. Nothing. Elks mind was racing as he tried to recount his shots. He had fired seven right? He should have one more bullet left. Did his gun malfunction, or did he fail to load all eight shells into the weapon? In the seconds that it took to run though everything, the other man pointed his weapon at Elk pulling the trigger without hesitation. Elk heard the bang, and then the lights went out.<br>\n<br>\ntheelkspeaks was killed, he was the <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Town 3-shot Neighborizer.</div><br>\n<br>\nDay 5 starts now and will last 14 days.<br>\n<span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2014-08-01 23:30:00)</span><br>\n<br>\nWith 3 players left alive, it takes 2 votes for a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nNot voting: bjc, Drew-Sta, Boonskiies.", "time": "Fri Jul 18, 2014 5:23 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58162&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "58162"}
