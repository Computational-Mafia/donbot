Partly the previous game experience I have mentioned, partly because I like to hang back a little more in the first few pages and watch behaviour (it identifies to me intention / where the angle of the game is being shifted in a neg-town way), partly because I simply had no reason to vote for you other than RVS, and to add speed to an RVS wagon isn't a very helpful move IMHO.

To me there's two things:<br><br>1. Avoids hammering or pressuring ILF despite claiming ILF and Shinobi are scumbuddies. Persists on voting Shinobi despite the biggest reason being \"he jumped to ILF's defense\" -- while Boon isn't quite so heavy-handed as he acccuses Shinobi of being, isn't this sort of the same thing he's doing, by trying to distract attention away from ILF and onto another candidate? Even after finally going from \"ILF is highly likely scum\" in #81 to \"not really sure [about ILF]\" in #83, he still remains steadfast about trying to pressure Shinobi, while undermining his own argument (which is all predicated on ILF being scum in the first place!) (Note that he goes back to the scumbuddy argument in #98.) <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">There's two parts to this. One, if he's actually suspicious of ILF, and thinks Shinobi is her scumbuddy, why not keep the pressure up on ILF? She's obviously going to crack like a walrus if she's scum, and probably out her whole gang. Why switch to Shinobi there? Especially while promising to hammer ILF if necessary?<br><br>And also, if you want to move pressure off of ILF and onto someone else, it's really easy here to make a better argument : That of Shinobi being scum who wants to look good by protecting a townie. Sticking to the scumbuddy theory is weird exactly BECAUSE he ends up destroying it himself, and is forced to \"let up\" on Shinobi when he finally sees it's getting him nowhere. </span><br><br>2. The \"too townie\" read on Grib. I may be biased because to me it's obvious that Grib is town. But even if I was unsure, even if I was only 80% sure Grib was town, under no circumstance would I worry that my read was TOO townie. It reads as though Boon is willing to entertain some possibility that Grib is scum, if he hears other people are willing to follow that path. He does jump very quickly to the Oka wagon, but still doesn't have strong feelings of scumminess towards him.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">And again, that's more because I just can't see any way Grib isn't town. Boon is less culpable of trying to figure out how Grib's role works, Oka and shiny are the biggest ones there, however.</span><br><br>So, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Shinobi</span>, what made you single out Boon over any of the other people we've been discussing?<br><br>----<br><br>aaaaaaand look what happens while I'm posting a text wall. The bjc wagon is a little ridiculous, don't you think? Say what you want about him being a horrible player (and I will), him screwing up and \"claiming\" isn't anything at all (as he's already shown he can't be trusted to act in the town's interest no matter which side he's on), and trying to get a wagon going on him because of it is ludicrous. ESPECIALLY OkaPoka, who \"wants to know how he was so confident in false claiming\" -- <span style=\"font-style: italic\">there's absolutely nothing that so far indicates he IS false-claiming, and even if you want someone to step up and counterclaim him, WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THEY COUNTERCLAIM?</span> -- and I especially love the fact that not a mere six posts prior to that, he was hoping he could railroad Boon for the \"how do you know he's false claiming?\" <br><br>Man I have never been so happy for my vote in a looooong time."}

He's a liability to the town<br>2. A bandwagon on me is still viable and I prefer the bjc bandwagon over my own (obviously)<br>3. I HATE how he plays and I honestly feel like people who refuse to contribute in games just so no one can get reads on them is against the spirit of the game and just makes the game worse and thus, should be policy lynched<br>4. His claim was obvscum to me. Let's look at his motivations for his claim:<br>a. He's VT, maybe he's trying to redirect NKs to him. Why I think this is bullshit: because if a VT wants to redirect NKs to themself, they should act like an obvious TPR without going so far as to make it obvious that they're not a VT by claiming (because a TPR wouldn't claim so early because they don't want to die because TPRs are valuable)<br>b. He's TPR, maybe he was just trying to keep himself alive because he's aware that TPRs are valuable. Why I think this is bullshit: He was not close to being lynched. There was no need for him to do anything to keep himself alive besides maybe participate more. If he actually was TPR, he'd care about keeping himself alive enough to actually participate in the game to prevent a lynch on himslef.<br>c. He's some sort of role that benefits from being NKed, which would explain why he claimed TPR, because he was trying to make himself a target. Why I think this is bullshit: The correct play here would be to attempt to portray himself as a TPR without making it obvious that he's not actually a TPR (well, he would be in this case, but he wants the NK, so he's trying to get NKed). So basically, his actions should be what actions he would take as a VT. I don't buy this one bit.<br>d. He's scum, he wants everyone to back off of him and he knows he won't be NKed because he's the one doing the NKs. Why I'm now a little skeptical on this: if he's scum, he should be aware that his action was pretty stupid as both scum and town. If we assume he's intelligent, he shouldn't fall into the trap he made himself.<br>e. He's a jester, he wants to get lynched, and knows that making a play completely awful for town will get him lynched, especially if he was already a liability. Why I'm concerned about this: I hadn't considered this option prior to writing this all out. However, I don't know how likely a jester actually is, would someone with more experience tell me how likely it is we have a jester?<br>5. His overall lack of a defense makes me think that he honestly doesn't care. Maybe that's not alignment indicative, maybe this should fit into reason 1, but still, this point angers me.<br>6. I'm currently town reading everyone but him, and since he's the odd one out in this case, I don't know who else to vote. This is my fault though, I've been super busy recently and I haven't had the time to put as much effort into this game as I began to do in my previous two games (the two games before I was new and lost and didn't really contribute all too much [still more than bjc]). <br><br>Also, Grib, what do you think of the bjc wagon, besides \"lazy\"?"}

I don't care much about posting frequency (lurking can be for any number of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with the game at all). I care about content, and you haven't posted much of that at all. You don't need to post walls every post either, just post some reads or analysis. <br><br>Literally everyone is better after a lynch/daykill/whatever because it gives them something to react to and reevaluate their original reads with. That's no excuse for not trying. As a villager, I would rather see you post three to four reads (or analysis that's wildly off-base) and have every single one turn out wrong then have you sit there posting no reads and no analysis. When you post reads that later end up being incorrect, the village can analyze those reads, try to figure out your thought process, and maybe gain some information that could be useful to them. If you don't post any reads or analysis, then not only do you slow the village down in life, you prevent them from gaining information from your death. <br><br>(the above, by the way, is why lurking is considered a scumtell by most mafia players)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5971456#p5971456\" class=\"postlink\">post 191</a>, OkaPoka wrote:</cite>I ain't lurking.<br><br>I am questioning and doing what I am asked.

Others decided that they wanted to control their own destiny and went looking for those who wish them dead. A few had much more devious plans for the evening. <br><br>A warehouse stands at the edge of town, towering ominously over all that you can see. It is here that two of our players have crossed paths. Each man slowly walked towards the other, sizing up the other as they came closer and closer. It became quickly apparent that these men were not on the same side, and that only one of them would be walking out of the warehouse that night.<br><br>With a quickness that deceived the naked eye the two men begin to throw a flurry of fists, feet, elbows and knees. Neither man landed a blow; easily parrying the other mans attempts. Each man was as skilled as the other, and they both knew that this would not end quickly, or without a good amount of pain being inflicted on each combatant. One man ran towards the other but veered off at the last second. He launched himself into the air, running along the wall using it to propel him towards the other landing a solid kick to the opposition\u2019s face, knocking out teeth and spraying blood into the air in a fine mist. The kick was followed up with a spinning backhand to the other side of the man\u2019s face, spraying even more blood into the air. As the wounded man struggled to get his bearings his assailant wasted no time. Lashing out with a lightening quick kick to the inside of the leg the aggressor knocked the other man to the ground. Wobbling back and forth the man knew he had been beaten, but he refused to give the other the satisfaction of begging for his life. He knew that his struggle would only give hope to those who will miss him. He raised his head in defiance and saw the open palm coming up and in to crush his nose and push the cartilage into the brain killing him instantly. The other man muttered something under his breath that would understood to be a farewell to a worthy opponent.<br><br>The sun eventually rose, and not everyone was accounted for. The group split up and scoured the area to see where their missing members were. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Shinobi was found dead in the warehouse, beaten to a bloody pulp and laid out ceremoniously in obvious reverence.</span> While his death was being lamented by those who found him another group was making a commotion across town. <span class=\"noboldsig\">shinyskarmory had been found dead in an alley with his throat slit from ear to ear.</span><br><br>Shinobi, <span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town 2-Shot Hider</span></span> was killed.<br><br>Shinyskarmory, <span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span> was killed.<br><br>Day starts now.<br><br>With 9 alive it will take 5 votes for a lynch.<br><br>Your time starts now, and will last 14 days.<br><span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2014-07-11 23:35:00)</span></span>"}

ILF in #183: One of the reasons to vote bjc is \"a bandwagon on me is still a possibility.\" At this point, ILF has one vote remaining on her (theelkspeaks) and there's one other viable bandwagon with some better-thought-out reasons than \"I don't like bjc's play style.\" If this is a legitimate concern, and you count it as a legitimate reason for voting for someone (I don't know that I do), why bjc over OkaPoka? In addition, all of her \"motivation\" points expect bjc to being playing in the town's best interests, which we already know he's not, and SHE knows he's not. <br><br>6. ILF buddying me in #199 is yikes. Would really like answers to my questions in #200.<br><br>7. Man I'm really curious why Shinobi was willing to vote for me in #202.

(Evidently it's the \"because gut\" post.) It's making me think two ways: <br><br>(1) ILF, despite Boon saying otherwise, keeps getting scummier and scummier every time I reread. For example:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5964432#p5964432\" class=\"postlink\">post 73</a>, I Love Fairies wrote:</cite>Scummers really like to buddy up with town members so that when that town member flips town, the scummer looks good because he was associated with the member that flipped.</div></blockquote><br><br>The first time I read it, she means it as a defense against why she wouldn't necessarily be scum if Shinobi is scum. In hindsight, I'm like, yeah, that's EXACTLY what you're doing in post #73 -- in reverse, though, by buddying up to Shinobi and saying his vote was \"probably RVS.\" <br><br>(not to mention #73 now reads A LOT like ILF coaching Boon)<br><br>(2) During Boon's initial Shinobi / ILF scumbuddy outing, Boon's reasoning for going after Shinobi and not ILF was essentially that ILF was scum (if and only if) Shinobi was scum. I still think normal behavior here is \"I think Shinobi and ILF are scummy, ILF is currently being bandwagoned, I don't care which goes first since they're both scummy, so I vote ILF.\" As Drew noted in #92, there's exactly four Shinobi posts at that point, none of which have much content, so it's hard to believe he's SO CONFIDENT in his Shinobi scum read that he'd refuse to consider other scum.<br><br>BTW Boons:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5965805#p5965805\" class=\"postlink\">post 98</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>@Drew  I was kidding about you being mafia.

Remember when I was assuming that there were 3 scum in this game? It's not a certainty that 3 scum are in an 11 person game. Is 3 scum too many for an 11 person game, and there is probably most likely only two? Give me another day to try and prove that I am town. Granted, I think Fat_Tony is scum, if only for the mix between his and KittyMo's play before him. He's just slid right under the radar since he's got here, and Kitty was also seen as scummy-ish beforehand.

Of their original numbers, only eight remain. One town member breaks away from the rest of the group as darkness overtakes them, finding a need to be alone with his thoughts.<br><br>The man goes back to the warehouse and stands over the bloodstained floor, looking for any clue he could find that would help him in his search for those who wish harm to him, and his people. Looking over every inch of the space before dejectedly giving up, he finally goes on his way. Stopping in the alley for a moment to think about the other fallen town member he kneels down for a time saying a prayer under his breath. Suddenly a feeling arises in him and the buildings begin to close in on him, the residual heat from the streets becomes oppressive and breathing becomes more and more labored. Not knowing what to do, he looks around in a panic. Finally he spots something that he believes might help on multiple fronts.  Across town he sees a building that towers over the rest of the metropolis, dwarfing any other building around it.<br><br>Gradually making his way to his respite he thinks to himself that the building would be perfect for him to escape from the stifling streets, to get some fresh air, and to have a good vantage point to look over the city. As he is walking he hears a sound behind him, something that almost sounds like the scrape of a boot on the pavement. Turning around he sees nothing, and in the time he waits nothing presents itself to him. Straining his eyes in the dark to see, he convinces himself that he is just wound tightly, and there are no boogey men in the dark waiting for him and he moves on. Finally he reaches the building and makes his way to the top.<br><br>The view from the rooftop was stunning, and he was able to see for miles in each direction. He saw the warehouse, the alley and the area where the town members gathered during the day. Something begins to eat at him but he cannot pin it down. Circling around the edges of an idea he paces back and forth nearer to the edge than he realizes. A gust of wind blows hard and knocks him off balance. Stumbling, flailing his arms, he envisions his end coming from a simple gust of wind. However, he digs his heel into the gravel of the roof and finds purchase there. That was a close one, he thought. <br><br>Unfortunately for him during the ruckus he failed to see the man in black slip out of the stairwell, and into the shadows. The man in black had been following him all night, keeping a good distance, well outside the man\u2019s realm of observation. Once after they visited the alley he thought that he was caught when he miss-stepped and scraped his boot on the raised gutter. His heart had skipped many beats in the time he stood silent and stoic, waiting for the other man to resume his journey. His patience was well rewarded, getting the town member separated and completely alone. He watched as the other man stood on the edge of the roof, looking down at what could have easily been the fall that killed him. Without a sound the man in black crept up behind him, took hold of his collar and his belt, whispered something into his ear before throwing him clear over the edge. The man flipped over in the air and you could see the distress on his face, the last thing that ran through his mind before hitting the roof of the car below, blowing out all of the windows in a shower of glass, was \u201cI didn\u2019t even know she had a brother.\u201d<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Grib</span> was killed, he was the <span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Doublevoter.</span></span><br><br>With 7 alive, it takes 4 votes for a lynch<br><br>Not voting: theelkspeaks, bjc, Tattletale, Drew-Sta, Octopus, Boonskiies, Fat_Tony<br><br>Day 3 begins now and will last 2 weeks.<br><span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2014-07-23 22:45:00)</span></span>"}

(This seems accurate, but has no team mate)<br>3. Boon is mafia with TT (which seems like a decent possibility) and they've been bouncing off each other a lot all game. Octo comes out with a Hail Mary investigation, and Boon is now bussing his partner to get towncred. (This one seems most likely - although I have found TT more affable and they have posted in a way I consider more town, I am still sus based off ILF's contribution.) I support this based off my earlier gut feeling that ILF was mafia.<br><br>Thoughts? I am personally thinking Theory 3. Happy to lynch either TT or Boon.

The men and women look at the faces left and wonder who among them really are to blame for the most recent loss. As their numbers dwindle the situation at hand becomes more and more dire, and scum needs to be found soon for the sake of the town. As the group begins to disperse and go to ground for another night Fat_Tony thinks that he sees a smile on one of the other group members faces. Confused by what he saw, Tony decides to follow the smiling player to see where they go, who knows maybe he will get lucky and find something out.<br><br>Smiley walks off down an alley with Tony in close pursuit. Tony makes sure to stay to the shadows, using doorways to shield himself from view, and windows to get a better view while avoiding detection. Smiley doesn\u2019t make things easy for Tony, multiple times he stops to light a cigarette, only to take a few drags off it look around and snuff the cigarette out beneath his shoe. Smiley used every move in the book to avoid detection. Doubling back on himself, stopping in front of shop windows to watch the people as they pass, walking against Don\u2019t Walk signals. Tony knew that he had made the right choice to follow Smiley, for whatever reason he did not want anyone to know where he was going.<br><br>It felt like Tony had been following Smiley much longer than he actually had when Smiley turned a corner and was out of his sight for only a few seconds. Tony sped up to avoid losing his prey in the sea of people on the streets. Turning the bend Tony realized too late that this was exactly what Smiley was hoping for. Smiley had picked up the tail sometime before and was luring the man pursuing him closer and closer. The shocked look on Tony\u2019s face was only changed by the punch thrown by Smiley that solidly connected with his chin. Seeing stars Tony could barely make out Smiley as they ran down the street. Taking every ounce of strength he had in him Tony rose to his feet and gave chase. <br><br>Tearing down the streets both of our players banged into pedestrians, knocking some to the ground, bouncing off others as they went. Tony ran with everything he had in him using the knowledge that if he lost sight of Smiley they would be in the wind for sure. Veering off of the sidewalk Tony jumped onto the hood of a car parked on the street and started to run on the hoods and roofs, gaining ground as he went. Smiley looked back and saw that Tony was quickly catching up to him, and ducked down the next alley that he came across. Tony followed him and saw that Smiley had turned into the first open door down the alley. Without a second thought Tony breached the doorway and found himself in the middle of a bustling kitchen filled with Chinese men, live chickens, smoke and open flames. The cooks were yelling in tongues that Tony could not understand, but he grasped the fact that they were yelling at Smiley who had just passed through into the dining room. Tony barreled through the men, catching hell from them as well, and entered the dining room. Smiley was there throwing tables out of his way as he moved towards the door. Running full speed out of the restaurant into the street Smiley ran right into traffic, jumping and sliding across the hood of a car that almost certainly would have ended his days. Tony had no second thoughts as he dodged the stopped vehicles keeping Smiley in his sights the entire time. <br><br>Smiley ran down the alley in front of him, jumping onto a dumpster and launching himself into the air to grab hold of the raised ladder of the building\u2019s fire escape. Using his weight Smiley was able to lower the ladder enough for him to climb onto the ladders rung and began climbing. Tony jumped onto the same dumpster and used the drain pipe on the wall to reach the fire escape. Only a flight behind Smiley, Tony redoubled his efforts taking the rungs two and three at a time. Smiley ducked into an open window and ran past a family at their dining room table eating a late supper. The family stopped in midsentence and stared at the commotion that interrupted their meal. A few seconds later Tony went by and the family had not moved, still staring in disbelief. Smiley was already at the fire door for the stairs and pushed the bar setting off a blare of lights and alarms. The door shut behind him and Tony knew that he would have to be more careful when approaching the door thinking that Smiley could be on the other side waiting for him to slip up again. Standing in front of the door Tony waited a second, and then one more before backing up to the wall behind him, dug his heel in and kicked the push bar as hard as he could. The door shot open revealing an open stair well. Tony looked over the railing and could see Smiley three flights below him. Jumping down entire half flights of stairs Tony made his way after his foe. <br><br>When he got to street level and out the exit Tony did not immediately see his object of pursuit. Looking left he saw no sign of Smiley, looking right he caught a glimpse of the back of Smiley\u2019s head as they ran down the entrance of the subway system. Tearing after them, Tony ran full speed into the subway tunnels. Tony was sure that he had Smiley cornered now and made his way to the platform where Smiley was assured to be. Tony looked over the platform and could not make out his quarry. Tony went to the edge of the inbound tracks and looked into the tunnel to see if Smiley had jumped onto the tracks trying to escape into the depths of the underground transit infrastructure. Seeing no signs of movement Tony went to the outbound side of the platform and looked to the left, and saw nothing. Looking to the right he only saw the lights of the oncoming subway car. Feeling dejected and confused Tony began to turn back towards the platform when he felt two hands firmly push him in the back. Before Tony could even register what had happened he became aware of the increasing glare of the lights from the subway car. Tony only had seconds to consider Smiley had somehow gotten behind him and caused this all to happen. Seconds slowed to a crawl and Tony saw his impending death with a Zen like clarity, seeing the light get brighter and closer to him before slamming into him, throwing him into the wall and crushing his skull beneath the train wheels and the rails. His death came so quickly that he was gone before the first scream was heard, and the person who caused it was not suspected in the least and was able to blend in with the crowd as they made their way steadily to the exit.<br><br>Fat_Tony has been killed, he was a <span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><br><br>With 5 players left alive, it takes 3 for a lynch.<br><br>Not voting: theelkspeaks, bjc, Tattletale, Drew-Sta, Boonskiies<br><br>Day 4 starts now, and will last 14 days.<br><span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2014-07-31 00:30:00)</span></span>"}

Infighting, deceit, paranoia, murder and revenge have ravaged the town until it became a shell of its former self. Few temporary moments of happiness among the pain have allowed those who are left to find the strength to carry on and finish the job they set out to do, find fucking scum. Going into the night four players remain. Theelkspeaks, bjc, Drew-Sta, and Boonskiies are still alive and kicking. <br><br>As the day comes to a close the four remaining players sit around a blazing bonfire, remembering those they lost, drinking in their names, and cursing those who took the ones they cared about away. Names like massive and Tattletale are spoken with an obvious disdain, like being spit out when said. Knowing that there was one more scumbag between them left an uneasy tension hanging thick in the air. Most of them wondered if they would all be there come morning, one player knew that would not be the case. The final toasts were made, lingering goodbyes were said, and the players finally broke apart and went their separate ways.<br><br>Theelkspeaks felt restless and chose to walk around the city to put his mind at ease. Walking down bustling streets feeling like he was completely separated from any of them, he tried to imagine how it what it must be like to be one of the uninformed. Ignorance truly is bliss, and if the people around him knew what was really going on in their city they would curl up in their beds and pray for the end. Families, couples, dirtbag teens loitering in convenience store parking lots, joggers, barflies all of them oblivious to the violence that was about to erupt in the streets. <br><br>Elk felt an electricity flowing through the air that threatened to light the night aflame. Glancing around Elk saw nothing noticeably out of order, and he continued on his way. When Elk started walking again he saw a reflection in the window of one a parked car of a man slipping out of a dark doorway, following him at a distance. Adrenaline pumped into Elks system, heightening his senses, putting a quicker step into his pace. It would have been unnoticeable a minute prior, but now Elk was able to hear the safety being taken off of a pistol. Elk took one more step before ducking behind the bumper of a mini van parked in the row of cars. As soon as he had ducked down a shot rang out, and the side mirror of the car behind him exploded. <br><br>Elk knew this was his time. One of them was going to die and fuck if it was going to be him. Elk drew his own handgun, a Shield M&amp;P, from the small of his back. The .40 caliber weapon held eight shots including one in the chamber, which should be enough for any trained owner. Elk took the safety off his own weapon, pulled back the slide to see the gun was fully loaded, peered around the back of the vehicle and took a shot in the direction he had last seen the mystery man. One.  Hearing the shot ricochet off the brick wall of the closest building he knew that he did not connect with anything. Elk let himself linger for a second franticly looking for his query without any luck. Taking cover just in time another shot was taken at him, hitting the body of the van he was behind. Lowering himself into a laying postion in the street, looking from under the van Elk pulled the trigger twice more trying to flush the other man out. Two, three.  Not seeing any movement Elk took off running towards the now abandoned convenience store, hoping to find better cover there. Pointing the pistol behind him as he ran he fired another shot blindly. Four. Running for his life Elk quickly covered the distance to the open door of the store. As he entered more shots rang out and the plate glass panel of the door shattered behind him. Elk quickly took stock of his surroundings. Coolers on the left, cash register on the right, fire exit in the back. Crawling he made his was out of sight from the outside of the store and went to the fire exit. Chained. Fucking great. Looking behind him he knew that going back out the front was not an option, and without any other windows he had to make due with the door in front of him. Elk took aim and fired twice, breaking the lock of the chain. Five, six. Kicking open the door into the alley he heard more gunfire from the front of the store. Elk wish he knew what the other man was carrying, so that he had a better idea of how many shots he had left to worry about. <br><br>Elk tore down the alley trying any door that he could. All of them were locked. Running further into the alley he worried that maybe this was his time to die after all. A bang echoed off the walls and something screamed past him clanging off a dumpster just ahead of him. Elk dropped into a roll and took cover, firing off a quick shot in response. Seven. Elk heard the other man cry out in pain. Elk slowly made his way back toward the other man finding him on the ground clutching his shoulder. Elk trained his weapon on the man before him and said, \u201cMove one fucking muscle and I will fucking end you right here, right now.\u201d The wounded man looked into Elks eyes trying to get a read on him. Seeing a glimpse of what he could only consider weakness the downed man raised his weapon. Without a second thought Elk pulled the trigger on his Shield. Click. Confused, Elk pulled the trigger again. Click. Click. Click. Nothing. Elks mind was racing as he tried to recount his shots. He had fired seven right? He should have one more bullet left. Did his gun malfunction, or did he fail to load all eight shells into the weapon? In the seconds that it took to run though everything, the other man pointed his weapon at Elk pulling the trigger without hesitation. Elk heard the bang, and then the lights went out.<br><br>theelkspeaks was killed, he was the <span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town 3-shot Neighborizer.</span></span><br><br>Day 5 starts now and will last 14 days.<br><span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2014-08-01 23:30:00)</span></span><br><br>With 3 players left alive, it takes 2 votes for a lynch.<br><br>Not voting: bjc, Drew-Sta, Boonskiies."}

I believe he thinks that Bjc and I are both more likely to make a rash judgement call and vote on with him, making him safer than elk who had rarely posted. ALSO, Bjc had posted that he was pretty sure I was town, so by keeping Bjc alive, it would seem like I was scum trying to keep him alive so that he could buddy up with me to pick off Drew. That being a little obvious, Bjc would then turn his attention to me and vote me. <br><br>_________<br><br>Bjc is scum. He's been an obvious troll throughout the game, including hammering. He went and attacked Octopus' claim because Tattletale was found guilty. That being his scum buddy, he wanted scum to live another day to get another NK. He killed elk because my suspicion was on Drew, so he thinks that he could get me to vote Drew. Bjc claims that he thinks I am town, possibly for me to trust him more and go along with him to kill Drew. <br><br><br>That's where I stand."}
