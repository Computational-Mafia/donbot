Recently, you've gotten letter in the mail, saying that you and a few select others have been chosen to attend a dinner party for a \"close relative\". Funny...it didn't really mention a name, but hey; you never pass up free food and a chance to enjoy life with family. But the drive seemed like hours....4 or 5 to be exact. Plus, it's snowing pretty hard...you've heard of a storm coming this way and strove to try to beat it. Regardless, it's freezing cold, and it's starting to put you asleep.<br><br>Feeling grateful that you have the car, you finally come across a giant mansion-like cabin. \"Wow...this place is huge! How many bedrooms does this place have...12?\" you say to yourself. As you pull in, you notice that there are other cars in the driveway as well. \"Weird...I don't remember having this many relatives...\"<br><br>You unpack your things from the car and knock on the front door. The door is opened by a tall man in a butler's uniform.<br><br>\"Yes...?\"<br><br>\"Hey...uh, I got a letter in the mail about a dinner party being held by a relative of mine..\"<br><br>\"Oh yes! You're one of the guests! Please, come in, sir. Let me take your bag for you.\"<br><br>As you walk in, you are in awe at the interior of the cabin. A giant kitchen sits to the left of you, complete with it's own pantry and dining table. A fireplace glows on the opposite side. Stairs leading up to various floors are straight ahead of you. Finally, you notice the butterfly painting above the fireplace. You take your coat off walk over to it to examine it.<br><br>You whisper the description of the painting to yourself. \"Mariposa Peak....otherwise known as Butterfly Mountain. A cozy cocoon during the winter and a beautifully fresh summer.\"<br><br>How tacky. Suddenly, you hear footsteps coming from the kitchen. 11 men and women shuffle out...but something's wrong. You don't recognize any of them. They look just as confused as you do.<br><br>The butler raises his hand to get everyone's attention. \"Hello, distinguished guests. My name is Bradley, and I'm the butler here at Mariposa Peak manor. I hope you all are having a wonderful morning, and we shall start our festivities later in the afternoon, but first, I invite you to get your keys for your rooms.\"<br><br>\"Rooms?\" you say. \"I don't remember this being an overnight stay...\"<br><br>\"I wouldn't worry about that, good sir. There will be many surprises yet to come, and trust me when I say, they will be rather...unexpected to say the least. There is a full wardrobe in each room to fit your needs. Please, dress in the finest attire, then meet me down in the kitchen, if you would.\"<br><br>As you pick up the keys to your room, you can't help but to feel a little freaked out about the situation. You walk upstairs, find your room number, and open the door. Bradley was right; over by the window is a huge wardrobe filled with various suits, nightclothes, day clothes, you name it, it has it. As you dress into the finest suit you can find, a scream fills the cabin. Suddenly, you rush downstairs to the main hall!<br><br>Bradley is on the ground, his throat sliced, his face in a twisted apparition of horror. As you run out of the cabin in a frenzied state of panic, you notice something else....everyone's tires has been slashed!<br><br>\"There is NO WAY we can walk back to town from here, especially with the storm coming...\" you say to yourself, and walk back into the cabin. You notice something else about Bradley as well; in his hand, he is clutching a note.<br><br>\"Hello, guests...we are the Mariposa Peak Mafia, and we have noticed that you've been doing a little sinning of your own. If you notice, you will find a key to the safe in Bradley's pocket. Please, I invite you to fulfill your curiosities...\"<br><br>You grab the key from his pocket, and open the safe in the corner of the room. Inside, you find photographs of the various guests in VERY demeaning positions, committing various crimes. They are all shocked and horrified at each other as the pictures are passed around and then finally returned to the vault. Inside, there is another note.<br><br>\"Now that you know of your crimes, you realize why we have invited you all here...to make a buck or two off of your misdeeds. But that's not all; we like a little challenge with our blackmail...it's no fun if the victims submit so easily, so here is what we propose to you. Either we can blackmail you with the copies to these photos, reveal them to the public...or we can play a game. The ones responsible for these pictures are hidden in the group of guests this very moment. If you'd like, you can provide a little...vigilante justice, if you know what I mean. There is rope in the master bedroom. Use Bradley's key. The choice is yours, and happy hunting!<br><br>-MP Mafia\"<br><br>You turn to the other guests, scanning their faces. You suggest that the only logical way to play their game is to take a majority vote, kill them where they stand, and then search their rooms with their keys. Surely the guilty ones will have evidence in their rooms.<br><br>The other guests agree. Suddenly, arguments broke out, and the race was off. The game was started. Someone had to die.<br><br>__________________________________________________________________<br><br></span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bradley, </span></span><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">The Butler</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, throat sliced Day 1!</span></span><br>__________________________________________________________________<br><br>Day 1:<br>Day 1 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2660747#p2660747\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2677684#p2677684\" class=\"postlink\">Ends</a><br>Day 2 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2683353#p2683353\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2714186#p2714186\" class=\"postlink\">Ends</a><br>Day 3 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2720697#p2720697\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2723540#p2723540\" class=\"postlink\">Ends</a><br>Day 4 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2729235#p2729235\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a><br><br>_________________________________________<br><br>Key:<br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Blue</span></span> = NPC<br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Red</span></span> = Mafia<br><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Purple</span></span> = Third Party<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Green</span></span> = Town<br><span style=\"color: #808080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Silver</span></span> = Modkilled Neutral Survivor<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Living Players</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">1. singersigner, Vanilla Townie<br>4.

You use votes to lynch (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: DemonHybrid</span>). A majority vote lynches a player. The deadline will lynch the person in the lead.

No lynch occurs when half (majority when half is not possible) of the players vote for it.<br>3. Please bold your votes and unvotes or else they don't count. You don't need to unvote, but I'd like it.<br>4. Don't talk in real life about the game.<br>5. No secret messages using size tags or other trickery.<br>6. Don't quote my PMs, fake or not. You can quote my in-thread posts.<br>7. If you're the lynchee, don't talk. If you're dead, you're dead; don't talk. As much as I like zombie movies, this is my world, and as such, there will be no living dead, and therefore, no \"Bah!\" post.<br>8. You can talk in twilight unless you're the lynchee.<br>9. Don't use personal attacks.<br>10. If I make a mistake, let me know.<br>11. I'll vote count every page, but if I slack, let me know.<br>12. Please use V/LA if you aren't going to post within 2 days.<br>13. I'll prod you if you don't post after 2 days. 3 prods and I'm replacing you.<br>14. You can leave the game if you wish, but don't do it jokingly.<br>15. Days are 2 weeks. Extensions are 3 days, and you can vote for them.<br>16. I'm the mod. Whatever I say, goes.<br>17. I post in bolded purple, so don't use it. Other colors are ok.<br>18. Modkills turn you into Neutral Survivor. They end the day if the modkilled player is town, they do NOT end the day if he/she is scum.<br>19. Play to your wincon. I'll be the judge of that, and I'm pretty reasonable on judging actions either playing to or against wincon. Voting for yourself to play towards your win-con is okay; outing scumbuddies and self-hammering for fun is not.<br>20. Don't post elsewhere on mafiascum about this thread, and don't quote anything from the game in your signature until the game is over IF it has to do with core game content.<br>21. Flavor's not relevant to any roles or players in the game, so don't use it for information or you'll be wasting your time.<br><br>All night actions will happen in the following order:<br><br>1. Roleblocking<br>2. Protecting<br>3. Investigating<br>4. Killing<br>5. Recruiting<br><br>NOTE: If by some chance there are two roleblockers regardless of faction and one roleblocker affects the other roleblocker's job for that night, I will randomize which roleblocker gets priority.</div></div></div></span></span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie Role PM Example:</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span class=\"noboldsig\">PLAYER</span>, you are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>.

I don't think it was an unjustified question at all, which is making me wonder why you care so much about it.

Does that not affect your decisions and/or ability to play the game more effectively?

That's wrong. My first comment about the Power-votes were about the votes against him from you and AGar. I disagree with the reason behind it. As for the second statement, that's about Power's last post. In other words, the two statements are about two different happenings.<br><br>I'm not saying you should discuss other players for the same reasons for mentioning Rhinox, as I disagree with it. However, it's odd to me to only mention Rhinox. So what's different about the 'last to post reason' when comparing it to different random vote reasons?<br><br>As for the part about Confid VS Sims, it's rather strange to mention that one seemed more townish, instead of mentioning that the other looked scummier. <br><br>As you can see from my previous post, I mentioned 'mainly' while I was talking about Power's post. Dodging your question could eventually be added, however, I can see how his post does answer it. So I'm waiting for him to respond to our accusations.<br><br><br>@Singer<br>Please look back at Thor's posts. At one point, he mentions that he wouldn't mind lynching Rhinox. Part about it is for keeping the RVS up. <br>As you can see, most points against AGar also goes for Thor. However, one point doesn't. That one and gut make the difference between the two. AGar fully denying to explain anything, doesn't help him at all.<br><br><br>With that said, wanna respond to my previous post, AGar?<br>Other than that, there's one more thing against AGar:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Vote Count</legend><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Day 1 Vote Count (#5)</span></span></fieldset></span><br><br></span></span><span style=\"color: #808000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">sims5487</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> - 4 (Rhinox, ConfidAnon, Guderian, Powerrox03)<br><br></span></span><span style=\"color: #808000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">AGar</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- 4 (Reckamonic, Seraphim, sims5487, Blood Queen)</span></span></div></blockquote><br><br>You mentioned the wagons, right?

The meat of it on D1 is that a wagon on Uite gained ground very, very quickly. Up to L-2, with some bussing influence (Thor). Zoneace (Uite &amp; Thor's scumbuddy) found a weak reason to attack town player (MPR) and tried to push the wagon. It backfired in the fact that ZA got himself lynched instead, but it clearly illustrates the same pattern of behavior I see here - scum A makes some kind of slip, after some pressure gathers, scum B hops on. Scum C sees Scum A's wagon take off and panics, and tries to counter-wagon to save Scum A. Also note that Thor pulled out in time to preserve Uite, but sacrificed Zoneace instead. But again, a similar behavior is illustrated in Gud, who hopped off of your wagon as the counter is presented, but moved to Thor instead.<br><br>Reckamonic, Sera - Both slots have a decent bit of experience here, so I'm interested in your input here."}

I didn't explain it because I don't have an answer. The logic is predicated on his belief that I would catch it. So either I caught it and scumtastically decided not to use a meta argument on him for a mislynch (because scum me...wouldn't want to lynch town AGar?) or I just missed it in which case there is no way to prove/disprove the thought.

Though my urge to try to write a big post on everything I perceive about AGar's playstyle seems a poor exchange on the effort to advantage scale. Overall I consider him a good player and I've seen him transform some of those little insight tells of his into brilliantly accurate conclusions. I've never played with him as scum.

Sure, you have some fluff thrown in, but fluff with scumhunting is acceptable.  You've done nothing even relating to the point I was making about sims in the beginning.  Comparing you two is a case of the long-contested debate, apples v. oranges.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gud wrote:</cite>a.

Much more so when I was in some deeper mafia games (that were set up kind of like reality television), but I still think about this one.  Thinking about sims's play disconnected from the exchange we were in made me see things a little differently.  Note that I'm not saying that he's innocent, by any means, but that my vote is better used elsewhere.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gud wrote:</cite>He then votes bloodqueen, saying she may be new/skittish, and thus is obviously mafia.</div></blockquote><br><br>I never said that I was voting Blood Queen for being new/skittish.  That was the reason I downgraded sims.  I voted Blood Queen for the reason outlined by AGar.  Is English your first language?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gud wrote:</cite>b. doesn't follow up on people he considers scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>I mean this in the nicest way possible (not really), but are you reading the thread?  Did you not see the exchange between me and sims?  All of that was follow-up.  There are several players in this game.  I'm not going to tunnel on one specific person.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gud wrote:</cite>a. His iso 11-12 tries to make friends with thor, tries to appear nonchalant, carefree.

I do enjoy joking around within games as well as playing them.  You're reading more into that than is there.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gud wrote:</cite>b.  His is clearly forced.

That comment was directed at the Serial Killer claim (though it's understandable why you'd be confused, looks like I forgot to quote that).

They are playing to their win conditions. Only roles like Jesters, Lynchers, and survivors can win WITH the town. They are technically \"anti-town\" but, persay, mutually against a town victory. Not to mention with SKs, there's always the danger you're just cutting a deal with a scumbag. <br><br>Look folks, let's lynch Guderian. If he was actually a serial killer, that might be a different can of worms, but since he has since (I think) rescinded the claim, we have to lynch him. The bag o' WIFOM that he has unleashed with his SK claim is not worth dealing with, especially in the long run. Also, don't forget that if Guderian is the SK and this is some bizarre gambit, this is a 8:3:1 or 9:2:1 and if we mislynch town today, we are in a much worse position.

I'll use confid's post here as a launch point because its a basic summary of what I want to talk about.<br><br>This is regarding Agar's case on BQ:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>confidanon wrote:</cite>If he were saying \"Lynch Blood Queen. If Town, lynch ConfidAnon. If scum, lynch sims,\" it would be more suspect because he's trying to lead up a lynch with another lynch regardless of what happens. But in this game, his suspicion of Blood Queen directly stems from what he views as Blood Queen's protection (from joining the AGar wagon) of sims. While I'm not sure pursuing a lynch this early based purely on voting patterns and not on individual scumminess is the best course of action, saying \"Lynch Blood Queen. If scum, lynch sims. If not scum, I'll reread sims\" is not scummy - it's a logical continuation of his viewpoint.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is wrong. Agar's case on bloodqueen is dependent on the assumption that sims is scum.<br><br>The logic should be: lynch sims. if sims-scum, lynch BQ. If sims-town, then there is no case on BQ.<br><br>It does not follow in reverse. If BQ is scum, it does not follow that sims is any more likely to be scum, and if BQ is town, it does not say anything about sims' allignment.<br><br>I feel this is a strike 2 for Agar. First was pushing Gud's lynch without voting. I fear it is possible scum-agar could be setting up the potential for 2 mislynches. After BQ-town, sims can still be lynched later on because a BQ-town flip would not say anything about sims' allignment. While in reverse, a sims-town flip completely obliterates Agar's case on BQ.<br><br>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2668573#p2668573\" class=\"postlink\">#167</a>, Agar is claiming it's the other way around. I don't buy it because Agar suspected BQ of voting to prevent the lynch of scumpartner-sims - aka BQ is scum is supported if sims is scum, not the other way around.<br><br>Agar's appeal to authority might just be strike 3. I don't care how many games he's played, that doesn't make him a better scum hunter. By that metric, zwets would pwn us all. I think Agar is taking advantage of the fact that half the players in this game (and the majority of the most active posters currently) are new-er-ish.<br><br><br>I can't even begin to comprehend the last couple pages.

They do nothing. 76% of the time winning is too significant a percentage to overlook and proclaim it a particular mafia groups well playing. For mafia to win these setup's they essentially have to show up.<br><br>This is how town wins.... well actually it looks like town doesn't ever win. Town is only 12/50 in the last 50 games. What does that mean? People are playing the same way, the same 'accepted way', doing townie things and what have you, and they end up losing. Badly. Almost every game. <br><br>What does that mean. Should the status quo continue, me and the town are likely to lose this game. Its raw numbers. Debate it all you want. If we played the 'normal' way, heres what usually happens.<br><br>Day 1: Usually a noob/VI/person people dont like, is lynched. This is a subtle policy lynch. People aren't overt or even conscious about it. But one little 'scumslip' is magnified, and the town pounces. If you debate this, look at the number of games Thor, or Glork, or Yos2, or anyone prominent, is lynched day one. Never happens.<br><br>N1: Random person killed<br><br>Day 2: Analysis over the townie killing. Who was on the wagon! Usually, its just some misguided town and maybe a scum or two. Usually not that many. They dont have to provoke town into lynching. So after much debate, it comes down to two people, one a questionable townie, one scum. Townie, perhaps is lynched.<br><br>Day 3-5 # days or lylo. Good luck.<br><br>So what did I do? Something scum never want to have happen. I obliterated the status quo. I rocked the boat. It may not have been popular, but it forced reactions out of people that maybe they didnt want to give. <br><br>That is why I claimed serial killer and let it ride. To see. To observe. To hope that maybe, town can win this one.<br><br>From this, I believe we have gotten some of what we wanted. We separated the sincere newbies from those with malicious intent, and forced the 'experienced' players to respond. I would argue my play this game has been the most pro town out of anybodies."}

I don't need to say hello\" is very nervous and scummy!<br>4: OMG SOMEONE ASKED ME A QUESTION! evasive answer... be vague as possible...<br>5: Ah, that good ol game that has nothing to do with this one!<br>6: I dont know how scum plays or who scum is, I'm not scum. Derp derp! I also think scums have personalities!<br>7: Tee hee, I'm making a funny comment. Wait, this isnt why I vote BQ earlier right?<br>8: Explain to me why I'm scum so I can not be scum against next game. Also, don't mind the fact you should explain your comment when I dont have to explain my BQ vote.<br>9: I shall now heavily misrep AGar, that will mostly appear town!<br>10: Oh, let's add another vote without explanation, since my vote shouldn't be explained, unlike people calling me scum!<br>11: Actually, let's put my vote somewhere else...<br>12: teehee, I made a funny!<br>13: Hey, the world totally changed since 60 games ago. Also, it's 3scum a sk, but dont tell anyone!<br>14: OMG, I'M POSTING AN OPINION!<br>15: Did I mention I love misrepping AGar? WEll, I do.<br>16: Sim disagrees with me! He MUST be scum!<br>17: newbies are aaaaaall identical!<br>18: SS, Tell me why I'm wrong, please.<br>19: No, I will NOT explain why I want to lynch Thor, that's not my job... right?<br>20: I ALREADY SAID YOU MUST FIND WHY THOR IS SCUM, LEAVE ME ALOOOOONE!<br>21: STOOOOOOOOOOP IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!<br>22: Guys, I think there's scum within half the playerlist! Also, I'M a SK, lawls!<br>23: Guys, COnfid is scum! His reads can change, he doesnt like lurkers and he wants me to make a case.<br>24: I'm cryyyyyptic!<br>25: I have a master plan, now that I have brought all the lights on myself I can execute it!<br>26: seraph, do you believe me? tell meeeee!<br>27: I dont like your post, so I wont answer.<br>28: Power, I may not do anything worthwhile, but YOU should.<br>29: AGar, how dare you put me at L-1 and ask for a claim when that is how the game has always been played? Also, I was kidding earlier, I won't claim in case someone doesnt believe me, although I'm totally honest, yep!<br>Also, it hurts the anti-town people to put every spotlight on myself by being super scummy and softclaiming a PR on which I can give no detail. Really, it does!<br>30: give me a second, I'm not done reading<br>31: Good defense, doesn't mean my case is bad at all.<br>32: OOOOOOOH you are an idiot sim!<br>33: According to these flawed data I got (ignore the fact I stated earlier that 60 game ago is incompatible with now), I think scum wins because they do nothing, and I'm doing stuff, so I'm town! Also, we should information hunt before having info, and sometimes on day 2 town is lynched, so you guys dont know how to play the game! Also, lookit my ego ^^<br>34: I wont claim, because I've nothing to actually claim. THat or my information will hurt the town, even though if I have any role the doc can surely protect me and I'll be roleblocked to submission if a roleblocker exists. Also, if my role is reflexive I'll fuck over the doc, so I shouldn't claim, no sir!<br>35: If you lynch me you'll get lynched, because apparently my scumminess transfers to you. This is not a threat, at all.<br>36: I love the newbies, so let's not lynch them! If I die, the newbies die. Hey, I heard that coming from a gangster in a movie I saw the other day!<br>37: I won't reply to your argument, because you're crazy. That makes me town.<br>38: Newbies, do a non-suicide pact for me please. I can read your minds, and you'll want to lynch each other. threeaaaaaaaaaaaaaats.<br>39: I haz unexplained townreads<br>40: pictures are funny, even though this one is cryptic<br>41: Look at the shiny kitties, they dont like me! KILL THEM! Don't ISO them, there are only posts about me there.<br>42: You're scum for calling me scum. HAH, GOT YOU!<br>43: I can't understand SS, therefore I'll daykill her after claiming she's town multiple times"}

Honestly, because of your little charade, I think the best thing for town is if you hung your head between your legs and took it like a man.  If you're around later in the game, it can cause more problems.  The best way to deal with this unfortunate situation is to get rid of it, and learn what we can from there.  Something that's great about these games, is that we can always afford at least one mislynch, and if this is it, and least we won't have your crappy logic/shinnigans to deal with in the future.  PLUS, we can take your reads and actually trust them to more of an extent than we can now.  I really hope you can see how that would be more beneficial to town than what you did."}

Someone brought a dry-erase board from the kitchen, put it up on the wall, and was taking a tally of the votes of who should die. Many people put up good cases, many people put up bad cases, but one person's behavior stood out more than the rest.<br><br>Mr. Guderian, a mild mannered yet paranoid man, kept eyeing the the safe in the corner of the room constantly. Soon enough, people started dropping their fights with one another and noticing his constant double-takes towards the safe. \"Uh....hello, sir? Why do you keep looking over by the safe?\" said one guest.<br><br>\"Huh? Oh...uh....it's...it's nothing. Lets just keep going. I don't like this guy's attitude beca-\"<br><br>\"No, seriously.\" You cut him off. \"You seem to be interested in that safe for some reason...\"<br><br>\"Guys....come on, I was just...I dunno, I've never seen a safe that big before in my life, so I....\"<br><br>\"Do you have something to hide?\"<br><br>\"Uh.....um.....guys, come on...\" His voice started to get weak and frail. He started saying less and less.<br><br>\"Which photo was yours? What did you do?\" said another guest.<br><br>\"Heh, I bet he killed somebody or something, that's why he's so paranoid about it.\" joked another.<br><br>Out of nowhere, a wave of panic set over Mr. Guderian's face due to the paranoia. Everyone stared at him.<br><br>\"....guys, seriously, it's not what you think.\"<br><br>The guests burst out in anger towards this man in reaction to the statement. Many people shouted, like an angry mob. \"MURDERER! HEATHEN! KILL HIM, HE NEEDS TO DIE!\"<br><br>Mr. Guderian turned and ran up the stairs. You and the rest of the crowd chased him down, but little did you know that a guest ran into the kitchen, picked up a steak knife, and joined the crowd. You cornered him at the end of the hallway.<br><br>\"What have you done?!?! Why are you so paranoid!?!?\"<br><br>\"GUYS, I didn't do anything! I swear, I'm innocent! Stop this, right now!\" said the confused man. \"If you don't.....I SWEAR, I'LL SHOOT YOU!\"<br><br>He puts his hand under his shirt to act as if he has a gun. The rest of you stare at him like he has three heads.<br><br>\"This is ridiculous. He needs to die!\" said one person in the mob. Suddenly, a hand came out from the crowd and grabbed Mr. Guderian's sleeve. He was pulled into the crowd. People started punching him, choking him, holding him so others can get at him. You stand back in horror. He was pushed back and forth, and into the knife of the person who grabbed it in the kitchen. He screams out in pain. After being stabbed multiple times, he loses strength and collapses. The mob picks him up and carries him down the stairs, leaving a trail of blood. They open the front door to the cabin and toss him outside, locking the door behind him. He runs up to the window, bleeding to death.<br><br>\"GUYS! I didn't murder anyone! I didn't do ANYTHING! I'm just..I...oh god...it's so cold, let me in! I swear, you guys will pay! I swear...\"<br><br>He pounds on the reinforced window, whimpering. Random screaming and crying followed. Two guests held the door shut, while the rest of you waited for his inevitable death.<br><br>*pound pound pound*<br><br>\"STOP IT, GUDERIAN. We're not letting you in!!\" You yell out in a panic.<br><br>\"...hahaha...I'm sorry....Guderian's not in at the moment...this is his brother...if you'd like to leave a message...please do so at the sound of the beep.<br><br>...beeep.\"<br><br>Then silence. The crowd freezes in horror. It's obvious that the paranoia and fear of death turned him insane.<br><br><br><br>Three hours pass...<br><br><br><br>By this time, the snow had piled up to a couple of feet, and the thermometer showed -10 degrees farenheit. The crying, pounding and screaming had stopped long before, but you decided not to risk opening the door. You finally gain the strength to open it up and check his frozen and bloodied body for the key. You climb upstairs, open the door to his room.....and find it impeccably clean. A made bed. Everything neatly tucked away. No guns. No notes. No technology...just the room of a simple man.<br><br>In a panic, you run downstairs, unlock the safe, and pull out the pictures. Finally, you find the one of the man fitting Mr. Guderian's description.<br><br>In it, he is caught jaywalking. Not a murderer at all. Just a man with a history of paranoid fits.<br><br>Tears well up in a few of the guests' eyes. You hang your head in shame. One person vomits.<br><br><br><br><br>After throwing the two bodies into the cellar, you open up a bottle of Jack, pour yourself a shot and turn to the guests.<br><br>\"We need to take this night to rest...we've obviously lost focus of what needs to be done and who is at fault. I suggest that all of you go to your rooms and get a good night's sleep.\" The rest of the crowd agrees. You all walk up to your rooms. In your room, you go to lock your door...but notice that there's no lock on the inside. Locking the door from the outside doesn't allow you to close the door.<br><br>\"Who the hell designed this cabin? It's like it's designed to have people invade your space...\" you say to yourself, as a slowly creeping panic flows over you. You realize that everyone has access to your room.<br><br>You stare at the ceiling, in fear that something will happen to you. Your eyes do not shut once that night.</span></span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Guderian, </span></span><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, stabbed and left for dead Day 1!</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">It is now Night 1.

You take a quick shower, dress in casual day clothing, and walk downstairs. You scream in terror.<br><br>The other 9 guests run downstairs to see what has happened. They are welcomed to the sight of Rhinox, a well built and muscular man, hanging from the chandelier by his leg. His stomach was cut open and his intestines were dangling down, dripping blood onto the floor.<br><br>After cleaning up the body (and finding the key on his person), cleaning up the floor and throwing Rhinox into the basement, you open the door to his room. Although it's very messy and disheveled, you find absolutely no traces of mafia activity. You walk downstairs and open up the safe to find his pictures.<br><br>There are two pictures of him.

I took it into account, considered it, and found it not worth keeping. I don't see much info to be had from the \"buddying with SK\" tell personally.

I actually was not much of a fan of the Gud wagon at all, though I'll admit after the dual personality thing if I'd been on in time I probably would have voted him as well. As such, I'm much less suspicious of those after the dual personality and much more those who leapt on beforehand when the wagon was clearly just a VI run up to my mind. Scum knew they could get on and not be questioned for it. AGar falls in that field, and I said as much then and haven't seen a reason to change that opinion now."}

That post was the straw that broke the camels back then. You're basing a vote based off of us having a differing view on theory behind optimal town play. I don't think his play in claiming SK was VI-like at all, honestly, since you want to delve into a theory based vote. Gud had just been playing in a manner that furthered a win-condition of an anti-town faction rather than a pro-town faction throughout the day. But not VI-like. Look at Gud's Iso #33, where he explains why he claimed SK. While I still don't agree it was an optimal town play, and the confusion furthered the cause of scum rather than town, he provides a level of thought and analysis that a player like DMSIS or Furcolow or any other VI would be capable of producing. VIs generally play mindlessly. <br><br>So if you think my vote was running up a VI, try again.

Committing an action that would propel your own mislynch is anti-town at best, and a massive WIFOM trap waiting to happen, and you know it as well as I do. Creating WIFOM traps like that is not what a town player should be doing. They cause confusion. Claiming an anti-town, third party role also creates confusion. Causing confusion is only a benefit to non-town players. Therefore, Gud was acting in a way that only benefitted either mafia or 3rd party roles.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you lynch people who appear to be scum.

It's not that difficult.<br><br>I did pay attention to your questions, and I think I answered them well. Just because something doesn't appear to directly further a scum agenda, doesn't make it a townie player. If scum-driven actions were the only way to find scum, either the scum were playing really poorly, or we'd never catch scum. Scum's objective is to blend in, why wouldn't they make the plays that could be seem town-driven, or at least not scum-driven.<br><br>The other scum on the wagon are between Reckamonic, Sera and PR I believe. I'd say one of them only, that wagon took way too long after the claim to be driven by 2-3 scum. Recka and PR are my heavier reads, less serious on Sera, Sera mostly because of timing + the post in which he hopped on, where he thought only \"Claim SK = Lynch\". Recka was on before it, and echoed the Sera sentiments essentially when the SK claim came about, while PR's voting post and what seemed to be his main reasoning was awful, and as flimsy as paper mache.<br><br>Also, I can agree with Confid (although his hammer looks terrible), but not on Sims, in terms of the wagon analysis alone. Sims hopped on that lynch fairly easily and before the whole dual-personality bit, and the post your highlighting was simply rhetoric. <br><br>Agreeing with the idea that CC is looking quite awful right now."}

In retrospect, though, he didn't pursue the SS vote any further after Thor provided a convenient reason to vote Powerrox, which AGar happily parroted while also laying down some weird FoS on Thor\u2026 immediately after agreeing with his position on Powerrox. You'll see in our first big catchup <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2669905#p2669905\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> that we noted AGar's agreement with Thor's case on Powerrox caused us to raise our eyebrows. But he still leaves a door open to hop back on the SS wagon if need be, when given the opportunity later on <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2667556#p2667556\" class=\"postlink\">by Blood Queen</a>.<br><br>His <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2663136#p2663136\" class=\"postlink\">original reason</a> for voting Guderan was due to\u2026 well, we're not sure, exactly. He says it's because it's scummy to state how Gud expected a three-man scumteam to behave, but never explains why, exactly, that is scummy. We don't even think AGar believed it himself. That's why <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2664746#p2664746\" class=\"postlink\">Rhinox had to remind him to change his vote</a>.<br><br>This is more speculation than anything concrete, but his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2663144#p2663144\" class=\"postlink\">PBPA of SS/CC's back-and-forth</a> has the potential to be \"trying to appear helpful/town\" instead of actual pro-towniness.<br><br>The way he quickly bails on this, as he puts it, \"fruitful\" wagon on Guderian <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in the very same post where he votes for him</span> is complete and utter bullshit. He gives no reason in the post\u2026 he just narrows it down to four potential scum, then votes one of them. However, when he sees he can easily rejoin the Guderian wagon, first he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2671525#p2671525\" class=\"postlink\">sits on the fence</a>, then RANDOMLY shows up later on, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2673498#p2673498\" class=\"postlink\">quotes one of Gud's posts</a>, and just declares him as scum out of nowhere. He wanted to get his vote back on Gud, but didn't wanna catch any heat in wagon hopping so blatantly again, so he needed that \"cushion\" post to ease the blow.<br><br>By the end of D1, AGar had expressed a willingness to lynch Guderian, Singer, sims, and Blood Queen. He never took a hard stance on any one of them and instead remained mostly fluid, bouncing from wagon to wagon, until eventually feeling comfortable sitting on the Guderian wagon while still throwing suspicion towards everyone else should he need to make a quick escape. Then he has the gall to come in D2 and state\u2026 wait, just let me quote his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2684922#p2684922\" class=\"postlink\">iso 24</a> for everyone:<br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite>My top suspects are undecided at this point, for those wondering. I need to re-read this, as I feel I was potentially barking way up the wrong tree yesterday.</div></blockquote><br><br>Translation: I'm scum who played like shit D1, so I need time to let the rest of you come up with another case for me to parrot and wagon.<br><br>Eventually, today, he laid down a vote on Carrotcake, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">after</span> he had a wagon going on him and his hand was forced. Looking through his post, there is very little active scumhunting or case-making. It's mostly flippant declarations of who is scummy and who is townie with very little reasoning put behind it, or him being defensive, or some kind of meta/theory discussion. This is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> how real townies play - this is how scumbags play when they're trying to appear town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dramatic confirmation vote, complete with waving of hands: AGar</span>"}

Those ideas contradict because if she doesn't think it matters, what's the point of asking?

More arguments erupted between the guests, when after a while, one man started to look visibly agitated in a way you haven't seen before.<br><br>AGar, a man with a tough grimace, eventually stopped arguing altogether. The guests started getting more and more suspicious. The votes piled up on this man and eventually came close to a majority.<br><br>The other guests had the rope from the master bedroom with them at this time. They started asking him questions, but with no answers. Eventually, he got up and walked towards the kitchen table slowly and quietly.<br><br>\"If I have to live in a world like this, then I will gladly sit and be chosen. This is no way to live.\"<br><br>The guests watched as he picked up the rope, stood on the table and wrapped it around one of the ceiling planks, and then his neck. One of the guests, astounded by the display of behavior, could only muster one sentence:<br><br>\"...any last words...?\"<br><br>AGar gave the bloodthirsty crowd a grave stare.<br><br>And then he jumped. Without a sound.<br><br>A check of his room showed nothing but a clean room and a teddy bear. \"Weird...why would he have that with him?\" You say to yourself.<br><br>As you open up the safe, you find his pictures. In one picture, you find a security camera still photo of him robbing a convenience store. In a second, you find him with his child. The setting was grim; they were homeless and they were sitting down for dinner, which consisted of a bag of chips.<br><br>He was only trying to save his son from starvation, otherwise he was a normal, desperate person.<br><br>You feel nothing but nausea and fear as you quietly walk up to your room. Would you be the next target?<br><br>As you sleep, visions of your past come rushing back to you, leaving you in a cold sweat.</span></span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">AGar, </span></span><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, hung quietly Day 2!</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">It is now Night 2.

Someone was missing, and everyone was very quiet.<br><br>\"Hey....where is iamausername?\"<br><br>A guest speaks up.<br><br>\"He's...<br><br>...well, look for yourself. His body is in the basement.\"<br><br>You go and turn on the lights to the basement. Walking downstairs, you see another body piled up with the other ones. iamausername's corpse lays there with a gunshot wound to the stomach.<br><br>The guests speak up before you can turn around. \"We already checked his room. Nothing. He's clean.\"<br><br>\"Well...what did he do?\" you say as you turn around.<br><br>A guest hands you various pictures of computer screenshots containing usernames and chat logs. He was a computer hacker, no more than age 18, and had, for fun, hacked into various governmental databases. A warrant was out for his arrest, but he hadn't done anything with the information. It was just for kicks. That IS what teenagers do.<br><br>\"He was just a kid...\" the guest says to you. <br><br>\"...we need to do something about this. These people aren't out just for the money. It's a game. A sick game to them. This is for sport.\"<br><br>You gather upstairs. Taking a bottle of rum, you take shot after shot to block out the past few days and the sick things that you have seen. These people aren't only criminals...they're just like you. They've all made mistakes. They were trying to make things better, doing things they couldn't control. These people need help.<br><br>And maybe so do you.<br><br>You put down the bottle and start the conversations again. At least the weather is starting to become nice...but it's still far too cold to walk for help.<br><br>Besides, as long as you're here, you realize that it's not about clearing your name any longer.

As I said, we really do need to look at that mothrax targeting after the massclaim. It's an odd choice for scum in my opinion, and if Seraph is town it was an odd gut too and he needs to come out with some effort towards figuring out what his gut picked up on.<br><br>@Reck - one of your heads appears to have a theatrics read on Seraphim as part of his meta.

It's also a bit of a bad scum with a guilty claim, since if he's lying about the power, there are plenty of things that could've targetted mothrax last night and fucked everything up. And since nothing but vanilla townies have claimed at this point, there was plenty of possibility for things. Then, there's the fact he was counterclaimed. Again, Watcher isn't the most common of roles, and I think the chances of scumSeraphim choosing an investigative role that was already in the town, especially since it's a watcher, is pretty unlikely.<br><br>Then, there's singer's reaction to Seraphim's claim.

The most recent lylo I was in as town was Newbie 955 - I was the first vote that day. My logic, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2406142#p2406142\" class=\"postlink\">was here</a> Looks like the same general mindset of aggressiveness and/or annoyance at slow days as I played up in my last two scum game lylos. I will note the reason I play scum so well is because I play scum like I play town, indeed I basically forget I'm scum whenever I play scum - I personally try to avoid doing anything as scum that I wouldn't also do as town, and use the same sort of logic and cases I do as town. So simply because I'm aggressive in lylo as scum doesn't mean that I would be unaggressive as town. In fact, I tend to believe it means the opposite. When I have clear logic to drive my vote I am aggressive, when I am unsure I play more reserved. I think that's pretty clear and comes across as how I play in all my games, town or scum. It's up to you to look at the rest of my play and figure out if this is Thorscum or Thortown.<br><br>I'd also advise you to look at Reck and Nacho at the same time. I am very content to be compared to their play this game."}

But balance wise I just can't accept the 1-shot neighbor and Watcher vs. 2 goons and 1 RBer as balanced.

The guests showed signs of weariness, and although the weather finally became warmer and melted the snow outside, no one dare to leave the house. The barbaric proceedings went on as planned.<br><br>Eventually, between the 5 people left standing, votes started piling up against a man known as Nachomamma. Everyone recognized him as the retired police officer who had used too much force when arresting a man, therefore effectively forcing his resignation. As the votes became majority, he had a solemn grimace on his face.<br><br>You bring the rope from the kitchen and tie it up. But as you're doing that...<br><br>\"Stop.\"<br><br>You all take a look at him.<br><br>\"I have a little more to say than those other fools who were killed by the little game that we're playing.\"<br><br>He stared straight at you as the other guests shuffled him on top of the bar and put the noose around his neck.<br><br>\"I know you have no clue who I am, but I assure you...you should. And you will remember me, long after I'm gone.\"<br><br>\"...what are you talking about?\"<br><br>\"The man you ran over...\"<br><br>Your eyes go wide.<br><br>\"...the man you paralyzed...\"<br><br>You feel nauseous.<br><br>\"...he was my son.\"<br><br>Everyone turns to look at you. Rage and fear fill your heart.<br><br>\"And you...all of you...deserve this. You may think your crimes are accidental and you may think that they were out of your control...but you have no clue. None of you. To the others, this may be a game. It may be a huge paycheck, but to me, you all deserve to die. You and everyone like you. You may think we're the villains...but who are the REAL villains here? Huh?\"<br><br>This man was a crooked cop. Part of the mafia you were hunting.<br><br>\"It wasn't my fault..\" you say. \"...none of it was. He ran out into the street....\"<br><br>He laughs at you. You continue.<br><br>\"...Look, you may have a twisted view on what should be punished, but those people downstairs...those rotting corpses. None of them deserved what went on this week. Your friends might think their little paycheck and game is cool, and you might think we deserve vigilante justice...but look at the level you're on right now. We may be looking for revenge, but at least we don't kill people for sport.\"<br><br>You run up and push him off of the bar.<br><br>As the life slowly drains out of him, you stare him in the eye with rage.<br><br>\"We deserve a second chance. You do not.\"<br><br>His body lies limp.<br><br><br><br><br>For the rest of the night, you stay absolutely silent. The rest of the guests put his body into the cellar, and then check his room; inside, you find a gun, a badge and interrogation equipment. This man wasn't an ordinary mafioso...<br><br><br><br>The rest of the guests go to their rooms to sleep. This still wasn't over. Another day of arguments, stress and anger lay ahead.<br><br><br>While the rest of the guests slept, all you can do is sit with your back against the wall, staring at the door, deep in thought.</span></span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Nachomamma8, </span></span><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Rolecop</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, lynched Day 5.</span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">It is now Night 5.

Overall, I tweaked it so that there would be a reliance on scumhunting over power roles. Scum became very well off in the beginning due to the cop on Carrotcake, but they failed to use that appropriately. A pre-counterclaim was a risky maneuver that didn't really go their way, and the reactions of scum to Sera's fake claim created an avalanche of information that town was able to use against them. Both teams did great, however. There was absolutely nothing Reck could do.<br><br>The JKer is in the same boat; If the JKer is able to stop a kill, no real information is gained, unless it's at endgame. Both the cop and the JKer are relatively useless roles until it is early game and late game, respectively. The watcher balances out the two other goons, and I personally think the Watcher is stronger than a tracker.<br><br>As far as my mod error goes, I flipped Rhinox before Carrotcake got a chance to send in her action, thinking she was late to send it in, however, I flipped a day early. It made no difference, however; Carrotcake never sent in her action even a day after the deadline. Nothing was affected.<br><br>The reviewers of the setup were Hoopla, JDodge, mykonian, SpyreX, Plum and Slaxx. We think it's relatively balanced, but I understand concerns that it wouldn't be, from both sides. It doesn't look balanced at first, but remember the specifics and the idea behind it. Scum was very powerful, but their claim did them in, even though it was a clever idea, it wasn't very organized. <br><br>You have to remember that an all goon team vs a town team with a Doctor or a Tracker is considered moderately balanced, at least in our opinion. Again, both the rolecop and the JKer can be used to the team's advantage and to the team's disadvantage."}

As I pointed out, Nacho self-hammering when he hit L-1 or shortly thereafter might have completely saved the game. Recka (I'm assuming Reck was the dominant personality in this game - it seemed it quite often) wouldn't have had the opportunity to slip in the nature in which he did. PR might've JKed someone else, kill gone through and then a different LYLO. <br><br>Scum was a bit slighted, but not enough that it affected the game's outcome. Neighborizer didn't do anything, and I don't think Lat got a successful watch off, so the only role that played a part at all was the JK, which only came through at the end to bite them. If Nacho had investigated PR on N2, this game would've gone in a completely different direction, I think.<br><br>Why did Nacho investigate Recka on N4? o.O"}
