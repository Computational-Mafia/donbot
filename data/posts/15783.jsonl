Recently, you've gotten letter in the mail, saying that you and a few select others have been chosen to attend a dinner party for a \"close relative\". Funny...it didn't really mention a name, but hey; you never pass up free food and a chance to enjoy life with family. But the drive seemed like hours....4 or 5 to be exact. Plus, it's snowing pretty hard...you've heard of a storm coming this way and strove to try to beat it. Regardless, it's freezing cold, and it's starting to put you asleep.<br>\n<br>\nFeeling grateful that you have the car, you finally come across a giant mansion-like cabin. \"Wow...this place is huge! How many bedrooms does this place have...12?\" you say to yourself. As you pull in, you notice that there are other cars in the driveway as well. \"Weird...I don't remember having this many relatives...\"<br>\n<br>\nYou unpack your things from the car and knock on the front door. The door is opened by a tall man in a butler's uniform.<br>\n<br>\n\"Yes...?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Hey...uh, I got a letter in the mail about a dinner party being held by a relative of mine..\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Oh yes! You're one of the guests! Please, come in, sir. Let me take your bag for you.\"<br>\n<br>\nAs you walk in, you are in awe at the interior of the cabin. A giant kitchen sits to the left of you, complete with it's own pantry and dining table. A fireplace glows on the opposite side. Stairs leading up to various floors are straight ahead of you. Finally, you notice the butterfly painting above the fireplace. You take your coat off walk over to it to examine it.<br>\n<br>\nYou whisper the description of the painting to yourself. \"Mariposa Peak....otherwise known as Butterfly Mountain. A cozy cocoon during the winter and a beautifully fresh summer.\"<br>\n<br>\nHow tacky. Suddenly, you hear footsteps coming from the kitchen. 11 men and women shuffle out...but something's wrong. You don't recognize any of them. They look just as confused as you do.<br>\n<br>\nThe butler raises his hand to get everyone's attention. \"Hello, distinguished guests. My name is Bradley, and I'm the butler here at Mariposa Peak manor. I hope you all are having a wonderful morning, and we shall start our festivities later in the afternoon, but first, I invite you to get your keys for your rooms.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Rooms?\" you say. \"I don't remember this being an overnight stay...\"<br>\n<br>\n\"I wouldn't worry about that, good sir. There will be many surprises yet to come, and trust me when I say, they will be rather...unexpected to say the least. There is a full wardrobe in each room to fit your needs. Please, dress in the finest attire, then meet me down in the kitchen, if you would.\"<br>\n<br>\nAs you pick up the keys to your room, you can't help but to feel a little freaked out about the situation. You walk upstairs, find your room number, and open the door. Bradley was right; over by the window is a huge wardrobe filled with various suits, nightclothes, day clothes, you name it, it has it. As you dress into the finest suit you can find, a scream fills the cabin. Suddenly, you rush downstairs to the main hall!<br>\n<br>\nBradley is on the ground, his throat sliced, his face in a twisted apparition of horror. As you run out of the cabin in a frenzied state of panic, you notice something else....everyone's tires has been slashed!<br>\n<br>\n\"There is NO WAY we can walk back to town from here, especially with the storm coming...\" you say to yourself, and walk back into the cabin. You notice something else about Bradley as well; in his hand, he is clutching a note.<br>\n<br>\n\"Hello, guests...we are the Mariposa Peak Mafia, and we have noticed that you've been doing a little sinning of your own. If you notice, you will find a key to the safe in Bradley's pocket. Please, I invite you to fulfill your curiosities...\"<br>\n<br>\nYou grab the key from his pocket, and open the safe in the corner of the room. Inside, you find photographs of the various guests in VERY demeaning positions, committing various crimes. They are all shocked and horrified at each other as the pictures are passed around and then finally returned to the vault. Inside, there is another note.<br>\n<br>\n\"Now that you know of your crimes, you realize why we have invited you all here...to make a buck or two off of your misdeeds. But that's not all; we like a little challenge with our blackmail...it's no fun if the victims submit so easily, so here is what we propose to you. Either we can blackmail you with the copies to these photos, reveal them to the public...or we can play a game. The ones responsible for these pictures are hidden in the group of guests this very moment. If you'd like, you can provide a little...vigilante justice, if you know what I mean. There is rope in the master bedroom. Use Bradley's key. The choice is yours, and happy hunting!<br>\n<br>\n-MP Mafia\"<br>\n<br>\nYou turn to the other guests, scanning their faces. You suggest that the only logical way to play their game is to take a majority vote, kill them where they stand, and then search their rooms with their keys. Surely the guilty ones will have evidence in their rooms.<br>\n<br>\nThe other guests agree. Suddenly, arguments broke out, and the race was off. The game was started. Someone had to die.<br>\n<br>\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\n</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">Bradley, </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">The Butler</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">, throat sliced Day 1!</div><br>\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\nDay 1:<br>\nDay 1 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2660747#p2660747\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2677684#p2677684\" class=\"postlink\">Ends</a><br>\nDay 2 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2683353#p2683353\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2714186#p2714186\" class=\"postlink\">Ends</a><br>\nDay 3 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2720697#p2720697\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2723540#p2723540\" class=\"postlink\">Ends</a><br>\nDay 4 <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2729235#p2729235\" class=\"postlink\">Starts</a><br>\n<br>\n_________________________________________<br>\n<br>\nKey:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Blue</div> = NPC<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Red</div> = Mafia<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">Purple</div> = Third Party<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Green</div> = Town<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#808080\">Silver</div> = Modkilled Neutral Survivor<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Living Players</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">1. singersigner, Vanilla Townie<br>\n4.

No lynch occurs when half (majority when half is not possible) of the players vote for it.<br>\n3. Please bold your votes and unvotes or else they don't count. You don't need to unvote, but I'd like it.<br>\n4. Don't talk in real life about the game.<br>\n5. No secret messages using size tags or other trickery.<br>\n6. Don't quote my PMs, fake or not. You can quote my in-thread posts.<br>\n7. If you're the lynchee, don't talk. If you're dead, you're dead; don't talk. As much as I like zombie movies, this is my world, and as such, there will be no living dead, and therefore, no \"Bah!\" post.<br>\n8. You can talk in twilight unless you're the lynchee.<br>\n9. Don't use personal attacks.<br>\n10. If I make a mistake, let me know.<br>\n11. I'll vote count every page, but if I slack, let me know.<br>\n12. Please use V/LA if you aren't going to post within 2 days.<br>\n13. I'll prod you if you don't post after 2 days. 3 prods and I'm replacing you.<br>\n14. You can leave the game if you wish, but don't do it jokingly.<br>\n15. Days are 2 weeks. Extensions are 3 days, and you can vote for them.<br>\n16. I'm the mod. Whatever I say, goes.<br>\n17. I post in bolded purple, so don't use it. Other colors are ok.<br>\n18. Modkills turn you into Neutral Survivor. They end the day if the modkilled player is town, they do NOT end the day if he/she is scum.<br>\n19. Play to your wincon. I'll be the judge of that, and I'm pretty reasonable on judging actions either playing to or against wincon. Voting for yourself to play towards your win-con is okay; outing scumbuddies and self-hammering for fun is not.<br>\n20. Don't post elsewhere on mafiascum about this thread, and don't quote anything from the game in your signature until the game is over IF it has to do with core game content.<br>\n21.

By claiming that my statement that he singled me out was uncalled for, you implied that you disagreed.  When you questioned what his motivation for \"singling\" anyone out D1 was, you again implied that you disagreed this is what he was doing.  Why was it so wrong that I was questioning him, when here you can't admit that you didn't actually think he was singling me out?<br>\n2.  What?  Are those quotes implying that's what I meant?  Answering loaded questions are at the discretion of the individual.  I was wondering if that was your reasoning for not having answered yet.  I'm still not quite sure if you answered the question he was actually asking.  Seemed a little jilted to me...<br>\n3.  Misrep:  I wouldn't say it was exaggerated OR unwilling to answer.

The meat of it on D1 is that a wagon on Uite gained ground very, very quickly. Up to L-2, with some bussing influence (Thor). Zoneace (Uite &amp; Thor's scumbuddy) found a weak reason to attack town player (MPR) and tried to push the wagon. It backfired in the fact that ZA got himself lynched instead, but it clearly illustrates the same pattern of behavior I see here - scum A makes some kind of slip, after some pressure gathers, scum B hops on. Scum C sees Scum A's wagon take off and panics, and tries to counter-wagon to save Scum A. Also note that Thor pulled out in time to preserve Uite, but sacrificed Zoneace instead. But again, a similar behavior is illustrated in Gud, who hopped off of your wagon as the counter is presented, but moved to Thor instead.<br>\n<br>\nReckamonic, Sera - Both slots have a decent bit of experience here, so I'm interested in your input here.", "time": "Thu Dec 09, 2010 7:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15783&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "15783"}

Thinking about sims's play disconnected from the exchange we were in made me see things a little differently.

Also, don't forget that if Guderian is the SK and this is some bizarre gambit, this is a 8:3:1 or 9:2:1 and if we mislynch town today, we are in a much worse position.

I'll use confid's post here as a launch point because its a basic summary of what I want to talk about.<br>\n<br>\nThis is regarding Agar's case on BQ:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>confidanon wrote:</cite>If he were saying \"Lynch Blood Queen. If Town, lynch ConfidAnon. If scum, lynch sims,\" it would be more suspect because he's trying to lead up a lynch with another lynch regardless of what happens. But in this game, his suspicion of Blood Queen directly stems from what he views as Blood Queen's protection (from joining the AGar wagon) of sims. While I'm not sure pursuing a lynch this early based purely on voting patterns and not on individual scumminess is the best course of action, saying \"Lynch Blood Queen. If scum, lynch sims. If not scum, I'll reread sims\" is not scummy - it's a logical continuation of his viewpoint.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is wrong. Agar's case on bloodqueen is dependent on the assumption that sims is scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe logic should be: lynch sims. if sims-scum, lynch BQ. If sims-town, then there is no case on BQ.<br>\n<br>\nIt does not follow in reverse. If BQ is scum, it does not follow that sims is any more likely to be scum, and if BQ is town, it does not say anything about sims' allignment.<br>\n<br>\nI feel this is a strike 2 for Agar. First was pushing Gud's lynch without voting. I fear it is possible scum-agar could be setting up the potential for 2 mislynches. After BQ-town, sims can still be lynched later on because a BQ-town flip would not say anything about sims' allignment. While in reverse, a sims-town flip completely obliterates Agar's case on BQ.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2668573#p2668573\" class=\"postlink\">#167</a>, Agar is claiming it's the other way around. I don't buy it because Agar suspected BQ of voting to prevent the lynch of scumpartner-sims - aka BQ is scum is supported if sims is scum, not the other way around.<br>\n<br>\nAgar's appeal to authority might just be strike 3. I don't care how many games he's played, that doesn't make him a better scum hunter. By that metric, zwets would pwn us all. I think Agar is taking advantage of the fact that half the players in this game (and the majority of the most active posters currently) are new-er-ish.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI can't even begin to comprehend the last couple pages.

Almost every game. <br>\n<br>\nWhat does that mean. Should the status quo continue, me and the town are likely to lose this game. Its raw numbers. Debate it all you want. If we played the 'normal' way, heres what usually happens.<br>\n<br>\nDay 1: Usually a noob/VI/person people dont like, is lynched. This is a subtle policy lynch. People aren't overt or even conscious about it. But one little 'scumslip' is magnified, and the town pounces.

Never happens.<br>\n<br>\nN1: Random person killed<br>\n<br>\nDay 2: Analysis over the townie killing. Who was on the wagon! Usually, its just some misguided town and maybe a scum or two. Usually not that many. They dont have to provoke town into lynching. So after much debate, it comes down to two people, one a questionable townie, one scum. Townie, perhaps is lynched.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3-5 # days or lylo. Good luck.<br>\n<br>\nSo what did I do? Something scum never want to have happen. I obliterated the status quo. I rocked the boat.

To hope that maybe, town can win this one.<br>\n<br>\nFrom this, I believe we have gotten some of what we wanted.

Someone brought a dry-erase board from the kitchen, put it up on the wall, and was taking a tally of the votes of who should die. Many people put up good cases, many people put up bad cases, but one person's behavior stood out more than the rest.<br>\n<br>\nMr. Guderian, a mild mannered yet paranoid man, kept eyeing the the safe in the corner of the room constantly. Soon enough, people started dropping their fights with one another and noticing his constant double-takes towards the safe. \"Uh....hello, sir? Why do you keep looking over by the safe?\" said one guest.<br>\n<br>\n\"Huh? Oh...uh....it's...it's nothing. Lets just keep going. I don't like this guy's attitude beca-\"<br>\n<br>\n\"No, seriously.\" You cut him off. \"You seem to be interested in that safe for some reason...\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Guys....come on, I was just...I dunno, I've never seen a safe that big before in my life, so I....\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Do you have something to hide?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Uh.....um.....guys, come on...\" His voice started to get weak and frail. He started saying less and less.<br>\n<br>\n\"Which photo was yours? What did you do?\" said another guest.<br>\n<br>\n\"Heh, I bet he killed somebody or something, that's why he's so paranoid about it.\" joked another.<br>\n<br>\nOut of nowhere, a wave of panic set over Mr. Guderian's face due to the paranoia. Everyone stared at him.<br>\n<br>\n\"....guys, seriously, it's not what you think.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe guests burst out in anger towards this man in reaction to the statement. Many people shouted, like an angry mob. \"MURDERER! HEATHEN! KILL HIM, HE NEEDS TO DIE!\"<br>\n<br>\nMr. Guderian turned and ran up the stairs. You and the rest of the crowd chased him down, but little did you know that a guest ran into the kitchen, picked up a steak knife, and joined the crowd. You cornered him at the end of the hallway.<br>\n<br>\n\"What have you done?!?! Why are you so paranoid!?!?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"GUYS, I didn't do anything! I swear, I'm innocent! Stop this, right now!\" said the confused man. \"If you don't.....I SWEAR, I'LL SHOOT YOU!\"<br>\n<br>\nHe puts his hand under his shirt to act as if he has a gun. The rest of you stare at him like he has three heads.<br>\n<br>\n\"This is ridiculous. He needs to die!\" said one person in the mob. Suddenly, a hand came out from the crowd and grabbed Mr. Guderian's sleeve. He was pulled into the crowd. People started punching him, choking him, holding him so others can get at him. You stand back in horror. He was pushed back and forth, and into the knife of the person who grabbed it in the kitchen. He screams out in pain. After being stabbed multiple times, he loses strength and collapses. The mob picks him up and carries him down the stairs, leaving a trail of blood. They open the front door to the cabin and toss him outside, locking the door behind him. He runs up to the window, bleeding to death.<br>\n<br>\n\"GUYS! I didn't murder anyone! I didn't do ANYTHING! I'm just..I...oh god...it's so cold, let me in! I swear, you guys will pay! I swear...\"<br>\n<br>\nHe pounds on the reinforced window, whimpering. Random screaming and crying followed. Two guests held the door shut, while the rest of you waited for his inevitable death.<br>\n<br>\n*pound pound pound*<br>\n<br>\n\"STOP IT, GUDERIAN. We're not letting you in!!\" You yell out in a panic.<br>\n<br>\n\"...hahaha...I'm sorry....Guderian's not in at the moment...this is his brother...if you'd like to leave a message...please do so at the sound of the beep.<br>\n<br>\n...beeep.\"<br>\n<br>\nThen silence. The crowd freezes in horror. It's obvious that the paranoia and fear of death turned him insane.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThree hours pass...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBy this time, the snow had piled up to a couple of feet, and the thermometer showed -10 degrees farenheit. The crying, pounding and screaming had stopped long before, but you decided not to risk opening the door. You finally gain the strength to open it up and check his frozen and bloodied body for the key. You climb upstairs, open the door to his room.....and find it impeccably clean. A made bed. Everything neatly tucked away. No guns. No notes. No technology...just the room of a simple man.<br>\n<br>\nIn a panic, you run downstairs, unlock the safe, and pull out the pictures. Finally, you find the one of the man fitting Mr. Guderian's description.<br>\n<br>\nIn it, he is caught jaywalking. Not a murderer at all. Just a man with a history of paranoid fits.<br>\n<br>\nTears well up in a few of the guests' eyes. You hang your head in shame. One person vomits.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter throwing the two bodies into the cellar, you open up a bottle of Jack, pour yourself a shot and turn to the guests.<br>\n<br>\n\"We need to take this night to rest...we've obviously lost focus of what needs to be done and who is at fault. I suggest that all of you go to your rooms and get a good night's sleep.\" The rest of the crowd agrees. You all walk up to your rooms. In your room, you go to lock your door...but notice that there's no lock on the inside. Locking the door from the outside doesn't allow you to close the door.<br>\n<br>\n\"Who the hell designed this cabin? It's like it's designed to have people invade your space...\" you say to yourself, as a slowly creeping panic flows over you. You realize that everyone has access to your room.<br>\n<br>\nYou stare at the ceiling, in fear that something will happen to you. Your eyes do not shut once that night.</div></div></div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">Guderian, </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Vanilla Townie</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">, stabbed and left for dead Day 1!</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">It is now Night 1.

You look at the clock.<br>\n<br>\n8 AM. Early morning. <br>\n<br>\nSomehow, when fearing for your life, the nightmares have melded into your consciousness and you passed out from sheer exhaustion. You have a raging headache and feel like you got run over by a truck.<br>\n<br>\nYou notice that you are starving, however. You haven't eaten since lunch yesterday. You take a quick shower, dress in casual day clothing, and walk downstairs. You scream in terror.<br>\n<br>\nThe other 9 guests run downstairs to see what has happened. They are welcomed to the sight of Rhinox, a well built and muscular man, hanging from the chandelier by his leg. His stomach was cut open and his intestines were dangling down, dripping blood onto the floor.<br>\n<br>\nAfter cleaning up the body (and finding the key on his person), cleaning up the floor and throwing Rhinox into the basement, you open the door to his room. Although it's very messy and disheveled, you find absolutely no traces of mafia activity. You walk downstairs and open up the safe to find his pictures.<br>\n<br>\nThere are two pictures of him. In one, he is taking steroids in the comfort of his home. In the other, he is hurting his wife.<br>\n<br>\nSteroid rage. You almost were glad that he was dead, and then you remember that he was in the same position as you...besides, you're no saint either. The last day was a blur, but you try to keep your thoughts focused and try not to think of the past...<br>\n<br>\n...suddenly, screams and yells interrupt your daze.

I don't think his play in claiming SK was VI-like at all, honestly, since you want to delve into a theory based vote. Gud had just been playing in a manner that furthered a win-condition of an anti-town faction rather than a pro-town faction throughout the day. But not VI-like. Look at Gud's Iso #33, where he explains why he claimed SK. While I still don't agree it was an optimal town play, and the confusion furthered the cause of scum rather than town, he provides a level of thought and analysis that a player like DMSIS or Furcolow or any other VI would be capable of producing. VIs generally play mindlessly. <br>\n<br>\nSo if you think my vote was running up a VI, try again. I voted him for general non-productive behavior for the town and anti-town actions such as causing mass confusion with an anti-town role claim which benefitted the scum in removing the spotlight from anyone else and forcing it on him while also propelling his own mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nDo you level with me now?", "time": "Tue Dec 21, 2010 12:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15783&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "15783"}

Committing an action that would propel your own mislynch is anti-town at best, and a massive WIFOM trap waiting to happen, and you know it as well as I do. Creating WIFOM traps like that is not what a town player should be doing. They cause confusion. Claiming an anti-town, third party role also creates confusion. Causing confusion is only a benefit to non-town players. Therefore, Gud was acting in a way that only benefitted either mafia or 3rd party roles.<br>\n<br>\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but you lynch people who appear to be scum. One way to appear to be scum is to be acting in direct contradiction to how a town player should be acting. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure how you're not following this logic. It's not that difficult.<br>\n<br>\nI did pay attention to your questions, and I think I answered them well. Just because something doesn't appear to directly further a scum agenda, doesn't make it a townie player. If scum-driven actions were the only way to find scum, either the scum were playing really poorly, or we'd never catch scum. Scum's objective is to blend in, why wouldn't they make the plays that could be seem town-driven, or at least not scum-driven.<br>\n<br>\nThe other scum on the wagon are between Reckamonic, Sera and PR I believe. I'd say one of them only, that wagon took way too long after the claim to be driven by 2-3 scum. Recka and PR are my heavier reads, less serious on Sera, Sera mostly because of timing + the post in which he hopped on, where he thought only \"Claim SK = Lynch\". Recka was on before it, and echoed the Sera sentiments essentially when the SK claim came about, while PR's voting post and what seemed to be his main reasoning was awful, and as flimsy as paper mache.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I can agree with Confid (although his hammer looks terrible), but not on Sims, in terms of the wagon analysis alone. Sims hopped on that lynch fairly easily and before the whole dual-personality bit, and the post your highlighting was simply rhetoric. <br>\n<br>\nAgreeing with the idea that CC is looking quite awful right now.", "time": "Wed Dec 22, 2010 1:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15783&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "15783"}

{"number": 440, "id": "2698476", "user": "Reckamonic", "user_id": "14262", "content": "Here's what has us bugged about AGar:<br>\n<br>\nEarly on, his policy vote on Singersigner didn't sit well with us, but we managed to chalk it up to RVS nonsense. In retrospect, though, he didn't pursue the SS vote any further after Thor provided a convenient reason to vote Powerrox, which AGar happily parroted while also laying down some weird FoS on Thor&#8230; immediately after agreeing with his position on Powerrox. You'll see in our first big catchup <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2669905#p2669905\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> that we noted AGar's agreement with Thor's case on Powerrox caused us to raise our eyebrows. But he still leaves a door open to hop back on the SS wagon if need be, when given the opportunity later on <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2667556#p2667556\" class=\"postlink\">by Blood Queen</a>.<br>\n<br>\nHis <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2663136#p2663136\" class=\"postlink\">original reason</a> for voting Guderan was due to&#8230; well, we're not sure, exactly. He says it's because it's scummy to state how Gud expected a three-man scumteam to behave, but never explains why, exactly, that is scummy. We don't even think AGar believed it himself. That's why <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2664746#p2664746\" class=\"postlink\">Rhinox had to remind him to change his vote</a>.<br>\n<br>\nThis is more speculation than anything concrete, but his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2663144#p2663144\" class=\"postlink\">PBPA of SS/CC's back-and-forth</a> has the potential to be \"trying to appear helpful/town\" instead of actual pro-towniness.<br>\n<br>\nThe way he quickly bails on this, as he puts it, \"fruitful\" wagon on Guderian <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">in the very same post where he votes for him</div> is complete and utter bullshit. He gives no reason in the post&#8230; he just narrows it down to four potential scum, then votes one of them. However, when he sees he can easily rejoin the Guderian wagon, first he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2671525#p2671525\" class=\"postlink\">sits on the fence</a>, then RANDOMLY shows up later on, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2673498#p2673498\" class=\"postlink\">quotes one of Gud's posts</a>, and just declares him as scum out of nowhere. He wanted to get his vote back on Gud, but didn't wanna catch any heat in wagon hopping so blatantly again, so he needed that \"cushion\" post to ease the blow.<br>\n<br>\nBy the end of D1, AGar had expressed a willingness to lynch Guderian, Singer, sims, and Blood Queen. He never took a hard stance on any one of them and instead remained mostly fluid, bouncing from wagon to wagon, until eventually feeling comfortable sitting on the Guderian wagon while still throwing suspicion towards everyone else should he need to make a quick escape. Then he has the gall to come in D2 and state&#8230; wait, just let me quote his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2684922#p2684922\" class=\"postlink\">iso 24</a> for everyone:\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite>My top suspects are undecided at this point, for those wondering. I need to re-read this, as I feel I was potentially barking way up the wrong tree yesterday.</div></blockquote>\n\nTranslation: I'm scum who played like shit D1, so I need time to let the rest of you come up with another case for me to parrot and wagon.<br>\n<br>\nEventually, today, he laid down a vote on Carrotcake, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">after</div> he had a wagon going on him and his hand was forced. Looking through his post, there is very little active scumhunting or case-making. It's mostly flippant declarations of who is scummy and who is townie with very little reasoning put behind it, or him being defensive, or some kind of meta/theory discussion. This is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> how real townies play - this is how scumbags play when they're trying to appear town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dramatic confirmation vote, complete with waving of hands: AGar</div>", "time": "Wed Dec 29, 2010 11:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15783&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "15783"}

By your logic, then we should lynch the countered wagonee and if he flips scum, lynch me. If he flips town, I'm out of said suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nNeither way is foolproof, and it may have been naive of me to believe that such a theory held it's own, but based on how the wagons gained such ground - sims with actual seeming intent to lynch, mine with a handful of random votes - it comes across plausibly to me, and I believe I've more than sufficiently explained it.</div></blockquote>\nFirst of all, my logic doesn't push for a lynch based on wagons being evened out like yours does. <br>\nSecond of all, it doesn't make sense for BQ to even out two townie wagons like that because yours was the wagon with the least amount of support. It doesn't make sense from a scum perspective, unless she was trying to frame you (which doesn't make sense), to even out two townie wagons when 1 has serious support behind it and the other is just a bunch of random voters who are behind the time a little. It also doesn't make sense to go after BQ for evening the wagons because there is nothing inherrantly wrong with evening out wagons. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite>Meant to include that the BQ scumread was based off of the timing, nature and attitude of that one vote. That's why I'm laughing at a townread based off of \"posting.\" Scumread wasn't based off of posting, it was based off of the vote and situations surrounding it.</div></blockquote>\nYou based an entire scumread off a single vote, on you, that just occured a little after the RVS? If so, you really shouldn't be calling anyone's reasoning weak. <br>\nBut anyways, I found that BQ responded to attacks against her just fine, and her drifting away from the thread didn't seem like she was avoiding anything, just that she was busy/losing interest.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite>and grouping a lot of suspects with mobility. </div></blockquote>\nWhat do you mean by that?

Two major problems throughout though, first we have this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2662912#p2662912\" class=\"postlink\">gem</a> here where she states it doesn't matter if someone had scum motivation for asking her a question or not but she refused to answer a question to find out that motivation? Those ideas contradict because if she doesn't think it matters, what's the point of asking? That's the thing, throughout this argument I don't get the sense she actually does care about someone's alignment. This pattern repeats itself once again after the heated debate in finished, where she drops the whole case without a word till CC brings it up once again.<br>\n<br>\nThat's just weird man, here's the thing, SS was obviously emotionally invested in this argument shown <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2662959#p2662959\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> but when you're that against someone and you think they're scum you don't just drop the case like that, especially when the majority of it she spent her time snapping back at CC with the whole <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">nononnonno you're misrepping me!</div> nonsense. The bottom line is, when you read her side of the debate it comes across as she's purely attacking for the sake of winning, but not because she's trying to evaluate and figure out CC's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing I do like about SS is that she's active and spends a fair amount of her time attacking. But another thing is when she does question, this falls back into the same routine of vicious attacks. I originally liked how she questioned Gud shown <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2674978#p2674978\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> but here when she does get her answers it's the same old thing again.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2676269#p2676269\" class=\"postlink\">Snarky</a> attacks where to the point at the conclusion it actually looks like she's trying to convince Gud himself that he should be lynched, I'm not even sure here if she even does think Gud is scum with the whole <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">hai guy it's liek so cool we have one mislynch</div> line.<br>\n<br>\nNow onto Day 2, her <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2684340#p2684340\" class=\"postlink\">vote</a> is awful.

Of course, I can't completely blame him either.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to be evaluating Later later(ha!)...I have some questions for him below.

My logic, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2406142#p2406142\" class=\"postlink\">was here</a> Looks like the same general mindset of aggressiveness and/or annoyance at slow days as I played up in my last two scum game lylos. I will note the reason I play scum so well is because I play scum like I play town, indeed I basically forget I'm scum whenever I play scum - I personally try to avoid doing anything as scum that I wouldn't also do as town, and use the same sort of logic and cases I do as town. So simply because I'm aggressive in lylo as scum doesn't mean that I would be unaggressive as town. In fact, I tend to believe it means the opposite. When I have clear logic to drive my vote I am aggressive, when I am unsure I play more reserved. I think that's pretty clear and comes across as how I play in all my games, town or scum. It's up to you to look at the rest of my play and figure out if this is Thorscum or Thortown.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also advise you to look at Reck and Nacho at the same time.

{"number": 937, "id": "2760489", "user": "DemonHybrid", "user_id": "13667", "content": "Anyway, my thoughts:<br>\n<br>\nThe setup went through a lot of versions. Overall, I tweaked it so that there would be a reliance on scumhunting over power roles. Scum became very well off in the beginning due to the cop on Carrotcake, but they failed to use that appropriately. A pre-counterclaim was a risky maneuver that didn't really go their way, and the reactions of scum to Sera's fake claim created an avalanche of information that town was able to use against them. Both teams did great, however. There was absolutely nothing Reck could do.<br>\n<br>\nThe JKer is in the same boat; If the JKer is able to stop a kill, no real information is gained, unless it's at endgame. Both the cop and the JKer are relatively useless roles until it is early game and late game, respectively. The watcher balances out the two other goons, and I personally think the Watcher is stronger than a tracker.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as my mod error goes, I flipped Rhinox before Carrotcake got a chance to send in her action, thinking she was late to send it in, however, I flipped a day early. It made no difference, however; Carrotcake never sent in her action even a day after the deadline. Nothing was affected.<br>\n<br>\nThe reviewers of the setup were Hoopla, JDodge, mykonian, SpyreX, Plum and Slaxx. We think it's relatively balanced, but I understand concerns that it wouldn't be, from both sides. It doesn't look balanced at first, but remember the specifics and the idea behind it. Scum was very powerful, but their claim did them in, even though it was a clever idea, it wasn't very organized. <br>\n<br>\nYou have to remember that an all goon team vs a town team with a Doctor or a Tracker is considered moderately balanced, at least in our opinion. Again, both the rolecop and the JKer can be used to the team's advantage and to the team's disadvantage.", "time": "Sat Jan 29, 2011 6:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15783&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "15783"}
