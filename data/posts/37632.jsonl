All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">general forum rules</a> apply.<br>\n2. Don't directly quote any PM you receive from the mod.<br>\n3. Don't personally insult anyone you're playing with.<br>\n4. You can talk about meta from finished games but NOT ongoing games.<br>\n5. Don't pretend to be me.  (why though??? why would anyone do that)<br>\n<br>\nThese are general rules, and if you break them, I will warn you with a GIF of Nic Cage yelling in despair from me to you:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: If you get this you broke a rule</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/38kEfNh.gif\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div>  If you break them again I will modkill or replace you. <br>\n<br>\nHere's stuff about the game:<br>\n1. If you don't post for approximately two days, I will prod you and will start looking for a replacement if you don't respond in another 24 hours.<br>\n2. Three prods and you're out.  Committed players are exactly what we need here.<br>\n3. If you're going to be V/LA then please post in thread so I know you are going to be away.<br>\n4. Day time will last two weeks max; night time will last two days unless someone asks for it to be longer to which I will grant only one one-day extension.<br>\n5. Vote with the bold or vote tag. (eg. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Caled</span>.) Unvoting is NOT required when SWITCHING votes.<br>\n6. A lynch occurs when more than half the players have voted for the same person.  After that, no one may change their vote.<br>\n7. No role may take more than one action in a single night, unless a mafia power role is the last member of his or her team alive. In that case, that player may use the factional kill and their power role ability on the same night.<br>\n8. If we don't get a majority before deadline then we will have a no-lynch.<br>\n9. After you're dead, please do not post in the thread until the game is over.  (There's going to be a great QT which you can post in though.)<br>\n10. I will use the color <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF4080\">fuchsia</div></div>.  Please don't use the color fuchsia as well.<br>\n11.

I remember in an early scum game I had, I was literally caught on my first post, an RVS post, I don't even remember what was wrong with it but it and my subsequent reaction to it made me get lynched accurately really early on. It's actually to this day why I never participate in RVS, regardless of my alignment.<br>\nI feel like I'm on the other end of that read now. I certainly wasn't the only one who didn't like LeMidget's opening post, but after I failed to explain why I didn't like 26 with more than just using the word \"appeal\" which, admittedly, is a buzz word but is not without meaning and I think I cleared up how in 33. By then, Nikanor had already had what I'm reading as a town knee-jerk reaction to the buzz word, and I'm fine with that. HOWEVER, LeMidget had posted in between Nikanor's vote on me, meaning he had the chance to vote me if he really thought I was scum but didn't until someone else had first (even says it was cuz OMGUS).<br>\nHere's what I see from this: That time I got caught and quicklynched, what made me even more scummy after a bad opening post was that I turned vulnerable and started to ask \"why me?\" because I was inexperienced enough that even when people tried to explain it, I couldn't grasp what was making it so easy for them to read me. This is exactly what LeMidget did here, where instead of getting mad cuz we're wrong or something, he only says \"all I did was...\"<br>\nThat's caught scum.<br>\nIs it a stretch to call that one point I brought up a lie? Maybe but I don't think so. It certainly reads like a misrep at least, and anyway, I got caught up with the same thing when I got ABR lynched in the game he hates me for so there's at least precedent in my town play for that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">My assessment of the votes on me</div><br>\nABR: Has personal vendetta. Worth ignoring. Probably town<br>\nNikanor: Already explained this... town<br>\ncatboi: misguided but assuming 38 is true and he didn't see page 2, he's town just because he thought he was the first person to vote me (besides ABR).<br>\nLeMidget: self-professed OMGUS. needs rope<br>\nbjc: basically parroting catboi. probably scum trying to use the town's apparent willingness to throw votes as an attempt to get on mislynches with no consequences. Has no reason to be as antsy for a hammer as he is in 81 and 90.<br>\n<br>\ndunno about the exchange between 82 and 85. It seems from those posts alone that they're proooobably not on the same team but idk.<br>\nMr Glidder: scum for the same reasons as bjc really. They're probably not together and if I had to pick one I'd go with Mr Glidder. Dunno what town slip RD sees.<br>\nThe Most Curious Thing: Town for holding off on the vote, and actually having his own reasons for thinking I'm scum.<br>\nXLAV: *shrug. null<br>\n<br>\n<br>\noh lol that claim... ok LeMidget is probably town hahaha  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: bjc</div>", "time": "Fri Jan 31, 2014 8:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37632&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "37632"}

We already have one less lynch to work with than normal.  If cat hit scum AND scum had a kill happen it would have left us at 8 alive today, essentially removing a lynch we had to work with.  It actually makes a lot of sense for there to be some second role that could mess with a kill now knowing we have a IC instead of something like masons.

If successful it steals a town lynch as two town and a scum are removed.  If unsuccessful it steals a town lynch as two town are removed.  That role by itself needs town power to balance it.  Just think.  D1 we had three mislynches.  Today we have three.  If there had been a second town death we would have had two.  Its literally a role that costs the town a lynch.

LM was scum.<br>\n<br>\nI think its a decent enough bet that we should have had more than one scum on the wagon.

I would again assume scum on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nABR on both of these, and I think more than just for votes he is scum.<br>\n<br>\n1) His EPM push feels like feigned policy.  I have pushed for policy lynches.  You do not suddenly go \"oh yeah I forgot about them\" or anything like that.  You want them dead.  Your entire purpose is to lay out a case on why they are a horrible person and/or player and convince the rest of the game that they are better with them gone.  ABR just latched onto it and seems to use it as a buffer to not comment on other things.  Its not how town plays policy.<br>\n<br>\n2) His vote on TMCT is bad.  Really bad.  He starts the day saying \"Two of RBD/Quill/Zek/MG\".  Edo replaces in and makes the slot look better, I claim and destroy his logic (more later there) and a wagon on TMCT pops up.  So he, without ANY mention of him up to this point, jumps TMCT?  It feels like scum who forgot what his \"suspicions\" were, and when I called him on it he jumps to MG.<br>\n<br>\n3) His abandonment of TMCT doesn't match his previous play.  EMP claims VT?  Kill it with fire.  LM?  Kill it with fire.  I claim RB?  Kill it with fire.  In a situation where if I cant get lynched scum is going to be in a super tight situation, TMCT claims VT and he... goes away?  To another unclaimed?  His play matches scum who knows they need to figure out what happened to their kill, a very distinct and unexplained difference compared to what happened earlier.<br>\n<br>\n4) His case on me was based purely on something only scum would be able to argue: Balance.  He says we are too strong.  How can he know that as town?  He cant.  What he can know (or at least think) as scum is that the town is too strong and he showed some of his cards by trying to take that stance.  This could easily be something like IC-WV-RB-Doc vs Goon-Goon-Tracker or something, and he thinks that's too town sided, and it came out in his posting.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote ABR</div><br>\n<br>\nBetter wagon is better.<br>\n<br>\nAlso MG was suggesting that there are two scum through his wording early.

That didn't catch my eye initially, to be honest, and even now I don't know that it can be taken as too damning. What's worse about this post (#107) is the way he criticizes EPM for being vague, but he himself hasn't really contributed that much with specificity at this point. Shortly after, LeMidget makes him the only Town read (#129), which almost seems too obvious but is in keeping with LeMidget's play elsewhere, and sheeps his opinions in a number of subsequent posts. And then when LeMidget appears to completely come apart in #196, there's an almost theatrical back and forth between the two of them that feels very staged or facetious (not that they have daytalk and came up with it there, but more that it feels like the way scumpartners would play off each other in this setting, without being able to coordinate)<br>\n<br>\nWhen it coms to the EPM wagon itself, TMCT never really does anything useful initially other than mudsling and set up his play for when EPM flips town.

If there are only two scum I would be hung out to dry either way.  It would be like in an open setup where its an X or Y role existing lynching the player who claimed X with no other claims happening.  It just doesn't make any sense from a logic standpoint because I am all but cleared if there are no other roles.  Look who is pushing for a lynch before anything that would clear me happens: Nik and ABR.  ABR who I have been calling scum and just abandoned my wagon to essentially hammer MG, and Nik who did the exact same thing.  Who would pass on killing me?

Apparently, I'd neglected to get it from my notes to the forum, hence why my vote on him looked more opportunistic than it really was.

{"number": 634, "id": "5695255", "user": "Quill", "user_id": "23360", "content": "Okay, here's the possible scenarios as I'm currently seeing them:<br>\n<br>\n1) We lynch Rainbow, who flips town roleblocker: Immediately, Nikanor and EPM are implicated. Of the two, Nikanor seems most likely to be scum, due to the reasons Rainbow and others have already stated. In this scenario, I'm personally inclined to think Nikanor has been mindgaming us ever since the start of D2, and scum targetted catboi. This would make Curious his likely partner, because the Doc claim implies Curious is town. But either way, Nik would be the smart follow-up lynch.<br>\n<br>\n2) We lynch Rainbow, who flips scum and/or scum roleblocker: Nikanor is confirmed doc, Curious is all-but-confirmed town. This leaves EPM and ABR. I'd be a little wary about going after ABR based on the case Rainbow hammered out earlier, but he seems to make more sense in the aggregate.<br>\n<br>\n3) We lynch Nikanor, who flips town doc: Curious is almost certainly town again, and the other two people on the wagon, ABR and Rainbow, are implicated. I think the decision to go after Rainbow is easier here, because I can see a town team of IC-WeakVig-Doctor against a Mafia Roleblocker better than a town team of IC-WeakVig-Doctor-Roleblocker. The latter's giving town a lot of ways to stop the kill, especially if, as Egg implies, there's some sort of trap built into his role beyond the usual extent of an IC. ABR could be the second scum then, I suppose.<br>\n<br>\n4) We lynch Nikanor, who flips scum: Rainbow is confirmed town, and Curious suddenly looks suspicious again. In fact, I'd be hard-pressed to buy any other partner for Nikanor, except maybe EPM.<br>\n<br>\nAs I've reread things, Rainbow's play has felt more consistent. She targets Egg right away on Day 2, because that's what you'd do if you blocked someone and no night kill happened. She immediately calls shenanigans on Nik's claim, because the claim probably should have been used Day 2 to either trap her or save Curious. And while some of her reasoning for why she's town is flawed, it seems in good faith.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, as I said above, Nik as a doctor and Rainbow as a mafia roleblocker seems to make a bit more sense. Also, while he certainly could have claimed to save Curious before being lynched, he doesn't actually waver in his belief that Curious is town, even if he doesn't express it as often as I might have. Egg's argument that a doctor would pay attention to flavor does hold a bit of water too, I guess.<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR: I'm pretty torn here. Logically, based on the possible outcomes of these scenarios, it makes more sense to lynch Nikanor because his claim is a bit less fitting, his death provides us with more information, and it would offer up that possibility Rainbow mentions of clearing another townie if he is in fact scum. Also, trios of LeMidget-Nikanor-ABR or LeMidget-Nikanor-Curious make more sense to me than the other ones we have left, except possibly LeMidget-Rainbow-ABR.
