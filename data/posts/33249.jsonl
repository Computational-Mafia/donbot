Rules may be added, removed, or changed at my discretion.<br>\n<br>\n2. If you do not post after 48 hours you will be prodded. You then have 24 hours to pick up the prod. If you do not pick it up after that time I will begin looking for a replacement. Weekends and holidays are counted as normal days. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Any player who is prodded 3 times is subject to replacement on the next prod.</div> Prod-dodges buy you 24 hours only.<br>\n<br>\n3. a) The deadline for Day 1 will be 18 days, and all subsequent Days will have deadlines of 12 days. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If a Day ends early, the remaining amount of time (rounded to days, not hours) will be added to the deadline of the next Day, up to a maximum of 6 days extra.</div> I reserve the right to extend Day length, typically for the purpose of finding a desperately needed replacement.<br>\n<br>\nb) Night rounds will last for 72 hours. During this time the thread will be locked, and all roles with night actions should send me a message telling me what they're going to do. Nights may be extended, just like Days.<br>\n<br>\n4. Short version: Vote in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: example</div>. As long as a vote isn't ambiguous, I'll count it. If it is ambiguous it won't ever count, even if clarified. You'll have to redo the vote. Also, unvoting is not necessary.<br>\n<br>\nLong version: Voting must be made in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: example</div>. The colon is optional, as is the space between the colon and the player's name. Capital letters are also optional. Unvoting is not necessary but appreciated. Votes using abbreviations for player names, misspellings of player names, and even misspellings of abbreviations of player names will all be accepted as long as they meet the above conditions. Abbreviations of misspellings of player names will be treated as mere abbreviations. In the event that a vote is ambiguous however, it will not be counted, not even retroactively. You can vote to not lynch anyone, and the rules for that are the same as regular voting. Trick votes aren't allowed.<br>\n<br>\n5. No invisible or small text (defined as \"text I have to copy and paste or quote to read\").<br>\n<br>\n6. To lynch in the Day rounds you need a simple majority of votes, or 50% rounded down +1.<br>\n<br>\n7. Discussing this game anywhere outside of the game thread itself is forbidden, unless you are specifically told otherwise in your role PM. Discussing other ongoing games in this thread is also forbidden.<br>\n<br>\n8. If you die you get one contentless \"bah\" post. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Note that if you reach the required majority needed for a lynch then you are immediately dead</div> (i.e., claiming that your death scene hadn't yet been posted so you were allowed to keep posting content won't work). During Twilight (after lynch majority is reached/after deadline hits, before round ending scene) anyone who is alive may post content (but the lynchee doesn't count as alive).<br>\n<br>\n9. Lynch majority will not be reduced at deadline. If a lynch majority is not reached at deadline, No Lynch will occur.<br>\n<br>\n10. Don't quote PMs you get from me. Paraphrasing is your friend.<br>\n<br>\n11. If you are going to be gone for 72 or more hours, say so in the thread, or PM me. This will put your inactivity clock on hold.<br>\n<br>\n12. Don't intentionally lie about out of game circumstances to gain an advantage in the game.<br>\n<br>\n13. Flavor is flavor, no story clues or anything.<br>\n<br>\n14. My color for this game will be <div style=\"display:inline;color:teal\">teal</div>, so don't use it.<br>\n<br>\n15. In the event that you are modkilled you will automatically lose, regardless of who wins.<br>\n<br>\n16. Do not lie to me about things related to the game.<br>\n<br>\n17. Vote counts will hopefully be done close to the top of each page. If a full page goes by without a vote count then one will be edited in at the top of it.<br>\n<br>\n18. If I make a mistake, tell me.<br>\n<br>\n19. If you have a question about the rules or game mechanics, just ask.<br>\n<br>\n20. Be considerate towards your fellow player. Excessive personal attacks will result in a warning, then forced replacement or modkill.<br>\n<br>\nNote: If you're being insulted, say so in thread or PM me. I'm not you, so I have no idea if you don't care or if you're upset or whatever. Therefore, I will tend not to intervene.<br>\n<br>\n21. If you think something you're about to do might break the rules, assume it will and message me asking if it's okay to do.<br>\n<br>\n22. Alts and hydra components should be made known to me, but I won't force you to publicize the information.<br>\n<br>\n23. And of course all basic game mechanics of a standard Mafia game apply, such as roles and alignment being revealed on death etc...<br>\n<br>\nPublic Vanilla Townie PM:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Vanilla Townie, and have nothing but your word and your vote.

This lead me to conduct a close review of espy's behavior and logic. I found a few interesting tidbits.<br>\n<br>\nThe tale of Espeonage:<br>\nIn his very first post he jokingly requests a page one claim from thor, creates a \"competing wagon\" that is competing on the wagon against... him, and invites thor to form a bloc. Null in a vacuum, but interesting.<br>\n<br>\nIn his second post he unvotes and votes SB, giving no reason: Null-to-scummy.<br>\n<br>\nHe later explains it was RVS derailment punishment: Townish.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>E-peon wrote:</cite>I still think that my vote [for SB] is in a good place. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Off topic is something we never want</div> and is a bad habit to be getting into this early in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Micc seems on the ball.</div></div></blockquote>\nWait, what? Sure, he agreed with you in his post 51 buuuuut 28 and 32 were both completely off topic. If you are keeping count (and apparently Espeonage isn't?), that's the exact same number of off-topic posts SB wrote in the first place.<br>\n<br>\nPost 67, Espeonage hops on SB yet again for asking me for a read on Illume. @Espeonage: How does asking for a read hurt the day from developing more naturally than asking to form a bloc on page one and voting under false pretenses?<br>\n<br>\nAt this point Micc sees (I think) what I'm seeing now thanks to SB, so he directly asks Espeonage for clarification. Espeonage says \"on the ball\" was a compliment to Micc's logical scumhunting. I don't see it. Micc had posted almost exclusively RVS and off-topic posts up to that point. Actually, 51 was the only post he'd made with any significant content, in my opinion. Let's look at that one:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5460120#p5460120\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5460120#p5460120\" data-post-id=\"5460120\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 51</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22688\">Micc</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5459791#p5459791\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5459791#p5459791\" data-post-id=\"5459791\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 39</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20873\">Elyse</a> wrote:</cite>Why Sir Bastion?</div></blockquote>\nI liked his wagon more than any of the other ones.

I found a few interesting tidbits.<br>\n<br>\nThe tale of Espeonage:<br>\nIn his very first post he jokingly requests a page one claim from thor, creates a \"competing wagon\" that is competing on the wagon against... him, and invites thor to form a bloc. Null in a vacuum, but interesting.<br>\n<br>\nIn his second post he unvotes and votes SB, giving no reason: Null-to-scummy.<br>\n<br>\nHe later explains it was RVS derailment punishment: Townish.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>E-peon wrote:</cite>I still think that my vote [for SB] is in a good place. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Off topic is something we never want</div> and is a bad habit to be getting into this early in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Micc seems on the ball.</div></div></blockquote>\nWait, what? Sure, he agreed with you in his post 51 buuuuut 28 and 32 were both completely off topic. If you are keeping count (and apparently Espeonage isn't?), that's the exact same number of off-topic posts SB wrote in the first place.<br>\n<br>\nPost 67, Espeonage hops on SB yet again for asking me for a read on Illume. @Espeonage: How does asking for a read hurt the day from developing more naturally than asking to form a bloc on page one and voting under false pretenses?<br>\n<br>\nAt this point Micc sees (I think) what I'm seeing now thanks to SB, so he directly asks Espeonage for clarification. Espeonage says \"on the ball\" was a compliment to Micc's logical scumhunting. I don't see it. Micc had posted almost exclusively RVS and off-topic posts up to that point. Actually, 51 was the only post he'd made with any significant content, in my opinion.

Putting aside the fact that he's wrong, jmo16mla was the not the first person to do so; Lord Mhork had already stated that an RVS-stage post made by AbboTT himself looked bad.  So why doesn't AbboTT attack Mhork?  Because doing so will increase scrutiny on him.<br>\n<br>\nLater AbboTT says that he \"almost OMGUS'd him\".  Earlier I described the use of the word \"OMGUS\" as fascinating, and here's why: An OMGUS vote is one made with no justification except \"Player A is voting for me.\"  In this case, AbboTT SHOULD have found Mhork suspicious for calling an RVS-stage post scummy, so a vote for Lord Mhork would NOT have been OMGUS.  If a player is being scummy, then they're scummy; you don't worry about if they're voting for you because if you have a valid reason to vote them in the first place.  <br>\n<br>\nThis suggests to me that AbboTT's stated reasons for his vote on jmo16mla are fake.</div></blockquote>\nI understand the reasoning, but honestly to me Abbott seems like a player who doesn't even know what OMGUS exactly means.

Twice he was end-gamed as town. The game he won as mafia was a micro that lasted two pages. <br>\n<br>\nDisclaimer: This study was really unscientific.<br>\nConclusion: Jmo's post's are almost entirely one or two lines. It is not alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nTo answer Thor's question:<br>\nI can agree with your analysis of jmo's post 197. But when I look at his other eight posts all I can do is shake my head.

Putting aside the fact that he's wrong, jmo16mla was the not the first person to do so; Lord Mhork had already stated that an RVS-stage post made by AbboTT himself looked bad.  So why doesn't AbboTT attack Mhork?  Because doing so will increase scrutiny on him.<br>\n<br>\nLater AbboTT says that he \"almost OMGUS'd him\".  Earlier I described the use of the word \"OMGUS\" as fascinating, and here's why: An OMGUS vote is one made with no justification except \"Player A is voting for me.\"  In this case, AbboTT SHOULD have found Mhork suspicious for calling an RVS-stage post scummy, so a vote for Lord Mhork would NOT have been OMGUS.  If a player is being scummy, then they're scummy; you don't worry about if they're voting for you because if you have a valid reason to vote them in the first place.  <br>\n<br>\nThis suggests to me that AbboTT's stated reasons for his vote on jmo16mla are fake.</div></blockquote>\n\nI like these points against AbboTT too.<br>\n<br>\nI'll do more later.

Putting aside the fact that he's wrong, jmo16mla was the not the first person to do so; Lord Mhork had already stated that an RVS-stage post made by AbboTT himself looked bad.  So why doesn't AbboTT attack Mhork?  Because doing so will increase scrutiny on him.<br>\n<br>\nLater AbboTT says that he \"almost OMGUS'd him\".  Earlier I described the use of the word \"OMGUS\" as fascinating, and here's why: An OMGUS vote is one made with no justification except \"Player A is voting for me.\"  In this case, AbboTT SHOULD have found Mhork suspicious for calling an RVS-stage post scummy, so a vote for Lord Mhork would NOT have been OMGUS.  If a player is being scummy, then they're scummy; you don't worry about if they're voting for you because if you have a valid reason to vote them in the first place.  <br>\n<br>\nThis suggests to me that AbboTT's stated reasons for his vote on jmo16mla are fake.</div></blockquote>\nI understand the reasoning, but honestly to me Abbott seems like a player who doesn't even know what OMGUS exactly means.

He responded in post 59 by saying that he <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5460443#p5460443\">\"Almost OMGUSed [me] earlier\"</a>. This, of course, indicates that he had no reason for suspecting me other than the fact that I voted him. This has been confirmed in post 317 where he <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5471743#p5471743\">confirms his understanding of the term OMGUS to mean \"[him] want[img] to vote me for the sake of voting me because I voted [him].</a><br>\n<br>\nNow you may be screaming \"But, Mhork! OMGUSing is not an innately scummy thing to do! Townies do it all the time!\" and you would be correct. However my issue is not with the fact that he wanted to OMGUS. My issue is that if he wanted to OMGUS me, that implies that I had done nothing suspicious or scummy. However read the following quote made almost immediate after my vote on him:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5459818#p5459818\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5459818#p5459818\" data-post-id=\"5459818\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 42</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6771\">AbboTT</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Illume</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: jmo16mla</span><br>\nCalling people's actions scummy during RVS feels scummy to me.</div></blockquote>\n\nI had just, in essence, called his actions scummy. I said they were bad. I seriously voted him. By his understanding I should have been scummy because, according to him, actions in RVS are immune to being scummy and only scum call them scummy. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Therein lies the contradiction. If he legitimately believed what he said in 42, he should have voted me immediately. However he did not. He waited and indicated that I did nothing scummy at all in my vote on him. Instead he votes jmo who had simply voted Elyse for looking slightly opportunistic in her post. There is a major dissonance here that has just been ignored. </div><br>\n<span style=\"color:darkred;font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">Note: This line of thought was blatantly <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">stolen</div> inspired by Haschel Cedricson's 94</span><br>\n<br>\n2) I believe so. At the very least I think that he wouldn't be proclaiming his activity as much with the same level of fluff. Admittedly this is a slightly weaker portion that I can't really substantiate due to lack of meta, but contentless fluff is always suspicious to me.<br>\n<br>\n3) This is just one of those nasty gutvibe things. Town paranoia sets in on wagons a lot of the time when a player is super super scummy, leading players to think that the person is too scummy to be scum and they end up getting a free ticket through the rest of the game. If I recall correctly, Pirate Mollie rode this fairly well to the endgame in the Mario Mafia I was just in.

Illume makes a post. Espeonage says that he was not satisfied with Illume's post. Illume makes zero posts before Espeonage votes Sir Bastion saying \"I'm done with Illume for now.\" I ask where Illume \"produced\" over that time span and why Espeonage changed his vote. Espeonage says he got bored, he got reads off the wagon, and that \"he figured he got what he came for, so to speak.\"<br>\n<br>\nTown Espeonage has no reason to go back on his original statement. Espeonage's defense was that he got the reads that he came for and thus no longer needed to be a part of the Illume wagon. This would be all good and well if Illume had actually posted since Espeonage explicitly said he wasn't satisfied with what Illume posted. Sir Bastion certainly couldn't have gotten more scummy since he didn't post over this interval either. The point being that Espeonage did not move his vote for town motivated reasons. <br>\n<br>\nScum Espeonage is distinctly aware that he is under pressure. L-3 at the time with other players keying in, he feels the need to do something. He jumps to the Sir Bastion wagon to look productive. The fact that he hardly makes a case against Sir Bastion supports the argument that Espeonage's motivation was to purely look involved. That is scum motivation at its finest. <br>\n<br>\n2 &amp; 3. I don't have a strong enough of a meta read on Espeonage to answer either of these questions. I'm also unsure how you are classifying these points as playstyle tells. I disagree with a good portion of his reads in this game. I think the reasoning for those reads (in this game) is terrible logic.

The real question is, do his reads appear to come logically from the info he has and does he appear to be scumhunting? If the answer to both of those is 'yes' then it doesn't matter if you agree with the reads, the reads are unlikely to be inherently scummy, and indeed, this then probably becomes a town tell. If you think he is downplaying and playing badly and that's why you disagree with his reads because he wouldn't do this as town, then that's another thing, but you have admitted to having no meta awareness of him - that makes this a bad reason to push him.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5480298#p5480298\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5480298#p5480298\" data-post-id=\"5480298\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 458</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22688\">Micc</a> wrote:</cite>1.

Because his reasoning for the sheep, the vote, and the push make coherent sense, o I don't feel they were faked. If he'd totally stopped scumhunting and been like 'sheepin' Supah Thor!' then I would have issue with it. But that he appears to follow my train of thought, and even presented a few ideas I had which I had not openly stated seems to bespeak to me that he is legit scumhunting. Now, maybe he is scum and has pulled the wool over my eyes, I can accept that, I just don't see any clear evidence of that, and even if he is then I tend to suspect he's bussing Illume or something, because Illume doesn't look like town at all.<br>\n<br>\n2. Oh my gawd - seriously dude, I took a few moments in a scan and could find that info. I am not going to go through and bold them all, just read the post and take my word they are in there so keep reading the post until you spot it. She is not even subtle about it - you'll note that in arguing it with him she's even just debatiing the word \"order\" and not suggesting she didn't ask for sheep or votes - and that's because she knows she did exactly that.

I don't have an problem agreeing to disagree on his real intentions. Obviously I can appreciate the feeling of being on a a stalled wagon, the Espeonage --&gt; Blueberry jump being a solid example. The issue is that I don't believe that Espeonage was \"bored\" of that wagon. The post directly before his jump was essentially him saying <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I'm not moving my vote off of Illume because I'm not happy with Illume's contribution thus far</div>. That doesn't sound like someone who is bored of Illume's wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThe issue that I have with Espeonage's reads and his play in general is that I can't follow his logic. Time and time again I have back and forth conversation with him and by the end of it I want to bang my head against the wall. For me it feels like I question him, he gives a dodgy answer, I push harder, and I get an answer that has logic that makes no sense. It's entirely possible that the disconnect is on my end, but I'm going to be egotistical and say it's not. It really feels like he's trying to support an argument that he knows is untrue. This would off course be because he is scum doing his best to deflect attention from himself to players he knows to be town. Ill acknowledge that with meta my argument be considerably stronger.<br>\n<br>\nElyse's \"ordering\" seems to have evolved into a pretty hot topic, but I'm ready to be done with it. I haven't seen a strong argument as to how its a scum tell, and I think that's one thing we can all agree on. I can see how Elyse's posts are suggesting that other players change their vote to follow hers. What I don't see is any type of ordering/forcefulness/condescending tone from Elyse. To me, her posts are no different than Thor blatantly suggesting that people sheep him. That's my stance, and probably my last post on the matter.<br>\n<br>\nApparently Espeonage's post 12 is an example of how to get a quick town read from Thor in RVS. I can't wait to draw scum in a game with Thor.<br>\n<br>\nI jumped off Espeonage wagon not only because I didn't see potential, but also because there could be no potential. With Espeonage on V/LA we were not getting an intent to hammer or a claim in the near future. I hoped back on because Espeonage was (and still is) my choice for a lynch. I was actually pretty surprised to see the wagon at L-1 the next morning. Staying on the Blueberry wagon was not an option because I was not ready to see a Blueberry lynch, and you explicitly stated that your intentions were for a Blueberry lynch and that you wanted it quickly.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo, I'm pretty bad at being brief - Sorry.

You agreed that your contributions were lacking, and therefor my point was valid. But then you deflected to other players who were playing similarly. If you would have pointed to posts 73 and 75 and said \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Here look at this, I'm trying to get involved in the scumhunting with these two posts. </div>\" I would have seen it as a decent defense. I even made that defense for you in my Pedit of 74, but instead you when the deflecting route...My point being that you chose to deflect when you could have easily defended yourself. <br>\n<br>\n2. If you really think I am being hypocritical, then why didn't you do something about it? Call it scummy, vote for it...do something! You even unvoted in this very post so that isn't much of an excuse. All I see is Illume doing his best to dig himself out of a whole, but not going any farther. It looks like survival the most important thing to you right now.

So no, you can't have a solid definitive statement on this. <br>\nI don't know how I feel about Espeonage. I think his case on Elyse was bad, I didn't see it as her being too overt in forcing the town to follow her, and even if she was it's not really something that's scummy. I definitely don't like his, or anyone else's for that matter, push on my slot. But this is all tied up with the Thor thing again anyway, didn't he start really going after Elyse once Espeo was getting up in votes? <br>\nThat's a suspicion of mine anyway, but without really understanding exactly how everything went down it's easy to imagine town-Thor defending his townreads in this way. Plus the significance of his case is diminished when you realize that he's basically willing to lynch anyone. <br>\nSorry that I can't get everything straight for you in time, but without solid reads I'm not going to push a lynch.

What's up with all this generic bloodlust, clearly that is scummy, yeah? Well, wait a minute, if he's generically bloodthirsty all that means is there are a lot of people he's willing to see dead, and the target seems to shift semi-often. WHat that says to me is that there isn't an *agenda* behind his bloodthirstiness. He wants people dead because he thinks it will help the town. He will attack people, violently, and then change his attitude towards them...because he doesn't care what they think about him, he cares what he thinks about them.<br>\n<br>\nThat's scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, he's also being run up for not being willing to answer questions about why he thinks a given player is town. Never mind that he always explains his scum vibes and has dropped town reads around for willy-nilly reasons. There isn't much money in him, as scum, to set up a town read and refuse to explain it. The *only* real reason to get town reads as scum is to <br>\n1. Nurture and buddy them for support later. <br>\n2. To look good after they are lynched and flipped town.<br>\n<br>\nEspeo's actions pretty clearly show that he doesn't give a hang about either of those two situations.<br>\n<br>\n--------------------<br>\n<br>\nNow, is that the most amazing town case ever, cast in gold and wrapped in bacon?<br>\nNo.<br>\nBut it IS just as strong, and I think stronger, than the current scum case on him - which is super weak and threadbare.<br>\nLet's vote Elyse, even if you think Espeo is scum for being disagreeable, then Elyse should look at least as scummy for opportunistic voting and changing her mind in strategic ways that go with the flow (unlike Espeo I can't think of an unfavorabl opinion she has ever particularly touted in thread as 'hers' because, unlike him, she's not actually trying to rock the boat and find out stuff. Also, unlike him, she's not stamping her name on any opinions and really claiming them nd any potential blowback about them. Look at how Espeo reacted to me with the 'slip' Everyone else as like \"looks like a slip...Vote and go silent!\" Espeo flat out stalked up, got in my face, and screamed how I was scum that needed to die. It was lulzy bad as far as logic went, but he clearly BELIEVED what he was on about, and if I'd been lynched then he would have looked horrid for being the ramrod of the lynch. But he wasn't scared of that because he believed what he was saying, and also doesn't know my alignment - because he's town)<br>\n<br>\nAll that make sense?", "time": "Tue Dec 03, 2013 8:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=33249&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "33249"}

WHAT IS THE TOWN MOTIVATION?</div></blockquote>\n1. Yes, that is possible, it's also possible I had an accurate town read - both of you looked at the info and came to different conclusions but neither is shockingly bad or strange given that singular piece of evidence. It is hardly scummy for him to look at my interactions and decide they were townish, especially if you don't even care enough to ask him for further thoughts on why he reached that conclusion. I also \"WK\" ABR, Mhork, and AbboTT yesterday, so should we presume they're all town too? I'm now WKing Micc - so he must be town as well.<br>\n<br>\n2. I don't think they look like you're both scum, I'll agree with you there, but I don't think they look like a really normal interaction. I agree with him that the shift was oddly sudden there considering the vehemence earlier.<br>\n<br>\n3. I've seen town lie before to cover up them being lazy or making bad pushes. I've had lengthy conversations with people *post game* where they were trying to sell me on some obscure read/gambit they were working on and how they really had all sorts of stuff figured out. I have no idea why those people would lie about that, but am pretty certain they were. And it had nothing to do with their alignment in game. People also lie in the real world, they say they've dated people they haven't, said and done things that they haven't, beefed up resumes with jobs they haven't. People care about how others perceive them, and will lie about it.<br>\n<br>\nOn a personal note, I actually buy the explanation just because it seems so bewilderingly silly and stupid that I can't imagine anyone coming up with it as a cover story and thinking people would buy it - but that's just me.<br>\n<br>\nI'll agree I can't think of a brilliant town motivation to do it.<br>\nBut I know there is no brilliant scum motivation to do it either; if he's scum it will be for reasons other than lying about mixing you up with someone. I feel like you're dwelling on surface lies and not caring about real motivation - I do that as scum all the time because lies are easy as a case to push because...hey! Lie! It's self contained and easy to argue.<br>\n<br>\nYour scum motivation explanation feels incredibly weak and threadbare.

He snaps at me for \"spoiling\" it. That's all fine and dandy.....if he comes in and tells us what he got out of his reaction test.

He better tell us who was supposed to be doing the reacting, what scum's reaction would have been and why, what town's reaction what have been and why, what it means if the test is ignored, and how the test has impacted his reads. If that doesn't happen, then I refuse to accept this as a reaction test.<br>\n<br>\nI'm tired of seeing the term reaction test thrown around as an explanation for doing something stupid.

Well, I'm probably capable to check in every day, so feel free to run a lynch on me if that's what you want.

JMO lurking out and needing replacement changes nothing as far as my read there goes, I'll move to him if that's what people would prefer over Elyse, my preference between the two of them currently does lean Elyse but I don't actually care enough to try to sway anyone off JMO if people could give me more support.

However, I'm not sure you can blame people for being apathetic when we have a frozen deadline for no particular good reason. Also, the most disjointed factor in this game is your own vote. Your vote is basically meaningless to any wagon because you switch every few posts, often to a shitty wagon. In fact, when your vote actually matters you unvote instantly because of 'cold feet'... doesn't look like you adhere to what you preach.<br>\n<br>\nI greatly dislike the three page back and forth between Thor and Elyse. Thor's questions are completely useless and I didn't get an answer to my question where that 'discussion' was supposed to go. Meanwhile, Elyse does zero scumhunting and has eye only for Thor.<br>\n<br>\nSo the only wagons of substance atm are Albert and Elyse? I'm not interested in an Albert wagon, and while my earlier Elyse townread has faded, I don't trust an L-1 wagon that was formed by apathy. I'd much rather go for a Thor wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote. Vote: Thor665</div><br>\n<br>\nFor the sake of my sanity I hope this deadline gets unfrozen qickly. The fact this game has been stuck in limbo for half a week is a big reason for this game becoming apathetic.", "time": "Thu Dec 19, 2013 11:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=33249&start=1625", "forum": "53", "thread": "33249"}

Or are they just staying off the town wagon? Or...crazy thought...is he scum? I'm probably most conflicted on the ABR read, simply because his play is atrocious and non-standard regardless of alignment, the only value I see in it as a playstyle though is if he does make it to lylo and is scum, so that's a pretty decent reason to flip him today since people apparently still are in Day 1. Per his last post, literally the only read he currently holds that looks half sane to me is the Fake God one, everything else reads bad. The Elyse lynch desire is for a handful of reasons but the core one is her sudden flip-flop of all her reads from yesterday simply because Espeo flipped town, which seems really bad and unnatural as a reads shift and screams scum to me. Also, quite frankly, even just looking at her last post where she lists two scum, two nulls,a nd nothing else, means she's claiming she's reading the rest of the game more townish than a null worthy lynch...just think about the reality of that with what she's actually been doing today.

Do you see my point?<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to Elyse, I have rarely seen scum get so desperate. And sure, she gets frustrated easily, but I think an important thing to note is that she is putting herself into those positions; she is not cornered scum trying to flail her wagon away. For an example of that, look at the way she responds to Thor. Sure, he is pushing her, but it's nothing that she should be particularly afraid of as scum since he has stronger reads elsewhere and is likely to switch again once the wagons grow in his stronger scumreads. She could have been a lot more aggressive in the way she treated ABR, but she wasn't. She reached out to him, he didn't respond to her reach out, she scumread him and went after him for a little bit, picked up something on Thor that she seriously believed in, and pursued it hard despite her being close as hell to a lynch today and ABR being the easier lynch.", "time": "Tue Dec 24, 2013 7:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=33249&start=1750", "forum": "53", "thread": "33249"}

I've just came off a game where we lynched him for that and learnt it can come from town ABR<br>\n<br>\nWhat I am pulling him up for in that post (it would be the leading 3 paragraphs well before the point about him claiming VT) is that much more then in that game he spent most of day 1 here being a drama whore and frankly at this point I stopped believing any of it was genuine. That in fact it was all a big show to get the result that we are seeing today, everybody is dismissing him as anything more then a fool.<br>\n<br>\nThis is the core of my issue with his play this game, I dont believe the ego cause it's not the same ego that got him lynched as town last time or in any of the town games I've seen him in. I dont believe the relentless attack on Elyse cause it never gains any weight. I've seen ABR get into long quote walls with Thor when pushing him, but for almost the entire of day 1 ABR hammers the drum of lynching Elyse but never engages.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yes I didnt like his extremely early role claim. I'd ask how his early claim has made people feel towards him? Did it make him feel *less important* was that the intention? The whole thing bugs the hell out of me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for the bussing point I've made clear the point of issue I have, and it is sort of a variation of why you dont believe it. The point at which ABR stops banging that drum to lynch elyse is before we get the flip of day 1. So with no new information (and with Elyse being a key vote on the wagon to lynch espeo) ABR stops his drum beating and does a complete 180* on Elyse.<br>\n<br>\nAnd Elyse does the same to him.<br>\n<br>\nABR wont say why<br>\n<br>\nand Elyse cant say why.<br>\n<br>\nThey just did.

Blind? Tunneled? I dunno, shouldn't he either be a low content under the radar sort of guy or shouldn't he not be commenting on lots of other stuff in avoiding pressuring a read of his?

Which, even if you are town, still happily leaves him well within the normal range for scumhunting accuracy. Also, I'm not sure why a dropping of his Blueberry push today is a scumtell.

I suppose my quick answer is 'I think he is scumhunting, I liked how he forgot that Espeo had claimed and chose to push you over Espeo considering Espeo's flip, and I liked his paranoia about the lynch yesterday and interactions near the end.' I'm really bugged by Nacho's push on him for being under the radar when, pretty clearly to my mind there are a handful of players who are being more under the radar than Bastion, and I also really don't like the composition and reasoning for this wagon.

How many times had you advertised \"I'm voting the biggest wagon, nyeh!\" in your usual way? It's fairly obvious that a Thor push early game isn't going to be hammered through to a lynch, so all Elyse scum *really* needed to do was handle your pressure in her usual way and you would have sauntered off to the next shiny thing you saw. Instead, she escalated things into the 1v1 against you in a fight she was clearly not going to win, so that tips the balance in favor of \"town conviction\". Do you think Elyse-scum generally gets flustered easily (especially after the meta dive someone did earlier that shows that she's fine under pressure too)? Do you think you were really turning up the heat before Elyse turned on you?

Thor landing the exact same role two games in a row and a row that before the last game I rarely ever saw pretty much killed me this game. I have a method in my head for dealing with him which is lynch him on day 2 if he is still alive and there were no obvious power roles in play (in the case of this game we had the weak doctor claim so *woulda coulda* lynched him day 3). Make the assumption that I have been truely and fully played like a broken fiddle, I fell for breadcrumbs he and his scumbuddies set up in the last game so I would not be surprised if most of this game I fell for much of the same. (btw scum chat of the last game with daychat scum thor <a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/50/H/Z26BU9Npih9qw\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.quicktopic.com/50/H/Z26BU9Npih9qw</a>)<br>\n<br>\nAs for the quicklynch to your (possible) credit, I made the opposite mistake, I let the clock run out after scum thor had been caught so that we can get a lot of discussion in which potentilly gave them more time to use thor's ability. Though in the end Thor didnt use it much at all during the long drawn out day (which may lead to a case later)<br>\n<br>\nIn my defence of why I am town. I'd like to ask if thor was such a crucial power role why he would put himself on the line so strongly to defend me. The obvious answer would be if I was an equally strong power role but if I was any of the obvious roles (watcher, rolecop, roleblocker) then chances would be high that I would have claimed a matching town pr role. This is the advice thor gave in the last game he was scum to the watcher on their team (link above, quote below)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>thor post 64 wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I would submit he should watch whoever he intends to claim he 'Doc'ed</div><br>\nThe other option is me, since there's a not unreasonable chance that a town investigative role will aim for me - or a Vig I suppose, depends who the Vig is really and if there even is one.<br>\nHonestly, considering our PR spread I would almost suspect a Vig over an Investigative. I dunno, scum is of moderate strength (Watcher is only good the more town targeting roles exist, and my power is considered a general small bump to scum's overall power) That said, I think we'd look a bit weak versus anything more than two PRs unless they're all relatively weak.</div></blockquote>\n\nI know it's weak, but the case on me is that thor moved heaven and earth to stop my lynch and he was scum. I'm asking what did he have to gain from that? He would have much more to gain if I was flipped and day 2 did go right down to the wire so I wouldnt argue the goal was to specifically lynch ABR or protect me. Frankly if I was flipped instead of ABR ask yourselves how differently day 3 would have gone (and I'm town so dont be smart about this and say I would have flipped scum)?<br>\n<br>\nAside from that debacle all the case on me is Nacho's case. Which if he wants me to continue responding to I'm willing to if you feel more is needed to be discussed beyond the *omg thor protected you* case<br>\n<br>\nBut what you want is reads so you can lynch with clear concious.<br>\n<br>\nI'd have to say my top scum read would be Guyett, <br>\n<br>\n To lessening levels Micc and Lord Mhork.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nGuyett because of the quickhammer on day 3. As i mentioned earlier thor in the last game didnt seem to take advantage of the long drawn out day when we had him cornered as confirmed scum, so perhaps he opted for a partner to quickhammer him day 3 and take the credit over taking advantage of this. I'd guess Guyett wasnt the first choice but I get the impression that the third scum might not have been present which would point to lord mhork who like me missed all of day 3 kind goes to explain guyetts really odd posting in the later half of day 3 with the *joke* claim the very quick turn around on thor and hammer.<br>\n<br>\nand Guyetts posting today has been somewhat artificial (bragging back against the quicklynch, the numerous fluff posts, the zero discussion on anything else and the third fake out post of the game (i believe the first was fakegod, the 2nd was me) oddly this is the only one no one seemed to pull up for shenanigans. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMicc I lean scum almost entirely because of Elyse being nightkilled.  She gave nacho a *maybe* on me but she pointed micc as a main suspect and she's the one who was killed last night. Scum aint likely to be pr hunting anymore so her death is one for controlling the lynch and scum would want me to hang today and not have someone stop what would have potentially been another quicklynch and asked we look at who fits better as partners to thor. Consider how close today came to another quicklynch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for FakeGod. He has had posts that bug me, joining nacho's wagon stink of laziness, he excused his entire day 1 to essentially him hating day 1s and preferring to lurk it out. But he moved his vote to thor on day 3 with little incentive from elyse so I dont think scum would have done that. Scum FG could have rode on my wagon over day 3 and 4 without question, but he hasnt.<br>\n<br>\nEven if he did do a stupid post saying I'd already given my voting preference. I think he clicked quickly after that both my voting preferences were dead.<br>\n<br>\nNacho has had nothing put doubt to his cases so far as he hasnt succeeded to lynch me and thor flipped scum so I think his posting fits confident town. The real scrutiny would come if you lynch me. But I wont be here for that scrutiny so thats up to others to see how he carries himself after his main case collapses.<br>\n<br>\nLord Mhork's question bugs me, why are you asking? Either you think someone else is scum or you havnt read. If Thor and Guyett were the active scum players I could easily see Mhork as a quiet third wheel slipping by into lylo.<br>\n<br>\nMindgamer joins the same thought process. Very quiet player.

Points Thor's scumslip, but doesn't change his vote. 120 posts later the Thor scumslip wagon has died down and HC comes into cast a vote and declare he is afk until lynch deadline. Seems like fairly typical play for someone who was part of Thor's scum team. It bothers me that HC pointed out the slip, but never acted on it. Either he didn't believe it was an actual slip or he didn't want to believe his scumpartner has screwed up.<br>\n<br>\nI have issues with other slots too, but this seems like a good place to start.

HC was fairly town when he was around; his early aggression was pretty good and Guyett's shining moment was the very strong push on the ABR lynch to later Thor quickhammer while hammered. Post-celebration seemed real, drunk hammer seemed fine, and throwing up weak wrists to Thor lynch --&gt; quickhammered when it's pretty highly likely he's going to be lynched instead of bringing the \"okay, you were right\" at the beginning of the day seems pretty strange.

For one, his LyLo play is extraordinarily inconvenient for him as scum. If Mhork is town, I would expect Micc to help prod along the mislynch instead of going \"well he's probably scum but I have a better feeling on Guyett\". As town, the trajectory onto Guyett makes sense; he was analyzing end of day votecounts, playing around with Guyett as a possibility earlier, all that good stuff. If Mhork is scum, Micc should be setting up as the person to go to endgame, by setting up with a bus Mhork and set up Mindgamer as tomorrow's lynch strategy, but he's not doing that at all. There was also the day where Sir Bastion was getting lynched, and Micc was like \"we should take this slow, I don't think Mhork/Bastion/Thor works very well\". It was a good approach to take to that day, and it had a good \"trying to figure things out\" feeling to it.", "time": "Mon Jan 20, 2014 5:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=33249&start=2150", "forum": "53", "thread": "33249"}

As far as I can tell, there are no confusing interactions between the Rolestopper and the Roleblocker because of this.<br>\nIf the Weak Doctor targets a Mafia member, but is roleblocked or rolestopped, then the Weak Doctor will not die.<br>\nThe Mafia 1-Shot Ninja is a complete red herring, and affects nothing in the game.<br>\nThe core idea behind this setup is to have somewhat unusual power roles who have a chance to interfere with each other. The Weak Doctor is less powerful than a Cop, in that the results are less trustworthy; I believe that a competent Weak Doctor will realize this, especially if the Roleblocker or Rolestopper flip. The compensation for this reduction in investigative power is that the Mafia have no counter to the protection ability other than attempting to kill the Weak Doctor. The Roleblocker's power is limited in comparison, but does gain significant usefulness in the event that only 1 Mafia member remains.<br>\n<br>\nThe Encryptor doesn't really play into this dynamic, but it does give the Mafia a boost in the day game, since their night game is relatively weak.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Wed Jan 22, 2014 4:47 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=33249&start=2225", "forum": "53", "thread": "33249"}

Anyone who has spent any time with me knows that I have 0 ego. At all. It's one of my biggest weaknesses at mafia and I'm trying to correct it. I have difficulty standing up to/dealing with aggressive personalities, especially the arrogant ones, and also towns who townread people for meta reasons and dismiss my scum reads as wrong. <br>\n<br>\nB) I have excellent understanding of mafia. Brilliant understanding. I understood the fact that bulletproof made no sense. I understood the fact that scum really obviously had more than just an encryptor. I understand theory very well. I also understand the social dynamics but--guess what---they're harder in practice. Don't you dare try to tell me that I don't understand mafia. And it is disgustingly arrogant for you to tell me not to be in one of your games again. I mean I would rather never have the displeasure of interacting with you in a mafia setting again, but I'll play any game I damn well please. <br>\n<br>\nC) Replacements ruin games. I kept trying to get back into the swing but it really wasn't happening. Not until the end at least. Yeah I should have played better. It's true. You too should have played better. And instead of saying what I did was wrong, maybe you could look at your own issues and work on those. Yeah I might have only voted scum at the end. That's mafia. I made some bad calls. However you had 'perfect' reads and got mislynched really early. Honesty who is the worse player in that case?<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT:<br>\nApologies, Alduskkel. I'm prolly done now. This game comes off the tail end of another game that really annoyed me for different reasons.", "time": "Wed Jan 22, 2014 5:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=33249&start=2225", "forum": "53", "thread": "33249"}

If you're getting constantly mislynched, it's on you. Mafia is and always will be a team game. You cannot dictate the way things go. Don't try to pretend that you meant to die.<br>\n<br>\nAnd there is no way this is all my fault. This loss belongs to all of the town.
