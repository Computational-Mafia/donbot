So... here we go.<br>\n<br>\nHello Everyone!, For those who know my play style this will be my normal meta post so... feel free to skip. For everyone else... time to write <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> hiya, I'm naomi and I have a very strange play style. Starting with a quirk; I call town Green and Mafia Reds I've only recently started doing this and I do slip up on this from time to time. So... going forward bare this in mind. <br>\n<br>\nNow. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br>\n<br>\nThe strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nI do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br>\n<br>\nI am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't. If your currently falling in the last group of players feel free to browse my wiki, I post every game I've completed in it and it can be a good source for you to confirm this information. of course most of you won't.. but that just tends to be how it is.<br>\n<br>\nFinally though my account is an older one I have only played a small pool of games as I took around about a year and a half break between two of my games only starting steadily again this year. So.. though I'm an older account I lack the experience and skill of many of my contemporaries.<br>\n<br>\nSo.. yeah.. thats pretty much all you need to know to get a good read on myself and... yeah lets get to that post I wanted to make.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nTL;DR&gt; She posts this stuff as town.

{"number": 46, "id": "8640652", "user": "Asphodel", "user_id": "18842", "content": "Hi everyone!  My last game ended in June and I don't think I've ever played with anyone in this game before.  So I should probably introduce myself.  I began playing mafia (werewolf) on a smaller site, and am far more used to playing under that's site's rules.  Those rules included almost exclusively out of topic communication and also day phases that last approximately 48 hours long.<br>\n<br>\nSelf-meta-ing a little bit from my games on the other site, I very rarely, if ever try to push for my partners to be lynched as scum.  That's for a few reasons.  It was a pretty tight-knit group over there, and there was no cardflip in many of the games.  Like, over a span of 20 or so scum games, I remember the single time I voted for a scum partner, and even that doesn't really count because my partner made a really terrible counterclaim.  That's not to say I never scumread my partners, I just avoided seriously putting my vote on them because 48 hours is not a very long time.<br>\n<br>\nI have been town in every game I've played on this site, so I'm unsure if this would be different under these rules.  I imagine it might.  I'm still probably going to use this as proof I'm town if I ever vote someone who flips scum though.  I've only completed two games here, and they went pretty differently.<br>\n<br>\nIn my first game, I was a Town Cop.  I locked onto someone who I thought was scum Day 1 and went after them pretty much the whole day.  I think I confirmation-biased them pretty hard since the most important thing I remember about them is that I didn't enjoy playing with them.  The person I scumread Day 1 ended up being the doctor and we lynched 1 of 2 scum Day 1.  I found the other scum Night 2, so the game ended pretty soon after that.<br>\n<br>\nIn my most recent game, I was one of a few weak town bodyguards.  After being forced to claim and then floundering for a lot of Day 1, I ended up pushing through a lynch on a VT.  I never really got another solid scumread the rest of the game.  As a result, I kept on rereading the thread and people moved up and down my suspicion list pretty randomly.  I think some people scumread me for that, though if I had to guess that's probably a townread for me.  <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8640358#p8640358\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8640358#p8640358\" data-post-id=\"8640358\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 8</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19768\">Naomi-Tan</a> wrote:</cite>Okay so onto the bulk of stuff.

So... going forward bare this in mind. <br>\n<br>\nNow. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br>\n<br>\nThe strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nI do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br>\n<br>\nI am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't.

For those who know this post feel free to skip it yadda yadda.<br>\nHi, I'm Naomi I have kinda a strange play style. Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people. I dislike calling people scum as its kinda mean so I switched to the color thing and it appears to have caught on rather well in other games I've been in. Thats not so major. but Its a good thing to note.<br>\n<br>\nOkay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me.

So... going forward bare this in mind. <br>\n<br>\nNow. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br>\n<br>\nThe strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nI do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br>\n<br>\nI am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't.

For those who know this post feel free to skip it yadda yadda.<br>\nHi, I'm Naomi I have kinda a strange play style. Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people. I dislike calling people scum as its kinda mean so I switched to the color thing and it appears to have caught on rather well in other games I've been in. Thats not so major. but Its a good thing to note.<br>\n<br>\nOkay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me.

For everyone else... time to write <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> hiya, I'm naomi and I have a very strange play style. Starting with a quirk; I call town Green and Mafia Reds I've only recently started doing this and I do slip up on this from time to time. So... going forward bare this in mind. <br>\n<br>\nNow. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br>\n<br>\nThe strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nI do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br>\n<br>\nI am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't. If your currently falling in the last group of players feel free to browse my wiki, I post every game I've completed in it and it can be a good source for you to confirm this information. of course most of you won't.. but that just tends to be how it is.<br>\n<br>\nFinally though my account is an older one I have only played a small pool of games as I took around about a year and a half break between two of my games only starting steadily again this year.

Asphodel accuses Ircher of faking a town read on Gamma, Ircher provides evidence that he was indeed townreading Gamma, and then Asphodel backs into a weird stance of \"oh well in that case you shouldn't have been townreading him\" that doesn't really follow from his original position. It reads like Asphodel is trying to force a scumread more than he's trying to gamesolve. In particular, this quote from Asphodel's 177 bothers me:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Asphodel wrote:</cite>a scumread you thought was legitimate, or not totally baseless, or whatever.</div></blockquote>\n\nIf town-Asphodel is genuinely scumreading Ircher, I don't think he would write off Ircher's position as \"or whatever\" like that. Townies don't tend to be that apathetic towards their scumreads' positions. Townies need to know what their scumreads' positions are, it's the whole reason they're scumreading them!<br>\n<br>\nBut if Asphodel is scum, it makes a lot more sense for him to not care what Ircher's position is here. For scum-Asphodel, the important thing is to make Ircher look bad, and dismissing his read on Gamma as \"or whatever\" does a much better job of that.<br>\n<br>\nAnd when I combine that with Asphodel's weird backoff above, I really, really don't get the impression that Asphodel is genuinely trying to sort Ircher here.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Asphodel</span>", "time": "Tue Dec 20, 2016 10:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69704&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "69704"}

Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people.

I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me.

It lets people know what to expect and helps me protect myself aganist reds pushing me for a miss lynch so its useful that way. also helps inform town onto what to expect saving foot work for those who are lazy. The way I see it you can either Believe it, NAI it or See it as an excuse setup for later, which it totally is as well. thats just kinda how its been. I normally get those who havn't played with me before fitting into the  latter two while those who have palyed with me before fit into the former two (as they have experienced it) As It in no way hurts to share information and I provide sources for people to check out I feel its a good and helpful thing that those who are paranoida can backup.

The more back and frothing happens the easier it is to spot a GvG or a RvG I feel its pretty important but at the end of the day there always will be 1 or two wagons being pushed out and that leads to the scramble. inactivity is also a thing as the day goes on but people have lives and don't spend all day on here. normally it happens cause either life or lack of interest.

For those who know this post feel free to skip it yadda yadda.<br>\nHi, I'm Naomi I have kinda a strange play style. Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people. I dislike calling people scum as its kinda mean so I switched to the color thing and it appears to have caught on rather well in other games I've been in. Thats not so major. but Its a good thing to note.<br>\n<br>\nOkay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me. I also am probably forgetting somethings. As i'm sleepy</div></blockquote>\nOne question --- Does making this post actually help you in any way?</div></blockquote>\n\nYes. It lets people know what to expect and helps me protect myself aganist reds pushing me for a miss lynch so its useful that way. also helps inform town onto what to expect saving foot work for those who are lazy. The way I see it you can either Believe it, NAI it or See it as an excuse setup for later, which it totally is as well. thats just kinda how its been. I normally get those who havn't played with me before fitting into the  latter two while those who have palyed with me before fit into the former two (as they have experienced it) As It in no way hurts to share information and I provide sources for people to check out I feel its a good and helpful thing that those who are paranoida can backup. Even if it is NAI.

Some people can only really give an hour or two a day to playing, and when all of that time is spent getting caught up on all of this you are going to create an oversaturation of information on a few players and leave the bar on entry at others so high that you are going to get next to zero content.

They set you up by asking a leading question and then span that as fence sitting. But if you look at your play you can see the weakness's as well as the townie aspects of it. Its not explicitly bad to examine things carefully before voting (It took me till page 11 to vote) To say your fence sitting would be incorrect. You gave your thoughts on things as the game went on you just didn't vote. This to me says that You wasn't sure enough to vote. which is a Green trait as reds don't hesitate as much especially on people who are weaker players as they can shrug it off if they turn out to be proactive // good for greens", "time": "Wed Dec 21, 2016 12:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69704&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "69704"}

Cause If you think I'm white knighting that means you think Alisae is Green from that the time of the quoted message. I saw a miss lynch happening and I stepped in and gave them an out. given that Reds have no day talk It would make more sense to assume that I was assisting a red team mate out of a bad situation given your previous stance rather than going with white knighting.

They set you up by asking a leading question and then span that as fence sitting. But if you look at your play you can see the weakness's as well as the townie aspects of it. Its not explicitly bad to examine things carefully before voting (It took me till page 11 to vote) To say your fence sitting would be incorrect. You gave your thoughts on things as the game went on you just didn't vote. This to me says that You wasn't sure enough to vote. which is a Green trait as reds don't hesitate as much especially on people who are weaker players as they can shrug it off if they turn out to be proactive // good for greens</div></blockquote>\nDid you read Grey's opinion on the matter?

If you was red and I had said \"as its unlikely reds have day talk\" it would of shown weakness and unsureness and given you an opportunity to take advantage of the situation by not answering my question (which you neglected to answer instead opting to chainsaw IIRC) I wanted to put you off footing and to get you to show if you was red or green. Given that a green would of acted as if what I said was offencive and silly while a red would more likely backout of it. Given you flipped it around on one word it became NAI as if a red spotted I said given They could make this wagon just as easily. The fact that I was making an agressive move acted aganist me here and I understand that I should of said Likely given or some other thing that acknowledged the existence of a role. <br>\n<br>\nEverypost their after was purely to try and get you off your focused word. I used given on an assumption that reds don't have day talk. Beacuse at the time I made an assumption that reds don't have day talk. and I used that to given the possible situations in my head. Which went as follows;<br>\n<br>\nRed having day talk and me and Alisae being red; No need to put my neck out in the main thread as I could of walked them through how to back down or stopped there push ealier.<br>\nRed having day talk and me and Alisae not being on the same team. White knighting<br>\nRed not having day talk and me and Alisae being red; Being so obvious would make it really easy for greens to get two kills off of a misslynch<br>\nRed not having day talk and me being red and Alisae being green; white knighting<br>\nRed not having day talk me being green and Alisae being red; I just saved a red woops.<br>\nRed not having day talk and me and Alisae being green; I saved someone in trouble.<br>\n<br>\nWhile white knighting may be a thing. There is no way to prove defending someone is a White knight situation. if you go back to my read list;<br>\n<br>\nAlisae &gt;&gt; Feels like miss guided Green If I had to guess there the type of player that takes a little to form an idea but once its there it sticks for a while. This isn't a bad thing but I feel there pushes are miss guided and go on slightly longer than needed and I feel that they should revaluate more often.<br>\n<br>\nI already said I thought they was being a bad green player and that they 'need to revalute more often' as in take a step back and go 'is this red or just bad for me' then I saw they wasn't doing that and flailing more and more lashing out at anyone and I stepped into stop them. before they self destructed. Is this white knighting is the question. I say no, if your reading someone as bad green and they are being so obvious bad green but are just digging themselves a hole stepping in is one of the ways to avoid them getting miss lynched.<br>\n<br>\nAfterwards I saw Gray try to flip things on me. Which would been fine, but he said I white knighted.. To me white knighting is steping into save someone green aligned when you have shown little or no thoughts that they are green. This is not the case here so I wished to reverse his push on me to pressure them back. This would helped others determine both our alignments as It was a thing I was sure wouldn't go more than a couple of pages as honestly. I didn't wanna lynch them and I felt they saw me as kinda green leaning at the time. Turns out I in my boldness made a misstake as I was getting into the pushing mood. Now you may be wondering. If I've done this kinda thing before and yes I have. If you go back a couple town games to the first game I adopted the colour system I called Town blue. As a town player. I have also made other mistakes while in the moment as TF can confirm (mort push last game, and the other 180's you've seen me do) <br>\n<br>\nI'm not always right. But I know when I have to back out of a mistake that I made and be honest about it. which is why after saying it was an assumption (because it was) I more in depth explained why I used given. I assumed at the time that there was no day talk and when it was brought up I admitted that It was the wrong choice of words. I choose it because it made my point more bold and I shouldn't have. <br>\n<br>\nI am going to keep dealing with the white knight stuff but this one word mistake thing, yeah I'm just gonna put that aside like I did a while ago. sure it'll shade people to me for a while but I expect it'll get me investigated and green confirmed later on.", "time": "Wed Dec 21, 2016 6:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69704&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "69704"}

They are lashing out at people who vote them without really thinking it fully through there emotional right now and trying there best to not be lynched ironically pushing more attention on themselves. If they live they will be shown as green later on I believe via play. Then there are things like her interaction with gray. Yes it was poorly executed but thats the point. If you was red looking for a Misslynch why target one of the strongest Green players instead of their investigative target that was already kinda melting.

Which is how her thoughts landed in that square.<br>\nHer questions after that interaction are probing to work out where people stand, not pushing at all which would match a more careful playstyle until people put pressure on her. Given what I extracted from her personality ealier I believe this would resulted in them acting defensive and making rash choices.</div></blockquote>\nWhy are you assuming that Alisae wouldn't be flustered as red?  She only has one completed game and that was a green game. Two others in progress where she's alive in both if I read right.  Seems to me like being flustered for a person without many completed games is NAI.

{"number": 736, "id": "8649459", "user": "Rainbowdash", "user_id": "16488", "content": "I guess thanks for only putting up 10 pages overnight?<br>\n<br>\nBefore I get caught up properly, there are two things that need to be said.  I am commandeering that IC hat from Gamma because he has ZERO idea about what he is talking about and if he is town just really helped scum these last few pages.<br>\n<br>\n1) The \"scum don't have day talk\" is not a slip.  It is something that you should always operate on as being true unless something presents itself to directly say otherwise.  If Naomi said scum DO have day talk, that would be worth jumping on.  As it stands she said something that I would bet all my bits everypony else assumed is the case.<br>\n<br>\n2) Asectic should absolutely 100% NOT CLAIM if they are town, and I am stuck between Gamma as the town VI or as scum trying to find out more about PRs.  For two primary reasons.  The first is that a majority of time a town role is given the ascetic modifier, its to help balance out another part of their role. Like if a mod wants a cop and a doctor, they can make the cop ascetic and that acts as a way to weaken the town role.  The second is what Gamma did if he is town just made the scum job easier.  Again working on common assumptions and nothing else, scum learns that he is not any other role threat to them.  10:3 is the standard split for these games, assume VT lynch day one.  Scum would have 9 players to choose to NK from, with Gamma making his move, that is down to 8.  Again the standard 2/3 town PR assumption... that means scum increase their chance of killing a PR by about 10% (3/9 - 33% to 3/8 - 43%) if they are just randomly guessing.<br>\n<br>\nWhat does town gain?  Lets say there are two roles that can give us a direct advantage (which is generous... 2+ investigators is rare) that would otherwise be nullified.  They both randomly target the other 11 players at random, with 2 players its about a 17% chance they will target the ascetic.  If they claimed it drops to 11%.  So town gains 6% chance at not wasting a shot, scum gains 10% chance of killing a value target.  If there is only one investigator, gets even more advantage for scum.  Its like the ponies who say \"miller must claim\".  Its flawed thinking that a longshot chance might happen, when it gives scum a massive heads up on the setup and who is what role.  You are doing their job for them.<br>\n<br>\nI want to say VI on him, but this is SUCH simple logic if you put pencil to paper for just a minute that I have a hard time with it.  I just hope if he is town that his role is a red herring, the town with that role hasn't checked in or was cheeky and just claimed not ascetic (which I thought about doing, but this needs to be said if for no other reason to correct future thoughts).  Anypony else who hasn't claimed should refuse.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/images/img-tags/7zwgtI59XGqTGHnktcnI.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nMath.", "time": "Wed Dec 21, 2016 3:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69704&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "69704"}

{"number": 772, "id": "8649802", "user": "Alisae", "user_id": "28780", "content": "<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I will ALWAYS make the point that pushing on fake slips is a scumtell, in every single game I ever play. Because it's been a very reliable tell for me. I'll let you in on a couple of my other tricks as well; being \"excited\" about the game when the general mood is depressed or uninterested to the point of wanting to abandon is a scumtell. Claiming an investigative PR and making a lot of content about who you're going to check the following night (especially framing it as an fos ie \"For that I'm going to check YOU tonight\") is a scumtell. Jumping on people for too quickly commenting on a nightkill is a scumtell. These are all things I will pretty much always points out when they happen, regardless of my alignment.<br>\n<br>\nScum love having a \"justified\" vote. Instinctively, they look for a vote where they can lean back on a \"factual\" basis. A \"slip\" is a perfect example. When you push on a slip, you're no longer making your own read, you're just saying A therefore B. There is no read, you're presenting it as a fact.

Because it's been a very reliable tell for me. I'll let you in on a couple of my other tricks as well; being \"excited\" about the game when the general mood is depressed or uninterested to the point of wanting to abandon is a scumtell. Claiming an investigative PR and making a lot of content about who you're going to check the following night (especially framing it as an fos ie \"For that I'm going to check YOU tonight\") is a scumtell. Jumping on people for too quickly commenting on a nightkill is a scumtell. These are all things I will pretty much always points out when they happen, regardless of my alignment.<br>\n<br>\nScum love having a \"justified\" vote. Instinctively, they look for a vote where they can lean back on a \"factual\" basis. A \"slip\" is a perfect example. When you push on a slip, you're no longer making your own read, you're just saying A therefore B. There is no read, you're presenting it as a fact. And when the person you push flips town, you don't have to defend your \"read\" being wrong, you can just use that justification you built as a scape-goat. It's what scum subconsciously do ALL THE TIME. Yes, sometimes town will mistakenly think they've found a scumslip. Players like Mathblade are notorious for that kind of play.

(Well actually tbh, 38 is the more serious post, but it's the need to further the joke that I find unnecessary and as an actual serious remark). Never really supports his assertion in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641266#p8641266\">84</a> that I'm undermining the town to keep them from cooperating. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641266#p8641266\">84</a>'s content would be fine if it was less accusatory.

The word of advice in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642325#p8642325\">202</a> reads as town stepping back and reconsidering before continuing a push. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643342#p8643342\">303</a> was a decent observation of Alisae's behavior around voting and joining wagons. Don't like the instant Gin scumread in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643794#p8643794\">336</a> very much -- too accusatory versus trying to come to the same conclusion. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644902#p8644902\">400</a> comes across as a bit too cautious. (Primarily cuz of the \"Eh,\" start) . Grey doesn't make very concessions but he did in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646338#p8646338\">478</a> which reads townish considering his previous remark in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646313#p8646313\">476</a>. (Even though I dont know scum!Grey, I'm inclined to believe he'd not give in quite so easily. Possibly a bad assumption on my part). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644921#p8644921\">403</a> was a good catch even if the slip (still a slip regardless if Naomi is town or scum) is somewhat null. Refusal to reconsider makes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646627#p8646627\">501</a> seem scum motivated, though this seems to be a thing for Grey.

Maybe it's hindsight? The interaction with Alisae feels meh and not really alignment indicative on Alone's side. The case on Asphodel in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8651657#p8651657\">875</a> is well backed and sensible.

(No Offense) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643857#p8643857\">344</a> is an ok question. The OMGUS in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644073#p8644073\">366</a> is bad, but is it scum-motivated? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644172#p8644172\">373</a> is just buzzwords and nothing else -- Gin is not guilty of IoA (well, by your flawed definition, perhaps, but giving info isn't a bad thing, just when its info without any attempt to analyze or very little that its a problem). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644217#p8644217\">376</a> reads more as confirmation bias than a scum agenda tbh. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644273#p8644273\">389</a> probably confirms my suspicion -- Alisae considers stepping back but cant quite manage to focus elsewhere. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8645023#p8645023\">406</a> is prob. a good indicator for town.

Serious Q -- Are you being facetious in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642902#p8642902\">218</a>?

(Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, I just wanna know why). Yeah, I kinda glazed through a lot of posts cuz they were hard to read, but I think the assessment during her intro is very accurate, so she's probs town.<br>\n</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Null</div> (0% - 30% Confidence; No/Very Weak Read)<br>\n7.

To be honest, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646044#p8646044\">455</a> reads as confirmation bias. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646152#p8646152\">471</a> is a weird and clearly scum-motivated remark. Townies don't ignore their scumreads; they work with them. Scum ignore their \"scumreads\" so as to discredit them and plead innocent when a mislynch occurs. Also, TwoFace never explained why he couldn't trust Human. (Conflicting Views does not mean either of your views are wrong). The follow up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646701#p8646701\">517</a> reads anti-town behavior versus scum motivation though. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646999#p8646999\">558</a> as town trying to come to a common understanding w/ his target. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647418#p8647418\">614</a> reads as genuine frustration. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647438#p8647438\">619</a> is a scummy misrep as reads can change.

Looking through, reads mostly as confirmation biased town, but it's hard to tell at first glance cuz there's a lot of other scummy stuff that TwoFace has done in addition.<br>\n9. Krylea (+40%) - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647833#p8647833\">679</a> is a good first impression. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8648232#p8648232\">699</a> is meh -- think he should've read but not really a thing I see scum doing versus lazyish town. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649922#p8649922\">794</a> reads as a genuine response to Grey's Q. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652312#p8652312\">971</a> is blatant misrep, though I feel this is misguided/biased town versus scum. Eh, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652729#p8652729\">993</a> was unexpected and felt like it came from scum. Peer pressure? Yeah, I'm realky mixed here, good intro but feels like Kry is sheeping more than anything tbh. Easily manipulated seems the best way to put it.<br>\n10. TheRealGin-N-Tonic (-45%) - So, picking up after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642240#p8642240\">196</a>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643765#p8643765\">333</a> would be fine except I don't see how Gin can be null on Alisae at the time he posted that. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644007#p8644007\">362</a> also reads strange to me.

My response to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646805#p8646805\">538</a> is that daytalk is pretty common and only doesn't exist in the newbie queue due to the greater skill gap in every game and balance reasons. Pretty sure <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649936#p8649936\">796</a> was a L-1 vote. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649954#p8649954\">802</a> seems like a pointless question to ask.

What do you mean \"starting to look more like scum hunting than it did before\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646650#p8646650\">507</a>?

It also feels that Flubber looked at the post for like 500 milliseconds then decided to jump on it. Too much fluff imo and not enough analysis. Some things are stated matter-of-fact but they seem to be just that -- info. Not feeling good about this slot.<br>\n12. Asphodel (-70%) - Continuing after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642339#p8642339\">203</a> where I left off last time. The  \"test\" from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642317#p8642317\">201</a> and the subsequent analysis in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642516#p8642516\">208</a> feels... not right. I think Asphodel was too set on trying to prove me as having a fake read (a bit stretched read? definitely! fake? not really) but in the end, the end resukt wasn't what Asphodel expected. What I don't know is Asphodel'send read on me after this -- feels like it could've gone both ways and is ambiguous. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643269#p8643269\">286</a> reads super faked and on purposely done to get towncred.

It why I specifically asked about the type of result that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be getting guilty/not guilty instead of mafia as he suggested.<br>\n<br>\nNow your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br>\n<br>\n1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br>\n<br>\n2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br>\n<br>\n3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br>\n<br>\nNot as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways tl;dr<br>\n<br>\nMy role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nReally I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.

You balance a cop such that they will get about two investigations in a game before they die, meaning that any single player has at most a 1 in 6 chance of being targeted.

I don't see a town motive for voting someone, and then immediately following it up with a punch-pull like that. When townies vote, regardless of whether it's for lynching, pressure, information, or even just spite, they usually want that vote to have the maximum possible effect. The immediate punch-pull comes off like Asphodel isn't motivated by any of those things. Scums are mush more happy to avoid getting into a fight, and I think that's exactly why Asphodel worded his Flubber vote this way.<br>\n<br>\nI'll gladly lynch either Alisae or Asphodel today, they both read very scummy to me.</div></blockquote>\nI wasn't suddenly remembering that I had a vote on Ircher--I was planning on shifting my vote to Naomi anyways.  When that suspicion unraveled, I had the option to change my vote or to not change my vote.  My vote on Ircher wasn't doing much anymore so I decided to change it.<br>\n<br>\nI think asking for ascetic claims is a bold move if Ircher's scum.  Rolefishing is a pretty common thing that scum get rung up for.  He's also forcing himself and maybe potential scum partners to stake a claim on whether or not they're ascetic, which is risky because if he's scum he probably doesn't know what town roles are out there.  Like what if the only ascetics are scum?  <br>\n<br>\nThe town motive for voting someone and immediately reducing its effect is to be honest.  Last night I put a lot of work into the Naomi case, only to have it unravel.  Flubbernugget was a residual suspicion I'd had from earlier stuff, and I didn't see anything recent that was particularly suspicious.  It was a case that I'd already laid out earlier.  Leaving my vote on Ircher wasn't doing much good, and my suspicion on him had (at the time) been fading.  So I thought maybe shifting my vote could get me some more posts from Flubbernugget, who's  been fairly quiet this game.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8652064#p8652064\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8652064#p8652064\" data-post-id=\"8652064\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 913</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26976\">Ircher</a> wrote:</cite>Why?<br>\n<br>\nWe need to agree on a lynch (besides certain people ofc), and do it without letting them claim.

Even if you want to say both players survive two cycles, you are at about 80% chance not to be investigated.

It why I specifically asked about the type of result that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be getting guilty/not guilty instead of mafia as he suggested.<br>\n<br>\nNow your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br>\n<br>\n1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br>\n<br>\n2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br>\n<br>\n3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br>\n<br>\nNot as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways tl;dr<br>\n<br>\nMy role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nReally I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br>\n<br>\nLets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.  That was somepony trying to act like a cop.</div></blockquote>\nHis cop claim apparently contradicts some of the language in your role PM, and he was your top suspicion before he claimed cop.  And you're still viewing him as more likely VT than scum?  I don't like this.  I don't like this at all.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8653570#p8653570\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8653570#p8653570\" data-post-id=\"8653570\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1105</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16488\">Rainbowdash</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>krylea wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8653528#p8653528\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8653528#p8653528\" data-post-id=\"8653528\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1086</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28580\">Human Sequencer</a> wrote:</cite>Grey didn't switch anything up.

He's saying that with ascetics and if he's only an x-shot cop, he'd expect that there might be a second weakened investigative role.  Rainbow Dash asking about if Grey had any limitations made Grey think that she may be the other investigative role (and thus his counterpart).  Miller + Ascetics + Shot limitations is three different ways the cop's crippled.  A second investigative role implies better balance.

It why I specifically asked about the type of result that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be getting guilty/not guilty instead of mafia as he suggested.<br>\n<br>\nNow your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br>\n<br>\n1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br>\n<br>\n2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br>\n<br>\n3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br>\n<br>\nNot as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways tl;dr<br>\n<br>\nMy role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nReally I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br>\n<br>\nLets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.

If you have ever seen me play I will absolutely defend somepony I think is town to no end when I read them as town, even if that's not a popular read I am usually able to get them off the block.  I was reading Ircher as one of my strongest town reads for quite a while, so this sudden descent of him is giving me fits since I don't know if he actually is just confused about what is going on or had happened to luck into hitting a few of my town tells in the early game.<br>\n<br>\nReally im not sure if he just doesn't understand that the only way I really think you are scum is if you are ungodly creative with that role claim/are true claiming as scum and ascetic is scum or there is none.

You say you copped them to confirm their role and the other person flips red. Suddenly you've outted a tracker/watcher PR and Confirmed your Fake PR to the rest of town. Given that you can then easily start offing people. starting with the investigative role that confirmed you and moving on to the rest of town. For bonus points have your remaining red buddy claim nurse and no kill one night (prob the first night) and when mass roleclaim comes you have a confirmed Doc and Cop on reds team.

I don't see a town motive for voting someone, and then immediately following it up with a punch-pull like that. When townies vote, regardless of whether it's for lynching, pressure, information, or even just spite, they usually want that vote to have the maximum possible effect. The immediate punch-pull comes off like Asphodel isn't motivated by any of those things. Scums are mush more happy to avoid getting into a fight, and I think that's exactly why Asphodel worded his Flubber vote this way.<br>\n<br>\nI'll gladly lynch either Alisae or Asphodel today, they both read very scummy to me.</div></blockquote>\nI wasn't suddenly remembering that I had a vote on Ircher--I was planning on shifting my vote to Naomi anyways.  When that suspicion unraveled, I had the option to change my vote or to not change my vote.  My vote on Ircher wasn't doing much anymore so I decided to change it.<br>\n<br>\nI think asking for ascetic claims is a bold move if Ircher's scum.  Rolefishing is a pretty common thing that scum get rung up for.  He's also forcing himself and maybe potential scum partners to stake a claim on whether or not they're ascetic, which is risky because if he's scum he probably doesn't know what town roles are out there.  Like what if the only ascetics are scum?  <br>\n<br>\nThe town motive for voting someone and immediately reducing its effect is to be honest.  Last night I put a lot of work into the Naomi case, only to have it unravel.  Flubbernugget was a residual suspicion I'd had from earlier stuff, and I didn't see anything recent that was particularly suspicious.  It was a case that I'd already laid out earlier.  Leaving my vote on Ircher wasn't doing much good, and my suspicion on him had (at the time) been fading.  So I thought maybe shifting my vote could get me some more posts from Flubbernugget, who's  been fairly quiet this game.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8652064#p8652064\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8652064#p8652064\" data-post-id=\"8652064\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 913</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26976\">Ircher</a> wrote:</cite>Why?<br>\n<br>\nWe need to agree on a lynch (besides certain people ofc), and do it without letting them claim.

It why I specifically asked about the <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">type of result</div> that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">getting guilty/not guilty</div> instead of mafia as he suggested.<br>\n<br>\nNow your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br>\n<br>\n1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br>\n<br>\n2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br>\n<br>\n3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br>\n<br>\nNot as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways tl;dr<br>\n<br>\nMy role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nReally I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br>\n<br>\nLets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.  That was somepony trying to act like a cop.</div></blockquote>\nI think Raibow is being genuine.<br>\n<br>\nShe doubted your claim from the start and while scum have more incentive to do so, I can still see town doing that. She asks about the results which is critical imo because  she seems to have a flawed understanding of the wording. If I were to take a guess, if Rainbow was a true miller, it is probably worded \"You investigate as guilty to an investigative\" which is the proper wording imo. On the other hand, the Cop pm makes sense as \"Mafia/Not Mafia\" because the results aren't a universal cop whereas miller tends to be a universal guilty for role investigatives. Is it a bad push? I definitely think so. But I feel that this isn't a fake push just to make you look bad, just a different vantage point and beliefs.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: Krylea reads as less genuine than Rainbowdash btw.

Yeah, I get that she was suspicious of Grey before he claimed.  That doesn't explain why she went off and voted for me and then Ircher before going back to Grey.

TF didn't seem to notice that one of the links in Ircher's writeup of me goes to an unrelated post.  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8653093#p8653093\" class=\"postlink\">This is an example of good scumhunting on his part</a>.

I wasn't originally a huge fan of his interactions with Gamma (Naomi was right, he did keep commenting on Gamma being town early and then flipped), but at this point I'm sufficiently satisfied that the two aren't partners.  The train of thought being suspicious of Grey and now leaning towards maybe trusting Rainbow Dash makes a decent amount of sense.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Ircher</div></div>:  Looks more town the more I see of him.  Townread on Grey actually seems pretty town to me.  Like look&#8212;there&#8217;s a ton of scummy stuff he&#8217;s pointing out there.  And he concludes basically that Grey&#8217;s almost conftown.  Seems to me like he&#8217;s already read Grey town beforehand and is kind of forcing that into his readlist.  This is a town move, not a scum one.  I also think that he put in a shitload of effort into that readslist and should get credit for that.  Some people will jump on his urging for me to be hammered without a claim.  That's a bad move on his part and so clearly antitown that I consider it NAI.  He's not lower because of earlier reasons I voted him (overly defensive of Gamma) and also because of his interaction w/ Naomi and Alisae (calling Naomi a white knight and saying she's acting differently from a different white knight he found).<br>\n<br>\n***************************************************************************************************<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Naomi-Tan</div></div>:  I feel like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647224#p8647224\" class=\"postlink\">this type of setup spec</a> is something scum would censor themselves about but town might have a looser filter with.  I also think her progression on Grey/RD seems town.  I think scum would be more likely to take the popular position if they're late to the party on this, and I think siding with RD is slightly less popular.  I also think that this sort of quick retraction she does comes more from town than scum.  Would like to see her take a little more initiative in accusing other players of being red, it seems like she's playing a lot more on the defensive.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Human Sequencer</div></div>:  His early reaction test on me made me think he was genuinely scumhunting even if I think the results were pretty flimsy.  I like his recent posts about Krylea.  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8653451#p8653451\" class=\"postlink\">1063</a> and his subsequent pushing for ascetics to claim if they exist seem town-oriented to me.  I disagree with his position on RD/Grey not working itself out, but I think it's the type of thing that comes from town rather than scum.  Biggest thing I'm worried about with HS is his relationship with Ircher.  He pretty consistently talks about how we need to wait on judging Ircher at the start of the game, which is the type of thing I might expect from scum worried his partner's getting jumped too early.  I'm curious about what between like 150 and 450 made HS change his mind on Ircher.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Alisae</div></div>:  I townread her earlier with this comment:  \"Her paranoia about lynchbait seems like it's coming from a less-experienced townie who found a new scumhunting heuristic and wants to try it out as much as possible. Her initial suspicion on Gin is actually pretty reasonable, and her subsequent vote on AA makes me think her panic was legit. I also think new scum would be far more hesitant to claim non-ascetic than she was.\"  Since then, her vote on RainbowDash seems like a pretty natural progression from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652125#p8652125\" class=\"postlink\">931</a>.

Grey actions look green and no one puts in as much effort as red as rainbow put into this. I think this is just role BS fuckery. However, Given how much RD put out and the consistancy of grey. I personally think we should keep them both around. If RD is putting in this effort all the time they'll burn out or slip up eventually. Likewise If Grey is faking a cop claim we should know fairly shortly by night actions.<br>\n<br>\nI feel that the thoughtful way both RD and grey examined the game would be more fruitful for us still being in the game. I feel that If RD is read there miss lynches will eventually catchup to them, meanwhile they'll be forced to give indepth insight into how the Reds view us or for today how she does. <br>\n<br>\nLike wise if Grey is red due to his claim he'll be forced to Reveal some other green players to us and though that becomes WIFOM We can assume if he lives long enough he'll be a red.

Knowing now that Dash is scum, let's look at who fell where and when in the Dash vs Grey wagons:<br>\nThe Grey wagon went on and off a few times. The wagon that got him to claim was motivated a lot by the whole Naomi-scumslip business, and was led by me, Alisae, Gamma and Dash. Alisae and Gamma go after Grey because they don't like his focus on Naomi and think the scumslip thing is cover for scum!Grey to have a justified vote. Dash and I agree and join the wagon. Ircher and Gin pile on. Grey claims. <br>\nSome other shit happens that I'll get to later, then RD claims and pushes Grey. I believe RD's claim over Grey's and I vote Grey. HS does the opposite, as does Alisae. AA joins the RD wagon a little later, then Gamma after him, and Ircher after that. Gin waffles, claims it is TvT, tries to push me, then eventually hammers.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, Flubber, TwoFace, Aspho, and Naomi are the only ones not on either Grey or RD at the end of the day.<br>\n<br>\nMy conclusions:<br>\nI obviously fucked up defending RD and my play looked suspicious as hell. No shit.<br>\nGin commented very little after RD claimed until his post where he declared he thought it was TvT. I can certainly see town!Gin legimitimately thinking it was TvT. I can also see scum!Gin trying to get people off of the Grey/RD fight once scum knew Grey was a cop, to not get RD lynched. As Grey pointed out though, Gin is the obvious mislynch today if he is town. The fact that so few people joined Grey's wagon on him when he is such an attractive mislynch target makes me lean scum on him. But, as Grey said earlier, it could just be paranoia from scum and not wanting to stick their neck out. I find it interesting that Grey doesn't consider the scum!Gin angle to that though.<br>\nUpon rereading, I'm a lot more suspicious of AA. He joined the RD wagon after it was clear it was beating the Grey wagon, but never really pushed it after that. He was also lurking hard all day, and pushed the Asphodel wagon a lot.<br>\nIf AA is town, then I am suspicious of Aspho. He didn't join either Grey or RD's wagon and tried to pursue AA instead. There were also good cases laid out against him day 1 which were at least somewhat compelling. I doubt both AA and Aspho are scum though.<br>\n<br>\nHS is clear unless they were bussing RD damn hard. I suppose that's possible, but I don't see it as likely.<br>\nGamma is still obvtown.<br>\nI still have no fucking clue on TF.<br>\n<br>\nThere was also the Ircher and Asphodel wagons to consider. The Ircher one was led by me, TF and Gin. TF was tunneling pretty hard on Ircher, but in his defense Ircher seemed scummy as fuck to me too. <br>\nAspho's was interesting. HS, Alisae and AA were the first ones on it, and I liked how the wagon started. Eventually, Flubber joined with a super-opportunistic <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642963#p8642963\" class=\"postlink\">229</a>, where he was the 4th person on the wagon after a very poorly justified vote where he was previously lurking. I find this an interesting comparison to his behaviour today, where he also jumped on my wagon in a relatively similar fashion. <br>\nI think I was the only other person to join it after that, but I could be mistaken on that one. Maybe Ircher did too at some point? Either way, it never got all that much traction and was drowned out by the cacophony around Grey and RD.<br>\n<br>\nNaomi is the only one I haven't mentioned much. I'm wondering whether to revisit her 'scumslip' thing given the knowledge that Grey is now almost certainly town and RD has flipped scum, but it's a hard thing to get a read on. The fact that she was also never on the RD wagon is also telling. There isn't exactly anything ironclad though.<br>\n<br>\nThis game is fucking weird. From looking at this, I'd be most inclined to suspect some combination of {Flubber, Gin, AA, Naomi}. Most suspicious of Flubber and Gin within those four.

Im kinda all lost right now as my usal read stuff didn't work right. Normally Im excellent at picking bad players from the reds. but I called the jailor wrong and I'm normally pretty good at telling who reds are but rainbow was a red when at the end of D1 I was entirely convinced they was green and this was just a TvT situation that I had to settle down.<br>\n<br>\nLike I was pretty much certain.. no one normally puts in that much effort as those two did and there exchange looked genuine from both sides.. at first I was with RD as I guess I was kinda confirm Bais'ing a little and there oringal post was pretty convincing when I read it. but nope. It was all a ruse. <br>\n<br>\nI've spent most of the last couple days just questioning myself if any of my reads are right.. Take two face. Normally hes active like myself on my more active times but he has been more background in this game. and he tossed doubt on someone who I think is confirmed town right now. Which Im not sure matches there play style. but then again two face is stubbon and unpredictable and if I went in on that and I was wrong again he would just get me slain and could be like \"woops\" and no one would care.. I feel my position is shakey and that makes me even more nervous to act.. I don't normally get things this wrong and I feel that only the cop clearing me will help. but given the jailor is down I doubt that'll happen too. Im just doing my best to not kill myself by just trying to find something that'll help us.. even if all I can add is questions Im hoping that in someway that'll help us win. Everything is just off this game. I did at least manage to save one person so.. if I can just keep helping people in little ways and just sorta explaining myself and stuff I'm sure between us we'll find the last reds.", "time": "Mon Dec 26, 2016 12:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69704&start=1550", "forum": "53", "thread": "69704"}

I saw a miss lynch happening and I stepped in and gave them an out. given that Reds have no day talk It would make more sense to assume that I was assisting a red team mate out of a bad situation given your previous stance rather than going with white knighting.

I still think there green right now. There reactions and actions just look like someone who is aggressively looking for any red slip. It can be grating at times but I don't equate being aggressive and abrasive to being red aligned. It can be a red trait but I think given grays analysis and thoughts they are probably green.<br>\n<br>\nIn 230 my perception was you might be bad green. Lately I been unsure of that though.

She puts forward an amazing case here and entirely flipped my thoughts on gray. Like Her first section where they talk about how he assumed no RB is a thing. Like he had a go at me for assuming no day talk when its not declared. If that was his attitude towards roles. why would be also make an assumption and RB is a much more common role in my experience. <br>\n<br>\nAs I read the second part of RB's post all I was thinking was Why would they claim cop Day 1?

If Rainbow haddn't stepped in I could see myself probing Ircher much more to try and work out their red green balance. but as it stands I feel they are likely green.

But this is not a normal situation for me. Most games I work out rather shortly who my short list of possible reds are and the ones on the bottom of the scale normally are red. This game the reverse has happened its shaken my gameplay. While normally I have the confidence of having people figgured out in this game Im only really sure of a very small handful of players and am trying to filter the others out (that list is Alisae and Human Sequencer for reference) Normally I can tell the more shinning players from the others and work out where the people who are meh are there is a conditional for this though and that non-biestness. I am aware that i'm prone to biest views on occasion and that leads me to make bad reads and given how much pressure I've gotten Its hard to get that clean read that helps me sort things properly. normally my read lists by page 20 have gotten all by 5 people green and that normally pans out. so far my reads have had a Green who was a Red and thats not good and at one stage I even had a cop as red cause I was convinced there Claim was a lie. This is also not good. My non-fear comes from the confidence that my reads are on point and this game.. they haven't been and thats okay. I was happy to let Grey lead the hunt for a while as he was playing better and had more firm views could argue me to a lynch and had the general skill at convincing people that I lack. Course greys gone now and the pressure is back on me.. and when Im pressured I get demotivated and try to fade away to come back when the heat has moved on as under pressure I suck hard and I can't focus on hunting which leads to the vicious cycle that ends with me being miss lynched due to not being able to focus on removing pressure. In fact in one game I entirely snapped under pressure as one guy kept being horrible and spinning stuff at me. <br>\n<br>\nMoving on<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>TheRealGin-N-Tonic wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nVoted Grey even after claim.

At the time I saw no reason why scum would go out of their way to buddy me when I could have turned into a lynch so that's mostly why I gave her towncredit, but I think Naomi buddied me so that I'd give her towncredit.

It was after the RD flip that I got all dislocated and confused as I took a knock to my listing and had to work out what peoples alignment REALLY was. I take my time to vote normally and being So very wrong made me distrust my own reads. I think there unreliable right now. So.. I'm being much less aggressive. Only really pointing at things and seeing if people agree or disagree. but it doesn't help with so much focus on me.. like its hard to work people out from interactions that don't involve me as they have been pretty much everything since post 600. Its kinda like trying to work around your biest but then I question I am giving too much give? Should I be pushing this? I don't like pushing around things that involve me it just blinds me to the truth and there is only so much I can gain from the early game.. so I'm kinda working with facts as that I can trust.. and using connections that seem present. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8674332#p8674332\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8674332#p8674332\" data-post-id=\"8674332\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1746</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28780\">Alisae</a> wrote:</cite>I mean that she didn't have any votes by the end of the day.

Grey actions look green and no one puts in as much effort as red as rainbow put into this. I think this is just role BS fuckery. However, Given how much RD put out and the consistancy of grey. I personally think we should keep them both around. If RD is putting in this effort all the time they'll burn out or slip up eventually. Likewise If Grey is faking a cop claim we should know fairly shortly by night actions.<br>\n<br>\nI feel that the thoughtful way both RD and grey examined the game would be more fruitful for us still being in the game. I feel that If RD is read there miss lynches will eventually catchup to them, meanwhile they'll be forced to give indepth insight into how the Reds view us or for today how she does. <br>\n<br>\nLike wise if Grey is red due to his claim he'll be forced to Reveal some other green players to us and though that becomes WIFOM We can assume if he lives long enough he'll be a red. As why leave the cop up for so long and risk being copped. <br>\n<br>\nLeast thats my sugar high thoughts on everything.

Starting to see what Naomi said for her introduction (and that's a good thing). 482 was a slip regardless of alignment, but that doesn't necessary mean Naomi is scum. Town \"slip\" all the time cuz they're less cautious. 549 gives an associative tell if either flips scum. Why did you feel the need to requite me in 660?

I still think there green right now. There reactions and actions just look like someone who is aggressively looking for any red slip. It can be grating at times but I don't equate being aggressive and abrasive to being red aligned. It can be a red trait but I think given grays analysis and thoughts they are probably green.<br>\n<br>\nIn 230 my perception was you might be bad green. Lately I been unsure of that though. Gray was pretty much unchanged.<br>\n<br>\nI just felt like 660 bared repeating. So It could be seen in both our iso's You drew attention to something no one else was looking at. I think it was good.<br>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\nThen I read rainbows post. She puts forward an amazing case here and entirely flipped my thoughts on gray. Like Her first section where they talk about how he assumed no RB is a thing. Like he had a go at me for assuming no day talk when its not declared. If that was his attitude towards roles. why would be also make an assumption and RB is a much more common role in my experience. <br>\n<br>\nAs I read the second part of RB's post all I was thinking was Why would they claim cop Day 1? They wasn't under major pressure and it just paints a huge target on themselves.

I do see the points people have made but If Gray is red and I was wrong (which I believe right now) I can't see a game where Ircher and Gray are on the same team given interactions at this stand Ircher was tunnelling gray for a while and IIRC gray also at one point voted back. If Rainbow haddn't stepped in I could see myself probing Ircher much more to try and work out their red green balance. but as it stands I feel they are likely green.
