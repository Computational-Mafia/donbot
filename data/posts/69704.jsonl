For everyone else... time to write <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> hiya, I'm naomi and I have a very strange play style. Starting with a quirk; I call town Green and Mafia Reds I've only recently started doing this and I do slip up on this from time to time. So... going forward bare this in mind. <br><br>Now. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br><br>The strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br><br>I do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br><br>I am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't. If your currently falling in the last group of players feel free to browse my wiki, I post every game I've completed in it and it can be a good source for you to confirm this information. of course most of you won't.. but that just tends to be how it is.<br><br>Finally though my account is an older one I have only played a small pool of games as I took around about a year and a half break between two of my games only starting steadily again this year. So.. though I'm an older account I lack the experience and skill of many of my contemporaries.<br><br>So.. yeah.. thats pretty much all you need to know to get a good read on myself and... yeah lets get to that post I wanted to make.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>TL;DR&gt; She posts this stuff as town.

My last game ended in June and I don't think I've ever played with anyone in this game before.  So I should probably introduce myself.  I began playing mafia (werewolf) on a smaller site, and am far more used to playing under that's site's rules.  Those rules included almost exclusively out of topic communication and also day phases that last approximately 48 hours long.<br><br>Self-meta-ing a little bit from my games on the other site, I very rarely, if ever try to push for my partners to be lynched as scum.  That's for a few reasons.  It was a pretty tight-knit group over there, and there was no cardflip in many of the games.  Like, over a span of 20 or so scum games, I remember the single time I voted for a scum partner, and even that doesn't really count because my partner made a really terrible counterclaim.  That's not to say I never scumread my partners, I just avoided seriously putting my vote on them because 48 hours is not a very long time.<br><br>I have been town in every game I've played on this site, so I'm unsure if this would be different under these rules.  I imagine it might.  I'm still probably going to use this as proof I'm town if I ever vote someone who flips scum though.  I've only completed two games here, and they went pretty differently.<br><br>In my first game, I was a Town Cop.  I locked onto someone who I thought was scum Day 1 and went after them pretty much the whole day.  I think I confirmation-biased them pretty hard since the most important thing I remember about them is that I didn't enjoy playing with them.  The person I scumread Day 1 ended up being the doctor and we lynched 1 of 2 scum Day 1.  I found the other scum Night 2, so the game ended pretty soon after that.<br><br>In my most recent game, I was one of a few weak town bodyguards.  After being forced to claim and then floundering for a lot of Day 1, I ended up pushing through a lynch on a VT.  I never really got another solid scumread the rest of the game.  As a result, I kept on rereading the thread and people moved up and down my suspicion list pretty randomly.  I think some people scumread me for that, though if I had to guess that's probably a townread for me.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8640358#p8640358\" class=\"postlink\">post 8</a>, Naomi-Tan wrote:</cite>Okay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure.

If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me.

For those who know this post feel free to skip it yadda yadda.<br>Hi, I'm Naomi I have kinda a strange play style. Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people. I dislike calling people scum as its kinda mean so I switched to the color thing and it appears to have caught on rather well in other games I've been in. Thats not so major. but Its a good thing to note.<br><br>Okay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me.

Starting with a quirk; I call town Green and Mafia Reds I've only recently started doing this and I do slip up on this from time to time. So... going forward bare this in mind. <br><br>Now. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br><br>The strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br><br>I do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br><br>I am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't. If your currently falling in the last group of players feel free to browse my wiki, I post every game I've completed in it and it can be a good source for you to confirm this information. of course most of you won't.. but that just tends to be how it is.<br><br>Finally though my account is an older one I have only played a small pool of games as I took around about a year and a half break between two of my games only starting steadily again this year.

Asphodel accuses Ircher of faking a town read on Gamma, Ircher provides evidence that he was indeed townreading Gamma, and then Asphodel backs into a weird stance of \"oh well in that case you shouldn't have been townreading him\" that doesn't really follow from his original position. It reads like Asphodel is trying to force a scumread more than he's trying to gamesolve. In particular, this quote from Asphodel's 177 bothers me:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Asphodel wrote:</cite>a scumread you thought was legitimate, or not totally baseless, or whatever.</div></blockquote><br><br>If town-Asphodel is genuinely scumreading Ircher, I don't think he would write off Ircher's position as \"or whatever\" like that. Townies don't tend to be that apathetic towards their scumreads' positions. Townies need to know what their scumreads' positions are, it's the whole reason they're scumreading them!<br><br>But if Asphodel is scum, it makes a lot more sense for him to not care what Ircher's position is here. For scum-Asphodel, the important thing is to make Ircher look bad, and dismissing his read on Gamma as \"or whatever\" does a much better job of that.<br><br>And when I combine that with Asphodel's weird backoff above, I really, really don't get the impression that Asphodel is genuinely trying to sort Ircher here.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Asphodel</span>"}

For those who know this post feel free to skip it yadda yadda.<br>Hi, I'm Naomi I have kinda a strange play style. Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people. I dislike calling people scum as its kinda mean so I switched to the color thing and it appears to have caught on rather well in other games I've been in. Thats not so major. but Its a good thing to note.<br><br>Okay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me. I also am probably forgetting somethings. As i'm sleepy</div></blockquote><br>One question --- Does making this post actually help you in any way?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes. It lets people know what to expect and helps me protect myself aganist reds pushing me for a miss lynch so its useful that way. also helps inform town onto what to expect saving foot work for those who are lazy. The way I see it you can either Believe it, NAI it or See it as an excuse setup for later, which it totally is as well. thats just kinda how its been. I normally get those who havn't played with me before fitting into the  latter two while those who have palyed with me before fit into the former two (as they have experienced it) As It in no way hurts to share information and I provide sources for people to check out I feel its a good and helpful thing that those who are paranoida can backup. Even if it is NAI. An NAI post to explain some things you'll red read me for are NAI is useful to me <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">"}

Obviouslu, the bad thing about it is the entire intro and how it is focused on Asphodel being town; however, I know I have done similar things (though not nearly as in-depth) as town before multiple times, so that point is kinda moot.

His \"continuance\" of his joke in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8640511#p8640511\">40</a> seems more serious than a joke.

For those who know this post feel free to skip it yadda yadda.<br>Hi, I'm Naomi I have kinda a strange play style. Firstly Rather than calling people town or Scum I call them Green or Red This is because Its just a nicer thing to call people. I dislike calling people scum as its kinda mean so I switched to the color thing and it appears to have caught on rather well in other games I've been in. Thats not so major. but Its a good thing to note.<br><br>Okay so onto the bulk of stuff. My playstyle Is kinda weird. I don't like dying as either alignment and try to stay alive. this means that sometimes I do actions to just look more green and sometimes and Im suspectable to peer pressure. To midigate this I tend to play entirely openly and honestly examining things and doing what I can to contribute to town. But things like Lamist actions are things I tend to do as both alignments. If anyone wants to read my town meta feel free to explore my wiki page (ordered chronologically with my most recent games at the bottom of either list) But this is a quick overview to protect my butt from future Red efforts (as they can push me on; Look there doing that thing thats normally red but isn't for them) and so Greens don't push me for being me. I also am probably forgetting somethings. As i'm sleepy</div></blockquote><br>One question --- Does making this post actually help you in any way?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes. It lets people know what to expect and helps me protect myself aganist reds pushing me for a miss lynch so its useful that way. also helps inform town onto what to expect saving foot work for those who are lazy. The way I see it you can either Believe it, NAI it or See it as an excuse setup for later, which it totally is as well. thats just kinda how its been. I normally get those who havn't played with me before fitting into the  latter two while those who have palyed with me before fit into the former two (as they have experienced it) As It in no way hurts to share information and I provide sources for people to check out I feel its a good and helpful thing that those who are paranoida can backup. Even if it is NAI. An NAI post to explain some things you'll red read me for are NAI is useful to me <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote><br>Was wondering because I've tried similar stuff before (a lot briefer though) and it's never worked well for me."}

This much in a day is nearing a point where its just anti-town in nature for those of us who have a regular job and cant be online 24-7.  Currently a third of the game has less than ten posts, and likely as with me don't have the time to be effective in a 15 page a day game.  Some people can only really give an hour or two a day to playing, and when all of that time is spent getting caught up on all of this you are going to create an oversaturation of information on a few players and leave the bar on entry at others so high that you are going to get next to zero content.  I can normally read at work, but a phone and hooves?  That isn't conducive to being able to play the game.<br><br>That just needs to be said.  Say in it less words.  Let other ponies get a chance to say things.  Posting this much is an anti-town practice when a third of the game is essentially eliminated from the picture because of it, and a fast paced game is by FAR the easiest thing for scum to be able to manipulate because there tends to be far more impulsive acts. I will see if I can find a game from a few years back that I am remembering where town basically lost what should have been a cakewalk win because they sped the game up way too fast and scum took advantage of it.<br><br>Trying to get caught up and something substantial out when cooking now."}

Also I would actually completely agree that sheeping a vote is scum motivated, if it's past Day 2. However, in Day 1, votes aren't super serious until you're turning people into L-3 and L-2, if sheeping at that stage, it's scummy.

They set you up by asking a leading question and then span that as fence sitting. But if you look at your play you can see the weakness's as well as the townie aspects of it. Its not explicitly bad to examine things carefully before voting (It took me till page 11 to vote) To say your fence sitting would be incorrect. You gave your thoughts on things as the game went on you just didn't vote. This to me says that You wasn't sure enough to vote. which is a Green trait as reds don't hesitate as much especially on people who are weaker players as they can shrug it off if they turn out to be proactive // good for greens"}

They are lashing out at people who vote them without really thinking it fully through there emotional right now and trying there best to not be lynched ironically pushing more attention on themselves. If they live they will be shown as green later on I believe via play. Then there are things like her interaction with gray. Yes it was poorly executed but thats the point. If you was red looking for a Misslynch why target one of the strongest Green players instead of their investigative target that was already kinda melting. Additionally The way they put forth there wagon was super poorly coordinated and didn't really have the careful thought put into it that a wagon by an experianced player or a red member has. To Paraphase that interaction here is a small over the top rendition.<br><br>Gray; Eh been on this train long enough, its not going anywhere time to switch back.<br>Alisae; Define Long<br>Gray; urrrr... Its a word, Look it up in the dictionary its kinda common.<br>Alisae; ...Why you avoiding the question. Its a simple thing to answer<br>Gray; Its a common word. I don't really need to look things up in the dictionary for you do I?<br>Alisae; Well you could!.. (Blushes) Well.. It appears you miss understood.. What I REALLY wanted to know is What made you change your vote... Not that im embarrassed! shut up! You just don't like working with people. thats red!<br><br>You can see this tsundere Attitude at the end in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641790#p8641790\">158</a> Its especally Explicit with the First and last lines; \"Okay then you misunderstood the question\" and \"Also don't like the fact you're not willing to work with me. If anything you're being anti-town at the moment.\" <br>The first line establishes that They acknowledge that Gray didn't get the question and didn't want to look up a common word. while the last line shows how flustered there are about it. red reading them for there own poorly worded question while being embarrassed themselves.<br>After that point they convince themselves that Gray is Lynch baiting when its obvious to us that they was just playing normally. but to the world filter she applied it was Lynch baiting because she took note that Gray was kinda playing well. but also thought they was playing badly. the only time you play well and badly is with a slayer gambit or lynch bait. Which is how her thoughts landed in that square.<br>Her questions after that interaction are probing to work out where people stand, not pushing at all which would match a more careful playstyle until people put pressure on her. Given what I extracted from her personality ealier I believe this would resulted in them acting defensive and making rash choices."}

Bad town bleeds bad town throughout the thread. It's easy to find bad town if you have enough content, and a large amount of mislynches D1 are on bad town.

I'm sick of seeing them at this point because it looks like a lot of town players read getting a power role as a 'Get Out Of Scumread Free' card and it pisses me off. If Gamma really is a PR and really is town he should be ashamed of his play. You can refer to Naomi and Twoface for information on how I react to softclaims and how irate they make me.

So In my post I made the statement as if It was a true fact to make it more convincing and put greater pressure on you. As it is not stated in the rules we can assume there is no day talk however, it is still possible given the normal setup that communication between reds is possible (they might have masons or have an encryptor) But in the first post It wouldn't made my point as strongly if I used given its likely instead of given."}

I saw a miss lynch happening and I stepped in and gave them an out. given that Reds have no day talk It would make more sense to assume that I was assisting a red team mate out of a bad situation given your previous stance rather than going with white knighting.

If you was red and I had said \"as its unlikely reds have day talk\" it would of shown weakness and unsureness and given you an opportunity to take advantage of the situation by not answering my question (which you neglected to answer instead opting to chainsaw IIRC) I wanted to put you off footing and to get you to show if you was red or green. Given that a green would of acted as if what I said was offencive and silly while a red would more likely backout of it. Given you flipped it around on one word it became NAI as if a red spotted I said given They could make this wagon just as easily. The fact that I was making an agressive move acted aganist me here and I understand that I should of said Likely given or some other thing that acknowledged the existence of a role. <br><br>Everypost their after was purely to try and get you off your focused word. I used given on an assumption that reds don't have day talk. Beacuse at the time I made an assumption that reds don't have day talk. and I used that to given the possible situations in my head. Which went as follows;<br><br>Red having day talk and me and Alisae being red; No need to put my neck out in the main thread as I could of walked them through how to back down or stopped there push ealier.<br>Red having day talk and me and Alisae not being on the same team. White knighting<br>Red not having day talk and me and Alisae being red; Being so obvious would make it really easy for greens to get two kills off of a misslynch<br>Red not having day talk and me being red and Alisae being green; white knighting<br>Red not having day talk me being green and Alisae being red; I just saved a red woops.<br>Red not having day talk and me and Alisae being green; I saved someone in trouble.<br><br>While white knighting may be a thing. There is no way to prove defending someone is a White knight situation. if you go back to my read list;<br><br>Alisae &gt;&gt; Feels like miss guided Green If I had to guess there the type of player that takes a little to form an idea but once its there it sticks for a while. This isn't a bad thing but I feel there pushes are miss guided and go on slightly longer than needed and I feel that they should revaluate more often.<br><br>I already said I thought they was being a bad green player and that they 'need to revalute more often' as in take a step back and go 'is this red or just bad for me' then I saw they wasn't doing that and flailing more and more lashing out at anyone and I stepped into stop them. before they self destructed. Is this white knighting is the question. I say no, if your reading someone as bad green and they are being so obvious bad green but are just digging themselves a hole stepping in is one of the ways to avoid them getting miss lynched.<br><br>Afterwards I saw Gray try to flip things on me. Which would been fine, but he said I white knighted.. To me white knighting is steping into save someone green aligned when you have shown little or no thoughts that they are green. This is not the case here so I wished to reverse his push on me to pressure them back. This would helped others determine both our alignments as It was a thing I was sure wouldn't go more than a couple of pages as honestly. I didn't wanna lynch them and I felt they saw me as kinda green leaning at the time. Turns out I in my boldness made a misstake as I was getting into the pushing mood. Now you may be wondering. If I've done this kinda thing before and yes I have. If you go back a couple town games to the first game I adopted the colour system I called Town blue. As a town player. I have also made other mistakes while in the moment as TF can confirm (mort push last game, and the other 180's you've seen me do) <br><br>I'm not always right. But I know when I have to back out of a mistake that I made and be honest about it. which is why after saying it was an assumption (because it was) I more in depth explained why I used given. I assumed at the time that there was no day talk and when it was brought up I admitted that It was the wrong choice of words. I choose it because it made my point more bold and I shouldn't have. <br><br>I am going to keep dealing with the white knight stuff but this one word mistake thing, yeah I'm just gonna put that aside like I did a while ago. sure it'll shade people to me for a while but I expect it'll get me investigated and green confirmed later on."}

They are lashing out at people who vote them without really thinking it fully through there emotional right now and trying there best to not be lynched ironically pushing more attention on themselves. If they live they will be shown as green later on I believe via play. Then there are things like her interaction with gray. Yes it was poorly executed but thats the point. If you was red looking for a Misslynch why target one of the strongest Green players instead of their investigative target that was already kinda melting. Additionally The way they put forth there wagon was super poorly coordinated and didn't really have the careful thought put into it that a wagon by an experianced player or a red member has. To Paraphase that interaction here is a small over the top rendition.<br><br>Gray; Eh been on this train long enough, its not going anywhere time to switch back.<br>Alisae; Define Long<br>Gray; urrrr... Its a word, Look it up in the dictionary its kinda common.<br>Alisae; ...Why you avoiding the question. Its a simple thing to answer<br>Gray; Its a common word. I don't really need to look things up in the dictionary for you do I?<br>Alisae; Well you could!.. (Blushes) Well.. It appears you miss understood.. What I REALLY wanted to know is What made you change your vote... Not that im embarrassed! shut up! You just don't like working with people. thats red!<br><br>You can see this tsundere Attitude at the end in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641790#p8641790\">158</a> Its especally Explicit with the First and last lines; \"Okay then you misunderstood the question\" and \"Also don't like the fact you're not willing to work with me. If anything you're being anti-town at the moment.\" <br>The first line establishes that They acknowledge that Gray didn't get the question and didn't want to look up a common word. while the last line shows how flustered there are about it. red reading them for there own poorly worded question while being embarrassed themselves.<br>After that point they convince themselves that Gray is Lynch baiting when its obvious to us that they was just playing normally. but to the world filter she applied it was Lynch baiting because she took note that Gray was kinda playing well. but also thought they was playing badly. the only time you play well and badly is with a slayer gambit or lynch bait. Which is how her thoughts landed in that square.<br>Her questions after that interaction are probing to work out where people stand, not pushing at all which would match a more careful playstyle until people put pressure on her. Given what I extracted from her personality ealier I believe this would resulted in them acting defensive and making rash choices.</div></blockquote><br>Why are you assuming that Alisae wouldn't be flustered as red?  She only has one completed game and that was a green game. Two others in progress where she's alive in both if I read right.  Seems to me like being flustered for a person without many completed games is NAI.  That being said, her focus on lynchbait strikes me as a more green thing now that I realize this is one of her first few games.  I don't know how to put this delicately, but focusing overly much on one potential strategy seems like a type of thing a newer player would do."}

If you're asking me why I think it's scummy, I think that all votes when they are casted matter and quite frankly say \"I think this person is scummy\" unless it's RVS, then it's to apply pressure.

I am commandeering that IC hat from Gamma because he has ZERO idea about what he is talking about and if he is town just really helped scum these last few pages.<br><br>1) The \"scum don't have day talk\" is not a slip.  It is something that you should always operate on as being true unless something presents itself to directly say otherwise.  If Naomi said scum DO have day talk, that would be worth jumping on.  As it stands she said something that I would bet all my bits everypony else assumed is the case.<br><br>2) Asectic should absolutely 100% NOT CLAIM if they are town, and I am stuck between Gamma as the town VI or as scum trying to find out more about PRs.  For two primary reasons.  The first is that a majority of time a town role is given the ascetic modifier, its to help balance out another part of their role. Like if a mod wants a cop and a doctor, they can make the cop ascetic and that acts as a way to weaken the town role.  The second is what Gamma did if he is town just made the scum job easier.  Again working on common assumptions and nothing else, scum learns that he is not any other role threat to them.  10:3 is the standard split for these games, assume VT lynch day one.  Scum would have 9 players to choose to NK from, with Gamma making his move, that is down to 8.  Again the standard 2/3 town PR assumption... that means scum increase their chance of killing a PR by about 10% (3/9 - 33% to 3/8 - 43%) if they are just randomly guessing.<br><br>What does town gain?  Lets say there are two roles that can give us a direct advantage (which is generous... 2+ investigators is rare) that would otherwise be nullified.  They both randomly target the other 11 players at random, with 2 players its about a 17% chance they will target the ascetic.  If they claimed it drops to 11%.  So town gains 6% chance at not wasting a shot, scum gains 10% chance of killing a value target.  If there is only one investigator, gets even more advantage for scum.  Its like the ponies who say \"miller must claim\".  Its flawed thinking that a longshot chance might happen, when it gives scum a massive heads up on the setup and who is what role.  You are doing their job for them.<br><br>I want to say VI on him, but this is SUCH simple logic if you put pencil to paper for just a minute that I have a hard time with it.  I just hope if he is town that his role is a red herring, the town with that role hasn't checked in or was cheeky and just claimed not ascetic (which I thought about doing, but this needs to be said if for no other reason to correct future thoughts).  Anypony else who hasn't claimed should refuse.<br><br><img src=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/images/img-tags/7zwgtI59XGqTGHnktcnI.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"><br><br>Math."}

Because it's been a very reliable tell for me. I'll let you in on a couple of my other tricks as well; being \"excited\" about the game when the general mood is depressed or uninterested to the point of wanting to abandon is a scumtell. Claiming an investigative PR and making a lot of content about who you're going to check the following night (especially framing it as an fos ie \"For that I'm going to check YOU tonight\") is a scumtell. Jumping on people for too quickly commenting on a nightkill is a scumtell. These are all things I will pretty much always points out when they happen, regardless of my alignment.<br><br>Scum love having a \"justified\" vote. Instinctively, they look for a vote where they can lean back on a \"factual\" basis. A \"slip\" is a perfect example. When you push on a slip, you're no longer making your own read, you're just saying A therefore B. There is no read, you're presenting it as a fact. And when the person you push flips town, you don't have to defend your \"read\" being wrong, you can just use that justification you built as a scape-goat. It's what scum subconsciously do ALL THE TIME. Yes, sometimes town will mistakenly think they've found a scumslip. Players like Mathblade are notorious for that kind of play. But as a general rule it's a scum tactic.</div></blockquote><br><br>^ Something a player that I respect once told me."}

Its far more of a risk, but by claiming miller you basically say to the scum \"by the way there is a cop in this game\".  Even if you want to say both players survive two cycles, you are at about 80% chance not to be investigated. Especially in a large game, I think you can get away without a miller claim, even more if you leave some sort of a \"Hey look at me, im a miller and this is a convenient breadcrumb\" type post.<br><br>Less scum know about the setup the harder it is to play as scum.  C9++ setup is the best example of how scum not knowing what they are up against makes the game FAR harder for them.<br><br>That's just theory though, I think site still tends to trend towards the conservative miller claim (likely due to lack of scum faking it) although not as much anymore, but I think there is plenty of justification against throwing that claim out as well."}

Because it's been a very reliable tell for me. I'll let you in on a couple of my other tricks as well; being \"excited\" about the game when the general mood is depressed or uninterested to the point of wanting to abandon is a scumtell. Claiming an investigative PR and making a lot of content about who you're going to check the following night (especially framing it as an fos ie \"For that I'm going to check YOU tonight\") is a scumtell. Jumping on people for too quickly commenting on a nightkill is a scumtell. These are all things I will pretty much always points out when they happen, regardless of my alignment.<br><br>Scum love having a \"justified\" vote. Instinctively, they look for a vote where they can lean back on a \"factual\" basis. A \"slip\" is a perfect example. When you push on a slip, you're no longer making your own read, you're just saying A therefore B. There is no read, you're presenting it as a fact. And when the person you push flips town, you don't have to defend your \"read\" being wrong, you can just use that justification you built as a scape-goat. It's what scum subconsciously do ALL THE TIME. Yes, sometimes town will mistakenly think they've found a scumslip. Players like Mathblade are notorious for that kind of play. But as a general rule it's a scum tactic.</div></blockquote><br><br>^ Something a player that I respect once told me.</div></blockquote><br><br>I also have a hard time believing that town-Alisae believes this strongly that slip-hunting is scummy, yet has said <span style=\"font-style: italic\">absolutely nothing</span> about TwoFace's attack on Naomi. TwoFace has only accused Naomi of slipping somewhere around <span class=\"noboldsig\">eighty million times</span>, so there's no way Alisae can have missed it. There's really no good reason for town-Alisae to be ignoring TwoFace here. But as scum looking for a reason to push the Grey wagon, it makes a lot more sense for Alisae to use this against Grey while ignoring TwoFace.<br><br>Like, I really, absolutely, cannot overstate how certain I am that Alisae got a red PM this game."}

Obviouslu, the bad thing about it is the entire intro and how it is focused on Asphodel being town; however, I know I have done similar things (though not nearly as in-depth) as town before multiple times, so that point is kinda moot.

The word of advice in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642325#p8642325\">202</a> reads as town stepping back and reconsidering before continuing a push. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643342#p8643342\">303</a> was a decent observation of Alisae's behavior around voting and joining wagons.

(Primarily cuz of the \"Eh,\" start) . Grey doesn't make very concessions but he did in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646338#p8646338\">478</a> which reads townish considering his previous remark in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646313#p8646313\">476</a>. (Even though I dont know scum!Grey, I'm inclined to believe he'd not give in quite so easily.

Refusal to reconsider makes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646627#p8646627\">501</a> seem scum motivated, though this seems to be a thing for Grey.

My assumption is scum!Alisae would be more jumpy at such a comment. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8645560#p8645560\">423</a> is again OMGUS in disguise; this is starting to become a personality tell. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8645710#p8645710\">444</a> I kinda feel is a weak response to Naomi's way out, but meh, I'd prob. do something similar given the chance. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647334#p8647334\">597</a> feels important, but it prob. be better if I didn't elaborate here. Nvm <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647334#p8647334\">597</a> -- see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647822#p8647822\">674</a>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649161#p8649161\">727</a> is just bad logic as that scumtell works just as much as the information scumtell. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649405#p8649405\">734</a> is confusing, but feels more authentic than the previous readslist. The person referenced in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649802#p8649802\">772</a> is unfortunately wrong as universal scumtells just never work. (One-Size-NEVER-Fits-ALL) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652163#p8652163\">943</a> feels legitimate to ask. Overall, this reads as self-conscious town.<br>6. Naomi-Tan (+65%) - Guess I'm starting after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8640412#p8640412\">27</a> here. Serious Q -- Are you being facetious in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642902#p8642902\">218</a>? What was your read on Grey and me after making <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642967#p8642967\">230</a>? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643218#p8643218\">266</a> is a good readslist imo. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643290#p8643290\">292</a> reads really town to me -- scum care, town don't. Starting to see what Naomi said for her introduction (and that's a good thing). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646355#p8646355\">482</a> was a slip regardless of alignment, but that doesn't necessary mean Naomi is scum. Town \"slip\" all the time cuz they're less cautious. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646893#p8646893\">549</a> gives an associative tell if either flips scum. Why did you feel the need to requite me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647736#p8647736\">660</a>? (Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, I just wanna know why). Yeah, I kinda glazed through a lot of posts cuz they were hard to read, but I think the assessment during her intro is very accurate, so she's probs town.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Null</span> (0% - 30% Confidence; No/Very Weak Read)<br>7. Rainbowdash (+20%) - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643663#p8643663\">324</a> is null (but I somewhat disagree w/ the perspective). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643961#p8643961\">357</a> makes logical sense. Setup spec in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649459#p8649459\">736</a> (null). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649540#p8649540\">739</a> feels off, but I think I'm biased.

Really hard to get a read here.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #FFAA00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Neutral</span> (31%-59% Confidence; Mixed Read)<br>8. TwoFace (+42%) - Last one, this time, we're starting after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643254#p8643254\">280</a>. To be honest, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646044#p8646044\">455</a> reads as confirmation bias. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646152#p8646152\">471</a> is a weird and clearly scum-motivated remark. Townies don't ignore their scumreads; they work with them. Scum ignore their \"scumreads\" so as to discredit them and plead innocent when a mislynch occurs. Also, TwoFace never explained why he couldn't trust Human. (Conflicting Views does not mean either of your views are wrong). The follow up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646701#p8646701\">517</a> reads anti-town behavior versus scum motivation though. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646999#p8646999\">558</a> as town trying to come to a common understanding w/ his target. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647418#p8647418\">614</a> reads as genuine frustration. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647438#p8647438\">619</a> is a scummy misrep as reads can change. Grey made it pretty clear (despite not explicitly) that he had reevaluated. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647568#p8647568\">638</a> reads as arrogant town who <span style=\"font-style: italic\">thinks</span> they've caught scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647809#p8647809\">670</a> reads as fake considering the answer is in the quote. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8653093#p8653093\">1003</a> is tbh a sign towards town. Looking through, reads mostly as confirmation biased town, but it's hard to tell at first glance cuz there's a lot of other scummy stuff that TwoFace has done in addition.<br>9. Krylea (+40%) - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647833#p8647833\">679</a> is a good first impression. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8648232#p8648232\">699</a> is meh -- think he should've read but not really a thing I see scum doing versus lazyish town. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649922#p8649922\">794</a> reads as a genuine response to Grey's Q. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652312#p8652312\">971</a> is blatant misrep, though I feel this is misguided/biased town versus scum. Eh, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652729#p8652729\">993</a> was unexpected and felt like it came from scum. Peer pressure? Yeah, I'm realky mixed here, good intro but feels like Kry is sheeping more than anything tbh. Easily manipulated seems the best way to put it.<br>10. TheRealGin-N-Tonic (-45%) - So, picking up after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642240#p8642240\">196</a>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643765#p8643765\">333</a> would be fine except I don't see how Gin can be null on Alisae at the time he posted that. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8644007#p8644007\">362</a> also reads strange to me. (Mainly the 3rd paragraph's accusatory tone). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646478#p8646478\">485</a> reads as naivety and inexperienced player tell. My response to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646805#p8646805\">538</a> is that daytalk is pretty common and only doesn't exist in the newbie queue due to the greater skill gap in every game and balance reasons. Pretty sure <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649936#p8649936\">796</a> was a L-1 vote. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8649954#p8649954\">802</a> seems like a pointless question to ask. It also reads as shade-throwing and fluff. In response to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652453#p8652453\">978</a>: And? Fence-sitting just like sheeping is not a scumtell. Don't try to use it as such. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652483#p8652483\">982</a> -- Logical fallancies abound! Seriously, there are more than 2 possibilities here. Not everything is black and white. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8653148#p8653148\">1007</a> is a VERY suspicious 180 you did. There's 3x as many posts to consider this time. This slot does not read town, but it doesn't read as scummy as some of othe other slots.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #CC7000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Leaning Scum</span> (60%-75% Confidence)<br>11. Flubbernugget (-65%) - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646631#p8646631\">503</a> makes me roll my eyes. What do you mean \"starting to look more like scum hunting than it did before\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646650#p8646650\">507</a>? Did you scumread the interaction earlier? (I'm assuming you're NOT referring to the earlier semantics thing). What's your point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8648498#p8648498\">705</a>? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8648577#p8648577\">706</a> is a horrible demand and prob. a logical fallancy.<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8648609#p8648609\">711</a> is also a fluff post. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8648629#p8648629\">713</a> feels too accusatory. It also feels that Flubber looked at the post for like 500 milliseconds then decided to jump on it. Too much fluff imo and not enough analysis. Some things are stated matter-of-fact but they seem to be just that -- info. Not feeling good about this slot.<br>12. Asphodel (-70%) - Continuing after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642339#p8642339\">203</a> where I left off last time. The  \"test\" from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642317#p8642317\">201</a> and the subsequent analysis in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642516#p8642516\">208</a> feels... not right. I think Asphodel was too set on trying to prove me as having a fake read (a bit stretched read? definitely! fake? not really) but in the end, the end resukt wasn't what Asphodel expected. What I don't know is Asphodel'send read on me after this -- feels like it could've gone both ways and is ambiguous. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643269#p8643269\">286</a> reads super faked and on purposely done to get towncred. Some of the later posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8650664#p8650664\">847</a> look a good deal better. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8650698#p8650698\">850</a> is pretty suspicious looking like he just cant bring himself to make a case on someone he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">knows</span> is town (cuz he's scum).<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #DD3000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Likely Scum</span> (76%-100% Confidence)<br>13. Gamma (-80%) - Resuming after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641326#p8641326\">93</a> with this. Gonna evaluate the truthfulness of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8643820#p8643820\">339</a>, cuz a lot of posts are null / about his (future) claim. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8645463#p8645463\">413</a> is a non-sensical Q --&gt; blank quotes generally express agreement. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8645619#p8645619\">431</a> is a bit too far. Not sure where <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8645694#p8645694\">443</a> came -- a bit defensive much? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646759#p8646759\">525</a> is pure WIFOM. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646792#p8646792\">533</a> is also overly defensive when it's been like 100+ posts since Sequencer asked you stuff and you never responded. (More than enough time). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8646866#p8646866\">548</a> feels fake as well -- elaborate. In response to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647280#p8647280\">589</a> -- you never stated how it felt more honest. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647337#p8647337\">598</a> is clear shade-throwing without just cause. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647435#p8647435\">617</a> is more a demand rather than cooperative request.<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647493#p8647493\">629</a> feels hypocritical -- if that's your philosophy, explain your Grey and TwoFace reads in-depth. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647695#p8647695\">652</a> is some kind of logical fallancy and totally uncooperative.

It why I specifically asked about the type of result that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be getting guilty/not guilty instead of mafia as he suggested.<br><br>Now your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br><br>1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br><br>2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br><br>3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br><br>Not as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br><br>Anyways tl;dr<br><br>My role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br><br>Really I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br><br>Lets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.  That was somepony trying to act like a cop."}

What was your read on Grey and me after making 230? 266 is a good readslist imo. 292 reads really town to me -- scum care, town don't. Starting to see what Naomi said for her introduction (and that's a good thing). 482 was a slip regardless of alignment, but that doesn't necessary mean Naomi is scum. Town \"slip\" all the time cuz they're less cautious. 549 gives an associative tell if either flips scum. Why did you feel the need to requite me in 660?

I still think there green right now. There reactions and actions just look like someone who is aggressively looking for any red slip.

It can be a red trait but I think given grays analysis and thoughts they are probably green.<br><br>In 230 my perception was you might be bad green. Lately I been unsure of that though.

She puts forward an amazing case here and entirely flipped my thoughts on gray. Like Her first section where they talk about how he assumed no RB is a thing. Like he had a go at me for assuming no day talk when its not declared. If that was his attitude towards roles. why would be also make an assumption and RB is a much more common role in my experience. <br><br>As I read the second part of RB's post all I was thinking was Why would they claim cop Day 1?

I don't see a town motive for voting someone, and then immediately following it up with a punch-pull like that. When townies vote, regardless of whether it's for lynching, pressure, information, or even just spite, they usually want that vote to have the maximum possible effect. The immediate punch-pull comes off like Asphodel isn't motivated by any of those things. Scums are mush more happy to avoid getting into a fight, and I think that's exactly why Asphodel worded his Flubber vote this way.<br><br>I'll gladly lynch either Alisae or Asphodel today, they both read very scummy to me.</div></blockquote><br>I wasn't suddenly remembering that I had a vote on Ircher--I was planning on shifting my vote to Naomi anyways.

Rolefishing is a pretty common thing that scum get rung up for.  He's also forcing himself and maybe potential scum partners to stake a claim on whether or not they're ascetic, which is risky because if he's scum he probably doesn't know what town roles are out there.  Like what if the only ascetics are scum?  <br><br>The town motive for voting someone and immediately reducing its effect is to be honest.  Last night I put a lot of work into the Naomi case, only to have it unravel.  Flubbernugget was a residual suspicion I'd had from earlier stuff, and I didn't see anything recent that was particularly suspicious.  It was a case that I'd already laid out earlier.  Leaving my vote on Ircher wasn't doing much good, and my suspicion on him had (at the time) been fading.

Its far more of a risk, but by claiming miller you basically say to the scum \"by the way there is a cop in this game\".  Even if you want to say both players survive two cycles, you are at about 80% chance not to be investigated.

It why I specifically asked about the type of result that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be getting guilty/not guilty instead of mafia as he suggested.<br><br>Now your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br><br>1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br><br>2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br><br>3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br><br>Not as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br><br>Anyways tl;dr<br><br>My role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br><br>Really I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br><br>Lets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.  That was somepony trying to act like a cop.</div></blockquote><br>His cop claim apparently contradicts some of the language in your role PM, and he was your top suspicion before he claimed cop.  And you're still viewing him as more likely VT than scum?  I don't like this.  I don't like this at all.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8653570#p8653570\" class=\"postlink\">post 1105</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>krylea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8653528#p8653528\" class=\"postlink\">post 1086</a>, Human Sequencer wrote:</cite>Grey didn't switch anything up.

He's saying that with ascetics and if he's only an x-shot cop, he'd expect that there might be a second weakened investigative role.  Rainbow Dash asking about if Grey had any limitations made Grey think that she may be the other investigative role (and thus his counterpart).  Miller + Ascetics + Shot limitations is three different ways the cop's crippled.  A second investigative role implies better balance.

Look at what he's actually doing though.  <br><br>Here is a timeline of All Alone's opinions:  TwoFace is scummy.  GammaEmerald is scummy.  Asphodel is scummy.  Alisae is scummy.  RainbowDash is scummy.  The closest he gets to reading anyone town is saying \"I honestly don't get a sense of disingenuity from Ircher's ISO\".  That's not even really a townread.  It's clear from the way he pursues both me and Alisae that he's only trying to get people lynched, not sort them.  <br><br>Look back on his posts, everything he says about me and Alisae is negative, and a lot of it is ticky-tacky stuff.<br><br>Going back to his original accusation of me in 182.  This is the meat of the accusation.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I really don't like this progression from Asphodel here. Asphodel accuses Ircher of faking a town read on Gamma, Ircher provides evidence that he was indeed townreading Gamma, and then Asphodel backs into a weird stance of \"oh well in that case you shouldn't have been townreading him\" that doesn't really follow from his original position. It reads like Asphodel is trying to force a scumread more than he's trying to gamesolve.</div></blockquote><br><br>Then he adds on:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8642236#p8642236\" class=\"postlink\">post 195</a>, All Alone wrote:</cite>In particular, this quote from Asphodel's 177 bothers me:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Asphodel wrote:</cite>a scumread you thought was legitimate, or not totally baseless, or whatever.</div></blockquote><br><br>If town-Asphodel is genuinely scumreading Ircher, I don't think he would write off Ircher's position as \"or whatever\" like that.

He spends more words complaining about my use of the phrase \"or whatever\" than he does making the real accusation.  In a later posts, he adds in the following three weak addenda to his suspicion of me:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8651657#p8651657\" class=\"postlink\">post 875</a>, All Alone wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8650698#p8650698\" class=\"postlink\">post 850</a>, Asphodel wrote:</cite>So I've still got a vote on Ircher.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't like this. In my experience scum are more likely to just \"suddenly remember\" who they're voting than town.

Ircher's post here isn't really risky, it's just standard play when town wants a claim. I really can't see a townie who was genuinely skeptical of Ircher dropping that skepticism because of this post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8650698#p8650698\" class=\"postlink\">post 850</a>, Asphodel wrote:</cite>So I'll vote <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Flubbernugget</span> who I've actually liked more the more I've seen from him, but whose original vote on the me wagon along with his strange intro make me suspicious.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't like this either. I don't see a town motive for voting someone, and then immediately following it up with a punch-pull like that. When townies vote, regardless of whether it's for lynching, pressure, information, or even just spite, they usually want that vote to have the maximum possible effect. The immediate punch-pull comes off like Asphodel isn't motivated by any of those things. Scums are mush more happy to avoid getting into a fight, and I think that's exactly why Asphodel worded his Flubber vote this way.</div></blockquote><br>Which boil down to:<br>1.  Asphodel's acting like he forgot who he was voting for<br>2.  Asphodel is softening on Ircher for a quote I don't think warrants it.<br>3.  After admitting he doesn't like his first two suspicions as much as he used to and promising he'd have a better one tomorrow, Asphodel went to a 3rd suspicion that he also isn't high on.<br><br>All Alone does the same thing with Alisae.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8645545#p8645545\" class=\"postlink\">post 422</a>, All Alone wrote:</cite>I can definitely support an Alisae lynch today.

It why I specifically asked about the type of result that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be getting guilty/not guilty instead of mafia as he suggested.<br><br>Now your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br><br>1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br><br>2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br><br>3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br><br>Not as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br><br>Anyways tl;dr<br><br>My role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br><br>Really I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br><br>Lets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.  That was somepony trying to act like a cop.</div></blockquote><br>Theres no way you are miller with an Ascetic Enabler around.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Rainbow</span>"}

I don't see a town motive for voting someone, and then immediately following it up with a punch-pull like that. When townies vote, regardless of whether it's for lynching, pressure, information, or even just spite, they usually want that vote to have the maximum possible effect. The immediate punch-pull comes off like Asphodel isn't motivated by any of those things. Scums are mush more happy to avoid getting into a fight, and I think that's exactly why Asphodel worded his Flubber vote this way.<br><br>I'll gladly lynch either Alisae or Asphodel today, they both read very scummy to me.</div></blockquote><br>I wasn't suddenly remembering that I had a vote on Ircher--I was planning on shifting my vote to Naomi anyways.  When that suspicion unraveled, I had the option to change my vote or to not change my vote.  My vote on Ircher wasn't doing much anymore so I decided to change it.<br><br>I think asking for ascetic claims is a bold move if Ircher's scum.  Rolefishing is a pretty common thing that scum get rung up for.  He's also forcing himself and maybe potential scum partners to stake a claim on whether or not they're ascetic, which is risky because if he's scum he probably doesn't know what town roles are out there.  Like what if the only ascetics are scum?  <br><br>The town motive for voting someone and immediately reducing its effect is to be honest.  Last night I put a lot of work into the Naomi case, only to have it unravel.  Flubbernugget was a residual suspicion I'd had from earlier stuff, and I didn't see anything recent that was particularly suspicious.  It was a case that I'd already laid out earlier.  Leaving my vote on Ircher wasn't doing much good, and my suspicion on him had (at the time) been fading.  So I thought maybe shifting my vote could get me some more posts from Flubbernugget, who's  been fairly quiet this game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8652064#p8652064\" class=\"postlink\">post 913</a>, Ircher wrote:</cite>Why?<br><br>We need to agree on a lynch (besides certain people ofc), and do it without letting them claim.

It why I specifically asked about the <span class=\"noboldsig\">type of result</span> that he would get since my role is a bit vague regarding it, but heavily implies that he would be <span class=\"noboldsig\">getting guilty/not guilty</span> instead of mafia as he suggested.<br><br>Now your immediate thought may be as to why I question a cop when my role implies it and there are a few things that I have been thinking as to why I am pretty sure he is lying about this that don't have to do with result wording.  In a bit of a spoiler alert, I think there is a better chance that he is fakeclaiming town than a cop.<br><br>1) His immediate thought of \"we lynch any guilty or 'no result' D2\".  This is first implies he would be alive which if he is a cop... why does he think this really, especially when he has continually pushed for a fact that there is \"no RB\" in the game.  The assumption that there is no RB is a little interesting, as a RB is a usually a scum counter for a role.  The presence of Gamma doesn't increase or decrease the chance for there to be a RB unless the ascetic is scum in which case it dramatically.  Either way, what is the worst case for him as scum?  Call a guilty on a player like me or another somewhat hard lynch and end up not pulling it off?  Best case he got out of D1 lynch, easy D2 lynch and scum is way up.<br><br>2) The game he kept referring to he claimed cop in and completely left that out of his reason for crumbing.  Its why I have this really bad gut feeling that he might be VT and is completely screwing with us and I am either a red herring role or there is a real cop who was smart and kept their mouth shut.  If he is going to refer to a game he claimed cop in (even as not cop) how do you NOT link that into your claim?  I had no idea what Gamma was going on about early, but figured it had to be something role related since I couldn't see any play reason to make that link.<br><br>3) Ascetic.  As I already stated, that is a way to weaken a role far more often than not.  What else is Gamma effecting?  I don't think he can be a red herring since that would be a massive curveball by the mod.  Throw in a very rare role (enabler) and then give it an ever more rare modifier (ascetic) and then make it useless?  Doubt it.  He has to be playing some part in this game, and scum having that modifier makes little sense as it doesn't really benefit them in any way, even if an ideal situation occurs (like cop targets ascetic) as its not a clear, just a \"there might be a RB\" and if Gamma claimed would likely get them lynched.  So its probably a town modifier, and it pretty much would only work on something like a cop.  Its why I kept trying to push just incase he was lying and was a more believable one shot or something.<br><br>Not as much on a direct correlation, but a PR claim D1 is a bit more likely from scum than from town.  Town wont (shouldn't) fake claim as VT.  Scum who are going to be lynched without a PR claim will claim a PR at a higher frequency than exist in the game.  Its not big, but it more works counter to this.  A VT claim is disproportionally likely to come from town D1 when it the first player ran up.<br><br>Anyways tl;dr<br><br>My role wording, him setting up ideal scum resolutions and assuming he will be around D2 to execute it, ignoring what seems like what would be an obvious cop breadcrumb from somepony who was planning it, ascetic not really balancing with a full cop.... I think he is scum.<br><br>Really I think there is a better chance he is a VT who saw this work once and now tries to do anti-town play than he is a real cop.  Either way I needed to claim here because I basically wreck a scum claim, become basic conf-town due to it and am a role that isn't even a threat to scum.  That's a win-win in my book since they have to take me out or hunt other roles.<br><br>Lets lynch him now please and thank you.  That was not cop play.  That was somepony trying to act like a cop.</div></blockquote><br>I think Raibow is being genuine.<br><br>She doubted your claim from the start and while scum have more incentive to do so, I can still see town doing that. She asks about the results which is critical imo because  she seems to have a flawed understanding of the wording. If I were to take a guess, if Rainbow was a true miller, it is probably worded \"You investigate as guilty to an investigative\" which is the proper wording imo. On the other hand, the Cop pm makes sense as \"Mafia/Not Mafia\" because the results aren't a universal cop whereas miller tends to be a universal guilty for role investigatives. Is it a bad push? I definitely think so. But I feel that this isn't a fake push just to make you look bad, just a different vantage point and beliefs.<br><br>Pedit: Krylea reads as less genuine than Rainbowdash btw. He just doubtcasts your claim without even giving an inch of reasoning why."}

Seems to me like he\u2019s already read Grey town beforehand and is kind of forcing that into his readlist.  This is a town move, not a scum one.  I also think that he put in a shitload of effort into that readslist and should get credit for that.  Some people will jump on his urging for me to be hammered without a claim.  That's a bad move on his part and so clearly antitown that I consider it NAI.  He's not lower because of earlier reasons I voted him (overly defensive of Gamma) and also because of his interaction w/ Naomi and Alisae (calling Naomi a white knight and saying she's acting differently from a different white knight he found).<br><br>***************************************************************************************************<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Naomi-Tan</span></span></span>:  I feel like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8647224#p8647224\" class=\"postlink\">this type of setup spec</a> is something scum would censor themselves about but town might have a looser filter with.

I think scum would be more likely to take the popular position if they're late to the party on this, and I think siding with RD is slightly less popular.  I also think that this sort of quick retraction she does comes more from town than scum.  Would like to see her take a little more initiative in accusing other players of being red, it seems like she's playing a lot more on the defensive.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Human Sequencer</span></span></span>:  His early reaction test on me made me think he was genuinely scumhunting even if I think the results were pretty flimsy.  I like his recent posts about Krylea.  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8653451#p8653451\" class=\"postlink\">1063</a> and his subsequent pushing for ascetics to claim if they exist seem town-oriented to me.  I disagree with his position on RD/Grey not working itself out, but I think it's the type of thing that comes from town rather than scum.  Biggest thing I'm worried about with HS is his relationship with Ircher.  He pretty consistently talks about how we need to wait on judging Ircher at the start of the game, which is the type of thing I might expect from scum worried his partner's getting jumped too early.  I'm curious about what between like 150 and 450 made HS change his mind on Ircher.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Alisae</span></span></span>:  I townread her earlier with this comment:  \"Her paranoia about lynchbait seems like it's coming from a less-experienced townie who found a new scumhunting heuristic and wants to try it out as much as possible. Her initial suspicion on Gin is actually pretty reasonable, and her subsequent vote on AA makes me think her panic was legit. I also think new scum would be far more hesitant to claim non-ascetic than she was.\"  Since then, her vote on RainbowDash seems like a pretty natural progression from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8652125#p8652125\" class=\"postlink\">931</a>.

Grey actions look green and no one puts in as much effort as red as rainbow put into this. I think this is just role BS fuckery. However, Given how much RD put out and the consistancy of grey. I personally think we should keep them both around. If RD is putting in this effort all the time they'll burn out or slip up eventually. Likewise If Grey is faking a cop claim we should know fairly shortly by night actions.<br><br>I feel that the thoughtful way both RD and grey examined the game would be more fruitful for us still being in the game. I feel that If RD is read there miss lynches will eventually catchup to them, meanwhile they'll be forced to give indepth insight into how the Reds view us or for today how she does. <br><br>Like wise if Grey is red due to his claim he'll be forced to Reveal some other green players to us and though that becomes WIFOM We can assume if he lives long enough he'll be a red. As why leave the cop up for so long and risk being copped. <br><br>Least thats my sugar high thoughts on everything. I think its TvT while I'm literally vomiting rainbows."}

Knowing now that Dash is scum, let's look at who fell where and when in the Dash vs Grey wagons:<br>The Grey wagon went on and off a few times. The wagon that got him to claim was motivated a lot by the whole Naomi-scumslip business, and was led by me, Alisae, Gamma and Dash. Alisae and Gamma go after Grey because they don't like his focus on Naomi and think the scumslip thing is cover for scum!Grey to have a justified vote. Dash and I agree and join the wagon. Ircher and Gin pile on. Grey claims. <br>Some other shit happens that I'll get to later, then RD claims and pushes Grey. I believe RD's claim over Grey's and I vote Grey. HS does the opposite, as does Alisae. AA joins the RD wagon a little later, then Gamma after him, and Ircher after that. Gin waffles, claims it is TvT, tries to push me, then eventually hammers.<br><br>In the end, Flubber, TwoFace, Aspho, and Naomi are the only ones not on either Grey or RD at the end of the day.<br><br>My conclusions:<br>I obviously fucked up defending RD and my play looked suspicious as hell. No shit.<br>Gin commented very little after RD claimed until his post where he declared he thought it was TvT. I can certainly see town!Gin legimitimately thinking it was TvT. I can also see scum!Gin trying to get people off of the Grey/RD fight once scum knew Grey was a cop, to not get RD lynched. As Grey pointed out though, Gin is the obvious mislynch today if he is town. The fact that so few people joined Grey's wagon on him when he is such an attractive mislynch target makes me lean scum on him. But, as Grey said earlier, it could just be paranoia from scum and not wanting to stick their neck out. I find it interesting that Grey doesn't consider the scum!Gin angle to that though.<br>Upon rereading, I'm a lot more suspicious of AA. He joined the RD wagon after it was clear it was beating the Grey wagon, but never really pushed it after that. He was also lurking hard all day, and pushed the Asphodel wagon a lot.<br>If AA is town, then I am suspicious of Aspho. He didn't join either Grey or RD's wagon and tried to pursue AA instead. There were also good cases laid out against him day 1 which were at least somewhat compelling. I doubt both AA and Aspho are scum though.<br><br>HS is clear unless they were bussing RD damn hard. I suppose that's possible, but I don't see it as likely.<br>Gamma is still obvtown.<br>I still have no fucking clue on TF.<br><br>There was also the Ircher and Asphodel wagons to consider. The Ircher one was led by me, TF and Gin. TF was tunneling pretty hard on Ircher, but in his defense Ircher seemed scummy as fuck to me too. <br>Aspho's was interesting. HS, Alisae and AA were the first ones on it, and I liked how the wagon started. Eventually, Flubber joined with a super-opportunistic <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8642963#p8642963\" class=\"postlink\">229</a>, where he was the 4th person on the wagon after a very poorly justified vote where he was previously lurking. I find this an interesting comparison to his behaviour today, where he also jumped on my wagon in a relatively similar fashion. <br>I think I was the only other person to join it after that, but I could be mistaken on that one. Maybe Ircher did too at some point? Either way, it never got all that much traction and was drowned out by the cacophony around Grey and RD.<br><br>Naomi is the only one I haven't mentioned much. I'm wondering whether to revisit her 'scumslip' thing given the knowledge that Grey is now almost certainly town and RD has flipped scum, but it's a hard thing to get a read on. The fact that she was also never on the RD wagon is also telling. There isn't exactly anything ironclad though.<br><br>This game is fucking weird. From looking at this, I'd be most inclined to suspect some combination of {Flubber, Gin, AA, Naomi}. Most suspicious of Flubber and Gin within those four. But I get that y'all are going to want to start with me first. Thoughts?"}

That's my own scum read, don't try to misrep saying I saw people scumreading you and I hopped in; no, are conversation directly played part into my current read on you. </span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8662084#p8662084\" class=\"postlink\">post 1541</a>, krylea wrote:</cite>Gin was also on Ircher's wagon, who flipped town.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>If you're going to say it was scummy being on Ircher's wagon because he flipped town, then how about we take a look at some of your own dialogue.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8653409#p8653409\" class=\"postlink\">post 1053</a>, krylea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8653395#p8653395\" class=\"postlink\">post 1051</a>, TheRealGin-N-Tonic wrote:</cite>I almost want to say Ircher supersaturates my scumdar to the point where he does a full circle around the meter and is back to being townie.</div></blockquote><br><br>Err...you were scumreading Ircher hard last time you posted.

Im kinda all lost right now as my usal read stuff didn't work right. Normally Im excellent at picking bad players from the reds. but I called the jailor wrong and I'm normally pretty good at telling who reds are but rainbow was a red when at the end of D1 I was entirely convinced they was green and this was just a TvT situation that I had to settle down.<br><br>Like I was pretty much certain.. no one normally puts in that much effort as those two did and there exchange looked genuine from both sides.. at first I was with RD as I guess I was kinda confirm Bais'ing a little and there oringal post was pretty convincing when I read it. but nope. It was all a ruse. <br><br>I've spent most of the last couple days just questioning myself if any of my reads are right.. Take two face. Normally hes active like myself on my more active times but he has been more background in this game. and he tossed doubt on someone who I think is confirmed town right now. Which Im not sure matches there play style. but then again two face is stubbon and unpredictable and if I went in on that and I was wrong again he would just get me slain and could be like \"woops\" and no one would care.. I feel my position is shakey and that makes me even more nervous to act.. I don't normally get things this wrong and I feel that only the cop clearing me will help. but given the jailor is down I doubt that'll happen too. Im just doing my best to not kill myself by just trying to find something that'll help us.. even if all I can add is questions Im hoping that in someway that'll help us win. Everything is just off this game. I did at least manage to save one person so.. if I can just keep helping people in little ways and just sorta explaining myself and stuff I'm sure between us we'll find the last reds."}

Starting to see what Naomi said for her introduction (and that's a good thing). 482 was a slip regardless of alignment, but that doesn't necessary mean Naomi is scum. Town \"slip\" all the time cuz they're less cautious. 549 gives an associative tell if either flips scum. Why did you feel the need to requite me in 660?

If Rainbow haddn't stepped in I could see myself probing Ircher much more to try and work out their red green balance. but as it stands I feel they are likely green.

But this is not a normal situation for me. Most games I work out rather shortly who my short list of possible reds are and the ones on the bottom of the scale normally are red. This game the reverse has happened its shaken my gameplay. While normally I have the confidence of having people figgured out in this game Im only really sure of a very small handful of players and am trying to filter the others out (that list is Alisae and Human Sequencer for reference) Normally I can tell the more shinning players from the others and work out where the people who are meh are there is a conditional for this though and that non-biestness. I am aware that i'm prone to biest views on occasion and that leads me to make bad reads and given how much pressure I've gotten Its hard to get that clean read that helps me sort things properly. normally my read lists by page 20 have gotten all by 5 people green and that normally pans out. so far my reads have had a Green who was a Red and thats not good and at one stage I even had a cop as red cause I was convinced there Claim was a lie. This is also not good. My non-fear comes from the confidence that my reads are on point and this game.. they haven't been and thats okay. I was happy to let Grey lead the hunt for a while as he was playing better and had more firm views could argue me to a lynch and had the general skill at convincing people that I lack. Course greys gone now and the pressure is back on me.. and when Im pressured I get demotivated and try to fade away to come back when the heat has moved on as under pressure I suck hard and I can't focus on hunting which leads to the vicious cycle that ends with me being miss lynched due to not being able to focus on removing pressure. In fact in one game I entirely snapped under pressure as one guy kept being horrible and spinning stuff at me. <br><br>Moving on<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>TheRealGin-N-Tonic wrote:</cite><br>Voted Grey even after claim.

Also buddying the weakest player has it's risk reward. If she could pull it off (which she did at the time), then she gets towncred from me. If she couldn't she gets lynched. At the time I saw no reason why scum would go out of their way to buddy me when I could have turned into a lynch so that's mostly why I gave her towncredit, but I think Naomi buddied me so that I'd give her towncredit.

It was after the RD flip that I got all dislocated and confused as I took a knock to my listing and had to work out what peoples alignment REALLY was. I take my time to vote normally and being So very wrong made me distrust my own reads. I think there unreliable right now. So.. I'm being much less aggressive. Only really pointing at things and seeing if people agree or disagree. but it doesn't help with so much focus on me.. like its hard to work people out from interactions that don't involve me as they have been pretty much everything since post 600. Its kinda like trying to work around your biest but then I question I am giving too much give? Should I be pushing this? I don't like pushing around things that involve me it just blinds me to the truth and there is only so much I can gain from the early game.. so I'm kinda working with facts as that I can trust.. and using connections that seem present. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8674332#p8674332\" class=\"postlink\">post 1746</a>, Alisae wrote:</cite>I mean that she didn't have any votes by the end of the day.

Grey actions look green and no one puts in as much effort as red as rainbow put into this. I think this is just role BS fuckery. However, Given how much RD put out and the consistancy of grey.

Likewise If Grey is faking a cop claim we should know fairly shortly by night actions.<br><br>I feel that the thoughtful way both RD and grey examined the game would be more fruitful for us still being in the game.

So I don't have that fast paced manic back and forthing that I have had in other games.

I've got a few townreads up my sleeve, though, and far more town influence than AA. The only scum motivation I can think of for choosing Gin as a nightkill over me is that I was potentially on the wrong track before (wanting to lynch Asphodel) which scum could leverage a few mislynches out of, combined with them being townread by me, leading them to feel safe, and/or them intending to incriminate and mislynch me somehow today.

I noticed that gin was killed then went to check gins read. cross refrenced that with RD's read on AA then thought if it was a good thing to do. then upon seeing 3 people was in the group (and knowing there isn't 3 reds) I worked out that the roleclaim couldn't be faked as it is a Green role (upon checking the wiki) from there I went if AA is Green who is Green which gives me the first person recruited as the Red team would have no reason to allow AA to continue to live. As you join the chat the next day and gin died last night that confirms the first person recruited into AA's pool."}

I do live in the UK so my last post was at about 10pm for me. Normally speaking i'm up all night but with christmas coming I switched to a more normal sleep pattern as I like to spend time with my family around this time of year going out and stuff. So when 10 pages pop up after I've gone bed its easy to see How It may look like I'm delaying compared to the games where I am up all night and can contribute like I did at the start of the game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8653238#p8653238\" class=\"postlink\">post 1025</a>, Ircher wrote:</cite>6. Naomi-Tan (+65%) - Guess I'm starting after 27 here. Serious Q -- Are you being facetious in 218? What was your read on Grey and me after making 230? 266 is a good readslist imo. 292 reads really town to me -- scum care, town don't. Starting to see what Naomi said for her introduction (and that's a good thing). 482 was a slip regardless of alignment, but that doesn't necessary mean Naomi is scum. Town \"slip\" all the time cuz they're less cautious. 549 gives an associative tell if either flips scum. Why did you feel the need to requite me in 660? (Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, I just wanna know why). Yeah, I kinda glazed through a lot of posts cuz they were hard to read, but I think the assessment during her intro is very accurate, so she's probs town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Nope in 218 was around the point I put grey into the Green pool hard. I still think there green right now. There reactions and actions just look like someone who is aggressively looking for any red slip. It can be grating at times but I don't equate being aggressive and abrasive to being red aligned. It can be a red trait but I think given grays analysis and thoughts they are probably green.<br><br>In 230 my perception was you might be bad green. Lately I been unsure of that though. Gray was pretty much unchanged.<br><br>I just felt like 660 bared repeating. So It could be seen in both our iso's You drew attention to something no one else was looking at. I think it was good.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Then I read rainbows post. She puts forward an amazing case here and entirely flipped my thoughts on gray. Like Her first section where they talk about how he assumed no RB is a thing. Like he had a go at me for assuming no day talk when its not declared. If that was his attitude towards roles. why would be also make an assumption and RB is a much more common role in my experience. <br><br>As I read the second part of RB's post all I was thinking was Why would they claim cop Day 1? They wasn't under major pressure and it just paints a huge target on themselves. Its very confusing to me. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gray</span> Rainbows post Is masterful Red hunting.

I do see the points people have made but If Gray is red and I was wrong (which I believe right now) I can't see a game where Ircher and Gray are on the same team given interactions at this stand Ircher was tunnelling gray for a while and IIRC gray also at one point voted back. If Rainbow haddn't stepped in I could see myself probing Ircher much more to try and work out their red green balance. but as it stands I feel they are likely green. I may look into this if gray flips green. but as it stands I think Ircher is Green by association.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8662399#p8662399\" class=\"postlink\">post 1561</a>, Naomi-Tan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8647779#p8647779\" class=\"postlink\">post 668</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite>Fine.
