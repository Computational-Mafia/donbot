I just don't like to vote without an actual tangible, quotable reason to put my vote down. I am also partially against starting a game without a full roster of confirms, so I vote nobody, absolutely nobody, not until I've got a couple of pages to read and won't be bullied into any such votes.  <br><br>Plus, I rather like putting myself out there as I am quite the attention whore."}

I'm not \"threatened by them\" I really don't like the fact that it is expected to random vote. Yes, it is our most powerful tool, but doing it randomly does not help, does it? You randomly voted for McGriddle, what did you learn from that vote? Nothing. My non-vote has started an actual conversation, I now have responses from IS, darkdude and yourself. I would say I have actually contributed to the game where as you just jumped up, pointed at me and voted for me for saying a prefer to carefully look at the evidence rather then put up some sorta random absurdness? That's just absurd, I'm not going throw my vote around for no reason, especially if not everyone has posted. Would you find it anti-town if someone jumped onto a bandwagon without reasoning?<br><br>I like that you at least have a question for me to respond to. I prefer contributions to the game, that have reasoning, not random voting. You must realize that while voting is the town's most powerful tool, is it also a great tool for the mafia to use. Especially with the uninformed and new. Its like a gun is great for protection, but don't shoot everyone who happens to step on your lawn. <br><br>In my mind at this point, we have something tangible to talk about, we have an event that we can discuss, we have reactions to look at and we are not even out of the first page, this is what I prefer over multiple pages of randomness. That just lets the anti-town bide their time and stay in the shadows. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Yes indeed.

You randomly voted for McGriddle, what did you learn from that vote? Nothing. My non-vote has started an actual conversation, I now have responses from IS, darkdude and yourself. I would say I have actually contributed to the game where as you just jumped up, pointed at me and voted for me for saying a prefer to carefully look at the evidence rather then put up some sorta random absurdness? That's just absurd, I'm not going throw my vote around for no reason, especially if not everyone has posted. Would you find it anti-town if someone jumped onto a bandwagon without reasoning?</div></blockquote><br><br>I agree that my McGriddle vote and all the RVS were largely pointless and more of \"checking in\" kind of posts while things get up to speed.  I disagree in that you say my next vote on you was \"random absurdness\" or not a contribution to the game, considering it got discussion rolling and pushed the ball into your court.  I don't know if its seen as more taboo on this site, but in my previous mafia experience, I largely use my vote to draw reactions, from both the vote-ee and the town.  And yeah, it's one of my biggest \"anti-town\" red flags when someone jumps onto a bandwagon with little to no reasoning.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Occult wrote:</cite>I like that you at least have a question for me to respond to. I prefer contributions to the game, that have reasoning, not random voting. You must realize that while voting is the town's most powerful tool, is it also a great tool for the mafia to use. Especially with the uninformed and new. Its like a gun is great for protection, but don't shoot everyone who happens to step on your lawn.</div></blockquote><br><br>See, the vote can only do damage if there's enough people on the bandwagon to push through an ill-advised lynch.  That said, a dangerous buildup on a weak bandwagon early in the game is immediately going to throw up some red flags.  In my experience, mafia tend to lay low and stay fairly conservative on their vote until the last possible moment so that they can remain as indecisive and inconspicuous for as long as possible.<br><br>In later stages, votes must be treated with more care, but in the beginning, I say again, pressure = a good thing to discern people's play style and glean into their alignments.  You're largely logical and I agree with many of your points.  Heck, from this exchange alone, I can say:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>"}

(What happened to the gender markers we used to have?) They first present suspicions based on a pokemon joke - Which I feel doesn't require a scum QT to conspire about making. It moves on from suspicions to accusations - And if they were just bitter that they didn't get the joke the first time, it's just immature to react that way and if not, the only alternative is that they really don't like me, for no reason other than my Pokemon joke. <br><br>Which, well, c'mon - It was pretty good, right? <br><br>But such blind accusations benefit neither scum, nor town - And as such I feel it would be premature to make a judgement on it - I'd prefer to see more of this Riceball character before I say anything of the matter.

Empking posts enough, but I wish his posts had more substance to them.</div></blockquote><br>I agree with the mason claim. I don't buy it at all and clearly you don't either. I find it hard to believe you needed my opinion to come to that conclusion though. And while its all fun and good to start imagining elaborate scum teams, until we start seeing some flips I don't really see the point. To me it looks like you're trying to set yourself up to be able to jump on a wagon down the road and have evidence you can point to and say \"See, I'm not just band wagoning for an easy lynch!\"<br><br>I'm happy with my vote on HezLucky. He's scum."}

Mcgriddle pops in says something vagely resembling an argument (if its more then a sentence long...) and fades away. If hez slips up later there is plenty to go on with his posting, he is def. putting himself out there more then what I would expect of an anti-town, Mcgriddle stays in his corner and tries to look active.

I missed the \"your\" in the sentence. <br>Upon a re-read, though, he isn't arguing that, he is arguing that kanye was on a bandwagon and was referring to him as scum. This worries me a bit, Kanye was not on any bandwagon I know of, so no, it is not HEAVILY NOTED that kanye was on a bandwagon, what do you mean by this? He has voted for you and is the only non-random vote on you, this feels like an OMGUS sorta thing or bussing.<br><br>So please elaborate, hez, to which bandwagon you were referring."}

Elsa clearly clearly has the exact opposite read from me, which is why I am happy to vote her over Kanye.<br><br>(Noted for future games once I get more data is the fact that Kanye is OMGUSing me while Elsa refuses to come anywhere near voting me and votes for someone who I support)</div></blockquote><br><br>Let's get this straight:<br><br>- I think McGriddle is scummy for his #81.<br>- You think McGriddle is town because he reminds you (Hez) of your own play when you are town.<br>- Therefore, you think I am scum because I am playing differently then what YOU play as town.  (Different play-styles, surely not!)<br>- Someone (me) that disagrees with your reads must be scum.<br><br>This is what I'm getting out of it.  Weak case is weak.  Also, I think it's hilarious that you're giving me scum points for not coming after you after you voted for me.  Isn't that basically asking me why I'm not using \"OMGUS\"?"}

I could care less if you have different scum reads from me. My scum reads aren't perfect, and it thus adds diversity to the game.<br><br>Once again, very small sample size, but I've found in my experience that when I'm able to pick out someone (5/5=100% success) who thinks like me, they are protown (haven't accounted for SK yet). On the other hand, when I find someone casually (defining this as being the first nonrandom vote on a small \"wagon\" of that player; don't play semantics, casually isn't the word i want) throw a vote onto that person, they wind up flipping scum. (Once again, small sample size but: 2/2 = 100%).  This is not circumstantial -- only a scum wouldn't be able to understand why that person does not make a good wagon, and I usually don't get these types of reads on heavily active players, so town have bigger fish to fry. You picked the wrong target in McGriddle.<br><br>So basically, in ADDITION to the other reasons I've mentioned earlier, you completely completely rub me as scum. Weak case is weak? Welcome to Day One, scum. In my mind, the case is very strong, and once I grab a dictionary and learn to express myself there will be one less mafia in town -- you."}

His reasoning here for voting Occult (who, by this stage, appears to be the candidate du jour) is at best unclear and at worst inconsistent. In the first paragraph he, rightly, argues that RVS rarely leads to legitimate votes and bandwagons. He then, however, attacks Occult for not voting on the basis that the vote is town's most powerful tool (wrong, it's reasoning; votes are, or should be, just an expression of reasoning). I've had some difficulty working out why this post seems inconsistent, and I think it can be best expressed as follows: a player who thinks that RVS is largely useless (as Elsa appears to) should not get upset by another player refusing to vote in RVS. After all if you think votes are so useful that a player should cast a vote without reasoning (which is what Occult refused to do), then you presumptively also think that RVS is useful.<br>27: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Hez+5</span> contingent on no future explanation of this vote.

Gah.<br>62: Not scummy, but I want to point out that this sort of \"I can see x/y/z scumteam, with this being an example of distancing, and this guy seeming protown so this guy must scum for attacking him\" is a REALLY terrible way to play the game. It simply leads to a form of confirmation bias where, rather than trying to work out who, individually, is scummy, you focus on trying to generate a picture of the game overall which fits with a set of assumptions, which may or may not be true. <br><br>to be continued..."}

I really dislike his passive pushing of a lurker lynch (terrible idea) here. The reason for the points is not that the idea is terrible (I've seen enough people stupidly support lurker lynches to know that it isn't inherently scummy), but the way he pushes it: first, by saying he thinks there are likely scum among the lurkers (why?) and, secondly, because he asks \"How do people feel about a lynch of a lurker\" - trying to get the issue on the agenda, but not actually committing to what can be a very dangerous position.<br>85: I've seen Hez's attitude here before, from Yosarian2 no less. I'm something. FWIW, I think it's a profoundly dangerous way to play. Basically saying \"People who think like me are town\" completely ignores the fact that scum's main daygame objective is to appear as pro-town as possible, and it isn't that hard for scum to do. All it really tells you is that \"that person is thinking like me\" - that might mean that they are town,  but it can also just mean that they are doing a good job faking it.  Though, Yosarian2, to my knowledge, never had the attitude that \"people who disagree with you are scummy\" - and it's pretty obvious why that is a terrible approach: there are many reasonable opinions that people can have in this game, whether or not they accord with your own.<br>94: *wishes I had read the thread before offering to replace in*"}

First (two - playing one other) game in five years and I have completely been approaching this the wrong way. <br><br>Over the last few hours, I picked a random mini and tested my \"thinks like Hez\" theory. I read the entirity of Mini 1117 - Manhattan Special, and nailed all three scum at the beginning of day two, not changing my suspicions even once throughout the rest of the game. Furthermore, I was correct on every single flip in teh game save one [I did not know the scum distribution]. However, I realize, if I were playing in that game, I would a) be nightkilled by the mafia for catching onto them  and b) nobody would listen to a damn word I say after I was dead or.. for that matter... before I was dead. There is simply no way for me to explain my methods - however, I do want everyone to know that I have methods. I am not voting randomly. And the above game merely confirms that I have not lost it one bit in terms of scumhunting.<br><br>However, it did open my eyes - I need to change my playstyle. I'm going to be way more vicious from now on - because I am clearly not capable of formulating my thoughts properly, and because town need to win. If I play in any other way, town would suffer. I also need to stop revealing my reads - McGriddle as town [which I am very confident of given past events] was a mistake on my part. <br><br>(I am now going to re-present the case on Elsa so that we can lynch scum)<br><br>Elsa has basically voted on my only two town reads, Occult and McGriddle. This has been very high yield for me in the past. I don't think she's a poor player [sometimes its tough to distinguish] as she is able to express herself well, so she is clearly not approaching the game from the same perspective that I am. The apologeticness I am talking about is Post #2 in her ISO:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elsa wrote:</cite>I agree that my McGriddle vote and all the RVS were largely pointless and more of \"checking in\" kind of posts while things get up to speed. I disagree in that you say my next vote on you was \"random absurdness\" or not a contribution to the game, considering it got discussion rolling and pushed the ball into your court. I don't know if its seen as more taboo on this site, but in my previous mafia experience, I largely use my vote to draw reactions, from both the vote-ee and the town. And yeah, it's one of my biggest \"anti-town\" red flags when someone jumps onto a bandwagon with little to no reasoning.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>She is trying WAY too hard to explain herself at the random vote stage of the game. Furthermore, it is in this very post where she unvotes Occult. This was in response to the Occult post that I described as \"townie frustration\", kind of how you would respectfully (in a pissed off manner) explain to someone annoying why they are wrong without actually cussing them off. Here is Occult's post that does that:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Occult wrote:</cite>Now, yes while its true that the RVS doesn't just automatically lead to a lynch, its just plain useless. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I'm not \"threatened by them\" I really don't like the fact that it is expected to random vote.  Yes, it is our most powerful tool, but doing it randomly does not help, does it? You randomly voted for McGriddle, what did you learn from that vote? Nothing.  </span>My non-vote has started an actual conversation, I now have responses from IS, darkdude and yourself. <span style=\"font-style: italic\"> I would say I have actually contributed to the game where as you just jumped up, pointed at me and voted for me for saying a prefer to carefully look at the evidence rather then put up some sorta random absurdness? That's just absurd, </span> I'm not going throw my vote around for no reason, especially if not everyone has posted. Would you find it anti-town if someone jumped onto a bandwagon without reasoning?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Your interpretation of tone will vary. I have italicized the parts I believe support my argument. Yes, this is all my meta, but I strongly strongly believe that I am right.<br><br>This is definitely not tunneling. I will <span class=\"noboldsig\"> Confirm Vote: Elsa </span> and encourage everyone to hop along. I'm not going to let her get away.<br><br>(and future posts will be more aggressive - I promise ... convincing people I'm right is where I fail as town)"}

It prevents the town from gathering information. You should know that. FOS: Kanyeknowsbest <br></div></blockquote><br><br>Let me try concisely sum up why I think Hez is scum as heck:<br><ul><li>He is constantly defending McGriddle. Half of his posts so far mention how much he thinks McGriddle is town. There is no reason to be so obsessed with declaring McGriddle town (#62, #85, #89, #130).</li><li>In several of these posts he equivocates despite being convinced McGriddle is town (#62, #85). I am not sure what his deal with McGriddle is, only that it doesn't do anything for town, and there are likely several reason why scum would do it.</li><li>As I have detailed previously, there are several posts where he has exaggerated data or made very clear misinterpretations of the data and refused to admit it. Town has no reason to do this except in cases where they are tunnel visioned and clawing for anything that can make their target look scummy. I do not believe that HezLucky is tunnel visioned at all.</li><li>He is pushing very hard for a Elsa lynch. I have no opinions on the wagon itself, I am just disturbed that he is pushing a wagon so hard and his evidence amounts to \"Guys I'm really good at finding out who's definitely town and who's definitely scum on day one trust me on this one.\" He picked this wagon very early off of his exaggerated data and has stuck to it the entire time, securing his position as number one on the wagon. Remember that Hez finds vote #2 on a wagon to be a huge scumtell. I suspect he would find #3-6 to also fall in the middle range that scum tries to hide in a la theory from the wiki. And naturally scum does not want to be the hammer vote either. I am certain from the things that Hez has said in this thread that he likely finds vote number one to be the safest place on a wagon for scum and where he would try to be.</li><li>And finally there are the internal inconsistencies in the application of your logic. What is a scum tell for one person you find a town tell for another.</li></ul><br><br>On that last note, the bandwagon thing where the first vote is a random vote and will obviously be withdrawn: Do you think that Internet Stranger is scummy for starting a bandwagon on Occult? I notice now that you were very curious about Jeromus' vote on Empking which was also a second vote. Additionally, how about McGriddle, who you feel is town, being second on the darkdude wagon?"}

However, what if players A and B both exhibit Tell<sub>1</sub>? Both of their p(Scum) rises, so obviously you would get a different average p(Scum|Event). Or do you treat them as separate events i.e. Tell<sub>1</sub> and Tell<sub>2</sub>? But that doesn't seem right; the probability of A being scum would be lower when B exhibits the same tell if you calculate it that way, and I can't think of an intuitive explanation for that.<br><br>At this point I'm no longer able to see this intuitively, and have not worked out the mathematical proofs necessary, so don't think I can speak much more on this subject at this time. We should start a thread in Mafia Discussion or even on a math forum to enlist some help."}

So if you were scum, wouldn't you ignore a damning question if you weren't going to get called out on dodging it?<br><br>Internet Scum is denying the town more than his own lynch candidate, Riceballs. He is also lurking just as much. He also called for a lurker lynch earlier. By his own reasoning, we should lynch him."}

The issue is that youre spouting craptastic reason for doing so. Again, youre trying to mask the real issue here. Thats three times you have attempted it so far.

Any kind words you want to try to throw her way to get her off your ass?</div></blockquote><br><br>But honestly it comes down to the fact that a NL is not helpful for town and I need to vote for A or B it seems, IS might have some scumtells, but he is far from being a D1 lynchplus his wagon grew absurdly fast.

I stand by that one much stronger then anything RBT has done.<br><br>@volk, plenty went down in the last couple of pages I find it hard to believe that nothing warranted any sort of \"points\" from you, I guess I'm saying that I hate your system."}

This is both as a means of minimising emotional influences (so I don't give a player who I have a stronger gut feeling about a slightly higher score) and keeping consistency.  <br>I should also say in advance that a few months ago (and I announced this in the game I started it), I doubled all my scores (as in, I used to mainly give out 1s,2s and 3s). I just say this in case you or anybody else runs off to check my meta on point scoring and then comes back with \"Why did this only get 1 point in x game from six months ago?\"<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">As for McG:</span><br>McG got 3 points for a tell that I call \"boilerplating\". The reason this tell only gets 3 is that, in the past (specifically in the game Popularity Mafia, if I recall correctly), I have seen it fail. <br><br>(To elaborate on the tell: there are certain scumtells (or alleged scumtells) that have recognised names (\"wagoning\", \"opportunism\", \"WIFOM\", \"OMGUS\", etc. are common examples). Some of those things are often scummy (eg. \"opportunism\") whereas others are, in my opinion, not (eg. OMGUS), but that's beside the point. The key point is that, because the tell has a recognised label, using that label effectively serves as an emotional tag to strengthen the argument.  It's much easier and sounds much more serious to accuse somebody of \"wagoning\" than it is to argue that they've cast a vote on an existing wagon for questionable reasons (mostly, I suspect, because \"wagoning\" imputes a scummy intention to wagon, whereas simply analysing the vote  directly might be more ambiguous) The trouble is, as I have learned, town do sometimes also do this, even though in theory the incorrect use of a boilerplate is reflective of a scum mentality.)<br><br>The +7 for McG was for two things (I quote the post below): first, his misrepresentation of his past play in respect of IS;  and, second, a further instance of him both admitting his scumminess whilst demonising somebody for attacking him. (If you want to really be pedantic, if I had scored the tells separately I would have given the first one 5 and the second 3 (because the second was a repeat of an earlier tell, rather than a new tell in its own right) - but my process of reasoning was more basically \"Well, the first of these is a moderate tell, and the second is not so much, so they roughly equate to a serious tell so I will give him 7\").<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Occult wrote:</cite>Example Hez gets 5 points for not explaining his vote.

To quote from one of the few parts of the wiki on scumtells that I endorse:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wiki wrote:</cite> The working definition of a scumtell is an action that is more likely to be taken by a scum player than a town player. This relies on motivations, as most things in mafia do. When a player takes an action, evaluating it on the basis of \"would this action more likely come from a town player, or a scum player\" should be the way that players determine the scumminess of that action. It is worthwhile to note here that subjectivity plays little to no role in this distinction. POSSIBLE motivations for scum to take a given action are not sufficient to call an action a scum tell. An action is scummy if and only if it can be deemed more likely to come from scum than from town, A perfect example of this occurs in mini 636: Gangland mafia. Kuribo asserts that an action is a scumtell to him, because he can think of A justification for scum to do it, but neglects, as vollkan points out, to show that this reason is likely.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Why is is more likely that DD was pushing the alternative wagon to save RBT than simply that he was earnestly pushing the alternative wagon? Heck, I was pushing Elsa yesterday - on what basis do you assert (as you are implicitly doing) that my push on Elsa was NOT trying to save RBT?<br><br>- I think the mason claim thing was an obvious joke. It's a bad thing to do, because it leads to all sorts of confusion, but it's not scummy so much as just an illustration of why jokey play is often a bad idea.<br><br>- \"and everything else\" What, specifically? I see McG's \"easy lynch\" point, but I've already said that I think that argument is scummy from McG, so I'm not sure what other points you are raising."}

Scum are on this wagon lynching someone (IS) they think is either werewolf or town. Werewolf is on this wagon trying to lynch someone they think is either scum or town.

I just see him playing it very safe, carefully watching what he is saying not trying to dig out scum. He spent more time adding fuel to his bitch-fight and completely ignored a claim of someone who he supposedly strongly felt was innocent. The fact that he made no attempt to actually stop the wagon when he felt this, does not sit right with me at all.

Go reread the first half of today and look at all the questions there were about darkdude and his play which he has ignored (yeah I know he asked me to repeat them, but he can go look over two pages as easily as I can). Can anyone tell me why McGriddle is a better lynch candidate than darkdude for today when there are all sorts of scummy signs pointing towards darkdude being rbt's partner? The only reasons I've seen for McGriddle's lynch are equally valid towards a darkdude lynch. There is more evidence against darkdude than McGriddle but you guys are pushing for McGriddle ... why???<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Going through the above:<br>- The bit about what you \"believe\" DD was doing is pure conspiracy argument. To quote from one of the few parts of the wiki on scumtells that I endorse:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wiki wrote:</cite> The working definition of a scumtell is an action that is more likely to be taken by a scum player than a town player. This relies on motivations, as most things in mafia do. When a player takes an action, evaluating it on the basis of \"would this action more likely come from a town player, or a scum player\" should be the way that players determine the scumminess of that action. It is worthwhile to note here that subjectivity plays little to no role in this distinction. POSSIBLE motivations for scum to take a given action are not sufficient to call an action a scum tell. An action is scummy if and only if it can be deemed more likely to come from scum than from town, A perfect example of this occurs in mini 636: Gangland mafia. Kuribo asserts that an action is a scumtell to him, because he can think of A justification for scum to do it, but neglects, as vollkan points out, to show that this reason is likely.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Why is is more likely that DD was pushing the alternative wagon to save RBT than simply that he was earnestly pushing the alternative wagon? Heck, I was pushing Elsa yesterday - on what basis do you assert (as you are implicitly doing) that my push on Elsa was NOT trying to save RBT?<br><br>- I think the mason claim thing was an obvious joke. It's a bad thing to do, because it leads to all sorts of confusion, but it's not scummy so much as just an illustration of why jokey play is often a bad idea.<br><br>- \"and everything else\" What, specifically? I see McG's \"easy lynch\" point, but I've already said that I think that argument is scummy from McG, so I'm not sure what other points you are raising.</div></blockquote><br><br>I've checked Rufflig's posts and can't find any answers. <br><br>So, @Rufflig: RESPOND"}

I just see him playing it very safe, carefully watching what he is saying not trying to dig out scum. He spent more time adding fuel to his bitch-fight and completely ignored a claim of someone who he supposedly strongly felt was innocent. The fact that he made no attempt to actually stop the wagon when he felt this, does not sit right with me at all. He was perfectly content to sit back and watch McG get lynched, and throw out one little comment about it so he could go ahead and claim his \"clairvoyance\" of the situation later. <br></div></blockquote><br><br><br>Rufflig has some scummy ticks but my favourite vote for today is by far darkdude, I can get behind a Jero lynch and I do not see IS lynch at this point, tells from him are minor in comparison to others.

So far after the lynch of his buddy RBT he is just gonna, sit back and hide and try to hold out, just my opinion of course, but in my head this is our wolf. He def. needs to start posting and it needs to have content in it.

Basically, IS-scum there also made crappy arguments and dressed them up with rhetoric that made me (town) discredited.<br><br>For those who can't be bothered clicking the link, this is a good example:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite> <br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>Vollkan, youre still using the useless point system to try an incriminate me, arent you? Thats how its relevant. Its like youre some catholic school nun handing out demerits to the kids, trying to pump them up full of guilt and repentance. Everytime you pump in points into your arbitrary system as if youre collecting points in a video game, youre throwing another accusatory barb in my direction.<br><br><br>All youre doing with your system is creating an arbitrary crutch to lean on to excuse your actions. Its not pre-commitment, its the equivalent of the curtain for the Wizard from the Wizard of Oz. You really believe that you can excuse such blatant scummy behavior by using a railed system? How can you use points that you set arbitrarily as a method to auto-determine your actions when you yourself are setting the points? Its crap, plain and simple.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Confining my response to game-relevant stuff, rather than a theory defence of my system: You are again attacking me for an aspect of my play which I do regardless of alignment. Enough said. It's even worse that you are completely smearing the system as some ploy to \"pump them up full of guilt and repentance\" when any reasonable observer, even those who detest my system (of which there are many), would know that it's simply the way that I express my suspicions<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>Youre right, it is a conspiracy argument. I already see through your trappings and if im not the only one not falling for it, then so be it. In the end, I shall have my vindication when you turn up to be scum. You cant sit there like some Ken doll, throw a wink and a smirk and just try to dismiss me and expect that to be the end of it. You expect me to con jure up your own defense for you either. All youre basically saying is that you get to lean on some point tally that you created, so you have free range to do whatever you want.<br><br>I dont need to create some detailed point by point analysis. All youre doing is trying to put the burden on me to do all the work, so you can just say \"No, I didnt\" and demand for more. Did you not see how Ythill was trying the same on me the previous day and I didnt bite? Its quite unfortunate that I was wrong then, but im definitely not wrong now.<br><br>Its quite simple really. You KNEW that Luchris was a townie, so of course you didnt want to change your points crutch around, because that would make you look too obvious. So by keeping your points inflated to MBF, you have an excuse to not be involved in the lynch. Like I said in the first sentence, you cant suddenly use hindsight glasses against me because only scum knew Luchris was innocent. Which is precisely what youre doing now. Of course youre not going to depart from a established meta, you purposely set it up to be that way in the first place. That means that there is no analysis to be made, you cant analyze made up scoring.<br><br>Why should I wait around and let you gather crazy fervor against me first? Youre the one trying to make me look bad and I can clearly see it, even if no one else does. Like I said earlier, you cant just wave your hand around like some jedi mind trick, throw a wink and a smile and assume that what I say doesnt have merit when it clearly does. <br><br>This isnt anything new, I am a constant daytime target. I been called an easy lynch before because Im not afraid to lay it out there for all to see. Im here to catch scum and its plain to see that youre trying to set me up here. I dont need to sit here and wait for you to shoot me. I see the threat against me and this town and its easy to see that you have been part of the scumteam all along.<br><br>My vote stays, im sure on this one.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>tl;dr version:<br><br>My argument is crap, but I've got great rhetorical skills.<br></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DD wrote:</cite>Wait, you're talking about Internet's case on Rufflig?<br><br>I was talking about you giving him +5 in #527.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Oh.<br><br>In that case, the meta above is even more relevant. For reference, those +5 were for:<br><blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite> <br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite> FUCK. THAT. SHIT.<br>No werewolf is going to determine if town wins this game or town. The fucking town will.<br>Can we lynch 3 scum in a row? We most certainly can, better than some fucking werewolf shooting 2 scum at night. Better than some scum picking out the werewolf.<br><br>Whos playing to emotions now? Darkdude.<br>Who is still a possible Werewolf? Darkdude.<br>Who is putting out the best laid plan for Mr Wolf? Darkdude.<br>Who wants to put the townie victory in the hands of the werewolf (win condition bullshit)? Darkdude<br><br>Who is jumping up the ranks of actually being the werewolf? Darkdude.<br></div></blockquote><br>IS+5<br><br>DD's math has proven that lynching wolf is anti-town. So, prima facie, anybody arguing for a wolf lynch (or, at least, for not trying to lynch mafia over wolf), is at best anti-town.<br><br>1) The above quote begins with a fairly blatant contradiction. First three lines, IS pulls his garden-variety emotional rhetoric out, completely ignoring the math (his assumptions 1-4 that preceded this have already been dealt with by DD). But, immediately after this, he accuses DD of playing to emotions - when, if anything DD has done the exact opposite in going against the natural emotional inclination of people to think \"lynching scum = good\". <br>2) This is simply irrelevant and pure ad hom. Dispute DD's math if you must, but the fact that he is a potential werewolf doesn't enter into it.<br>3) Ditto<br>4) Ditto<br>5) Ditto<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Maybe it's clearer now what I mean by \"garden-variety emotional rhetoric\", but basically, my case there is not that he is wrong or illogical about the game setup (though he is). Rather, my problem is that he is ignoring the math and the reasoning and, instead, making an essentially ad hominem/conspiracy case against you. This is scummy in and of itself, but I'm obviously particularly alert to it given what happened in our last game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DD wrote:</cite>And Internet wasn't alone in suspecting Rufflig for the same obvious reasons, so why only give him points?

Here's the full list of why Internet is Scum.<br><br>1. Playing the image game, as he calls it. Avoids my attempt to draw attention on him Day 1 by ignoring questions, and now tries to spin my past unsuccessful wagons into some sort of conspiracy \"always trying to get him lynched no matter what\". Always a bunch of fancy appeals to emotion (including baseless accusations of others AtE) in every single post.<br><br>2. Just admitted that McG looked scummy Day 2 but then blames me for \"letting mislynch go through\".<br><br>3. Near the end of Day 2, starts saying that Jeromus, Rufflig, Kanye and Occult are all making good points. But that's not it, he adds that therefore, someone in there is opportunistic scum. This is an attempt to make his record ambiguous and allow him to pick wagons freely on Day 3.<br><br>4. Mentions me for the first time at beginning of day 3, with only reason that \"faking crazy\" is scummy. Later adds on some crap floating around such as the \"mason claim\". Anyone with half a brain should know that's not any sort of tell.<br><br>5. Lies about always lynching the scummiest person. He unvoted Rufflig when I stopped the wagon (under assumption that he was wolf). At the time I was voting Internet (first time Day 3). If I were to grasp straws like Internet, I would say this is an effort to appease me.<br><br>6. Has been always focusing on wolf lynch. When confronted with proof that mafia is lynch is better than wolf lynch, he doesn't start looking for mafia. He sits with his old scumlist and tries to get Rufflig lynched by trying to discredit the math (through appeals to emotion and no real logic). Whenever he's called out on this he says \"I'm lynching scummiest\" despite that he had made it clear that he thought Rufflig was wolf at the time, as many of his tells assumes the association with Riceballs.<br><br>7. Started off Day 3 with NK speculation, that because the kills were on the Riceballs wagon, that scum must be on the other wagon. This way he looks good and sets up his lynch targets at the same time. But with Rufflig's claim, it is clear that there's not many scum on the Day 1 Internet wagon. Riceballs was scum. Me, Jeromus, McGriddle, and Rufflig are town. Even if you think I'm scum, that's only another one. And since then I would most likely be wolf, Mafia are all on the Riceballs wagon. (I don't think vollkan is mafia now, compared to the other candidates)<br><br>8. First doubts Rufflig's claim. When Rufflig doesn't back down he says he's at a loss as to who Rufflig wants him to vote for. When Rufflig points out that he's not forcing Internet to vote anyone, he defaults to darkdude, his 3rd suspect. He's doubting and trying to appease Rufflig at the same time. Looks like scum at a loss as to what to do with that surprise claim.<br><br>No, Rufflig is not cleared, but highly likely to be town so it's harmless to assume so until otherwise. It's something like 95%. We have better things to do than to guess what WIFOM layer Rufflig is on.<br><br>9. Internet tries to spin anything I do as scummy. I wanted him to state his case because I don't recall any points that should make him want to lynch me. He delays this, okay. But saying that calling for restating a case is a scumtell is ridiculous. Clearly, vollkan didn't see your case either. Am I scum with him? Is that what you think?<br><br>Reading Internet's posts in Flash Mafia, it would seem that his strategy of defense is to use strawmen of cases against him to pretend that there is no case. Guess how many times he's said that in this game? Go to his ISO and look for all the instances where he says \"you have no case on me\" where he should have been addressing the points instead. Saying people's cases against you is a conspiracy to always get you lynched is NOT a town way of defending one self.<br><br>He already said that he doesn't care about town, only about catching scum. This is fine as long as catching scum helps town, as it is 99% of the time. But he's using his alleged zealotry as his own crutch (way worse than vollkan's points, btw). If we had listened to him, we would have lynched the obvious wolf (assume Rufflig is wolf), even though that would be very bad compared to mafia lynch.

It seemed to me that you would be a reasonable lynch because ignoring me was weird. Riceballs was fine too. But I already had some a little thing going against you. THEN: a bunch of scummy people jumped on. McGriddle. Rufflig. Riceballs himself. I thought it was interesting to see where it would go. Especially since McGriddle quoted my encouragement before jumping on. It looked like I was catching something.<br><br>That's why I had no interest in picking up the wagon Day 2. After the Riceballs flip, I thought Internet (and Emp and Charter) had wayyyy better scumhunting skillzzz than I did, able to see Riceballs as clear scum, as opposed to me and a bunch of other people who were nowhere near as sure though we had suspicions. McGriddle looked to be clearly Riceballs' buddy. Of course I would want to lynch him rather than Internet, who I had only the weird behaviour of not paying me any attention.<br><br>My vote back on Internet early Day 3 was similar, though more serious than before. This time I had the additional suspicion because he had been focusing on wolf lynch so badly and making illogical arguments and big appeals to emotion. I was mightily surprised when vollkan started giving points and then jumped on. So then I thought vollkan was scummy.

That remark was regarding Internet's claim that math has no place at all when you assess behaviour.<br><br>I told you exactly why I thought some parts of the analysis mattered. The probability for winning the 2-day LyLo based on random lynch seems to me to be not too far off, because we have no good leads on mafia. You think the lynches are going to be more town-favored. I doubt it. But even if we give you a compromise on that...<br><br>The other thing is that wolf wants to kill mafia for sure. Mafia, I think, may want to kill wolf rather than town as well.<br><br>Those are the things I can think of. If you can think of something else, great. Let us know. Don't just say \"it doesn't accurately reflect\" and not give examples.<br><br>As far as I can see, even in the worse case, that the wolf knows nothing about good play, his random NK will help town. Ya, in THIS SPECIFIC INSTANCE the NK is pro-town. Your dislike of \"control\" is irrational."}

Whether or not it was in the other wolf's best interests to bus depends on a heap of other factors, including i) their perception of the likelihood of any bus succeeding; ii) their perception of the likelihood of their buddy being lynched; iii) their perception of the likely results for people's suspicion of them if they bussed versus not bussing. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>jeromus wrote:</cite>Alright, Volkan - Did you SEE day 1?

Hell, you were even still going at it up to the end there. Is that supposed to be some sort of convoluted trap that im still not getting? That being said, im still perplexed about the night kill. The doctor is gone, Rufflig claims to not be wearing superman's cape, so whats the deal?<br><br>I still fail to see how both Rufflig and Jeromus are still alive. You would assume that at least one would bite the bullet. Obviously one team shot Darkdude (and I cant figure out why!) or maybe both did. So where is the other kill? What im trying to get at here is the possibility that Rufflig and Jeromus are actually the mafia and somehow have a way of stuffing the werewolf kill. Maybe Bulletproof, roleblocker? If that was the case, then Rufflig and Jeromus must have the wolf figured out, otherwise that would be an extremely suicidal gambit. But then again, I figured that their claim yesterday was suicidal onto itself as it is and yet here they still are, why?<br><br>So assuming that Jeromus and Rufflig arent mafia (I can safely rule them out of wolfness at this point), that means that 3 of 4 of Vollkan, Empking, Occult and Kanye are scum. Holy shit, if we fail to lynch scum today we truly suck.<br><br>So whos it going to be?<br>Vollkan could be a wolf. Didnt vote RBT Day 1.<br>If Empking is a wolf, then that means he was going for a softbus on RBT, but got screwed when I jumped on and finished RBT off. I dont see any evidence that says that Empking cant be mafia though.<br>As Occult pointed out, Kanye is playing games with Vollkan.<br><br>I did an ISO on Occult and he seems to hem and haw a lot. He did it on Day 1 and finally put something down when RBT was at L-1 and I was at L-2. He essentially calls me a bully and scum and spins a conspiracy theory over Empking and I (Im coaching Empking apparently), says a few soft words on RBT, calls her a lurker and then votes for her.<br><br>Its risky, but its quite likely after all that this was a bus. The wagon on me was going to start losing momentum. It took Rufflig and Jeromus to glob on to keep it from losing steam (nice pick there, boys), so whos to say what would happen if Occult put the vote on me then suddenly had to backtrack. RBT wasnt going to be much help the rest of the game anyways after I flipped town, she would have likely been a Day 2 target, so why not gain town cred with bus and coast? <br><br>Which is what Occult seems to be doing. Coasting. Further looking at Occult reveals a patter of coasting. His opinions, although lengthy, seem to be carefully orchestrated to remain extremely neutral. He did the same thing on Day 2 with the Griddle lynch. Pretended to think deeply about the subject matter until finally going \"aw shucks\" and plunking the vote on McG. Oh hey, Occult HAMMERED McG too.<br><br>Day 3, a lot more coasting. Im starting to see a pattern here. I think im onto something here and the odds are very good that he could be from either scum faction at this point. So unless Rufflig and Jeromus are going to assrape us with this mason claim gambit, I think its most possible that Occult is a very possible scum. <br><br>Im upset because my best lead is a dead townie and my next two scummiest are claiming masons. Which would explain why they are acting like all symbiotic. Rufflig and Jeromus are either masons or mafia scum. This is almost like starting over at this point. But, out of everyone, Occult seems the most like he is hiding something.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Rufflig<br>Vote: Occult</span>"}

I just need some sort of evidence that youre lying and I wouldnt switch my vote off you. The fact that both you and Jeromus survived the night somehow is suspicious in my opinion. The fact that there is only one kill and not two also adds to that suspicion.<br><br>But despite that, taking your claim at face value, my chances of lynching scum are still decent enough due to Occults behavior. If he is mafia, then youre clear and I will follow your lead to eternity (within reason).

Let me put it this way: you scum hunting does not seem genuine to me. You keep throwing points at IS who, on the other hand, seems quite genuine in his scum hunting. I don't agree with the points you give him, and you claim you are not tunneling. You claim that scum tells persist the entire game, but you have yet to give any retroactive points. There is a mountain of things that could potentially be seen as scummy that you ignore in favor or quoting IS's latest post and giving him 5-10 points. The more time I spend thinking about your play, the more I want to say that you are scum.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>IS's playstyle as scum is to appear genuine and emotional. You only have to look at the past game I referenced to see that. Whatever effort he is appearing to make, the fact of the matter is that the undelrying arguments he is making are absolute rubbish. <br><br>As for the absence of many points elsewhere - I readily admit that it's unusual even for me. However, two points need to be borne in mind:<br>1) There were other players with relatively high scores; except they have died<br><br>2) I've explained every instance of me apparently not finding something scummy. Again, if you think there is something that I am unreasonably not finding scummy, then please point it out; if you are going to accuse me of unjustifiably not finding things scummy, you need to actually demonstrate that I have done just that. Simply complaining about my lack of points doesn't suffice.  <br><br>I also think it's worth noting that I am probably the ONLY player in this game who is vulnerable to this sort of criticism. Everybody is able to say: \"I suspect X\" without anybody batting an eyelid. But when I say \"I suspect IS\" and also indicate, through my points, that I have little suspicion of anybody else, suddenly it's a huge issue. I know it looks like I am getting tunnel-visioned on IS (and, tbh, I can't see myself supporting any other lynch today), but I really can't see what it is that I am apparently ignoring from other people. Nobody else screams scum to me; even though I disagree with your arguments Kanye, I can kind of see where you are coming from so I don't suspect you nearly as much as IS.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rufflig wrote:</cite>Ok, IS.

Continuing to insist that there is no case or valid suspicions against you is ludicrous at this point. Also, I would really appreciate it if you don't bring up your role in the rbt lynch again. That lynch only proves that you aren't likely to be werewolf - it doesn't prove you are townie and it doesn't prove you aren't mafia.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>You're wasting your time with this.

At that point it was either plunk down a vote on me and have a very damn good reason to do so. You would have drawn even more attention to yourself by needing to make a case on me (other than calling me a bully) and make a righteous defense on RBT. How exactly could you have defended RBT at that point? In fact, you sure did a lot of hemming and hawing when it came to RBT, didnt you. It was pretty damn convenient to lay off a vote \"waiting for her to add more content\". <br><br>Sounds to me like a convenient excuse to use as a distancing mechanic. Additionally, it would have looked pretty silly on you to make such a case on RBT then find her flipping wolf later. So certainly, bussing RBT at that point allows you to fly under the radar until now, doesnt it Occult?<br><br>As for your other point, youre right about one thing. You made a huge grand declaration that McG was your evil scum pick on D1, but then went \"aw, shucks\" and bussed RBT. Yet on day 2, with McG being a very likely scum and me going after him with a full case, with notable and concise arguments, you STILL chose to coast, try to remain neutral and stall and try to hang back until the very end before plunking down another \"Oh golly\" hammer on McG. The very same MCG that was supposed to be your #1 suspect. Why the hesitation Occult? Were you just trying to look good? Was that McG talk initially just to make yourself look good? If he was scummy as you claim him to be, then what was holding you up? Perhaps you already knew that was a mislynch and wanted others to make all the fuss all day so you could fly under the radar with the vote? Didnt want to stick your neck out there, did you? You wanted everyone else worked into a fervor so you could say exactly what youre saying now: \"But you said he was scum too!\" <br><br>Now that is a classic scum tactic, Occult. Latch on the coattails of others, let them stick their neck out and then capitalize on the results.<br><br>I still think that Occult has plenty of reason to be either mafia or the werewolf. And with a 3 of 4 of hitting scum, I still say that im making the right choice here. Occult's behavior is leading me to believe that he is indeed scum.

If this was a theme game then perhaps there could be a hidden mechanic as to the chance of a nightkill going through or perhaps one scum on a team can only submit nightkills on odd nights while the other can submit kills on even nights. However, in a normal game, I don't find any of these probabilities particularly likely.<br> B) The doctor and his backup are already dead. I doubt the town has another protective role to prevent nightkills. While the scum could have such an ability, I would think that would make the game too unbalanced towards the scum teams -- very swingy at best anyhow. No, I doubt there are any roles left that could stop a nightkill.<br>C) So, that leaves both scum teams targetting the same player - somewhat unlikely, but more probable than anything else imo.<br><br>If you don't like my scenario for what happened last night, perhaps you would care to share your thoughts as to what happened?

Yet, I have put up like three huge posts full of explanations of why I think Occult is a sneaky scum, but yet you choose to continually hanker on one minor point of my whole argument, the lurker part. What about his voting patterns? What about his proclamations? What about the timing of his posts?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>This is a neat little parable for exactly what I hate about your arguments.<br><br>Let me go through them:<br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite> I did an ISO on Occult and he seems to hem and haw a lot. He did it on Day 1 and finally put something down when RBT was at L-1 and I was at L-2. He essentially calls me a bully and scum and spins a conspiracy theory over Empking and I (Im coaching Empking apparently), says a few soft words on RBT, calls her a lurker and then votes for her.<br><br>Its risky, but its quite likely after all that this was a bus. The wagon on me was going to start losing momentum. It took Rufflig and Jeromus to glob on to keep it from losing steam (nice pick there, boys), so whos to say what would happen if Occult put the vote on me then suddenly had to backtrack. RBT wasnt going to be much help the rest of the game anyways after I flipped town, she would have likely been a Day 2 target, so why not gain town cred with bus and coast? <br><br>Which is what Occult seems to be doing. Coasting. Further looking at Occult reveals a patter of coasting. His opinions, although lengthy, seem to be carefully orchestrated to remain extremely neutral. He did the same thing on Day 2 with the Griddle lynch. Pretended to think deeply about the subject matter until finally going \"aw shucks\" and plunking the vote on McG. Oh hey, Occult HAMMERED McG too.<br><br>Day 3, a lot more coasting. Im starting to see a pattern here. I think im onto something here and the odds are very good that he could be from either scum faction at this point. So unless Rufflig and Jeromus are going to assrape us with this mason claim gambit, I think its most possible that Occult is a very possible scum. <br><br>Im upset because my best lead is a dead townie and my next two scummiest are claiming masons. Which would explain why they are acting like all symbiotic. Rufflig and Jeromus are either masons or mafia scum. This is almost like starting over at this point. But, out of everyone, Occult seems the most like he is hiding something.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Everything in the above is pure conspiracy.<br><br>\"hemming and hawing\" on D1 is completely understandable,  and the fact that he chose RBT as a compromise candidate is not something that I consider a scumtell. it only becomes a scumtell when you read a whole heap of extraneous BS about distancing and so forth into it. Maybe I am being simplistic here, but in the fact of not unreasonable uncertainty about who to pick, he chose RBT.<br><br>The rest of this is just the same thing in respect of coasting and remaining relatively neutral. You claim he has \"carefully crafted\" his opinions to be neutral - but you have absolutely no evidential basis for that.<br><br>Once again, you just take actions, interpret them in a scummy way, then start frothing at the mouth, claiming you are some kind of hero, and acting shocked when anybody suggests that your play is hollow.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>Is there a reason why you cant look at Occult critically, Vollkan? What are you trying to hide? Are you purposely trying to make Occult look good here?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I AM looking at him critically.  The difference is that, unlike you, I don't think he is scummy just because I can conceive of a possible universe in which his actions are scum-motivated. If an action is not demonstrably more likely to be scum-motivated than town-motivated, it isn't a scumtell - no matter how much you puff yourself up about wanting to lynch scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>Is that why youre STILL trying to defame me through meta nonsense? What is it that youre trying to say? Because I passionately made some really good arguments against you in a past game that I happened to be scum in, I must be scum now too? Because last time I criticized that silly system of yours that might as well be neutered, I must be scum in this game too? Did you even bother looking at any other game I was in? If youre going to along with this meta nonsense, then you need to look at more games than the one we were in. I catch scum in Day 1 constantly. I show that passion for a true scumhunt like a hunter does when stalking his prey. I put the pressure on the scum and STILL back it up with solid, valid arguments. Meta arguments on me are useless. All I ever do is go after scum and catch me a hell of a whole lot of said scum. Youre welcome to see just about any game im in for evidence and not just one that makes your little argument convenient for you.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I've never once said anything even approaching the notion that you are scum here because you were scum in our past game. In fact, I've pointed out on several occasions that you would still be my #1 suspect even if I wasn't aware of your meta. <br><br>Keep playing the denialism game, though; it's only making me more confident in my read of you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>You want to talk meta again Vollkan? What do you do? You use \"the system\" as a giant albatross around your neck. It makes a convenient excuse as to why you cant scumhunt \"But X is low on my list\" or its a convenient excuse as to why vote for someone arbitrarily \"uh.. yea, Y has a bunch of points, he must be scum\". Whatever Vollkan, we all know you been inflating points on me while you ignore Occult. The question is as to why?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>And again, complete BS<br><br>I've never used my points that way. What my points let me do is, when someone asks me why I suspect a particular person, I can point to the precise reasons why, without having to deal with stupid arguments like \"Why did you vote X at this point in time and not why?\" It just helps me keep things simple and clear.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jeromus wrote:</cite>Seriously, Empking.

He is clearly employing a Exhausting Defense strategy on me. By constabntly asking me to repeat my points, he is attempting to devalue them. The more times the same case is presented, the less impact it has. Add this with a strategy of asking for more (that's it? Where is the rest of the points? As an example), it will make it appear as if I was grasping for straws. Its all about image and darkdude is trying to play the image game on me.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>As you mentioned about DD, this is really what you are doing to me, except you ignore parts of my argument to get me to repeat them over and over.<br><br>As for the rufflig thing, claim and push the rest of the game to claim as well, make an attempt to get them cleared. If you find them so possibly scummy put some effort in it don't just throw your hands up with a \"well, if they're mafia, we fucked.\" I would like to take steps towards clearing them."}

Im the hero in EVERY GAME. The scum are the villains in EVERY GAME.<br><br>Again, youre completely missing the point, whether its deliberate or not. Your feelings are hurt because of one game I happened to be scum in, so now its your personal vendetta, your grand crusade to get PAYBACK. Its that simple. Youre not looking for some angle through meta, youre not looking to find the scum. Oh no, Vollkan is out for BLOOD.<br><br>So yes Vollkan, I am the god damn hero. I always am. I could rattle off all sorts of games where my actions, where my persistence, where my vision has led the town to victory. This includes all sorts of games where I have caught scum Day 1, including THIS ONE. In the end, do they matter? No. Much the same way the game youre STILL crying about does not matter.<br><br>The only thing that matter is this game. Stop trying to derail the focus Vollkan. I (with the help of Empking) nailed, NAILED! RBT. I am here to catch scum and pad my numbers. I am here catching scum now so that next game, when you or anyone else tries to pull this little gambit on me again, I can point back and point out that mini where I got me all sorts of werewolves and scum.<br><br>So now, the choice is clear. There is no one left from my Day 1 wagon. I expected at minimum the werewolf to be there. Its quite possible that the mafia killed Darkdude because they also thought that he was the werewolf. I dont know where the werewolf kill went. Its quite possible that the mafia are Rufflig and Jeromus. By killing Darkdude, they can leave me flapping in the wind. Maybe it becomes easier to come after me that way. Give me enough rope, see if I hang myself.<br><br>So if that conspiracy is alive and well, then the next most likely wolf is Occult with the bus (As Darkdude himself had offered).<br><br>If Jeromus and Rufflig are masons after all, then the mafia is clearly two of (Vollkan, Kanye, Occult, Empking). So that means that I have a 3 in 4 shot of catching scum. So I might as well go after the most likely werewolf. That is the whole point on Occult, thats one of the reasons he is scum. Its a double shot, its the best chance we got. Vollkan is voting me because of pure revenge, so why follow him? Why listen to anything he says?<br><br>Occult presents the best chance of catching scum. His actions havent exactly been town friendly, no matter how many shots at me he takes.<br><br><br>P-EDIT:<br><br>Jeromus, I point out how good a townie I am simply to counter Vollkan's claim. Dont make it seem so one sided, please. Im trying to make the point be back at how Occult is scum. But thats impossible when my meta, my good name and character is under a vicious assault. How is anyone supposed to catch scum in this meta-heavy environment? It just serves as a canopy for scum to hide under."}

I did previously have Volkan as my idea for the other mafia, but I have read his iso several times to try and construct a case but I can't find anything damning besides his focusing of points onto people he wanted to lynch. I did say that I would rather lynch mafia, but I believe I also made it clear that I would be content to lynch wolf if we could not be extremely certain about our mafia candidate. I am not certain about a mafia candidate and darkdude isn't in danger of being quick lynched so I am happy with my vote where it is. I don't believe I am being inconsistent.</div></blockquote><br><br>He had not particularly mentioned me before, but I am apparently town yesterday and volkan is his other mafia.

Its very clear that he is putting points specifically where he wants them as an excuse to push a lynch. With the way he has explained his system, I find it very hard to believe that he can be awarding all these points to IS and have none he wants to award in retrospect. His case against IS is based on meta and the fact that there is no case on darkdude when there clearly is. Also, anyone who would rather mislynch than lynch the wolf is antitown.<br><br>Empking: What are your thoughts on lynching darkdude today to be safe and seeing how Rufflig's claim pans out and lynching vollkan tomorrow if it turns out to be the right lynch?<br>IS: What are your thoughts on a vollkan lynch today?</div></blockquote><br><br>Now he def. sees volk as mafia.<br><br>He votes volkan and then immediately unvotes volkan.<br><br>D4, first post out of the gate Occult is scum, not a mention of why he changed his opinion, just that Occult is scum and he's forgotten about volk.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kanyeknowsbest wrote:</cite>vollkan: You keep saying you are responding to my concerns, but you haven't done a thing to alleviate my uneasiness with you vollkan. Let me put it this way: you scum hunting does not seem genuine to me. You keep throwing points at IS who, on the other hand, seems quite genuine in his scum hunting. I don't agree with the points you give him, and you claim you are not tunneling. You claim that scum tells persist the entire game, but you have yet to give any retroactive points. There is a mountain of things that could potentially be seen as scummy that you ignore in favor or quoting IS's latest post and giving him 5-10 points.

Occult represents the best of both. Possible wolf, possible mafia. <br><br>Empking is highly unlikely to be the wolf. If he is, he tried a weak bus and it backfired on him. Could still be mafia.<br>Vollkan is unlikely to be the wolf, all he has is an off vote. Occult has more reason to be the wolf with a late bus. Could also be scum due to the way he has been singling me out.<br>Kanye has shown no propensities to be wolf. Kanye Could be scum based on number probability.<br><br>Occult is possible wolf by avoiding the issue by focusing on McG Day 1 then dropping the hammer when the RBT wagon was inevitable. Occult is possible mafia due to his actions as previously mentioned. Opportunism, strategic lurking and content filling, etc. Occult has been very careful to avoid contact with Vollkan and Kanye and Empking as opposed to Jeromus, Rufflig and myself. That usually denotes that he doesnt want to give a way a possible partner connection.<br><br>In the end, the fact remains that since im not scum, and assuming that Jeromus and Rufflig are telling the truth, there are three scum between those four. We almost cant miss. Occult represents the best chance of not missing. Combine that with his actions and thats who I propose to lynch. Otherwise, whos a better lynch? Vollkan? Empking? or Kanye?<br><br>Occult is pretty sure on Kanye, Rufflig is highly suspicious of Kanye? What about the rest of you?<br><br>My points on Kanye:<br><br>1) Went after Hez pretty hard on Day 1, but then jumped on the RBT wagon when several votes piled up on me suddenly (Unlikely wolf, possible mafia)<br>2) Day 2, goes after Rufflig for being wolf, but then stops and gets into the numbers game with Darkdude. Going back and forth on percentages and statistics.<br>3) Day 3, Eventually decides that Darkdude is wolf<br>4) Still Day 3, Praises Empking and myself, avoids Occult and trashes Vollkan and plunks the vote on him.<br>5) Day 4, quick vote on Vollkan but quickly retracted. Notes the interactions of Vollkan and Occult, finally votes for Occult<br><br>Kanye is having a very similar game to Empking. So its still very unlikely that Kanye is wolf since his position on the Day 1 wagon was not a RBT bus position. He still has the same possibility to be mafia, if Kanye is mafia, his most possible partner would have to be Empking, making Occult even more likely to be wolf.<br><br>If Occult is mafia, his partner would have to be Vollkan, since I doubt the mafia would be going for a bus right now. What this means is that the possibility is HUGE that we have this game pretty much figured out now. But it has to start with Occult. Occult is very likely to be a wolf. And if he turns out to be a scum, we will very likely know who his partner is. His actions then seal the deal. No one else has such high possibility of being from either faction and no one else will give us as much information once OccultScum is dead.<br><br>So im pretty convinced that Occult is the scummiest and our best bet. Im sticking with my vote on Occult."}

My idea had bullet proofs instead of role-blockers for the scum, which would have resulted in 3p endgame with the scum and jeromus. On the other hand, it also had a town role-blocker, so that would have changed things. I've never been much of a fan of scum role-blockers anyway, somewhat because they're so common that it's practically common knowledge there'll be one in any MN.<br>Hoopla, I have some questions about the normality of a a couple things. Would it be allowed to have 2 scum groups and a SK, or is it only 2 antitown factions of any kind?<br>Other one is whether redirecting roles are allowed, and if not, whether they would count as the special role allowed.<br><br>I was pretty impressed with Occult living so long after his partner got lynched D1. Hezlucky was pretty good with his N1 protection, and I find it amusing that he blocked occults kill, and the following night Occult got him."}
