I don't know if its seen as more taboo on this site, but in my previous mafia experience, I largely use my vote to draw reactions, from both the vote-ee and the town.

That said, a dangerous buildup on a weak bandwagon early in the game is immediately going to throw up some red flags.

It moves on from suspicions to accusations - And if they were just bitter that they didn't get the joke the first time, it's just immature to react that way and if not, the only alternative is that they really don't like me, for no reason other than my Pokemon joke. <br>\n<br>\nWhich, well, c'mon - It was pretty good, right? <br>\n<br>\nBut such blind accusations benefit neither scum, nor town - And as such I feel it would be premature to make a judgement on it - I'd prefer to see more of this Riceball character before I say anything of the matter.

The question is: are scum<br>\ndisproportionately frustrated at something like this?<br>\n- Regarding darkdude: Post #41 -- Votes: IS (1st vote on him) agreeing with McGriddle saying Kanye/IS scumteam. <br>\nI could see Darkdude being on a scumteam with Kanye, and trying to discredit McGriddle by attacking the innocent IS.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe scum I see are Elsa/Kanye/Darkdude.

This is something thats really confusing to me because there are several other wagons you could throw accusations at that would be easier and not require to to make it look like something is there when its not.

I never said that abstaining from a vote doesn't prevent the town from gathering information. What I did say was that Occult provided the town a springboard point and was very helpful with getting the town started on information gathering.

On the other hand, when I find someone casually (defining this as being the first nonrandom vote on a small \"wagon\" of that player; don't play semantics, casually isn't the word i want) throw a vote onto that person, they wind up flipping scum.

I cannot point to very much that you contributed, you make a fair point but then drop right back into an act, I don't like that. Anti-town needs to put up a front, you are putting up a front... I feel slightly better about you, but really have a negative read on you.<br>\n<br>\nPart of this applies to Mr. King, I find it amusing, but far from helpful. You seem to have trained with Active-lurking monks and play it to an art. But, its still active lurking, its still putting up a front and I don't like it. Yes you make a good point, but lets hear another one, you're being way to narrow-minded. I don't mind you having a \"favourite\", but I want to have a post where you tell me what you think of the rest of the game. As much as I love to read a hissy fight between two-players *sarcasm*  cut it off for a couple of minutes to give a more extensive post and then go at each other throats again.<br>\n<br>\nRBT, same thing, I want to hear what you think of the game, we got 5-pages, now and most of the players in it, let's get an actual post,  lets see some content.<br>\n<br>\nMHI, nice to see you join the game, but that is some shit posting. I understand not being able to be at the computer all the time, I understand V/la, but you could've gave us on solid post before telling us you are gone for 10 days. I'm not gonna shit on you for that, life happens, but your post is crap, not even bare minimum, its only a five page thread, not asking you to climb mount Everest. Useless post, I'm viewing you as not even confirmed yet.<br>\n<br>\nForget what I said above, McG is my new favourite, every time you post I just like you less and less. Darkdude is fake claiming and acting out the way he is, but you, you're acting scummy. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>McGriddle wrote:</cite>\nI am not seeing any apologies here or hesitance to vote. You are trying to create evidence where there is none, both here and above where you are trying to say that Occult is hindering the town; something that is clearly not the case.</div></blockquote>\n\nScum train anyone? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Kanyeknowsbest</div> obv wagon riding is obv.</div></blockquote>\n\nThere is no wagon, none at all, this applies to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hez</div> as well, a random vote does not count as a real-vote and a one-man wagon does not exists. No reasoning on this post.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>McGriddle wrote:</cite>I fixed my coding, but as far as your reasoning, I disagree. You in fact sound scummy pulling an early \"scum-tell\" out of something that could be used either way. Scum would be frustrated being declared as scum right from the beginning obviously, but as would town. Basically you're saying because he cares about being wrongfully accused of being scum he is scum? I disagree. You're also trying to get out of RVS fast, which too is suspicious, because you want to quick lynch and move to night. Hmm. igmeoy.</div></blockquote>\n\nNo, quick lynch was mentioned, you are producing a case against IS here. Fake reasoning again.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>McGriddle wrote:</cite>Hmm... Kanye and Stranger scum team. Calling it now. You're welcome.</div></blockquote>\nFlat out useless post, no reasoning to be found on this one.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>McGriddle wrote:</cite>\nFirst off, you're an idiot. Just going to throw that out there.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, I see some of you don't think I am posting enough content, but really I have very little reads on anything. When I am on a wagon with someone I don't look at just reasons to find that person scummy, I am the least tunnel visioned person here. So, through much experience, I have learned to sit back and watch everyone while putting my 2 cents in where it matters. I haven't found anything particularly scummy besides my original vote on Kanye. That is until darkdude posted a mason claim, then rebuffed it. Don't ever fake claim, all it does is piss people off and there is no reason for it. <br>\n<br>\nI will be the first to admit, I am a big fan of looking a little bit less pro town, but not necessarily scummy on day 1. To avoid a day and a night kill obviously, but to get a better case against someone for the next day. I usually leave my thoughts to myself for the most part, because it's good to keep things in your own head to avoid scum knowing what's going on up there.</div></blockquote>\n\nFirst off, thats just an insult, you add nothing to the discussion, you want to stand around mindlessly bitching at someone, play a game on scumchat.<br>\nSecond, no, I want your two cents, what you are saying here is you are not gonna help us, this game is four pages long (at this post), there is plenty to comment on. All i know is that you find fake claims, scummy, who doesn't? Lets hear some reasoning. <br>\nYou might as well have replaced that last sentence with a picture of someone giving the middle finger. Thanks for the warning that you are gonna be useless, though.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>McGriddle wrote:</cite>\nI never said I keep ALL information from town, but if I am on to somebody I keep my thoughts on that person to myself until at least twilight. I never said I can't scum hunt, and putting words in my mouth will not solve anything. kthnx.</div></blockquote>\nYes, you did hand out that little gem of fake claim = BAD, but lets loosen the knot a little on your bag of wisdom, we may need some of it.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>McGriddle wrote:</cite>Neutral* Let's just sum it up like that.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, wow darkdude. Ballsy move, but I don't think anyone would claim without a reason like that. So, we lynch whoever fake claimed, and if they flip mason we lynch you? Is that what you want?</div></blockquote>\n\nContent? Any Content? Nope, lets move on.<br>\n<br>\nSo, in most games the first day my vote is usaully deciding between people acting scummy vs. active lurkers vs. non-essential posters, luckily this game I have someone who is a little bit of everything a true, red-blooded smorgasbord of scummy goodness. That my good sir, is you <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote, vote: Mcgriddle</div> some days the scum-hunting just comes easy. Darkdude is a distraction, that I wouldn't be surprised is scum, you are non-entity that is content to hide in the shadows coming out to feed on the scraps of others arguements. <br>\n<br>\nI feel the same about everyone else at the moment, except hez, who despite me liking him as town, I flat-out disagree with his reasoning, McG is not helpful, there was no bandwagon on you at any point in this game. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">To the mod: I'd hate to bother you, but any word from meri and hero?</div>[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nSo darkdude obviously false claims and you still vote for a guy that has \"not given any content\"?

His reasoning here for voting Occult (who, by this stage, appears to be the candidate du jour) is at best unclear and at worst inconsistent. In the first paragraph he, rightly, argues that RVS rarely leads to legitimate votes and bandwagons. He then, however, attacks Occult for not voting on the basis that the vote is town's most powerful tool (wrong, it's reasoning; votes are, or should be, just an expression of reasoning). I've had some difficulty working out why this post seems inconsistent, and I think it can be best expressed as follows: a player who thinks that RVS is largely useless (as Elsa appears to) should not get upset by another player refusing to vote in RVS. After all if you think votes are so useful that a player should cast a vote without reasoning (which is what Occult refused to do), then you presumptively also think that RVS is useful.<br>\n27: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hez+5</div> contingent on no future explanation of this vote.

If you are playing in a manner that makes reasonable players unsure of whether you are serious or not, you are playing badly.<br>\n84: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elsa+5</div>. I really dislike his passive pushing of a lurker lynch (terrible idea) here. The reason for the points is not that the idea is terrible (I've seen enough people stupidly support lurker lynches to know that it isn't inherently scummy), but the way he pushes it: first, by saying he thinks there are likely scum among the lurkers (why?) and, secondly, because he asks \"How do people feel about a lynch of a lurker\" - trying to get the issue on the agenda, but not actually committing to what can be a very dangerous position.<br>\n85: I've seen Hez's attitude here before, from Yosarian2 no less. I'm something. FWIW, I think it's a profoundly dangerous way to play. Basically saying \"People who think like me are town\" completely ignores the fact that scum's main daygame objective is to appear as pro-town as possible, and it isn't that hard for scum to do. All it really tells you is that \"that person is thinking like me\" - that might mean that they are town,  but it can also just mean that they are doing a good job faking it.  Though, Yosarian2, to my knowledge, never had the attitude that \"people who disagree with you are scummy\" - and it's pretty obvious why that is a terrible approach: there are many reasonable opinions that people can have in this game, whether or not they accord with your own.<br>\n94: *wishes I had read the thread before offering to replace in*", "time": "Mon Apr 11, 2011 2:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17173&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "17173"}

First (two - playing one other) game in five years and I have completely been approaching this the wrong way. <br>\n<br>\nOver the last few hours, I picked a random mini and tested my \"thinks like Hez\" theory. I read the entirity of Mini 1117 - Manhattan Special, and nailed all three scum at the beginning of day two, not changing my suspicions even once throughout the rest of the game. Furthermore, I was correct on every single flip in teh game save one <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">. However, I realize, if I were playing in that game, I would a) be nightkilled by the mafia for catching onto them  and b) nobody would listen to a damn word I say after I was dead or.. for that matter... before I was dead.

I'm going to be way more vicious from now on - because I am clearly not capable of formulating my thoughts properly, and because town need to win. If I play in any other way, town would suffer. I also need to stop revealing my reads - McGriddle as town [which I am very confident of given past events] was a mistake on my part. <br>\n<br>\n(I am now going to re-present the case on Elsa so that we can lynch scum)<br>\n<br>\nElsa has basically voted on my only two town reads, Occult and McGriddle.

I disagree in that you say my next vote on you was \"random absurdness\" or not a contribution to the game, considering it got discussion rolling and pushed the ball into your court. I don't know if its seen as more taboo on this site, but in my previous mafia experience, I largely use my vote to draw reactions, from both the vote-ee and the town. And yeah, it's one of my biggest \"anti-town\" red flags when someone jumps onto a bandwagon with little to no reasoning.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nShe is trying WAY too hard to explain herself at the random vote stage of the game. Furthermore, it is in this very post where she unvotes Occult. This was in response to the Occult post that I described as \"townie frustration\", kind of how you would respectfully (in a pissed off manner) explain to someone annoying why they are wrong without actually cussing them off. Here is Occult's post that does that:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Occult wrote:</cite>Now, yes while its true that the RVS doesn't just automatically lead to a lynch, its just plain useless. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I'm not \"threatened by them\" I really don't like the fact that it is expected to random vote.  Yes, it is our most powerful tool, but doing it randomly does not help, does it? You randomly voted for McGriddle, what did you learn from that vote? Nothing.  </div>My non-vote has started an actual conversation, I now have responses from IS, darkdude and yourself. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> I would say I have actually contributed to the game where as you just jumped up, pointed at me and voted for me for saying a prefer to carefully look at the evidence rather then put up some sorta random absurdness?

It prevents the town from gathering information. You should know that. FOS: Kanyeknowsbest \n</div></blockquote>\n\nLet me try concisely sum up why I think Hez is scum as heck:\n<ul><li>He is constantly defending McGriddle. Half of his posts so far mention how much he thinks McGriddle is town. There is no reason to be so obsessed with declaring McGriddle town (#62, #85, #89, #130).</li>\n<li>In several of these posts he equivocates despite being convinced McGriddle is town (#62, #85). I am not sure what his deal with McGriddle is, only that it doesn't do anything for town, and there are likely several reason why scum would do it.</li>\n<li>As I have detailed previously, there are several posts where he has exaggerated data or made very clear misinterpretations of the data and refused to admit it. Town has no reason to do this except in cases where they are tunnel visioned and clawing for anything that can make their target look scummy. I do not believe that HezLucky is tunnel visioned at all.</li>\n<li>He is pushing very hard for a Elsa lynch. I have no opinions on the wagon itself, I am just disturbed that he is pushing a wagon so hard and his evidence amounts to \"Guys I'm really good at finding out who's definitely town and who's definitely scum on day one trust me on this one.\" He picked this wagon very early off of his exaggerated data and has stuck to it the entire time, securing his position as number one on the wagon. Remember that Hez finds vote #2 on a wagon to be a huge scumtell. I suspect he would find #3-6 to also fall in the middle range that scum tries to hide in a la theory from the wiki. And naturally scum does not want to be the hammer vote either. I am certain from the things that Hez has said in this thread that he likely finds vote number one to be the safest place on a wagon for scum and where he would try to be.</li>\n<li>And finally there are the internal inconsistencies in the application of your logic. What is a scum tell for one person you find a town tell for another.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\nOn that last note, the bandwagon thing where the first vote is a random vote and will obviously be withdrawn: Do you think that Internet Stranger is scummy for starting a bandwagon on Occult? I notice now that you were very curious about Jeromus' vote on Empking which was also a second vote.

Numerator should be the number of scum you anticipate in the game. It should work even if it is a non-integer: e.g. if you think there is equal chance of 5 or 6 scum, then the numerator would be 5.5 .<br>\n<br>\nSo every player starts with:<br>\n<br>\np(Scum)= (#scum in game)/(#players-1)<br>\n<br>\nThen when you find a tell, you decide on:<br>\n<br>\np(Event|Scum), which is the probability that you would see this tell (Event) occurring if the player were Scum, and<br>\np(Event|Scum'), which is the probability that you would see this Event occurring if the player were not Scum (town)<br>\n<br>\nThe plug these into Bayes' Theorem<br>\np(Scum|Event) = [p(Event|Scum)p(Scum)]/[p(Event|Scum)p(Scum)+p(Event|Scum')(1-p(Scum))]<br>\n<br>\n(below calculator found with Google)<br>\n<a href=\"http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/bayes/BayesCalc.htm\" class=\"postlink\">http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/ba ... esCalc.htm</a><br>\n<br>\nYou will get the updated probability p(Scum|Event), which is the probability of the player being Scum given that you have observed the Event. If you were 100% correct in your assessment of p(Event|Scum) and p(Event|Scum') as well as the prior probability p(Scum), then the updated probability should also be 100% correct. That is to say, the alignment of the players should be scum exactly at the rate of p(Scum|Event).<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, so you do this to update the probability of the suspect player being scum. Then you do the same with all other players-</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd that's where I realized that I haven't thought of this enough.<br>\n<br>\nHow do you mathematically account for the updated probability in every player? Take this example: Tell<sub>1</sub> increases p(Scum) of player A, and simultaneously decrease p(Scum) of all other players. I was assuming that simply reversing p(Event|Scum) and p(Event|Scum') for all other players would work and the average p(Scum|Event) for all players would still be equal to the original p(Scum). However, what if players A and B both exhibit Tell<sub>1</sub>? Both of their p(Scum) rises, so obviously you would get a different average p(Scum|Event). Or do you treat them as separate events i.e. Tell<sub>1</sub> and Tell<sub>2</sub>? But that doesn't seem right; the probability of A being scum would be lower when B exhibits the same tell if you calculate it that way, and I can't think of an intuitive explanation for that.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point I'm no longer able to see this intuitively, and have not worked out the mathematical proofs necessary, so don't think I can speak much more on this subject at this time.

You are, um, aware of this, right?<br>\n- Rufflig: way to only read part of my ISO, dude. My reads in post #62 were the ones you posted, yet those definitely<br>\nchanged somewhat later on in the game. <br>\n- Kanye: His very first explanation in post #65 actually makes me surprisingly more comfortable with him. Must have<br>\nmissed it the first time around. I said initially that he's either scum or poor town. Was leaning towards the first.<br>\nNow I'm leaning towards the second.<br>\n<br>\n- Charter: This is by far the most interesting, because Charter died. I will focus more on what charter said, since even<br>\nif Mhi was \"onto someone\" it doesn't matter because Mhi replaced out. Why did Charter die? He didn't seem overly town.<br>\nHe must have been onto someone. But who?<br>\n<br>\nSo in conclusion:<br>\nMy scumlist yesterday was: Elsa, RBT, Kanye<br>\nRBT has been lynched. Hurrah. <br>\nElsa is still my top choice. But everyone knows that. <br>\nKanye is no longer on it for now. Likely tunnelling Day One. But I will still watch and observe him.<br>\nHere's my new list: Elsa, Jeromus, McGriddle   [[first two are mafia]]<br>\n<br>\nMcGriddle is about to be lynched. I support this lynch. However, my vote right now has a different purpose: I want to<br>\npoint someone else out to the town who has been far too conservative this game to be town and has been posting a<br>\nsurprising amount of fluff and getting away with it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Vote: Jeromus </div><br>\n<br>\n[[NOTE: Charter's scumlist post #205: RBT, Elsa, Jeromus<br>\n<br>\nand he's dead.

This is both as a means of minimising emotional influences (so I don't give a player who I have a stronger gut feeling about a slightly higher score) and keeping consistency.  <br>\nI should also say in advance that a few months ago (and I announced this in the game I started it), I doubled all my scores (as in, I used to mainly give out 1s,2s and 3s). I just say this in case you or anybody else runs off to check my meta on point scoring and then comes back with \"Why did this only get 1 point in x game from six months ago?\"<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">As for McG:</div><br>\nMcG got 3 points for a tell that I call \"boilerplating\". The reason this tell only gets 3 is that, in the past (specifically in the game Popularity Mafia, if I recall correctly), I have seen it fail. <br>\n<br>\n(To elaborate on the tell: there are certain scumtells (or alleged scumtells) that have recognised names (\"wagoning\", \"opportunism\", \"WIFOM\", \"OMGUS\", etc. are common examples). Some of those things are often scummy (eg. \"opportunism\") whereas others are, in my opinion, not (eg. OMGUS), but that's beside the point. The key point is that, because the tell has a recognised label, using that label effectively serves as an emotional tag to strengthen the argument.  It's much easier and sounds much more serious to accuse somebody of \"wagoning\" than it is to argue that they've cast a vote on an existing wagon for questionable reasons (mostly, I suspect, because \"wagoning\" imputes a scummy intention to wagon, whereas simply analysing the vote  directly might be more ambiguous) The trouble is, as I have learned, town do sometimes also do this, even though in theory the incorrect use of a boilerplate is reflective of a scum mentality.)<br>\n<br>\nThe +7 for McG was for two things (I quote the post below): first, his misrepresentation of his past play in respect of IS;  and, second, a further instance of him both admitting his scumminess whilst demonising somebody for attacking him. (If you want to really be pedantic, if I had scored the tells separately I would have given the first one 5 and the second 3 (because the second was a repeat of an earlier tell, rather than a new tell in its own right) - but my process of reasoning was more basically \"Well, the first of these is a moderate tell, and the second is not so much, so they roughly equate to a serious tell so I will give him 7\").<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Occult wrote:</cite>\nExample Hez gets 5 points for not explaining his vote.

To quote from one of the few parts of the wiki on scumtells that I endorse:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wiki wrote:</cite> The working definition of a scumtell is an action that is more likely to be taken by a scum player than a town player. This relies on motivations, as most things in mafia do. When a player takes an action, evaluating it on the basis of \"would this action more likely come from a town player, or a scum player\" should be the way that players determine the scumminess of that action. It is worthwhile to note here that subjectivity plays little to no role in this distinction. POSSIBLE motivations for scum to take a given action are not sufficient to call an action a scum tell. An action is scummy if and only if it can be deemed more likely to come from scum than from town, A perfect example of this occurs in mini 636: Gangland mafia. Kuribo asserts that an action is a scumtell to him, because he can think of A justification for scum to do it, but neglects, as vollkan points out, to show that this reason is likely.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhy is is more likely that DD was pushing the alternative wagon to save RBT than simply that he was earnestly pushing the alternative wagon? Heck, I was pushing Elsa yesterday - on what basis do you assert (as you are implicitly doing) that my push on Elsa was NOT trying to save RBT?<br>\n<br>\n- I think the mason claim thing was an obvious joke. It's a bad thing to do, because it leads to all sorts of confusion, but it's not scummy so much as just an illustration of why jokey play is often a bad idea.<br>\n<br>\n- \"and everything else\" What, specifically?

That's enough to make me raise my eyebrow at you, really, but it really kicked in at this little comment here. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kanye wrote:</cite> If you think that there is scum on your wagon, doesn't the fact that they are trying so hard to push your wagon along with you cause you some concern? </div></blockquote>\n\nAlright, this next bit makes perfect sense in my head - But I will attempt to verbalise it now. <br>\n<br>\nTwo scum teams are confirmed. Kanye raises this point just above.<br>\n<br>\nIf he's town, then there's a few possibilities in this situation he's brought up. Scum are on this wagon lynching someone (IS) they think is either werewolf or town. Werewolf is on this wagon trying to lynch someone they think is either scum or town. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There's a fifty/fifty chance of town lynch, but that town lynch is all he refers to. Note that.<br>\n<br>\nNow assume for this next paragraph that DD and Kanye are scumbuddies. Kanye says this, with the knowledge that he and DD are confirmed mafia.<br>\nSo given this hypothetical - The only option is werewolves lynching town.<br>\nCall it reaching, but I feel that it wasn't just a poor phrasing. It was a slip of the tongue, probably not even thought about, that had him believing that if there were scum on that wagon - They could only be lynching town.<br>\n<br>\nI hope I phrased that alright <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> But Kanye is confirmed scum in my eyes, with DD likely being his buddy. I feel you're hiding behind crazy-prose, as Occult said in....#101, it was. Trying to make us assume \"Oh, he's not scummy, he's just always this way\", so that none of you being all over the place need be even glanced at oddly.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, reading through, just a few quotes of interest.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Occult wrote:</cite> Well, it's hard to take your game tactics seriously when you spend most of your time curled up in the fetal position crying about how you can't play D1 and then get upset when people question you specifically about things </div></blockquote>\n\nLol.

There is more evidence against darkdude than McGriddle but you guys are pushing for McGriddle ... why???<br>\n<br>\nOh, I suppose I should answer the actual question - heh. Since McGriddle isn't rbt's buddy then the only way he can be scum is as mafia. If and only if IS isn't mafia _and_ the mafia split themselves between the two wagons then there is a straight 1 in 4 chance of McGriddle being mafia.

Remember how darkdude pushed IS' wagon hard yesterday? I believe darkdude was trying to save his werewolf buddy by pushing a competing wagon. Add in the false mason claim with rbt (which he is now attempting to cover that blunder by calling everyone in turn his mason buddy) and everything else and darkdude was the obvious lynch for today not McGriddle. Go reread the first half of today and look at all the questions there were about darkdude and his play which he has ignored (yeah I know he asked me to repeat them, but he can go look over two pages as easily as I can). Can anyone tell me why McGriddle is a better lynch candidate than darkdude for today when there are all sorts of scummy signs pointing towards darkdude being rbt's partner? The only reasons I've seen for McGriddle's lynch are equally valid towards a darkdude lynch. There is more evidence against darkdude than McGriddle but you guys are pushing for McGriddle ... why???<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGoing through the above:<br>\n- The bit about what you \"believe\" DD was doing is pure conspiracy argument. To quote from one of the few parts of the wiki on scumtells that I endorse:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wiki wrote:</cite> The working definition of a scumtell is an action that is more likely to be taken by a scum player than a town player. This relies on motivations, as most things in mafia do. When a player takes an action, evaluating it on the basis of \"would this action more likely come from a town player, or a scum player\" should be the way that players determine the scumminess of that action. It is worthwhile to note here that subjectivity plays little to no role in this distinction. POSSIBLE motivations for scum to take a given action are not sufficient to call an action a scum tell. An action is scummy if and only if it can be deemed more likely to come from scum than from town, A perfect example of this occurs in mini 636: Gangland mafia. Kuribo asserts that an action is a scumtell to him, because he can think of A justification for scum to do it, but neglects, as vollkan points out, to show that this reason is likely.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy is is more likely that DD was pushing the alternative wagon to save RBT than simply that he was earnestly pushing the alternative wagon? Heck, I was pushing Elsa yesterday - on what basis do you assert (as you are implicitly doing) that my push on Elsa was NOT trying to save RBT?<br>\n<br>\n- I think the mason claim thing was an obvious joke. It's a bad thing to do, because it leads to all sorts of confusion, but it's not scummy so much as just an illustration of why jokey play is often a bad idea.<br>\n<br>\n- \"and everything else\" What, specifically? I see McG's \"easy lynch\" point, but I've already said that I think that argument is scummy from McG, so I'm not sure what other points you are raising.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI've checked Rufflig's posts and can't find any answers. <br>\n<br>\nSo, @Rufflig: RESPOND", "time": "Wed May 04, 2011 7:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17173&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "17173"}

Subjectivity has to come into play. <br>\nOn the specific matter of differences between you and DD. I would catergorize you as having been in favor of an Elsa lynch rather than strongly pushing for one. Secondly, even if I were to state that you were pushing an Elsa lynch, the Elsa lynch had no backing and was pre-doomed to failure.

I just see him playing it very safe, carefully watching what he is saying not trying to dig out scum. He spent more time adding fuel to his bitch-fight and completely ignored a claim of someone who he supposedly strongly felt was innocent. The fact that he made no attempt to actually stop the wagon when he felt this, does not sit right with me at all.

Its not pre-commitment, its the equivalent of the curtain for the Wizard from the Wizard of Oz. You really believe that you can excuse such blatant scummy behavior by using a railed system? How can you use points that you set arbitrarily as a method to auto-determine your actions when you yourself are setting the points? Its crap, plain and simple.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nConfining my response to game-relevant stuff, rather than a theory defence of my system: You are again attacking me for an aspect of my play which I do regardless of alignment. Enough said. It's even worse that you are completely smearing the system as some ploy to \"pump them up full of guilt and repentance\" when any reasonable observer, even those who detest my system (of which there are many), would know that it's simply the way that I express my suspicions<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite><br>\nYoure right, it is a conspiracy argument.

You cant sit there like some Ken doll, throw a wink and a smirk and just try to dismiss me and expect that to be the end of it. You expect me to con jure up your own defense for you either. All youre basically saying is that you get to lean on some point tally that you created, so you have free range to do whatever you want.<br>\n<br>\nI dont need to create some detailed point by point analysis. All youre doing is trying to put the burden on me to do all the work, so you can just say \"No, I didnt\" and demand for more.

Its quite unfortunate that I was wrong then, but im definitely not wrong now.<br>\n<br>\nIts quite simple really. You KNEW that Luchris was a townie, so of course you didnt want to change your points crutch around, because that would make you look too obvious. So by keeping your points inflated to MBF, you have an excuse to not be involved in the lynch. Like I said in the first sentence, you cant suddenly use hindsight glasses against me because only scum knew Luchris was innocent. Which is precisely what youre doing now. Of course youre not going to depart from a established meta, you purposely set it up to be that way in the first place. That means that there is no analysis to be made, you cant analyze made up scoring.<br>\n<br>\nWhy should I wait around and let you gather crazy fervor against me first? Youre the one trying to make me look bad and I can clearly see it, even if no one else does. Like I said earlier, you cant just wave your hand around like some jedi mind trick, throw a wink and a smile and assume that what I say doesnt have merit when it clearly does. <br>\n<br>\nThis isnt anything new, I am a constant daytime target. I been called an easy lynch before because Im not afraid to lay it out there for all to see. Im here to catch scum and its plain to see that youre trying to set me up here. I dont need to sit here and wait for you to shoot me. I see the threat against me and this town and its easy to see that you have been part of the scumteam all along.<br>\n<br>\nMy vote stays, im sure on this one.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\ntl;dr version:<br>\n<br>\nMy argument is crap, but I've got great rhetorical skills.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DD wrote:</cite><br>\nWait, you're talking about Internet's case on Rufflig?<br>\n<br>\nI was talking about you giving him +5 in #527.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOh.<br>\n<br>\nIn that case, the meta above is even more relevant.

So, prima facie, anybody arguing for a wolf lynch (or, at least, for not trying to lynch mafia over wolf), is at best anti-town.<br>\n<br>\n1) The above quote begins with a fairly blatant contradiction. First three lines, IS pulls his garden-variety emotional rhetoric out, completely ignoring the math (his assumptions 1-4 that preceded this have already been dealt with by DD). But, immediately after this, he accuses DD of playing to emotions - when, if anything DD has done the exact opposite in going against the natural emotional inclination of people to think \"lynching scum = good\". <br>\n2) This is simply irrelevant and pure ad hom. Dispute DD's math if you must, but the fact that he is a potential werewolf doesn't enter into it.<br>\n3) Ditto<br>\n4) Ditto<br>\n5) Ditto<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMaybe it's clearer now what I mean by \"garden-variety emotional rhetoric\", but basically, my case there is not that he is wrong or illogical about the game setup (though he is). Rather, my problem is that he is ignoring the math and the reasoning and, instead, making an essentially ad hominem/conspiracy case against you.

{"number": 670, "id": "3028382", "user": "darkdude", "user_id": "8762", "content": "K, we're gonna compare cases now? Here's the full list of why Internet is Scum.<br>\n<br>\n1. Playing the image game, as he calls it. Avoids my attempt to draw attention on him Day 1 by ignoring questions, and now tries to spin my past unsuccessful wagons into some sort of conspiracy \"always trying to get him lynched no matter what\". Always a bunch of fancy appeals to emotion (including baseless accusations of others AtE) in every single post.<br>\n<br>\n2. Just admitted that McG looked scummy Day 2 but then blames me for \"letting mislynch go through\".<br>\n<br>\n3. Near the end of Day 2, starts saying that Jeromus, Rufflig, Kanye and Occult are all making good points. But that's not it, he adds that therefore, someone in there is opportunistic scum. This is an attempt to make his record ambiguous and allow him to pick wagons freely on Day 3.<br>\n<br>\n4. Mentions me for the first time at beginning of day 3, with only reason that \"faking crazy\" is scummy. Later adds on some crap floating around such as the \"mason claim\". Anyone with half a brain should know that's not any sort of tell.<br>\n<br>\n5. Lies about always lynching the scummiest person. He unvoted Rufflig when I stopped the wagon (under assumption that he was wolf). At the time I was voting Internet (first time Day 3). If I were to grasp straws like Internet, I would say this is an effort to appease me.<br>\n<br>\n6. Has been always focusing on wolf lynch. When confronted with proof that mafia is lynch is better than wolf lynch, he doesn't start looking for mafia. He sits with his old scumlist and tries to get Rufflig lynched by trying to discredit the math (through appeals to emotion and no real logic). Whenever he's called out on this he says \"I'm lynching scummiest\" despite that he had made it clear that he thought Rufflig was wolf at the time, as many of his tells assumes the association with Riceballs.<br>\n<br>\n7. Started off Day 3 with NK speculation, that because the kills were on the Riceballs wagon, that scum must be on the other wagon. This way he looks good and sets up his lynch targets at the same time. But with Rufflig's claim, it is clear that there's not many scum on the Day 1 Internet wagon. Riceballs was scum. Me, Jeromus, McGriddle, and Rufflig are town. Even if you think I'm scum, that's only another one. And since then I would most likely be wolf, Mafia are all on the Riceballs wagon. (I don't think vollkan is mafia now, compared to the other candidates)<br>\n<br>\n8. First doubts Rufflig's claim. When Rufflig doesn't back down he says he's at a loss as to who Rufflig wants him to vote for. When Rufflig points out that he's not forcing Internet to vote anyone, he defaults to darkdude, his 3rd suspect. He's doubting and trying to appease Rufflig at the same time. Looks like scum at a loss as to what to do with that surprise claim.<br>\n<br>\nNo, Rufflig is not cleared, but highly likely to be town so it's harmless to assume so until otherwise. It's something like 95%. We have better things to do than to guess what WIFOM layer Rufflig is on.<br>\n<br>\n9. Internet tries to spin anything I do as scummy. I wanted him to state his case because I don't recall any points that should make him want to lynch me. He delays this, okay. But saying that calling for restating a case is a scumtell is ridiculous. Clearly, vollkan didn't see your case either. Am I scum with him? Is that what you think?<br>\n<br>\nReading Internet's posts in Flash Mafia, it would seem that his strategy of defense is to use strawmen of cases against him to pretend that there is no case. Guess how many times he's said that in this game? Go to his ISO and look for all the instances where he says \"you have no case on me\" where he should have been addressing the points instead. Saying people's cases against you is a conspiracy to always get you lynched is NOT a town way of defending one self.<br>\n<br>\nHe already said that he doesn't care about town, only about catching scum. This is fine as long as catching scum helps town, as it is 99% of the time. But he's using his alleged zealotry as his own crutch (way worse than vollkan's points, btw). If we had listened to him, we would have lynched the obvious wolf (assume Rufflig is wolf), even though that would be very bad compared to mafia lynch. All because he doesn't care about town but only about \"catching scum\". In specific cases, like this one, there actually is a difference. And in this case if he doesn't care about town, it means his mindset is not town. It means he's scum.", "time": "Mon May 09, 2011 9:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17173&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "17173"}

Behaviour (as is anything else in the universe) can be modeled. Saying otherwise is discounting the entire field of social science.<br>\n<br>\nThere is also a reason why I thought the math was applicable. Mostly, that we had no good leads on the Mafia.

It seemed to me that you would be a reasonable lynch because ignoring me was weird. Riceballs was fine too. But I already had some a little thing going against you. THEN: a bunch of scummy people jumped on. McGriddle. Rufflig. Riceballs himself. I thought it was interesting to see where it would go. Especially since McGriddle quoted my encouragement before jumping on. It looked like I was catching something.<br>\n<br>\nThat's why I had no interest in picking up the wagon Day 2. After the Riceballs flip, I thought Internet (and Emp and Charter) had wayyyy better scumhunting skillzzz than I did, able to see Riceballs as clear scum, as opposed to me and a bunch of other people who were nowhere near as sure though we had suspicions. McGriddle looked to be clearly Riceballs' buddy. Of course I would want to lynch him rather than Internet, who I had only the weird behaviour of not paying me any attention.<br>\n<br>\nMy vote back on Internet early Day 3 was similar, though more serious than before. This time I had the additional suspicion because he had been focusing on wolf lynch so badly and making illogical arguments and big appeals to emotion. I was mightily surprised when vollkan started giving points and then jumped on. So then I thought vollkan was scummy.

McGriiiiiddle overshadowed Internet in scumminess, and after the Riceballs flip I was very inclined to trust Internet and Empking's scumread on McGriiiiddle. Internet at the time was still only at fault for being anti-town with not answer the question. I would be scum if I DIDN'T switch.<br>\n<br>\nIn case haven't made it clear yet, my general feeling on day 1 was that Internet was playing anti-town by intentionally ignoring a question. Riceballs was scummy but I was not as sure as the others (see twilight posts of mine) and so either lynch was okay. Pushing Internet instead of Riceballs was just fine for me because at the time they were similar in scum-likelihood.<br>\n<br>\nAnd having a competing wagon seemed very useful. Like Internet himself said, it looked like a honeypot for scum. Pretty much every vote on it after Jeromus (2nd vote) looked scummy as hell. And no, I'm not just making up an excuse now. Go look at my response to Charter's \"THERE'S NO WAY ANY TOWN WOULD THINK OTHERS ON INTERNET WAGON IS TOWN\" post. I was fully aware how awful the other votes were.<br>\n<br>\nTurns out that was wrong though. Riceballs was the only scum there. Apparently the crappiness of the wagon was too obvious. The scum stayed the hell away from it, except Riceballs who had nothing to lose.<br>\n<br>\nInternet looks quite ridiculous in his conviction that woooolf buuuuddie 100% bussed Riceballs. Too bad I'm the only player with 100% proof since only I'm darkdude.<br>\n<br>\nBut for others, you should see that the once-thought scummy wagon turned out to be anything but. Rufflig and Jeromus, the big suspects, are now for all practical considerations town.

Thus I got 19.3% for Internet. Better than 18.1% for No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nFeel free to plug in your own estimate of Internet's (or anyone else's) scumminess and see for yourself if it's better than No Lynch.", "time": "Thu May 12, 2011 6:43 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17173&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "17173"}

{"number": 759, "id": "3056182", "user": "Internet Stranger", "user_id": "77", "content": "So Rufflig, why all the drama about having some serious power role then? Hell, you were even still going at it up to the end there. Is that supposed to be some sort of convoluted trap that im still not getting? That being said, im still perplexed about the night kill. The doctor is gone, Rufflig claims to not be wearing superman's cape, so whats the deal?<br>\n<br>\nI still fail to see how both Rufflig and Jeromus are still alive. You would assume that at least one would bite the bullet. Obviously one team shot Darkdude (and I cant figure out why!) or maybe both did. So where is the other kill? What im trying to get at here is the possibility that Rufflig and Jeromus are actually the mafia and somehow have a way of stuffing the werewolf kill. Maybe Bulletproof, roleblocker? If that was the case, then Rufflig and Jeromus must have the wolf figured out, otherwise that would be an extremely suicidal gambit. But then again, I figured that their claim yesterday was suicidal onto itself as it is and yet here they still are, why?<br>\n<br>\nSo assuming that Jeromus and Rufflig arent mafia (I can safely rule them out of wolfness at this point), that means that 3 of 4 of Vollkan, Empking, Occult and Kanye are scum. Holy shit, if we fail to lynch scum today we truly suck.<br>\n<br>\nSo whos it going to be?<br>\nVollkan could be a wolf. Didnt vote RBT Day 1.<br>\nIf Empking is a wolf, then that means he was going for a softbus on RBT, but got screwed when I jumped on and finished RBT off. I dont see any evidence that says that Empking cant be mafia though.<br>\nAs Occult pointed out, Kanye is playing games with Vollkan.<br>\n<br>\nI did an ISO on Occult and he seems to hem and haw a lot. He did it on Day 1 and finally put something down when RBT was at L-1 and I was at L-2. He essentially calls me a bully and scum and spins a conspiracy theory over Empking and I (Im coaching Empking apparently), says a few soft words on RBT, calls her a lurker and then votes for her.<br>\n<br>\nIts risky, but its quite likely after all that this was a bus. The wagon on me was going to start losing momentum. It took Rufflig and Jeromus to glob on to keep it from losing steam (nice pick there, boys), so whos to say what would happen if Occult put the vote on me then suddenly had to backtrack. RBT wasnt going to be much help the rest of the game anyways after I flipped town, she would have likely been a Day 2 target, so why not gain town cred with bus and coast? <br>\n<br>\nWhich is what Occult seems to be doing. Coasting. Further looking at Occult reveals a patter of coasting. His opinions, although lengthy, seem to be carefully orchestrated to remain extremely neutral. He did the same thing on Day 2 with the Griddle lynch. Pretended to think deeply about the subject matter until finally going \"aw shucks\" and plunking the vote on McG. Oh hey, Occult HAMMERED McG too.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3, a lot more coasting. Im starting to see a pattern here. I think im onto something here and the odds are very good that he could be from either scum faction at this point. So unless Rufflig and Jeromus are going to assrape us with this mason claim gambit, I think its most possible that Occult is a very possible scum. <br>\n<br>\nIm upset because my best lead is a dead townie and my next two scummiest are claiming masons. Which would explain why they are acting like all symbiotic. Rufflig and Jeromus are either masons or mafia scum. This is almost like starting over at this point.

Your buddy Occult can lurk all day and night and the more I point it out the more points you're going to assign to me?

Let me put it this way: you scum hunting does not seem genuine to me. You keep throwing points at IS who, on the other hand, seems quite genuine in his scum hunting. I don't agree with the points you give him, and you claim you are not tunneling. You claim that scum tells persist the entire game, but you have yet to give any retroactive points. There is a mountain of things that could potentially be seen as scummy that you ignore in favor or quoting IS's latest post and giving him 5-10 points. The more time I spend thinking about your play, the more I want to say that you are scum.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIS's playstyle as scum is to appear genuine and emotional. You only have to look at the past game I referenced to see that. Whatever effort he is appearing to make, the fact of the matter is that the undelrying arguments he is making are absolute rubbish. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the absence of many points elsewhere - I readily admit that it's unusual even for me. However, two points need to be borne in mind:<br>\n1) There were other players with relatively high scores; except they have died<br>\n<br>\n2) I've explained every instance of me apparently not finding something scummy. Again, if you think there is something that I am unreasonably not finding scummy, then please point it out; if you are going to accuse me of unjustifiably not finding things scummy, you need to actually demonstrate that I have done just that. Simply complaining about my lack of points doesn't suffice.  <br>\n<br>\nI also think it's worth noting that I am probably the ONLY player in this game who is vulnerable to this sort of criticism. Everybody is able to say: \"I suspect X\" without anybody batting an eyelid. But when I say \"I suspect IS\" and also indicate, through my points, that I have little suspicion of anybody else, suddenly it's a huge issue. I know it looks like I am getting tunnel-visioned on IS (and, tbh, I can't see myself supporting any other lynch today), but I really can't see what it is that I am apparently ignoring from other people. Nobody else screams scum to me; even though I disagree with your arguments Kanye, I can kind of see where you are coming from so I don't suspect you nearly as much as IS.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rufflig wrote:</cite><br>\nOk, IS.

At that point it was either plunk down a vote on me and have a very damn good reason to do so.

The very same MCG that was supposed to be your #1 suspect. Why the hesitation Occult? Were you just trying to look good? Was that McG talk initially just to make yourself look good? If he was scummy as you claim him to be, then what was holding you up? Perhaps you already knew that was a mislynch and wanted others to make all the fuss all day so you could fly under the radar with the vote? Didnt want to stick your neck out there, did you? You wanted everyone else worked into a fervor so you could say exactly what youre saying now: \"But you said he was scum too!\" <br>\n<br>\nNow that is a classic scum tactic, Occult.

In spite of your little insinuation at the end of your post, I don't know exactly what happened last night - nor could I know. This is a multi-scum faction game.

{"number": 790, "id": "3066006", "user": "vollkan", "user_id": "6898", "content": "<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Again Vollkan, your whole basis of defending Occult is yet again: \"I dont think lurking is a scum trait\". Yet, I have put up like three huge posts full of explanations of why I think Occult is a sneaky scum, but yet you choose to continually hanker on one minor point of my whole argument, the lurker part. What about his voting patterns? What about his proclamations? What about the timing of his posts?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is a neat little parable for exactly what I hate about your arguments.<br>\n<br>\nLet me go through them:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite> I did an ISO on Occult and he seems to hem and haw a lot. He did it on Day 1 and finally put something down when RBT was at L-1 and I was at L-2. He essentially calls me a bully and scum and spins a conspiracy theory over Empking and I (Im coaching Empking apparently), says a few soft words on RBT, calls her a lurker and then votes for her.<br>\n<br>\nIts risky, but its quite likely after all that this was a bus. The wagon on me was going to start losing momentum. It took Rufflig and Jeromus to glob on to keep it from losing steam (nice pick there, boys), so whos to say what would happen if Occult put the vote on me then suddenly had to backtrack. RBT wasnt going to be much help the rest of the game anyways after I flipped town, she would have likely been a Day 2 target, so why not gain town cred with bus and coast? <br>\n<br>\nWhich is what Occult seems to be doing. Coasting. Further looking at Occult reveals a patter of coasting. His opinions, although lengthy, seem to be carefully orchestrated to remain extremely neutral. He did the same thing on Day 2 with the Griddle lynch. Pretended to think deeply about the subject matter until finally going \"aw shucks\" and plunking the vote on McG. Oh hey, Occult HAMMERED McG too.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3, a lot more coasting. Im starting to see a pattern here. I think im onto something here and the odds are very good that he could be from either scum faction at this point. So unless Rufflig and Jeromus are going to assrape us with this mason claim gambit, I think its most possible that Occult is a very possible scum. <br>\n<br>\nIm upset because my best lead is a dead townie and my next two scummiest are claiming masons. Which would explain why they are acting like all symbiotic. Rufflig and Jeromus are either masons or mafia scum. This is almost like starting over at this point. But, out of everyone, Occult seems the most like he is hiding something.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nEverything in the above is pure conspiracy.<br>\n<br>\n\"hemming and hawing\" on D1 is completely understandable,  and the fact that he chose RBT as a compromise candidate is not something that I consider a scumtell. it only becomes a scumtell when you read a whole heap of extraneous BS about distancing and so forth into it. Maybe I am being simplistic here, but in the fact of not unreasonable uncertainty about who to pick, he chose RBT.<br>\n<br>\nThe rest of this is just the same thing in respect of coasting and remaining relatively neutral. You claim he has \"carefully crafted\" his opinions to be neutral - but you have absolutely no evidential basis for that.<br>\n<br>\nOnce again, you just take actions, interpret them in a scummy way, then start frothing at the mouth, claiming you are some kind of hero, and acting shocked when anybody suggests that your play is hollow.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite><br>\nIs there a reason why you cant look at Occult critically, Vollkan? What are you trying to hide? Are you purposely trying to make Occult look good here?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI AM looking at him critically.  The difference is that, unlike you, I don't think he is scummy just because I can conceive of a possible universe in which his actions are scum-motivated. If an action is not demonstrably more likely to be scum-motivated than town-motivated, it isn't a scumtell - no matter how much you puff yourself up about wanting to lynch scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite><br>\nIs that why youre STILL trying to defame me through meta nonsense? What is it that youre trying to say? Because I passionately made some really good arguments against you in a past game that I happened to be scum in, I must be scum now too? Because last time I criticized that silly system of yours that might as well be neutered, I must be scum in this game too? Did you even bother looking at any other game I was in? If youre going to along with this meta nonsense, then you need to look at more games than the one we were in. I catch scum in Day 1 constantly. I show that passion for a true scumhunt like a hunter does when stalking his prey. I put the pressure on the scum and STILL back it up with solid, valid arguments. Meta arguments on me are useless. All I ever do is go after scum and catch me a hell of a whole lot of said scum. Youre welcome to see just about any game im in for evidence and not just one that makes your little argument convenient for you.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI've never once said anything even approaching the notion that you are scum here because you were scum in our past game. In fact, I've pointed out on several occasions that you would still be my #1 suspect even if I wasn't aware of your meta. <br>\n<br>\nKeep playing the denialism game, though; it's only making me more confident in my read of you.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite><br>\nYou want to talk meta again Vollkan? What do you do? You use \"the system\" as a giant albatross around your neck. It makes a convenient excuse as to why you cant scumhunt \"But X is low on my list\" or its a convenient excuse as to why vote for someone arbitrarily \"uh.. yea, Y has a bunch of points, he must be scum\". Whatever Vollkan, we all know you been inflating points on me while you ignore Occult. The question is as to why?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd again, complete BS<br>\n<br>\nI've never used my points that way. What my points let me do is, when someone asks me why I suspect a particular person, I can point to the precise reasons why, without having to deal with stupid arguments like \"Why did you vote X at this point in time and not why?\" It just helps me keep things simple and clear.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jeromus wrote:</cite>Seriously, Empking.

The scum are the villains in EVERY GAME.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, youre completely missing the point, whether its deliberate or not. Your feelings are hurt because of one game I happened to be scum in, so now its your personal vendetta, your grand crusade to get PAYBACK. Its that simple. Youre not looking for some angle through meta, youre not looking to find the scum. Oh no, Vollkan is out for BLOOD.<br>\n<br>\nSo yes Vollkan, I am the god damn hero. I always am. I could rattle off all sorts of games where my actions, where my persistence, where my vision has led the town to victory. This includes all sorts of games where I have caught scum Day 1, including THIS ONE. In the end, do they matter? No. Much the same way the game youre STILL crying about does not matter.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing that matter is this game. Stop trying to derail the focus Vollkan. I (with the help of Empking) nailed, NAILED! RBT. I am here to catch scum and pad my numbers. I am here catching scum now so that next game, when you or anyone else tries to pull this little gambit on me again, I can point back and point out that mini where I got me all sorts of werewolves and scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo now, the choice is clear. There is no one left from my Day 1 wagon. I expected at minimum the werewolf to be there. Its quite possible that the mafia killed Darkdude because they also thought that he was the werewolf. I dont know where the werewolf kill went. Its quite possible that the mafia are Rufflig and Jeromus. By killing Darkdude, they can leave me flapping in the wind. Maybe it becomes easier to come after me that way. Give me enough rope, see if I hang myself.<br>\n<br>\nSo if that conspiracy is alive and well, then the next most likely wolf is Occult with the bus (As Darkdude himself had offered).<br>\n<br>\nIf Jeromus and Rufflig are masons after all, then the mafia is clearly two of (Vollkan, Kanye, Occult, Empking). So that means that I have a 3 in 4 shot of catching scum. So I might as well go after the most likely werewolf. That is the whole point on Occult, thats one of the reasons he is scum. Its a double shot, its the best chance we got. Vollkan is voting me because of pure revenge, so why follow him? Why listen to anything he says?<br>\n<br>\nOccult presents the best chance of catching scum. His actions havent exactly been town friendly, no matter how many shots at me he takes.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nP-EDIT:<br>\n<br>\nJeromus, I point out how good a townie I am simply to counter Vollkan's claim. Dont make it seem so one sided, please. Im trying to make the point be back at how Occult is scum. But thats impossible when my meta, my good name and character is under a vicious assault.

His case against IS is based on meta and the fact that there is no case on darkdude when there clearly is. Also, anyone who would rather mislynch than lynch the wolf is antitown.<br>\n<br>\nEmpking: What are your thoughts on lynching darkdude today to be safe and seeing how Rufflig's claim pans out and lynching vollkan tomorrow if it turns out to be the right lynch?<br>\nIS: What are your thoughts on a vollkan lynch today?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNow he def. sees volk as mafia.<br>\n<br>\nHe votes volkan and then immediately unvotes volkan.<br>\n<br>\nD4, first post out of the gate Occult is scum, not a mention of why he changed his opinion, just that Occult is scum and he's forgotten about volk.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>kanyeknowsbest wrote:</cite>vollkan: You keep saying you are responding to my concerns, but you haven't done a thing to alleviate my uneasiness with you vollkan.

I don't agree with the points you give him, and you claim you are not tunneling. You claim that scum tells persist the entire game, but you have yet to give any retroactive points.

Possible wolf, possible mafia. <br>\n<br>\nEmpking is highly unlikely to be the wolf. If he is, he tried a weak bus and it backfired on him. Could still be mafia.<br>\nVollkan is unlikely to be the wolf, all he has is an off vote. Occult has more reason to be the wolf with a late bus. Could also be scum due to the way he has been singling me out.<br>\nKanye has shown no propensities to be wolf. Kanye Could be scum based on number probability.<br>\n<br>\nOccult is possible wolf by avoiding the issue by focusing on McG Day 1 then dropping the hammer when the RBT wagon was inevitable. Occult is possible mafia due to his actions as previously mentioned. Opportunism, strategic lurking and content filling, etc. Occult has been very careful to avoid contact with Vollkan and Kanye and Empking as opposed to Jeromus, Rufflig and myself. That usually denotes that he doesnt want to give a way a possible partner connection.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, the fact remains that since im not scum, and assuming that Jeromus and Rufflig are telling the truth, there are three scum between those four. We almost cant miss. Occult represents the best chance of not missing. Combine that with his actions and thats who I propose to lynch. Otherwise, whos a better lynch? Vollkan? Empking? or Kanye?<br>\n<br>\nOccult is pretty sure on Kanye, Rufflig is highly suspicious of Kanye? What about the rest of you?<br>\n<br>\nMy points on Kanye:<br>\n<br>\n1) Went after Hez pretty hard on Day 1, but then jumped on the RBT wagon when several votes piled up on me suddenly (Unlikely wolf, possible mafia)<br>\n2) Day 2, goes after Rufflig for being wolf, but then stops and gets into the numbers game with Darkdude. Going back and forth on percentages and statistics.<br>\n3) Day 3, Eventually decides that Darkdude is wolf<br>\n4) Still Day 3, Praises Empking and myself, avoids Occult and trashes Vollkan and plunks the vote on him.<br>\n5) Day 4, quick vote on Vollkan but quickly retracted. Notes the interactions of Vollkan and Occult, finally votes for Occult<br>\n<br>\nKanye is having a very similar game to Empking. So its still very unlikely that Kanye is wolf since his position on the Day 1 wagon was not a RBT bus position. He still has the same possibility to be mafia, if Kanye is mafia, his most possible partner would have to be Empking, making Occult even more likely to be wolf.<br>\n<br>\nIf Occult is mafia, his partner would have to be Vollkan, since I doubt the mafia would be going for a bus right now. What this means is that the possibility is HUGE that we have this game pretty much figured out now. But it has to start with Occult. Occult is very likely to be a wolf. And if he turns out to be a scum, we will very likely know who his partner is. His actions then seal the deal.
