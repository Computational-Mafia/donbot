No using it under any circumstances, and no impersonating or pretending to impersonate the mod. <br>\n3) Play to your faction's win condition, as long as you do not break any game or site rules in doing so.<br>\n4) You may not discuss this game anywhere outside the game thread unless explicitly permitted to do so in your role PM.<br>\n5) Directly quoting your role PM, QT or private communications with the mod is strictly forbidden. Loose paraphrasing is permitted. <br>\n6) I expect every player to be civil and to treat eachother with respect. Mafia is a heated game, but I'll interfere if anyone resorts to excessive insults, personal attacks, or bullying. <br>\n7) No weird forms of encryption. Crumbing is perfectly OK. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting/Lynching Mechanics</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI) For your vote or unvote to be counted, it must either be in the form of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Aeronaut</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aeronaut</span>. Nicknames/abbreviations are fine as long as I know who you're talking about.<br>\nII) A lynch will occur when &gt;50% of the votes are cast for the same player. (E.G. if there are 9 people left in-game, 5 votes insures a lynch) <br>\nIII) You may vote for \"no lynch\" if you wish. If &gt;50% of the players in the game vote for no-lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\nIV) Alternatively, if the lynching deadline passes and a majority of votes for one player is not reached, there will be a \"No Lynch\", and the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\nIV) If you are killed, you may make one tasteful \"Bah\" post, but it must 100% non revealing of any sort of game information, or anything of that sort. It must be a farewell only. <br>\nV) Twilight phase talking is allowed. <br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Activity and Deadlines</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI) Each Day phase will last [number of living players + 4] days. For example, if there are 7 players left in the game, you will have 11 days. <br>\nII) Deadlines will be extended for replacement situations and exceptional circumstances. <br>\nIII) Night phases will last for 48 hours. <br>\nIV) In order to be accepted, night/day actions must be PMed to the mod.

This policy thing is BS, and clearly Lapsa is trying to suck in a scum on his wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThen he actually brings up a policy lynch after CD posts. I wasn't quite sure who he was referring to, and he says guess, so I'm assuming about Lapsa. But that's idiotic. Vote your damn scum read, and have good reasons for it. I'm not going to sit here and policy lynch someone who's obviously trying to act scummy, and then turn out to be town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'm playing defense, like no one ever was. To defend them all, is my quest, to derail trains is my cause! Mafia-mon!<br>\nSorry. Right, content.<br>\n<br>\nPoint by point:<br>\n1) Yeah, his meta read on you was dumb. Not scummy, just dumb. (Meta is dumb don't use it. It's a siren song that even I fall prey to some times, but it leads me astray so often. It's confirmation bias land) You talked it through, he changed his mind and moved away.<br>\n2) I think his post about Texcat was pretty okay. What about it was scummy, in your opinion? I already layed out why I think Plotonius' claim to be able to read you is towny, so it strikes me that someone pushing against that (as Texcat was in this case) is something worth questioning. He votes more freely than you or I do, obviously, but that's a style thing, not an alignment indicator, imo.<br>\n3) Slayer's Gambit is dumb. Never do it unless you have a really good way to prove your own towniness, because it tanks your credibility (because you're acting objectively scummy). It's honey-potting, and you need a good way to tell the difference between 'scum lured into your honey pot' and 'town that voted you because you're doing something objectively scummy'. It also turns 'I refuse to participate' into a towny action, which it very much isn't. Once you start assuming that everyone acting purposefully obstinate is town, you get into a degenerate case where scum can just refuse to play, be town read for it, and win by not playing. That's no fun.<br>\n4) I agree that his push on you was shitty. Conveniently he changed his mind when faced with updated information. His push on Texcat was pretty okay. Also, hypocrisy is a null tell. Plenty of town are hypocrites, whether they want to admit it or not.<br>\n5 &amp; 6) Those are 'Pressure votes'. Basically people are shaking their fists at Lapsa and yelling \"You better start playing or we'll kill you!\" They're trying to force him to participate. Personally I don't think it's the best way to engage an obstinate player (see: My questions / talk with Lapsa. I find curated engagement works better) but it's the far more common way to handle the situation. If someone refuses to play, that is anti-town. It's pretty much the definition of a policy lynch. You do it because you're trying to create a 'policy' where people must participate and refusing to do so is unacceptable.<br>\nMaking it clear that his actual scum read is on Abuse is towny, because if Abuse gets lynched while MathDino is camping on a Lapsa vote, we can hold MathDino responsible for that read. If push comes to shove and MathDino refuses to vote that read, we can hold him responsible for that too.<br>\n<br>\n7) Policy lynches are a really controversial subject. Some people really love them, some people (like me, and obviously you), don't. But that's not usually alignment indicating. Things like refusing to participate just suck to deal with. Making it not-okay to do that is a pro-fun maneuver, if not always pro-town.<br>\nLapsa is acting anti-town. Full stop. He's not helping us find the scum, and he's not helping us get a read on him. Other than metaing \"Oh, he must be doing X gambit\" we have no real way to determine his alignment. If you didn't know he was gambiting, what would your read on him be?<br>\nMy method to get a read on him is to coax him into participating. MadDino's (and others, and it's the more conventional way to handle it) is to threaten him into participating. But we need him participating. Pressure voting here is actually a pro-town action, as much as that sounds backwards, because it puts Lapsa into a position where he has to produce some content to help us get a read on him.", "time": "Sat Jun 13, 2015 5:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950417#p6950417\">90</a> for the most part. The pressure on both Lapsa and abuse is good.

A scum read for softing vanilla town, really? That seems weak. Also you saw VT soft VT but now you think Lapsa is scum for doing it this game? It doesn't seem like the greatest scum strategy either as it is just WIFOM and easily ignored in LYLO <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950322#p6950322\">75</a>.

On original push: I want to make this clear to everyone, I use meta to stop myself from voting people, not to vote people. I looked at your entrance post, said to myself, \"this is scummy as fuck, but lemme check his other entrance posts real quick to make sure he doesn't ALWAYS do stuff like that\". Had all your posts been like that, I would've left it alone and probably put in an announcement on what I found. Had there been no meta to look over, I'd have voted you.<br>\nPlease let me know if anyone's still confused on that.

Reply to Thor: ...which was a lead in to the next sentence saying \"but you've probably got more reasons, so let's talk\". I have enough faith in Thor as a player that he didn't base his entire read on that so I wanted to see his case. Turned out said shitty reason wasn't the major reason for his scumread at all. Cool.<br>\n<br>\n5. Policy lynch: I feel as if my vote is better served here. That's it. Not going to engage in a super lengthy discussion on the merit of policy lynches (god knows I've done that too much in the past) but I feel that having Lapsa contributing to the thread is more valuable than a vote on abuse right now.

That&#8217;s not quite where I was coming from with the question but I liked your answer anyway (and I&#8217;m not sure I can explain the difference between what i meant and what you said).

I can understand the &#8220;he can&#8217;t be this bad&#8221; arguments but if he&#8217;s known for playing like this as town, what motivation would he have as scum to change up his playstyle and start playing better? If he&#8217;s scum, he doesn&#8217;t want to make sudden playstyle changes but wants to act like he did when he was town in previous games. If this is his usual playstyle, then &#8220;as town, I do scum twilight trolling while still alive&#8221; is easy as fuck to do as scum too, especially if he knows people are going to say &#8220;oh, Lapsa&#8217;s always like that&#8221;. <br>\n<br>\nI like Zoronos&#8217; method of dealing with Lapsa too. I tend to favour that method in newbie games (the one I linked earlier is a good example), because if it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s first game then goading them into being a better player is fun and the problem is usually &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221;, not &#8220;won&#8217;t&#8221;.

The main thing I can tell you, is that pretty much everything he does right now is null. Everything you think he is saying that seems scummy, is null, everything he says that seems townie, is also null. Things he says are quite likely lies, but could be truth aswell, In any case - there is no way to know <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">yet.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe reason I poked plotinus, about him voting for lapsa was to see if he was newbish or scum. Because his vote was fishy.<br>\nI know Lapsa, many people here do not. My conversation with him was to find out. His defense of the lapsa vote was that neither vanillas nor mafia benefit from a claim such as that. That is correct- i pointed that there is another role that would benefit from it. He understood what I talked about, that should've been it.<br>\nThe interesting part though, is that shinobi intervened, and followed up trying to get me to say what exactly do I mean by that. I honestly think that what I said was obvious. Getting me to say it out loud, can be classified as both PR hunting, or trapping me for pointing to PR's instead of scum.<br>\nThe only thing is - again - I know how Lapsa plays, so basically I can tell you with 99.9% certainty, that that was not a crumb at all. I knew this pretty much for sure, they did not. This allowed me to judge their reactions about the scenario. Overall, from this alone, there's a picture of plotinus and shinobi. Plotinus came out with a slight town lean, while shinobi with a slight scum lean from that alone.

I think he honestly did believe you and I had played together, but it does point to some skimming of the thread (although he was catching up at post 147 so understandable), because it definitely was pointed out you and I hadn't played together.<br>\n3) He wasn't being serious about day 5.

Townreading everyone or treating everyone like town who pushes me. I have this image that if I explain my actions clearly and explicitly enough that my being town will be obvious enough to people trying to read me, so I take being lynched as town as a miscommunication issue more than... idk what else you could blame a guy getting lynched on.<br>\nI mean I could shout at you that I'm town but that wouldn't help you read me nearly as much as telling you all the motives in what I do and who I am.<br>\n2. Not admitting past me was wrong getting me lynched. I had this argument in Friends and Enemies where people were questioning the fact that I thought wgeurts was rolefishing, early on, right? Later he flipped town and when I got called on it, I used a game that happened AFTER the flip to defend the fact that he does in fact rolefish as scum, and I was right to believe he would do that. Got me tunneled all day after being a universal townread and probably lost the game.<br>\nCall it self meta, I'd call it self-psychoanalysis, I think a lot of the time in mafia I try to defend myself as a player or as a person above defending my alignment. Consider though Thor, where's the threshold in admitting you were wrong?<br>\n<br>\nSuppose Frogger's first post literally said he was scum and apathetic. Then suddenly he's a mod confirmed IC.

Not that Lapsa's fluffposting was hard to spot otherwise. Math made pretty clear that he was more annoyed with Lapsa's play than anything, I don't know if I really got the impression that Math thought Lapsa was scum. Frogger's definitely looks the worst of the votes on Lapsa just because it came later (the revote, not the RVS), as well as his reasons for switching to me. Which is to say, I can't really find them. I know he's tried to explain this more later in the game so I'll have to go dig those up.

I have a thing I want to test with thor this game, but this vote lends no evidence. Frogger's reasons for voting math are fine, but the circumstances are similar to his switch from Lapsa to me. That is, when he switched his vote to me, it was because he didn't have a reason to vote for Lapsa anymore (and the original reason, that Lapsa was last to confirm, was shallow anyway). Then, when he switched his vote from Lapsa to math, it was basically because I and at least one other person pointed out that Lapsa was pretty much lynchbait. Frogger follows this logic. BBT's vote is fine, I think.

One, I defy you to find the place in my ISO where I ever said that I thought Math was scum.<br>\n<br>\nTwo, you're talking about things I said a while ago like I'm still sticking to them.<br>\n<br>\nSpecifically, you're pretending like I came out and said that I thought Math was scum, and that I've been trying to push Math while not taking a stance on it or something. So let me clear this up for you so we're on the same page:<br>\n<br>\n-At the beginning of the game, I found myself agreeing with Math a lot. That gave me general good gut vibes. I sheeped Math on an early wagon that I thought was a good way to get the game out of RVS.<br>\n-People started to push Math and I realized that some of their points made sense. I noticed that there had been a wagon on Math and thought that if I analyzed both hers and Lapsa's wagons, it could be both a novel and fun way for me to look for scum.<br>\n-After rereading some of the arguments about math and getting a better (although admittedly limited) feel for his ISO, now I'm starting to get suspicious.<br>\n-I still don't have very strong reads. So analyzing a wagon, even if it's on a player I have my doubts about, is a good idea. It's a way to get my head into this game some more.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6958116#p6958116\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6958116#p6958116\" data-post-id=\"6958116\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 337</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24545\">texcat</a> wrote:</cite>And BTW those sorts of statements drive me nutso.  \"Scum on one of those two wagons\" seems like a very easy way for scum to direct attention away from themselves, particularly at this early no flip stage.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/images/img-tags/mHvF7ryK9SwpcNhwG5A2.gif\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nNo, but seriously.

I still promise to create original content next post that I don't have to answer to stuff.<br>\n<br>\nWhat you're missing is that voting Frogger was intended as an early scumread vote to apply pressure and see what happens, get a read. The vote on Lapsa was specifically intended to get him to start posting and then policy him if he didn't (I didn't expect that to actually happen). A vote for weird writing won't make the guy stop writing funnily, but a vote for not posting may make a guy start posting. Does that make sense? I wanted the anti-townness to stop REGARDLESS of Lapsa's alignment, while I had no investment in Frogger changing his posting style. So I put little effort into a meta dive to determine his alignment because I'm better at reading people than I am at meta diving. And it looks like other people provided meta information without me.<br>\n<br>\nOn the latter, yeah I agree (I'm assuming you mean 'scummy' instead of 'scum'?). To further clarify, I think to me it would be incredibly bad if I were still reading Frogger SOLELY on that entrance post even though we're 16 pages in with tons of other info, and Frogger seemed to think for a second that was what I was doing.

Zoro lacks the paranoia I expect out of town he is too confident on his town reads on too little and his wording is overly friendly and looks like pocketing to me.

Dino made a post that I marked to come back to about that argument, primarily because I had the opposite experience as him; I have never seen a Town player make the 'How do you know how many scum there are?!?!' case. (The reason the argument is bad is because it hinges on something non-alignment-indicating. Town can and do make assumptions about how many scum are in a game, so voting someone for those assumptions is a bad case.)<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956258#p6956258\">311</a> - Arguing further about the setup is scummy, because it's posting that looks like content, but isn't. Debating how many scum there might be doesn't do anything to actually find scum, but appears to be contribution. It's no good. You can look at that and go, \"Yeah, makes sense\". Because it 'makes sense' and seems reasonable, it gives towny vibes. But it doesn't actually do anything to find the scum, so it isn't towny. It's at best null. Setup spec over content is a classic scum play.<br>\n<br>\nI guess cat is out of the bag - I'm interrogating Cthulu because I'm trying to get a better idea if he's scum or just making a bad case / posting dumb stuff about setup. After his initial catchup post and a slap at some people accusing CB, he hasn't proactively gone out to sort players. He's answered engagement, but he's not out there doing work to sort. His answer to my question about why he chose to slap at Abuse and Lapsa for their questions was okay, but not as deep as I was hoping. I'm trying to draw out his other reads, if any, to analyze.<br>\nAlso he's voting / FoS'ing nobody but my town reads, (Lapsa, you, Math), so, there's that too.", "time": "Wed Jun 17, 2015 6:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

The main thing I can tell you, is that pretty much everything he does right now is null. Everything you think he is saying that seems scummy, is null, everything he says that seems townie, is also null. Things he says are quite likely lies, but could be truth aswell, In any case - there is no way to know <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">yet.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe reason I poked plotinus, about him voting for lapsa was to see if he was newbish or scum. Because his vote was fishy.<br>\nI know Lapsa, many people here do not. My conversation with him was to find out. His defense of the lapsa vote was that neither vanillas nor mafia benefit from a claim such as that. That is correct- i pointed that there is another role that would benefit from it. He understood what I talked about, that should've been it.<br>\nThe interesting part though, is that shinobi intervened, and followed up trying to get me to say what exactly do I mean by that. I honestly think that what I said was obvious. Getting me to say it out loud, can be classified as both PR hunting, or trapping me for pointing to PR's instead of scum.<br>\nThe only thing is - again - I know how Lapsa plays, so basically I can tell you with 99.9% certainty, that that was not a crumb at all. I knew this pretty much for sure, they did not. This allowed me to judge their reactions about the scenario. Overall, from this alone, there's a picture of plotinus and shinobi. Plotinus came out with a slight town lean, while shinobi with a slight scum lean from that alone.

The main thing I can tell you, is that pretty much everything he does right now is null. Everything you think he is saying that seems scummy, is null, everything he says that seems townie, is also null. Things he says are quite likely lies, but could be truth aswell, In any case - there is no way to know <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">yet.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe reason I poked plotinus, about him voting for lapsa was to see if he was newbish or scum. Because his vote was fishy.<br>\nI know Lapsa, many people here do not. My conversation with him was to find out. His defense of the lapsa vote was that neither vanillas nor mafia benefit from a claim such as that. That is correct- i pointed that there is another role that would benefit from it. He understood what I talked about, that should've been it.<br>\nThe interesting part though, is that shinobi intervened, and followed up trying to get me to say what exactly do I mean by that. I honestly think that what I said was obvious. Getting me to say it out loud, can be classified as both PR hunting, or trapping me for pointing to PR's instead of scum.<br>\nThe only thing is - again - I know how Lapsa plays, so basically I can tell you with 99.9% certainty, that that was not a crumb at all. I knew this pretty much for sure, they did not. This allowed me to judge their reactions about the scenario. Overall, from this alone, there's a picture of plotinus and shinobi. Plotinus came out with a slight town lean, while shinobi with a slight scum lean from that alone. Though Shinobi's posts interacting with zoro put him back in the null zone.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis was an awful lot of words to say 'Lapsa is null, it's too early to read him and I'm leaning town on Plotinus and null on Shinobi via interactions around vanilla crumb.'</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat's not all I said.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6963666#p6963666\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6963666#p6963666\" data-post-id=\"6963666\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 443</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23899\">BlueBloodedToffee</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6954995#p6954995\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6954995#p6954995\" data-post-id=\"6954995\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 246</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24479\">abuse</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">snip, reads list</div></div></blockquote><br>\nThe timing of this reads list is icky.

I had yet to sort you. So that was my main priority. I was trying to figure out WHY you were not really scumhunting, and also trying to figure out WHY you moved me from the obvtown pile (you said obvtown frogger would be easy to spot, and then you said I am town (70 lean, 160 confident)) then suddenly in to the scum pile, with no middle ground. That simply didn't make sense.<br>\n<br>\n-- Because of this push, I have found you are looking at my motivation for acting the way I am. You're wrong about my motivation (I'm not scum cozying up to you), but at least you've shown you're looking at my motivation. Unfortunately, you can only see your perspective here for my motivation instead of a holistic game state approach.<br>\n<br>\n-- By the way, my post 98 said I planned to sort you by your motivations and emotions. I have done that.<br>\n<br>\n2. I'm trying to figure out why you haven't obtowned YOURSELF yet. Are you scum? Are you a PR trying to move a NK away from yourself? Are you a VT who just hasn't scumhunted enough? I'm not sure, but based off you actually trying to understand my motivaiton, you've actually convinced me, for now, that you're town. This is good, because it helps narrow the scumpool I need to find.<br>\n<br>\n3. You are a large patterns guy. I don't think I need to put 2+2 together for you (I can't, and I shouldn't).

Verbose and cryptic, but he's trying to learn a middle ground (from his GTKAS in his sig). I prefer verbose Plotinus myself, even if it leads to some walls to read. Plotinus is most definitely a newbie, and will make some mistakes, but mistakes don't mean he's scum. For example, the game I observed he forgot to count the RVS votes and accidentally derphammered someone, and got painted super suspicious/scummy for it. I can't say how he plays scum, because I've never seen him play scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">My intent is to read into Plotinus' emotions/motivation to see if what he does is towny or scummy.

Ignore the GTKAS part which is mostly irrelevant. And the wallposter part which is obvious (and not alignment indicative). It&#8217;s interesting what he points out about the exotic birds game. What he says is true, but it&#8217;s not the whole story. I had a terrible day 1 in that game (including derphammering the other power role just out of RVS) then I took a lot of pressure for it on day 2, which I spent deathtunnelling a townie over his smiley usage (seriously), but by day 3 (LYLO) I was universally townread and considered part of the town voting bloc. The day 3 part of the story is important and I&#8217;m not sure why Fro99er left it out. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, the bit about being able to read my emotions also really pinged me because I don&#8217;t think Fro99er has had nearly enough experience with me to recognise my emotions and figure out what that means for my alignment. Like, I do sort of know what he was referring to there (a very brief PM conversation we had back before we had any ongoing games with each other) but I was being so extremely vague in that conversation that he could very easily overgeneralise what he thinks he knows about me and he has since started doing just that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: 99</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6950469#p6950469\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6950469#p6950469\" data-post-id=\"6950469\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 99</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6950300#p6950300\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6950300#p6950300\" data-post-id=\"6950300\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 65</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23594\">Shinobi</a> wrote:</cite>I agree with the Plotinus votes as of right now.

I&#8217;ve also since come around about Lapsa because he&#8217;s started contributing now but you&#8217;ve been weird about Lapsa since the beginning and it makes me wonder if you know something about his alignment that I don&#8217;t, for example your wishywashy reaction about how Lapsa looked super scummy and you agreed with my naked vote but at the same time I was being scummy for doing it and then suddenly  you were absolutely certain he was just too scummy to be scum or whatever.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: 280</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955816#p6955816\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955816#p6955816\" data-post-id=\"6955816\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 280</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955487#p6955487\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955487#p6955487\" data-post-id=\"6955487\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 257</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23594\">Shinobi</a> wrote:</cite>@Mathdino:  My issue with Plotinus stemmed from the fact that he was talking about Lapsa's breadcrumb in regards to who would/wouldn't breadcrumb in that situation.  The issue wasn't the breadcrumb itself, it was how he handled his scumread - he stated that he found that both factions could try to breadcrumb VT (Sure, I guess?  Still a mediocre reason.) but then ran with the possibility that Lapsa was scum because of his breadcrumb instead of engaging him and trying to figure him out.  Afaik plot hasn't done anything to try to engage Lapsa and the few recent posts (read: only one) he has regarding him indicate that he doesn't really care about his top scumread at all.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is a really good post by Shinobi.

I&#8217;m getting better at figuring out when to use my out loud voice but you saw me being accused of rolefishing by BBT on page 1 of exotic birds for asking if everyone got the role they wanted (I thought I was alignment fishing at the time), and I learned not to do that. And then in the Zar show which you skimmed I was talking about cop crumbs as town which is a lot worse than talking about VT crumbs, and I learned from that experience too. And then here I pointed it out because I thought what he was doing was scummy or antitown at best (in large part because of what Zar said in the end game of the Zar show).

He doesn't state WHY he thinks CB is Lynchhunting instead of scumhunting (examples or explanation would be nice), and feels like CB is going for low hanging fruit. Who is low hanging fruit here? He hasn't since interacted with CB, when I'd expect Plot would want to push a scumread, no? He's also hardly pushed on Lapsa since the fruit crumb other than post 252 calling Lapsa out for reading comprehension.

I think Plot had a good point; CB's opener was just a  temperature-of-thread survey of people that have had suspicion voiced on them. Other than abuse, it looked like he was just scattergunning into my town reads. I don't think there's a reasonable chance he's scum with Thor though, so if CB flips scum Thor is probably clear.

It&#8217;s not alignment indicative. i think i have been playing more like i did in elemental mafia (was hanging back there a lot) and I think it&#8217;s because that was one of the last games I started.

This game, I&#8217;m behind on my private notes (except for fro99er&#8217;s).<br>\n<br>\ni&#8217;m having trouble telling certain slots apart. For example, Shinobi and Chthulu are both coloured the same way in my head which is weird because the colours are usually at least partially avatar based and green and purple aren&#8217;t that close to each other, so I need to figure out if that means something or if it&#8217;s just more noise to sift through.<br>\n<br>\nOr I need to catchup on my notes because I felt like peoples reads were dividing into roughly two camps and like if I could sort everyone based on stances they&#8217;ve taken (including refusal to take a stance) on the various major events so far there might be something in there. <br>\n<br>\nEverything is getting under my skin today/yesterday. offline, too. probably tomorrow too and maybe the next day will suck, then i&#8217;ll be less jumpy. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6966915#p6966915\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6966915#p6966915\" data-post-id=\"6966915\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 536</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23899\">BlueBloodedToffee</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6963105#p6963105\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6963105#p6963105\" data-post-id=\"6963105\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 439</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25516\">Plotinus</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nprobably town: abuse<br>\nmaybe town: toolenduso, lapsa, math<br>\ncould be town: chthulu, zoronos, thor, shinobi<br>\ncould be scum: bbt, texcat, <br>\nmaybe scum:<br>\nscum: cb, fro99er</div></blockquote><br>\nPlot, can you explain the town reads on Abuse, Tool &amp; Lapsa.<br>\n<br>\nYour reads are near enough the polar opposite of mine and that is a worrying sign indeed.</div></blockquote><br>\nI didn&#8217;t like abuse for a while at the start and i think i need to reread him when i&#8217;m not tunnelling fro99er but i liked some of his later stuff. meh, skimming it now i&#8217;m less sure about his push on fro99er than i was when i wrote that. move him down a notch then. <br>\n<br>\nI liked lapsa&#8217;s coloured numbers thing, how he quoted people and pointed to things that didn&#8217;t match up. i didn&#8217;t like his earlier posting but i like that he&#8217;s trying to contribute and making original points. part of the townread is rewarding him for contributing and scum hunting. <br>\n<br>\ntool seems to approach the game a lot like I do, kind off in a corner rearranging shapes in his head until things start to make sense and that&#8217;s probably not alignment indicative but it looks so familiar to me that it&#8217;s hard not to appreciate it. he also seems to be scumhunting.

So I've been wondering which to vote. And ultimately I think what tips the balance is the Lapsa and math wagons. The Lapsa wagon just seems like such juicy fruit for scum to latch onto (assuming Lapsa is town ofc). So Math and Frogger were both on it. But then this Math wagon comes along, and frogger's on that one too.

The question itself looks kinda towny because it looks like scumhunting, but aside from that there's the way he goes about it. He doesn't go and look it up for himself and then call plot out for it or something. Which is I think what I would want to do as scum, go into the situation armed with info that other people don't have and then make the person look like they're lying. But nah, he just asks him about it. Just seems genuine is all.<br>\n-His response to me in #155 also seems genuine. Like as scum I would think he would want to try to look like he was scumhunting more, but here he admits that he's fallen behind a bit and is skimming and instead of just jumping on the people he's been feeling out (plot, shinobi), he goes oh yeah they're fine. Have to look somewhere else. It looks like the meandering path of a person who doesn't have inside information.<br>\n-And then he lets go of it in #244 without revoting.

You admit as such. \"He has called you wrong on multiple occasions as to his Frogger case opinions \" That looks like my interpretation of events is different from Dino's, huh.

So yeah, I interpreted the events around Dino's case on Frogger differently than Dino did. Since I am not Dino, I am not at all surprised that this is the case. (more on this later)<br>\n2) Faced with data changing his mind - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950048#p6950048\">57</a> / <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950064#p6950064\">58</a> about Frogger. Frogger posted towny, he changed his mind. He changed his mind about Abuse as well.<br>\n3) Scum hunting under pressure - Cthulu put him at L-2 in 284. He's casing Texcat in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961224#p6961224\">389</a> and pushing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961908#p6961908\">406</a>. Yup, scum hunting under pressure.<br>\n<br>\nSo much for 'provably incorrect'.<br>\n<br>\nUnderlined stuff<br>\n1) Attempting to scum hunt early - He was pushing and talking to people and developing reads by page 2 / 3. I liked his push on Texcat. Tex's statement about not trusting people that claim to be able to read each other struck me as off, so I was glad he had pushed it. Given that I thought Frogger and Plot were both towny, that looked like it might scum undermining a town correctly reading another town and was worth being pushed.<br>\n2) Cooperation with town reads - I've felt he's worked with me and we've had productive discussion. He attempted to work with Abuse (who he was town reading) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956275#p6956275\">313</a>.<br>\n<br>\nAnd there goes 'don't really appear to be true'.<br>\n<br>\nThings actually in your post:<br>\n1) He 'dropped' (and by dropped, he mentions it again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6951968#p6951968\">158</a>, so not really dropped) Texcat to pressure a player that wasn't participating, but also made it clear that his scum read at the time was on Abuse, and why it was on Abuse. It's in the same post where he voted Lapsa (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950417#p6950417\">90</a> and he reiterates in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950613#p6950613\">122</a>). Also, I didn't say 'scumhunting instead of defending'. So don't act like that's a quote (especially when you quoted what I actually said). I said 'continued to try to scum hunt rather than just playing pure defense'. Both activities occurred. Your fake-quote makes it seem like I said only one did. Don't twist my words please.<br>\n<br>\n2) It wasn't 'really oddly wrong', or 'jumping the gun'. My exact words were \"No, it wasn't scummy, it was just dumb. Well, maybe a little scummy, but not *that* scummy.\" It was a little scummy. Because it was a meta case on page 2. It definitely wasn't 'really oddly wrong' or 'jumping the gun'. So, no, I never agreed to that. You're misrepresenting what I've said.<br>\n<br>\n3) I didn't claim his push on Lapsa was scumhunting; those were clearly pressure votes to get someone who wasn't contributing to contribute. His pushes on Tex and Abuse have been. <br>\n(If you are suggesting there was 'pressure' on him when he policy voted Lapsa, he had 2 votes at the time. Lots of pressure. He was also actively questioning Abuse at the time, which would be... wait for it... scum hunting)<br>\n<br>\n4) I see no reason for his clarifications on his frogger case to change my mind. I thought he changed his mind by having another player show how he was incorrect. He claims he changed his own mind based on seeing a pair of posts from frogger. Those are roughly equivalent statements, and the difference between them doesn't bother me. The other disagreement was that I thought it was a meta case, he thought it was a non-meta-case, but he checked up on the meta anyway to c/d. (*cough* which makes it a meta case *cough*). Whatever. Effectively equivalent statements. <br>\n<br>\nYeah, so, you're pretty 'far off in understanding', or are just misrepresenting me pretty clearly.", "time": "Thu Jun 18, 2015 7:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

Provably wrong *is* provably wrong when your 'interpretation' is 'he claimed he was wrong about this' and his reply is 'I am not claiming that, and do not believe I was wrong'.

Okay, so now your backing is that you felt he worked with you, and also questioned textcat. Yeah...I don't really see that as a history of either cooperation nor scumhunting, and if it is then it applies to basically everyone in this game *including* Lapsa.<br>\n<br>\n1. The drop I'm talking about is Frogger, not textcat. I've never claimed an issue with his textcat push - so I'm not sure why you think I'd do so now.<br>\n<br>\n2. You say dumb, I say intentional and thus scummy. In either case - you are aware that something is wrong about the case, even if it was simply 'dumb'. Oh...and your exact words even admitted it was possibly a little scummy, and that if he had kept pressing it you would have been on him. SO I really have no idea what you think you're disagreeing with me on here, or how I'm misrepresenting you. You flat out called it a little scummy and potentially worthy of being attacked if he hadn't stopped (or if he started it up again, even).<br>\n<br>\n3. Okay, so we're down to at least 50% of his votes being dumb or not scumhunting. I'm also not really sold on the Abuse or Text pushes, but I guess if they're impressive to you I can't claim they're not impressive to you. They're not impressive to me.<br>\n<br>\n4.

The collapse of the Math wagon was very strange and happened pretty quickly with nobody actually stating they think Math could be town. They all just moved onto new suspects.<br>\n<br>\nI unvoted and you unvoted. That moved Math to L-4 and very clearly puts the wagon on the decline, whether one person was possibly joining it or not. This forces scum to make a move, especially as you were the one doing all the leg work on the Math wagon. You're good enough as scum to do this, your buddies may not be. Once your push on the Math wagon is gone, who else is pushing it? Lapsa? Hardly.<br>\n<br>\nYou don't seem to have a problem with Lapsa sheeping you. May I ask why? Especially as you don't seem to have a read on him. Why are you not interacting with him to develop a read?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6969262#p6969262\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6969262#p6969262\" data-post-id=\"6969262\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 572</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12326\">Thor665</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nWhy not?

That's because apparently fencesitting all over the place like I used to do is bad play. So I go after people. But not all my pushes are good and I absolutely despise tunneling. Intent is to see the entire game as a big picture, and as such I take a few moments every now and then to reevaluate the entire game to make SURE I'm not tunneling.

Because I'm not going to be right from the beginning, I'm going to delude myself into a few bullshit pushes just to get my bearings. And then the ball gets rolling and I change my mind. Right now I really like a texcat push because this Plotinus wagon? It's certainly bullshit. And I'm surprised barely anyone's even commented on the texcat thing in the past, what, 8 pages? So I need to reread. Reevaluate.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr: Fuck everyone who thinks I should be lynched for being bad at scumhunting off the bat.<br>\n<br>\nAnd hell, Thor, from my standpoint 100% of your votes are dumb or not scumhunting. Zor (prior to this clusterfuck of a last 8 pages) is my top townread, and BBT is correct that you're focusing on literally no one else. I said I have no interest in lynching you because I think you're a good player and I want to work with you, but so far in my eyes you're doing NOTHING helpful to find scum. And on the flip side I haven't seen you reevaluate once. This isn't me trying to be all \"oh ho ho, maybe everyone voting me is scum\" and cast suspicion wildly. This is me speaking to you as a player, do you actually have no other reads that I can work with? And if so please link me to them because I may just have read right over them.<br>\n<br>\nAddendum: Not sure if this helps or not but I haven't mentioned this because I thought it'd be weird/awkward. First thing I did before I posted was look at Thor's wiki. And the only thing I remember from it was to ALWAYS be using your vote for something. And that's been in the back of my mind this game and has influenced specifically my playstyle this game, and that's why I was talking about voting Lapsa because that's where I felt my vote was best served. So first thing I'm probably gonna do in post-game is ask everyone who's played more than I have, \"WTF did I do wrong this time?\" Unless you're scum, in which case, you know, respect for casing me and all that shit.<br>\n<br>\nWhatever.

There is probably some bias from agreement, since I think CB is scummy and he also thinks so.<br>\n<br>\nPlot - I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949918#p6949918\">48</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949961#p6949961\">53</a> felt reasonable. I thought Texcat's question to him was unnecessarily pejorative, and that was a good response to it; he doesn't feel the pressure to make up an early read when he doesn't have one yet.<br>\nI like his push on CB in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6952023#p6952023\">160</a>. His followup thought in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956136#p6956136\">299</a> echoed my initial impression of CB's post (the part about CB's post looking like a surface skim of 'people that have had suspicion voiced'). <br>\nThe general vibe I get from him is that he's a newbie that makes a lot of communication mistakes. He's trying to use 'mafia words' without necessarily understanding them, especially in his later posts. His fight with Frogger seems to be just rife with them.<br>\nHe's seems to have a set of 'scumtells' that he knows exist and it looks like he's trying to apply them, but is doing so very inexpertly. Though not necessarily scummily, if that makes sense. I don't get the impression he's trying to actively push mislynches, even though I disagree with some of his reads.<br>\n<br>\nI did miss something in 160 though on first read through. \"I&#8217;m not really sure why you voted me at the end of it, because the parts directed at me didn&#8217;t seem stronger than the parts directed at anyone else. (huh, mathdino counted 6. now i&#8217;m wondering who i missed)\" &lt;- \"Why Me?\".

But he hasn't done that yet.<br>\n<br>\nSo, what is the point of the 'narrative' here then? How is it scummy? What scum agenda is he pushing? Like, scum don't just lie for the luls.

{"number": 675, "id": "6977160", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "Thoughts upon catching up from page 23:<br>\n<br>\n-I'll admit I'm not parsing through each and every thing in the Thor-Zoronos back and forth. Like I'm not clicking on links and thinking deeply about who's right about the various things people have said. I kind of feel like that's beside the point because I think the fact that they're arguing and the way they're arguing is more important than that. One gut feeling I have is that Thor is kind of pushing Zoronos to get him to look worse. As opposed to, like, feeling out whether he's scum. It reminds me a bit of the first game I played on the site after a long hiatus (Mini 1505) where Thor was scum and got in this big fight with Slandaar, who was town. But I don't really want to rely on meta here because I believe Thor is kind of known for having tricky meta. So what I want to do instead is go back and look at some of this back and forth, really look at it in isolation to look more for Thor's and Zoronos's motivations.<br>\n-BBT is really reminding of the town game I played with him. And the way he's interacting with Thor again looks like town to me. Like he's just responding very naturally to Thor's questions, I see a person who trusts themselves and distrusts others. And the questions appear to come from a place of lacking knowledge, in the sense that they take a step-by-step logical progression based on no information other than the answers to the questions.<br>\n-Not a fan of Shinobi's #582/584 where he says he's reading the BBT and Thor back and forth but he dismisses it as TvT. #587 is where he explains it, saying the points are reasonable but pedantic. Which just kind of seems like a surface-level thing and therefore sits at an odd angle to his unsolicited interjection that he is, indeed, reading it all.<br>\n-My immediate reaction to Math's #589 is that it makes me feel more comfortable with his slot because it kind of clears up question marks I had about town explanations for his voting and posting. But I can fall for stuff that I later find fault with so I'll let it sit for a bit.<br>\n-I think CB's reasoning for voting abuse in #601 is pretty unconvincing. I actually find those two posts to be pretty consistent. The other two posts he mentioned are also things I do not think necessarily point to scum.<br>\n-At this point Shinobi's posting also seems very sideline-y.<br>\n-Did not realize Lapsa was ESL. That explains a lot actually. I think I need to reevaluate that slot with this in mind.<br>\n-I don't agree with the way BBT is characterizing Thor's \"lack of engagement\" with other players. He is engaging with people. But I share a view that's...adjacent, I guess would be the word. I think Thor is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">focusing</div> on a few people to the extent of looking like he feels very confident in those players being scum. I guess whether it appears that that confidence is justified or looks like it's a pre-determined conclusion is how I will look at Thor's slot when I get around to devoting some time to it.<br>\n-I guess plotinus's acceptance and self-analysis of using a collection of standard-ish MS tells/phrases makes me feel more like he's town. Because I feel like that would be something to be self-conscious of as scum and I feel like he might try to deny something like that.", "time": "Mon Jun 22, 2015 3:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

Tex's 52 was after Plot's statement about reading Frogger. In it, Tex says \"That's the 2nd time you've mentioned your ability to read Frogger.\" Plot volunteered the ability to read Frogger, *then afterwards* people questioned it. That seems like \"without prompting\" (to use my language) to me. Plot's declaration happened, then Texcat's post. You can't prompt from the future. <br>\nThat post from Tex was also pejorative about Plot saying they could read Frogger (The \"What's up with that?\" language). Check <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6950216#p6950216\">63</a> where Texcat again expresses skepticism about declarations from one player that they can read another.<br>\n<br>\nSo, yeah, you're wrong about order of events which means you're calling my post untrue incorrectly or you're mischaracterizing that post.<br>\nWhy you mischaracterizing my posts Bella?

Then Frogger actually follows up on it and goes to investigate when Lapsa's last posting was, using that as justification for unvoting Lapsa later.

The trouble is, Math is not refuting <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> claim from Zor. Math is refuting the claim that Math unvoted Frog <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because of people's disagreement with Math's case on Frog</div>, not <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because Zor was wrong about Math admitting that the meta was bad.</div> Now onto the point of whether Math actually admitted the meta was bad. Zor gives #57 as evidence...I see no evidence to back up Zor's claim. Does that make Zor scum? Let's talk about that in this next point.<br>\n-Thor says Zor is not reading the game because he's said something about Math that Math has refuted: I don't think you can call someone scummy for not reading the game. Town do this...all the time. Tex has openly admitted to doing the same and Thor has openly admitted to not having any thoughts on Tex, so.<br>\n-Thor says Zor is too confident for townreading Math: Does Zor's confidence in Math based on the assertion that Math admitted to being wrong fall for lack of evidence? Yes. Does Zor give other, less fallible evidence for townreading Math? Yes (see: #144). Do I agree with this evidence? No. Does that make Zor look scummy? Meh.<br>\n-Thor says Zor tries to move on from the debate by dismissing it as \"different interpretations\": After a certain point, it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> different interpretations. Like, you continued to push Zor saying that Math admitted to being wrong, and Zor said \"OK, but regardless of whether Math said that I think he looks town for agreeing that Frog looked towny and moving on.\" This <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> be scum trying to escape pressure, sure, but I see no reason to think that over town trying to defend themselves against a mislynch/moving on from a protracted argument about the same ol' shit.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: What I think of Zor based on the back and forth</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Zor's interaction with Thor based on this whole thing does not lead me to believe he's scum.

His rebuttals to Thor's case don't strike me as being weird. Does he possibly misinterpret some shit? Yeah. Does he forget stuff and openly admit to skimming certain things? Yep. Does that make him scummy? Maybe if that supported some larger scummy thing he's doing I guess....I don't really see it...<br>\n-Zor's reasoning for thinking Math is town is a little thin, yes. He says he thinks Math is town for agreeing that Frog was scum and for then moving on. Which gives more deference, too easily I think, to the town explanation over the scum explanation (the scum explanation being that Math got uncomfortable with the pressure based on Frog's vote and therefore switched away to dial down the pressure). He also doesn't seem to see what's wrong with Math's vote on texcat, which I thought was weird too. Now the question is, why does Zor not see these things? Is it because he's scum who either doesn't want to (because Math is a partner, perhaps) or because he has no genuine reason to be more paranoid about Math? Maybe. Or maybe, like most people in this fast-paced game, he's handling the volume of activity by dialing down his efforts on some players and ramping it up on others. Or maybe he just sees the game differently.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: What I think of Thor based on the back and forth</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-The building up of this feels natural just based on the progression (Thor pushes math -&gt; Zor defends Math -&gt; Thor argues with Zor -&gt; Thor votes Zor).

He calls out Zor for his thought that Math doesn't look scummy now that he's dropped scummy reasoning. Which makes sense, logically to me. Like, person was scummy -&gt; person stopped being scummy -&gt; person is no longer scummy. But Thor acts like it's super weird and calls it unnatural. And this is something Thor has essentially pushed Zoronos into saying through questioning. Either scumThor pushed Zoronos until he said something he thought he could capitalize on, then used it to start building a case against Zor, or townThor was pushing for a Math lynch and through his pushing found somebody he thought looked worse. The reasoning for calling Zor's defense \"unnatural\" in this post is what tips the scale toward the scum explanation for me.<br>\n-#533 is, I think, the point that makes the foundation of Thor's case: that Zor is defending Math based on something that Thor says is not true, and that Thor says Math has pointed out as not being true. Which is, like...a misunderstanding, IMO. It just feels like thin reasoning and I don't understand why it's enough for Thor to change his vote, especially when he's still scumreading Math.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Another note on Thor from going through his ISO</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Thor does do a lot of cluttering that looks at lest semi-unjustified.

In response to BBT saying that Thor hasn't engaged with other players, Thor goes back through his ISO and compiles a list of his interactions with every single player in the game. Perhaps more to my point, he tends to respond to everything, or at least most things a person says about him, in any given post. It's just a lot of effort that leads to a lot of posts that are lengthy relative to other players' posts. I remember this being something Thor did in Mini 1505 (where he was scum) and it makes sense as a scum strategy because it allows him to become this vortex of argument in the game. It allows him to direct the flow of conversation, to the extent that one player can. And as we see with his switch to Zoronos, it also gives him ample opportunity to push cases on other players.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nVerdict: Zor is a little scummy.

Your commentary about the \"logic\" of person was scummy -&gt; person stopped being scummy -&gt; person is no longer scummy bewilders me.<br>\n<br>\nFirstly - that isn't what Zor is claiming. (he is claiming logic was scummy, logic was stopped, but if logic came back it would, again, be scummy)<br>\nSecondly - let's even say I'm wrong and that's exactly what Zor is saying; I don't think it makes sense by your logic either unless your argument is that scumminess is a scale, and that every non-scum action moves one towards a town read. You know this isn't true because you admit that though some things I do \"look logical\" they are within my ability to do as scum. So you admit that non-scummy actions fail to justify me not being scummy. So, if you can do that, and I can do that - why is it so strange to accept that I don't believe other people *don't* do that and that it's strange if they claim they do?

It's your lack of engagement with the entire player base. The 'scum plan' is you attract less attention from people as a whole when you're pushing a single case against one person and don't do much else.

I decided that it does not. The reason I was townreading Lapsa was because of his refusal to try to look town. That doesn't change just because Lapsa might have a harder time with the language, it's still clearly true).<br>\n-Upon further review...yeah, Zor's reasoning on Math is well within the bounds of town who just see the game differently than I do. I don't agree with his assessment of Math's jump on and off frogger, but there's nothing about the actual way that he states it that makes him look scummy to me.<br>\n-That being said, he parked his vote on abuse for a while and then ignored abuse and didn't engage with him or ask other players about him.<br>\n-He does bring it back around though, with an \"interrogation\" and then vote on CD.<br>\n-The reasoning for keeping his vote on the CD slot after Bella replaced in/not voting Thor in #777 also makes sense to me.<br>\n-My gut says Zor leans town and I'm pretty sure that comes from what looks like a genuine arc of developing reads in the game and paying attention to other peoples' cases.

His case was interesting since he jumped directly to the motivation level instead of directly going after Frogger's points. But I think that's specifcally where his case falls down.

The main thing I can tell you, is that pretty much everything he does right now is null. Everything you think he is saying that seems scummy, is null, everything he says that seems townie, is also null. Things he says are quite likely lies, but could be truth aswell, In any case - there is no way to know <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">yet.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe reason I poked plotinus, about him voting for lapsa was to see if he was newbish or scum. Because his vote was fishy.<br>\nI know Lapsa, many people here do not. My conversation with him was to find out. His defense of the lapsa vote was that neither vanillas nor mafia benefit from a claim such as that. That is correct- i pointed that there is another role that would benefit from it. He understood what I talked about, that should've been it.<br>\nThe interesting part though, is that shinobi intervened, and followed up trying to get me to say what exactly do I mean by that. I honestly think that what I said was obvious. Getting me to say it out loud, can be classified as both PR hunting, or trapping me for pointing to PR's instead of scum.<br>\nThe only thing is - again - I know how Lapsa plays, so basically I can tell you with 99.9% certainty, that that was not a crumb at all. I knew this pretty much for sure, they did not. This allowed me to judge their reactions about the scenario. Overall, from this alone, there's a picture of plotinus and shinobi. Plotinus came out with a slight town lean, while shinobi with a slight scum lean from that alone. Though Shinobi's posts interacting with zoro put him back in the null zone.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis was an awful lot of words to say 'Lapsa is null, it's too early to read him and I'm leaning town on Plotinus and null on Shinobi via interactions around vanilla crumb.'<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6954995#p6954995\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6954995#p6954995\" data-post-id=\"6954995\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 246</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24479\">abuse</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">snip, reads list</div></div></blockquote><br>\nThe timing of this reads list is icky.

I disagree that this means much, but I suppose it was OK as a starting point. People do have moods IRL, and those can come through in the posting. My entrance to this thread was more lighthearted than usual. It happens. Town points to Thor for arguing against it. Also interesting point by Plotinus in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949825#p6949825\">31</a>. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Frogger, have you played scum yet? If so, please link the game.</div><br>\n<br>\n- tool's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949846#p6949846\">34</a> struck me as awkward. Why is he concerned about appearing scummy so early in the game? frogger has a good answer - \"Yours. Feels sheeped and unoriginal. But I understand wanting an early wagon, so I really don't read it as too scummy right now.\" As I said above, \"OK as a starting point.\" Starting to get warm and fuzzy about frogger already, and that's a good thing, because he's an excellent analyst. <br>\n<br>\n- texcat votes tool in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949861#p6949861\">37</a>, which I note because tool is now the main wagon. Valid observations and reasons for the vote.<br>\n<br>\n- <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949908#p6949908\">46</a> is another example of tool being overly concerned with himself, which is scummy. However, I may be engaging in confbias since he's the main wagon. <br>\n<br>\n- Don't like Plotinus in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949918#p6949918\">48</a>. It's just a repeat of his previous point on frogger and seems really forced. Is he trying to plant suspicion on frogger? texcat says the same thing a few posts later. texcat doesn't make a lot of posts, but makes good observations.<br>\n<br>\n- Lapsa in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6949983#p6949983\">56</a> - wtf? Is this a joke or serious? Also, frogger, interesting note that if scum have access to their thread pre-game, it might be to their advantage if they delay the start. OTOH, they'd have to be an unusually organized group to take advantage of it, and mod can see who's active and probably takes that as a confirmation anyway.

A \"naked vote\" can reasonably be interpreted as an \"unexplained scumread.\" You don't vote someone because you think they're town. Either he's just not thinking things through, or is making a poor attempt to appear to be participating.

So many words and when I try to boil it down it&#8217;s a long tunnel on mathdino over &#8220;something about rvs&#8221; and a long tunnel on zoronos over &#8220;lacking expected amounts of town paranoia (sheeped from cb) + him defending mathdino&#8221;. And the argument with BBT is ridiculously nitpicky about what constitutes an interaction (though i think both of them are being nitpicky at the moment).<br>\n<br>\nBut what worries me more than that is that your reads are very static, with the possible exception of BBT. At times you seem to be scumleaning BBT and at other times you seem to be townleaning him. Also kind of frogger since you seemed to be townleaning him for the most part with just a few things you didn&#8217;t like from him (that didn&#8217;t otherwise affect your read). No matter who I look at, your interactions are either all positive sorts of interactions (townreading, sheeping, agreeing, defending, backing them up) or all negative sorts of interactions (attacking, tunnelling, wagon driving, etc.). <br>\n<br>\nOh, finally in post 886 his scumlean on tool turns into a town lean, pretty abruptly. so count that as a read that changed.<br>\nAnd then in 908 he says bella&#8217;s slot is slightly less scummy due to activitylevels but it doesn&#8217;t look like much of a change. <br>\n<br>\nOne of the main things I know how to look for is organically changing

This is one ISO I have not read all the way through but from what I can tell he gives literally no reason for unvoting Plot, and in fact appears to be criticizing plot's play pretty close to when he unvotes him. Shin's vote is on nobody for 150 posts and two days before he switches it to me.<br>\n-In #827 he says he would still wagon plot. Wtf.<br>\n-Votes me not long after Bella lists a secondary scum read on me (votes for plot instead though). His entire reasoning appears to be that I switched to a wagon that had Frogger on it. This is a super surface-level action to call scummy. He doesn't take into consideration the circumstances that more than adequately explain <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> I'm doing it, and then advocates for a fucking flashwagon based on this scumread he pulled out of fucking nowhere.<br>\n-Shin does not look good at all.<br>\n<br>\nFrog:<br>\n<br>\n-Frog's vote was on Thor since #565. He switched to me in #869.<br>\n-His flippant post in #871 could be Frogger again attempting to pre-empt suspicion by overplaying it.<br>\n-#873 and #876 are Frogger deflecting my questioning of him and turning it around to try to make me look worse. Frog later says he is actually making no attempt to defend himself from me. Not sure how that makes me feel about his alignment.<br>\n-Ffs...here's another place where Frogger contradicts himself. In #876 he's calling me out for being hypocritical, then he turns around and talks about how being hypocritical isn't a scumtell in #880. Four fucking posts later.<br>\n-#956 is Frogger handing out a townread to everybody willing to vote me. This is nonsensical.<br>\n-This is all par for the course frogger this game. His vote on me is bad, but looking at the whole wagon it does not look the worst to me. And it's hard to think Frog, playing the way we've seen him play this game, would actually sheep Shinobi if Shinobi was his partner.<br>\n<br>\nBella:<br>\n<br>\n-Vote was on Plot since #789. Votes for me in #911.<br>\n-Bella had me as a back-up scumread behind Plot ever since she did her catch-up posts, so it makes sense she would switch to me as deadline approached. That doesn't excuse her reasoning for me being scum, which is poor just like everybody else's, but it does give a town explanation for why she voted me.<br>\n-The reasoning Bella uses that does strike me as particularly suspicious is her point about my post #403, which Bella writes about in her post #786. She calls the list of people I wanted to look into \"really weird if I want to progress the game.\" This very much feels like Bella was looking for something to scumread me for. Like why does it have to do with anything? Is she saying I should only pay attention to the most active players? Is she not considering the numerous possibilities for why this might come from town, or the obvious null explanation of \"he wants to get a better idea of how individual players are playing\"?<br>\n-Kind of a wash on this one.<br>\n<br>\nPers:<br>\n<br>\n-Votes and unvotes me right off the bat. Not really sure of the reasoning behind it and not sure if he knew that he was putting me at L-2.<br>\n-As I've already said, he appears to be going through my ISO with the predetermined conclusion that I'm scum. Very much something town or scum can do.<br>\n-I think one conclusion to draw from this is that it's unlikely that scumPers would join this wagon right off the bat if he had a partner on the wagon. I suppose it seems like a towny who doesn't have scummy caution, but I feel like that could easily be non-alignment-indicative based on Pers's playstyle.<br>\n<br>\nPeople off my flashwagon:<br>\n<br>\nCB:<br>\n<br>\n-Seemed to think I was towny early in the game, then later criticized my play.<br>\n-His only reaction to the flashwagon against me was \"Why are people scumreading tool?\" in #958. Not much to go on.<br>\n<br>\nThor:<br>\n<br>\n-Explicitly did not offer a read on me for a long time. See #613.<br>\n-The way that he wanted me to comment on the Zor wagon, and was working pretty hard to try to get me to see his arguments, would suggest to me that he approached my slot at that point as though he saw me as town.<br>\n-First time he explicitly calls me town is in #886, which is directly in response to the flashwagon on me. He is also specifically saying he gets a townvibe from my post #883.<br>\n-I'm conflicted on this. On the one hand, this is the second scum-counterintuitive thing Thor has done. He unvoted Math when that wagon was going strong in favor of starting a new wagon on Zor, and then despite having no stated read on me and having argued in walls with me for a while, he attacked the people on my wagon rather than joining it. On the other hand, I can think of a few explanations for Thor not joining my wagon. It could be that he figured Frog (in this scenario not a partner) would unvote if he joined my wagon. It could be that a partner was already on my wagon. Or maybe scumThor couldn't think of a legit reason to scumread me. I think Thor's strength as scum is that he works hard to develop reads in what looks like an organic way and tries to downplay any possible scum motivation like avoiding partners, pushing mislynches, etc. So I can see explanations either way for this.<br>\n-I suppose where that leaves me is that it does not do much to sway my earlier read on him.<br>\n<br>\nPlot:<br>\n<br>\n-Has me as maybe-town in #439.<br>\n-Continues to townread me, often for following a similar thought pattern as him, throughout his ISO.<br>\n-As far as I can tell, Plot never actually addresses the flashwagon on me. Which is, by itself suspicious...except that I townread plot for unrelated reasons.<br>\n<br>\nBBT:<br>\n<br>\n-Unfortunately the short version of my username (which is the most common way people refer to me) is also a word in BBT's signature, which makes it very hard for me to find myself in his ISO. Old-fashioned way it is!<br>\n-BBT is suspicious of me to start off with, pretty much for the same early-game reasons everyone else who's suspicious of me has used. #442 is a nice summary.<br>\n-Begins to ask me questions about my case, and basically realizes that I'm town when I show that I have a legitimate thought process behind it, even if he doesn't agree. I try to look at interactions with my own slot objectively, and this is a somewhat town maneuver. It certainly wouldn't have been controversial to push me at the time, and BBT already had stated suspicion of me.<br>\n-The predominant feature of BBT's interaction with my flashwagon is annoyance that it's distracting from the Thor wagon. By the time the flashwagon had begun, BBT had pretty much decided that I look town and was putting all his efforts into building the Thor wagon. Which is dead-on exactly the way he played the last time we were in a game together, when we were both town. Besides, I don't see a way to argue that that arc is improbable for town. So.<br>\n<br>\nLapsa:<br>\n<br>\n-Hard to say. In #828 I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">think</div> he's townreading me, for an early-game post I made.<br>\n-Then in #837 he says he'll scumread me if I vote Thor.<br>\n-Then I vote Thor, and in #1041 it seems like he's scumreading me?<br>\n-Has not voted me, however, and does not appear to have commented on the flashwagon on me. Then again, how often does Lapsa comment on any specific thing going on in the game? I feel like it's kind of a crapshoot. So I don't see any alignment-indicative stuff either way.<br>\n<br>\nZor:<br>\n<br>\n-The vast majority of Zor's mentions of me are basically in the same place BBT ended up on me: He leans town on me for my posting, but doesn't agree with my case. He questions texcat a little for her read on me, but that looks more like trying to develop a read on texcat than it does defending me. In #858 Zor says he's leaning town on me.<br>\n-The only thing that kind of looks like an interaction with my flashwagon from Zor is #1120, and it's only kind of an interaction with my flashwagon because it's addressed to Shin. Other than that his thoughts on my wagon are conspicuously absent.<br>\n-Which is suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Overall:</div> It would make sense to me for there to be two scum off the wagon and one on, especially given that there are more than two players not on the wagon who didn't have much to say about my flashwagon. I believe a couple of them were also in catch-up mode or not really around at the time of this. For instance, if abuse is scum then that would help explain why the wagon never got past L-2. The one-on, two-off theory fits in pretty well with the wagon building up to L-2 but never getting past that -- scum at that point would likely be worried about looking opportunistic for hopping on.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is just awesome because I feel like most people are townreading Shinobi too. Hey, maybe people will take this analysis seriously once I flip town.

Honestly I don't find Titus's case all that convincing purely because of the too scummy to be scum thing. The point about her wagon not crumbling after her claim doesn't hold water because plot counterclaimed like immediately. The actions just look too transparent, like he doesn't have any caution.<br>\n-Shinobi: Naked vote, sheeping, doesn't even really talk that much about Titus as the wagon progresses. Lol. Like half of his responses to Titus are him defending himself. Even #1478 feels weird. Like that kid who just started hanging out with a new group of kids at summer camp and he's trying to react to everything they show him because he doesn't know how else to act. Weird analogy but hopefully you see the point.<br>\n-Pers: Vote on Titus in #1384 does look kinda scummy. He's cautioning town about hopping on wagons as he hops on a wagon. It feels like he's trying to look like town.<br>\n-Bella: Has a couple of posts where she appears to be debating over whether or not to vote Titus. I feel very conflicted about this because it's what you would expect town to do. Note my choice of wording: it's what you would <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">expect</div> town to do. As in, if Bella were scum and were worried about jumping on the wagon so late, it makes sense that she would do this. On the other hand, I was also cautious about joining the Titus wagon. Fuck. I wish I could find something more definitive in this because I feel like it's an important arc to look at.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Off the wagon</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Thor: Was actually on the Titus wagon and unvoted. Something I could see experienced scum doing, given the momentum that wagon had. Makes sense from a town perspective too since Thor has/had a scumread on BBT and I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">think</div> he unvoted the Titus wagon because BBT got on it. Anyway, I feel like the claim will dictate his read better than his interaction with the Titus wagon anyway.<br>\n-Lapsa: I will be beyond shocked if Lapsa is scum this game. I'm not even going to explain it because I kind of feel like I shouldn't but Lapsa is town.<br>\n-Tex: Wasn't around at the time all of the Titus stuff went down and wasn't posting elsewhere on site, so. Not much to talk about here.<br>\n-Tere: Same as Tex except Tere was trying to catch up and couldn't keep up with the maelstrom that happened at the end of the day. Can't blame her, town or scum.<br>\n-Zor: Pretty much in the same boat with Zor that I'm in with Bella, but with the scale tipped toward suspicion on this one. I asked Zor about Titus before I hammered because I wanted people to be on the record to look at associatives after the flip. So Zor gives a response in #1466, and it's kind of wishy-washy stuff from going back through the Titus/abuse ISOs. And in earlier posts he had all this suspicion of the Titus/abuse slot as this whole clusterfuck at the end of the day was going on. So why not vote Titus? See, this is what I would expect scum to do: Not really commit fully because they're scared to jump on a wagon they know is on town. But then...yes, I was also hesitant about Titus. It's not really definitive just because it would make a lot of sense for scum to be off the wagon and just by sheer lack of being around that could have been Tere and/or Tex.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\ntl;dr -- Shinobi looked the worst.

{"number": 1908, "id": "7035086", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "OK well here's what I had typed up. I'm going to spoiler it since it seems like people weren't really considering lynching between investigative claims today anyway.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Thoughts</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">So I kind of feel like scum would go after the masons first? Especially since there's still some doubt floating around about the two investigative claims. So it's possible two scum factions go after the same target, and that would be nice for us because that's one less town killed at night, one more conftown the next day and (probably) two more investigation results -- though we would still have to sort out whether we trust them. If we mislynch today, assuming multiball, this scenario would leave us at 8:2:1. That means that if we mislynch the next day and scum get off two kills, we would be at 5:2:1 (however at this point we could have more investigation results, making the game much easier to win -- also, scum could kill scum again and that would be p cool). If we lynch correctly, we are either at 8:2 or 8:1:1. If it's 8:2, then we've eliminated the double kill each night, so a mislynch would bring town to 6:2, then another would bring town to 4:2 and that would be MyLo (and again, we'd hopefully be looking at some investigative results). If it's 8:1:1 and scum don't kill each other, a mislynch would bring town to 5:1:1, and another would bring town to 2:1:1 and then the remaining town would just be deciding which scum faction they want to win.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's the scenario where both scum factions hit town tonight (this is obviously assuming we don't eliminate one mafia faction today via lynch). If we've mislynched, that puts town at 7:2:1, and another mislynch/double NK would put us at 4:2:1. If we've lynched correctly and hit the smaller mafia faction, we're at 7:1:1, and another mislynch/double NK leaves us at 4:1:1.<br>\n<br>\nSo all of this is basically to add some background before trying to answer the question of \"should we consider lynching between investigative role claims today (Thor and Pers)?\" You'll notice that all of the above scenarios look a lot better for town -- even the scenarios where we mislynch -- if we have investigative results coming in. For instance, let's consider the absolute worst case scenario, where we lynch (non-investigative claim) town today and scum eliminate two town tonight (let's say the masons). We're at 7:2:1, but at that point the cops could have cut the list of possible scum down to three...of which three would have to be scum.<br>\n<br>\nThis is assuming both investigative role claims are town. So I guess what I'm saying is, if we were to lynch among investigative role claims, we could be preventing ourselves from solving the game pretty quickly.<br>\n<br>\nWhereas if one of them <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> scum and we leave them out of the lynch pool today, it lowers our chances of hitting scum among the remaining (non-investigative, non-mason claim) possibilities. But even in that case, we've still eliminated a possibility among that pool of question marks and we should have a chance to sort out the cop claims later.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the added benefit that if one of the cop claims is really scum, the other scum faction will be trying to eliminate them. So that's cool.<br>\n<br>\nTo add to Pers's assertion that scum would kill investigative claims first, that's even better reason not to lynch between Thor and Pers today.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl;dr</div> -- it makes sense to me that we exclude Thor and Pers from the lynch list today.<br>\n<br>\nSo, next I will be going through the ISOs of the remaining lynch options for today: Shin, RC, Bella and Zor.", "time": "Tue Jul 07, 2015 8:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

The cases have always read as white noise to me.  I don't see where he \"isn't scumhunting\" so I think that's kind of bosh too.  PLUS, his case on Bella mimicked a lot of what I thought about Bella.  I didn't put much stock into the associatives on him.<br>\n<br>\nBella - scum:  Zor's case is pretty much exactly how I felt about Bella's EoD yesterday, and I've already harped on it a bit myself.  I think his backtrack on me yesterday was extremely awkward and I don't really buy the fact that he was \"just joking,\" especially when he spent the majority of the day pushing me without ever voting me and only backed off when I yelled at him because \"loljokes,\" only to continue the push a second time when it was convenient (IE today).<br>\n<br>\nTool - null:  I felt like he flew under the radar a bit too much yesterday, which is not a great sign when most of the townreads on him rely on him putting forth effort; the only thing he came up with was a scumread on me which he basically stopped pushing entirely, only to come back and completely change his plan towards lynching BBT's partner (though the quickhammer might have had something to do with that and made it look worse than it was).  He's had a couple of posts I hated today (his aimless associative reads post and his whole bit on trying to advise the town on how to play mylo/lylo) so that's also something.<br>\n<br>\nThe issue I have with this read is that his whole persona relies on him being somewhat ineffectual: he complained about flashwagons earlier in the game for some reason, even though he put little effort into getting either of his preferred wagons lynched (which I still don't particularly understand the concept behind, but whatever I guess).<br>\n<br>\nLapsa - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">probably</div> town but I have a few doubts so I'm working that out as of right now.<br>\n<br>\nIt's likely Thor will be resolved by mafia but, either way, town.<br>\nMason claims are a stupid play for mafia to make, PLUS I think frogger is very town on his own for independent reasons so I'm fine with those two.<br>\ntexcat's posts are very town anyways - every time she posted I felt better, so that's okay.<br>\n<br>\nI'm aware that, if this is multiball, then I'm wrong somewhere but I don't know where that somewhere is.<br>\n<br>\nPedit:  Fine, whatever frog.", "time": "Thu Jul 09, 2015 11:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=2000", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

The basis of Bella's scum read is, quote, \"This is terrible, to replace in and resume a scum-read without a case. I could vote this.\" This is at the point where Teres / RC have 4 votes; Tex / Frogger / Shinobi / Thor.<br>\nIf RC is in Teres' slot, then RC has the same alignment as Teres. If the case was good on Shinobi up until this point, why does a slot she was reading as not-scum, voting a case she thinks is good, suddenly make that 'terrible'?  RC's PM didn't change. Shinobi didn't change. If the case on Shinobi is good (per her own words), why is it scummy for RC to continue that case? Shinobi, her previous scum read, was already on that train.<br>\n<br>\nThat's the soft-push. Bella's vote wasn't on RC, but 4 other votes were. (Frogger, Tex, Thor, Shinobi). It's opportunistic scum play. She turns on her town read, who is pushing the case that she agreed with a moment ago, for a non-alignment-indicating reason.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirstly, I hate how Zor decides I voted RC without bothering to check. This is prolly mylo and that kind of blase-ness is gross. It's not even that it's a mis-rep, it's just lazy and not town-motivated. It also allowed him to craft a narrative.<br>\n<br>\nOk, so all you've actually said here is that 1) I was scum-reading Shin (true, obviously). Tere's post about Frog really pinged my paranoia, seeing as we'd recently finished Frog's first scum-game, and I saw a lot of the same...confidence from him there, which made me unsure of my read on him. Claiming masons and knowing he's got his own private thread has clarified why I was getting the same sort of vibes. <br>\n<br>\n2) I was also unsure about Pers for a while, and I openly stated that maybe it was a play-style thing after he'd started to post some good 'sorting the game' posts. That lynch line is still pretty good - it was 4 un-claimed. Also, if I was scum, why would I advocate a list that could've got me lynched?<br>\n<br>\n3) I've talked about 1776. Thor's previous post amused me, I was joining in. <br>\n<br>\nI have no idea what the issue with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7031906#p7031906\">1793</a> is<br>\n<br>\n4) The RC thing. It looks like a knee-jerk reaction because it was.

You're also avoiding the importance of 1776. The point is that as of that post you were actively not scum reading Teres' slot.<br>\nThe 'issue' with 1793 is that you were clearly scum reading Shinobi. We're establishing your reads, based on your posting. Town read on Teres, scum read on Shinobi.<br>\n<br>\nYou were getting ready to vote a town read. \"I could vote this\". Your words. Your town read was getting lynched, and you never once argued against it. You argued *for* it. (1925 is irrelevant, since it's neither attempting to stall the wagon nor support it). RC was at L-2, with your scum read on the wagon. What do you do? Question the person being wagoned. Not the people wagoning your town read.<br>\nThe replacement, into the same slot, with the same read as you and their predecessor, was \"Terrible\" (again, your words).

Afaik plot hasn't done anything to try to engage Lapsa and the few recent posts (read: only one) he has regarding him indicate that he doesn't really care about his top scumread at all.</div></blockquote><br>\nSCUMHUNTING!<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955489#p6955489\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955489#p6955489\" data-post-id=\"6955489\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 258</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23594\">Shinobi</a> wrote:</cite>@abuse:  Have we played together before?  iirc we haven't but that might be an alt or something.</div></blockquote><br>\nNot scumhunting<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955494#p6955494\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955494#p6955494\" data-post-id=\"6955494\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 259</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23594\">Shinobi</a> wrote:</cite>*You might be on an alt.<br>\n<br>\n@Thor:  What feels fake about Zor's defense?</div></blockquote><br>\nNot scumhunting<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955746#p6955746\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955746#p6955746\" data-post-id=\"6955746\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 272</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23594\">Shinobi</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955546#p6955546\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955546#p6955546\" data-post-id=\"6955546\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 261</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24479\">abuse</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955489#p6955489\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955489#p6955489\" data-post-id=\"6955489\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 258</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23594\">Shinobi</a> wrote:</cite>@abuse:  Have we played together before?  iirc we haven't but that might be an alt or something.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWe haven't.

That gives Zor townpoints IMO, unless Lapsa flips scum but I still feel like Lapsa's town (I should elaborate on this actually, because I did think about whether Lapsa being ESL/EAL changed my read on him but I never posted it in-thread. I decided that it does not. The reason I was townreading Lapsa was because of his refusal to try to look town. That doesn't change just because Lapsa might have a harder time with the language, it's still clearly true).<br>\n-Upon further review...yeah, Zor's reasoning on Math is well within the bounds of town who just see the game differently than I do.

{"number": 2233, "id": "7053163", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "At a coffee shop with wifi right now. Looking back more into Plot's interactions post.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, a post that I find significant but not for interaction reasons: #311 is CD trying to push a scumslip on Math/Pers for assuming that there are three scum. CD specifically brings up the possibility of multiball. Very interesting...I could see this coming from scum who knew, or perhaps had guessed in a PT/QT pre-game with their partner that they were in multiball, and therefore thought that nobody should just expect there to be three scum. Idk. This almost seems too good to be true.<br>\n<br>\nNot going to do Shin/BBT because I've already looked into that one pretty well and I don't think it's likely they would be partners.<br>\n<br>\nBBT toward CD/Bella:<br>\n<br>\n-#446 is BBT criticizing CD for pretty easy reasons, reasons which he was not the only person to criticize.<br>\n-Other than that, there isn't a whole lot to look at here. That in itself could actually be significant.<br>\n<br>\nCD/Bella toward BBT:<br>\n<br>\n-CD only mentions BBT once and it's to say that he'd like some more content from BBT.<br>\n-Several of Bella's early posts involve her working with BBT on reading Zor....eh, she does this with everyone though.<br>\n-That, combined with her criticism of BBT's walling in #911, does create a vibe of genuine interactions with BBT.<br>\n<br>\nBBT toward Zor:<br>\n<br>\n-#196 stands out. BBT says Zor feels town because Zor talks about trying to get BBT into the game, but I don't remember BBT saying anything like this about Bella, though Bella did pretty much the exact same thing, maybe moreso.<br>\n-BBT does a lot of criticizing Thor for pushing Zor (the classic \"chainsaw defense\"), while interactions with Zor himself during this time mainly appear to be working with him on reads.<br>\n-A note based on the game I've played with BBT where he was town: BBT is actually philosophically opposed to giving clear reasons for why he townreads people. So looking at his vague reasoning for townreading Zor isn't a good piece of evidence imo.<br>\n<br>\nZor toward BBT:<br>\n<br>\n-Wow, there's really not a whole lot to note here. Zor works with BBT a little bit, some of which is at BBT's prompting. He disagrees with BBT about CB in a cordial way and leans on BBT among other players as evidence of other players seeing the same thing he did.<br>\n<br>\nA note on BBT: He fooled me pretty thoroughly in this game; I had him as one of my top townreads going into N1. Maybe my top townread. Part of this was meta that I perhaps should have researched more thoroughly, part of this was how genuine his posting felt and how convincing he was about Thor. So now knowing that he's quite good as scum, I will weight interactions from him directed at other players as having less importance than interactions from other players toward him.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing to note: Bella has been scumreading Zor since not long after she replaced in. Her vote on Shin, on the other hand, came after she seemed confused as to why people were voting him. Then she unvoted after I and other people started thinking about lynching BBT's partner specifically instead of just lynching scum. I see her Shin vote as more likely to be bussing, which would again point toward Zor being BBT's partner given other assumptions about the game I am making right now.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still comfortable with Zor as the most likely partner for BBT. BBT did some fairly transparently partner-y looking things with Zor, but scum who play genuine can very easily wind up doing this when they genuinely think their partner looks towny. TSO and I have won games together as scum mostly townreading each other. But then you have the other side, with Zor not really having a whole lot to say about BBT/toward BBT.<br>\n<br>\nNext up is getting to Zor's question to me a while back, I did see it but this has been my first opportunity to sit down with my laptop in a place with internet since leaving. Won't get to it today probably because I'm leaving the coffee shop now but that's next on the list.", "time": "Mon Jul 13, 2015 11:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=2225", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

Looking back more into Plot's interactions post.<br>\n<br>\n*snip*<br>\n<br>\nA note on BBT: He fooled me pretty thoroughly in this game; I had him as one of my top townreads going into N1. Maybe my top townread. Part of this was meta that I perhaps should have researched more thoroughly, part of this was how genuine his posting felt and how convincing he was about Thor. So now knowing that he's quite good as scum, I will weight interactions from him directed at other players as having less importance than interactions from other players toward him.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing to note: Bella has been scumreading Zor since not long after she replaced in. Her vote on Shin, on the other hand, came after she seemed confused as to why people were voting him. Then she unvoted after I and other people started thinking about lynching BBT's partner specifically instead of just lynching scum. I see her Shin vote as more likely to be bussing, which would again point toward Zor being BBT's partner given other assumptions about the game I am making right now.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still comfortable with Zor as the most likely partner for BBT. BBT did some fairly transparently partner-y looking things with Zor, but scum who play genuine can very easily wind up doing this when they genuinely think their partner looks towny. TSO and I have won games together as scum mostly townreading each other. But then you have the other side, with Zor not really having a whole lot to say about BBT/toward BBT.<br>\n<br>\nNext up is getting to Zor's question to me a while back, I did see it but this has been my first opportunity to sit down with my laptop in a place with internet since leaving. Won't get to it today probably because I'm leaving the coffee shop now but that's next on the list.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nDid you look at my initial readlists, where I had you, Shin and tex as total nulls, but Shin towards the bottom of this pile? Me wanting to lynch Shin didn't exactly come out of no-where. The vote also came after Shin had just spouted the same incorrect narrative about RC as Zor is now singing.  It's a lot more convenient for the two of them, as scum, to negate my read on Shin and to focus on my wobble over RC.<br>\n<br>\nTalking of:<br>\n<br>\n@Zor,<br>\n<br>\n Plot wasn't posting like Plot. Pushing them isn't scummy. After we'd talked, I backed the fuck away from that.  I'm not talking about it anymore. I also never 'pushed my town-read off a cliff' (you've manged to say that twice in the post. Re-inforcing your mis-rep. It's not pretty enough to be clever) I'm not arguing I didn't have a knee-jerk reaction, but I also tried to fucking engage them over something that wasn't Shin, and they self hammered. They'd not even  been clear they'd read up, so ofc I was suspicious of the automatic want to lynch the same slot. I never posted intent. Your last point is...that I use the same words? Really? <br>\n<br>\nOh wait, I didn't talk town down. I thought we'd give the slot time to catch up, and half an hour after the post, after I'd asked about reading up and didn't get a response I went to bed. l-1 and the hammer came out of no-where.

That assumes that night kills go through. Because even if we lynch correctly, if town dies at night then we're again left with the same number of town as scum. The only hope would be that we lynch correctly without eliminating a faction/SK, and then one of the factions/SK kills off the other at night. Which is...unlikely, I think.<br>\n<br>\n@Lapsa: You asked me to explain my thoughts on why you would have to be an SK if Thor is town. Keep in mind that the theory doesn't hold as much weight if there are mini normals where town has two investigative roles and they're only facing one anti-town faction (and yes I will be looking at the games you referenced). But my idea goes like this. TownThor has a \"not mafia\" result on you. This means you are either town or an SK. If we are in a situation where Thor is town, that means we are also facing a scum faction that most likely has two players left in it. Since you are \"not mafia\" according to Thor, this means the other scum faction is Bella and Shin, leaving you to be the SK. The exception to this rule is if you are a godfather, in which case you're still scum and therefore require rope.<br>\n<br>\nIf there are mini normals where town faces one scum faction and no SK but still has two investigative roles, and we then assume that Thor is town, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">then</div> it's possible that you're scum -- except that in that situation, I would expect scum to have a lot of firepower. Since we're assuming Thor is telling the truth in this scenario, we have to assume that scum does not have a roleblocker (because Thor got a result N1 despite having claimed), which makes it even more likely that scum has a godfather, and then we can't trust the result on you anyway. Either way, lynching between you, Bella and Shin randomly yields a 67% chance of hitting scum.<br>\n<br>\nOn to Thor's stuff.", "time": "Sun Jul 19, 2015 12:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62181&start=2450", "forum": "53", "thread": "62181"}

Need to think about implications of the game Lapsa linked, possibly do more setup research.<br>\n<br>\nBut @Bella....I suppose it's possible that there would be two scum teams of only one faction, but I would think it would be highly improbable. It just seems very, very townsided even if you take Thor's possible investigative power out of the equation. Two masons mean one clear and another three investigative roles that could, in the right circumstances, yield definitive results each night.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't played with neighbors/neighborizers very much (or possibly at all), but they've never seemed like they were all that powerful to me. They often appear to be scum (the game Lapsa linked had a scum neighbor), and the neighborhood does not allow any sort of clearing capability if I understand it correctly.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the idea of how many factions we want to have alive going into the night, if we assume multiball or 3 scum/1 SK then I believe it would actually be in town's interests to leave both anti-town groups alive going into the night. That would give town a chance that one group kills off the other, which would give town the majority of the votes again. And it would be in the smaller group's interests to kill scum.<br>\n<br>\nWhereas if we are at 6 players, three of which are scum, then killing off the smaller faction via lynching would leave us at 5 players, two of which are scum going into the night.

Either way, this scenario fits well with some things that have happened:<br>\n<br>\n-It explains the lack of multiple NKs during the past two nights.<br>\n-It explains the Pers kill (Thor knows he will be outed as scum by Pers, so he kills Pers while neutralizing the remaining infrared scum via roleblock).<br>\n-It explains why Thor \"got a result\" N1 (though that is explained just by him being scum).<br>\n<br>\nIn order for this to be true, the other team must not have a roleblocker.<br>\n<br>\nSetup spec-wise, I'm leaning away from the theory that town is only up against one anti-town faction. If I believe that it's 10:3, I see no other choice but to believe that town has a PGO that still has not claimed, which just does not make sense to me. If I believe that it's 9:2:2 or 9:3:1, there are a couple different explanations for why there haven't been multiple NKs for the past two nights (one-shot SK, scum RB that knows who's on the other faction, scum protective role, scum targeting bulletproof SK).<br>\n<br>\nIf it's 9:2:2, that suggests scum Thor to me because only one of {Lapsa, Thor, Shin, Bella} gets to be town in that scenario and Thor being ultraviolet (especially with a RB) explains a lot. If it's 9:3:1, that makes it less likely that Thor is scum IMO because there's no way in hell he's an SK and it's hard to see him being scum with BBT.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Results from ctrl + F'ing the mini normal archives post</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=29549\" class=\"postlink\">Here</a> are the archives.<br>\n-Even in games with werewolves and town, town often did not have two investigative roles.
