I just reasoned that if he were town, he would try to move onto someone that hadn't been questioned yet; instead he jumped onto the one person who had two votes based on what seemed to me like a meaningless RVS accusation (i.e. Barcode not voting on his first post). The whole thing made him stick out to me as too eager to get a bandwagon going."}

You said it yourself, if we don't get info then we're screwed. The only way to get that info is by voting. It's literally the only thing we can do. Plus ConMan only had 3 (now 2) votes on him. Now what I'm wondering is why you're so worried about us lynching ConMan when he wasn't even close to that point."}

It started <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7205404#p7205404\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, which feels satisfyingly open in a way that posts like that often really don't. There's also <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213623#p7213623\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>, where EV suspects Bacde for a very similar (but more roughly articulated) reason as one of those behind my suspicion of Kyubey (more on that later) - similar reasoning usually says to me that someone is in the same mindset as me, so EV strikes me as town. The primary reason, though, is that I'm pretty sure that <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7207345#p7207345\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> unguarded-looking comment shows that, if the mafia in this game had pregame chat, EV is no such mafia. How to approach a game with an SK is sure to be at the top of the list for mafia pregame chat; I doubt very much that mafia would be able to fake lack of knowledge about the setup. That's making an assumption about pregame chat but I can't remember the last game that I saw where mafia <span style=\"font-style: italic\">couldn't</span> talk in pregame, so I'm just going to go ahead and assume. It also doesn't rule out SK but other EV posts (and scumminess elsewhere) make me happy to not worry about that.<br><br>Cavane townread is partly based on the fact that a buncha people treated him weirdly and also I thought completely the opposite that Bacde did of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7208341#p7208341\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>; I think scum is likelier to join the chorus by criticising \"defensiveness\" rather than say something different like \"aggro\". It tells me that Cavane has been reading Bacde separately and evaluating his play for himself rather than it being a case of him deciding whether or not (or how) to join the wagon.</div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Kyubey is scum</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I've been rubbed up the wrong way by Kyubey for a long time.

I feel like it's a scum thing to ask too many questions to appear engaged in the game without actually contributing anything. They're also heavily pressuring bacde, in a way that looks a lot more like scum trying to grill someone rather than actual town inquisitiveness. \"why behave so unpleasantly?\" doesn't even really feel game-relevant, cavane seems to have used it like it's some indicator of scumminess which is ridiculous. \"why can't both of us be scum?\" is such a ridiculous question to ask and I'm not sure why town would ask it at all.

Thought guyett to that point was fairly town, but regardless of that, if you're going to single out someone as being \"not helpful\" why guyett of all people? There's a million people lurking their asses off, and he's the one being not helpful? Follows it up with saying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210293#p7210293\">187</a> that \"Guyett's reasoning for trying to prevent the wagon on him is also pretty poor\", which is also vague as hell and doesn't actually explain why he thinks it's poor.<br><br>Then, he posts essentially nothing but filler until showing up to make an INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT vote for banana in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213766#p7213766\">306</a>.

The line in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7212251#p7212251\">268</a> \"start defending yourself as opposed to nothing\" doesn't sound good, comes across as scum provoking someone rather than town annoyance.

Scum don't claim mason. Especially not with an SK in the setup. Additionally given the balance town likely needs several power roles to even things out. bodyguard's very weak, masons are plausible.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">cavane</span> - see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7253995#p7253995\">453</a>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">conmanmick</span> - Also exceedingly lurky, has essentially no contribution to the game. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7209401#p7209401\">134</a> is the first time he posts outside essentially RVS and it's total filler. Then an excuse post, and the hammer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213770#p7213770\">307</a> is horrifically scummy. And then he's done essentially nothing while promising to contribute, eventually. Not that being a flake is necessarily a scumtell, I just freaking hate it. He's probably not mafia if cavane is, though - think given activity levels scum could have piled on any wagon they wanted. I know this somewhat contridicts the post I just made before this one but whatever. I'm theorizing.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">evvenomous</span> - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7208988#p7208988\">120</a> looks somewhat insincere, picking at guyett for \"just jumping on the cavane wagon\" - this is an absolutely horrible post if I'm right about cavane being scum. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7209508#p7209508\">137</a> he critcizes guyett's play for being vague while being exceptionally vague himself, never cites specific examples, and never expains why he didn't like guyett's fake dayvig. Also feels like he overreacts majorly to being asked why he finds him scummy, like he doesn't want to be seen as making a false accusation. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7209659#p7209659\">140</a> he says he's \"not too happy with Cavane's earlier posts\" while on the very same day he'd just criticized guyett for his earlier vote on Cavane. Observation of kaiserb lurking is worthless, doesn't actually draw a conclusion as to whether he thinks it makes him scummy. The \"did I just hammer him\" bit in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210001#p7210001\">155</a> is inexplicable for town, he posts it a minute after voting bacde and it makes zero sense that he'd suddenly think about a potential hammer vote a minute after voting him, but not before doing so, looks more than anything like he thought he was hammering as scum and was trying to make it look accidental. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7211133#p7211133\">246</a> he sets up the dichotomy of one of banana/guyett being scum without much reasoning at all, looks particularly bad given both flipped town. God <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213623#p7213623\">303</a> just looks awful, again it's a badly opportunistic vote with shoddy justification. Banana was scummy for pressuring bacde then backing off? It looks a hell of a lot like a pile-on vote. I know that's the third person I've said that about but it remains true and there's four scum alive right now. And since then he's gone to lurking and also was someone who sheeped the conman wagon.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">performer/kyubey</span> - Somewhat liked kyubey's early posts. Like the fact that he tried to meta bacde in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7207838#p7207838\">79</a>, given experience level it seems genuine, and the fact that he just used it too question bacde rather than justify voting him I liked. I have in my notes I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7207942#p7207942\">83</a> because it seems like a sincere explanation of a read. After that it gets a little fuzzy. He seems to be trying and it's all well and good, but not a lot jumps out at me. He does, at least, seemingly have an honest suspicion of banana, that he does a lot to justify.<br><br>Performer is a horrid gimmick alt and I hate him. His replace in post manages to use a lot of words to say not a whole lot. He doesn't really draw strong conclusions or make decent analysis. Kind of puts a damper on my earlier read on kyubey. Still would probably weight kyubey's content more than two posts from his replacement, though.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">radiantcowbells/theworst</span> - worst was essentially useless, but <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210508#p7210508\">237</a> was very slightly town in that he bothered to take a stance on bacde. RC is okay. Irritation at anen seems genuine, can see him as town pushing them for not living up to epxectations. The reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7245039#p7245039\">405</a> seems townish, though again not totally sure scum wouldn't just be lazy. NOt sure at all what he liked about performer's post that caused him to unvote. Vote on vedith is reactionary, but in a townish sort of way, possibly - getting paranoid of the wagon and calling him out.<br><br>Except it's actually pretty scummy if everydaymuffin is scum and he's trying to derail the wagon.<br><br>I'd still lean town here but it's not a strong read at all.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vedith/kaiserb</span> - In my notes I have <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7209683#p7209683\">141</a> as slightly scummy but don't say why, reading it tonight I actually think I like it a bit better, him interrogating EV has some bite to it. his justification of voting bacde wasn't great, but not a lot to go by. Vedith on review says a lot less than I like and spends too much time asking questions without having a lot of drive/initiative, though realize some of this could be a result of the game being stagnant. Actually think him butting heads against the mason probably points to him being stubborn town. responses to pressure in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7241565#p7241565\">393</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252339#p7252339\">444</a> seem genuine, latter in particular feels like him actually being disappointed by the gamestate. Lean town, would like to see more content, might try to get to some specifics later<br><br><br>Didn't really like duppin's posts so I'm biased against cdb from the start, but going to try to give his reads list an honest shot. getting late though so that'll likely have to come tomorrow in ~17ish hours.

The line \"This is the exact same thing I was considering, but I am leaning town on Bacde at the moment so I doubt this is the case.

I'm not sure how to actually read him based on this though - I could be wrong, I could be right, I don't know what it says about him either way.<br><br>Already went into why I found Cavane's play to be horrifically scummy, the short justification of \"a buncha people treated him weirdly\" doesn't do a whole lot for me, and not sure how him using different wording of \"aggro\" instead of \"defensiveness\" makes him town, it looked like shoddy reasoning either way.<br><br>The second post he liked from EVV, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213623#p7213623\">303</a>, I also really don't see as looking town. The reasoning looks cheap, like scum trying to justify piling on the largest wagon with a very flimsy suspicion. The supposed townslip of not knowing about the SK doesn't mean a whole lot to me, people get careless all the time and given the activity levels of this game (dead as hell) wouldn't suprirse me if scum simply didn't bother talking about the SK or notice that info was in the setup.<br><br>Not sure how that reflects on CDB ultimately, disagree heavily with those reads but those are maybe not the easiest players to townread as scum. (this is what I hate about lists).<br><br>ehh, his points against kyubey's early play actually make some sense to me. I don't know that it really looks like after the fact justification, though. Kaiser trying to start a wagon seems to be the implied reasoning of kyubey's second vote. That it's \"lathered in unseriousness\" seems a product of RVS more than anything. Still though, the chain of posts about suspecting bacde look town to me, in particular 79 looks fairly townish. Not sure kyubey's experienced enough to fake meta-ing someone like that. It's a gradual questioning of bacde followed by dropping a vote on him when he doesn't get the answers he likes. The language doesn't bother me nearly as much. Agree that \"before I return to suspecting him\" is an awkward turn of phrase, but it might have something to do with kyubey being ESL (know this for a fact but can't show it). Not sure if it's scummy, would be a dumb thing to say as scum. The way he transitions to voting banana there is maybe a little scummier given it feels a bit like \"gotcha!\" reasoning when banana had already said bacde was null to him at that point. But ehh, this just feels like such a flimsy justification for a top scumread to be based around language in a handful of posts.<br><br><br>So much of this analysis seems to be focusing on phrasing/tone rather than actions and I'm not raelly a fan of it.

Shouldn't that be worth something to him, since he thought similarly? I don't understand the accusation of \"playing both sides of the Cavane train\" at all, not sure where he's getting that from, linked series of posts starting at 241 seems like pretty decent analysis actually and he finishes with a definitive take that he thinks cavane is scum.<br><br><br>Ultimately though I don't feel like I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">connecting</span> with a lot of what CDB's saying.

I feel like it's a scum thing to ask too many questions to appear engaged in the game without actually contributing anything. They're also heavily pressuring bacde, in a way that looks a lot more like scum trying to grill someone rather than actual town inquisitiveness. \"why behave so unpleasantly?\" doesn't even really feel game-relevant, cavane seems to have used it like it's some indicator of scumminess which is ridiculous. \"why can't both of us be scum?\" is such a ridiculous question to ask and I'm not sure why town would ask it at all. He also asks for bacde'sd reasoning but doesn't seem to care too much, there's no insistence or follow-up at all.<br><br>reasoning for voting guyett in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210268#p7210268\">182</a> I also don't like, statement that \"Nothing [Guyett]'s said or done thus far is helpful to the town.\" is insanely vague and fairly ridiculous. Thought guyett to that point was fairly town, but regardless of that, if you're going to single out someone as being \"not helpful\" why guyett of all people? There's a million people lurking their asses off, and he's the one being not helpful? Follows it up with saying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210293#p7210293\">187</a> that \"Guyett's reasoning for trying to prevent the wagon on him is also pretty poor\", which is also vague as hell and doesn't actually explain why he thinks it's poor.<br><br>Then, he posts essentially nothing but filler until showing up to make an INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT vote for banana in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213766#p7213766\">306</a>. This is blatant, bold-faced opportunism. puts him at L-1 with his only comment being \"I am okay with removing banana's slot\" wwithout ever exlaining WHY.

That's the third time Cavane makes a sheepy wagon vote with a tiny, crappy little reason attached to it. He's made one original vote that was barely justified. He looks a lot like someone who's just going along with lynches because he can.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7226911#p7226911\">347</a> is filler and I don't like the way he laments both deaths being town - it feels like a \"look at me I'm so town\" type statement, where most people aren't really going to concern themselves too much with the deaths.<br><br>And then again, from there, nothing but straight filler.<br><br>There's a lot of terrible lurkers in this game, Cavane takse top of the list for me though just because all his votes have been so opportunistic.</div></blockquote><br><br>Starting with my response to this.<br><br>I later admitted that my initial vote on bacde was more due to me disliking his style than actual scumtells.  I actually had a pretty good feeling he was town by the end of the day, which is why I backed off of questioning him.  I have no clue why you think it was ridiculous to ask why Muffin and I couldn't both be scum.  Bacde had repeatedly stated that he felt strongly that one or the other of us was scum.  He specifically stated one us two.  If he had scumtells on both of us, why would it be one of us two?  I felt that was a pretty natural question to ask.<br><br>What needs explaining about my statement on Guyett?  But since you insist, at the time I made that post, his play had consisted entirely of a trollclaim during RVS and, as you call them, filler posts.  Unhelpful.  Since you're scumreading me for similar reasons, I'm not sure why you disagree with me there.<br><br>As for the banana vote, there's really not much to say.  Your predecessor voted just before me based on Banana pretty much ruining his slot for whoever would have replaced him.  As stated in my vote post, I agreed with that.  I felt we had gained everything of value we were going to out of Day 1, but that we might learn something from banana's death, even if he wasn't scum.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.<br><br>Overall, I'm really not buying your case on me.  According to you, a town player isn't allowed to bandwagon.  I submit that bandwagons are one of the most effective ways of getting information."}

Most of it seems to hinge on his accidental fake hammer. First of all, I see no reason for this to be faked if he is scum. It doesn't seem like an exchange he would view as particularly townie, and he was not under any pressure at the time. In addition, the wording seems realistic to me. It's a little awkward, but he freaks out about possibly hammering on accident, apologizes, then checks to see if he possibly didn't mess up. There is a minute and 41 seconds between him apologizing and him confirming the five votes against Bacde. I see no real issue with the events. The slot isn't particularly townie though, and I would be willing to jump on that wagon if we had to get a lynch going.<br><br>Performer is much worse though, and I remember feeling really off about Kyubey as well. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Performer</span>"}

He'd dropped a vague townread on me earlier, but I don't get much of a sense he has real reason to trust me, and yet he's talking to me like he knows I'm town. In general in a mylo situation, I'd expect town to be a lot more cautious and suspicious of everyone. The way he openly appealed to me just comes off fake and bothersome.

I doubt you are the cop putting the read on RC.<br>okay than B) RC is the cop//// but that leaves the question of how you know this. You obvious didn't talk to him at night since town does not have night talk and you are not the a role cop if RC is aop so there is no way of knowing this.
