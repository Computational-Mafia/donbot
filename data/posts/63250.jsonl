The primary reason, though, is that I'm pretty sure that <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7207345#p7207345\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> unguarded-looking comment shows that, if the mafia in this game had pregame chat, EV is no such mafia. How to approach a game with an SK is sure to be at the top of the list for mafia pregame chat; I doubt very much that mafia would be able to fake lack of knowledge about the setup. That's making an assumption about pregame chat but I can't remember the last game that I saw where mafia <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">couldn't</div> talk in pregame, so I'm just going to go ahead and assume. It also doesn't rule out SK but other EV posts (and scumminess elsewhere) make me happy to not worry about that.<br>\n<br>\nCavane townread is partly based on the fact that a buncha people treated him weirdly and also I thought completely the opposite that Bacde did of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7208341#p7208341\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>; I think scum is likelier to join the chorus by criticising \"defensiveness\" rather than say something different like \"aggro\". It tells me that Cavane has been reading Bacde separately and evaluating his play for himself rather than it being a case of him deciding whether or not (or how) to join the wagon.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Kyubey is scum</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I've been rubbed up the wrong way by Kyubey for a long time.

If Muffin is scum, which I think that he is, then it strikes me as highly unlikely that Anen is his buddy as the unvote is the kind of skittish reaction that scum have when they think that they're starting to worry the town, indicating that Muffin considers Anen as likely town, even though SK is technically possible.

I feel like it's a scum thing to ask too many questions to appear engaged in the game without actually contributing anything. They're also heavily pressuring bacde, in a way that looks a lot more like scum trying to grill someone rather than actual town inquisitiveness. \"why behave so unpleasantly?\" doesn't even really feel game-relevant, cavane seems to have used it like it's some indicator of scumminess which is ridiculous. \"why can't both of us be scum?\" is such a ridiculous question to ask and I'm not sure why town would ask it at all.

Thought guyett to that point was fairly town, but regardless of that, if you're going to single out someone as being \"not helpful\" why guyett of all people? There's a million people lurking their asses off, and he's the one being not helpful? Follows it up with saying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210293#p7210293\">187</a> that \"Guyett's reasoning for trying to prevent the wagon on him is also pretty poor\", which is also vague as hell and doesn't actually explain why he thinks it's poor.<br>\n<br>\nThen, he posts essentially nothing but filler until showing up to make an INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT vote for banana in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213766#p7213766\">306</a>.

And then he's done essentially nothing while promising to contribute, eventually. Not that being a flake is necessarily a scumtell, I just freaking hate it. He's probably not mafia if cavane is, though - think given activity levels scum could have piled on any wagon they wanted.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7209508#p7209508\">137</a> he critcizes guyett's play for being vague while being exceptionally vague himself, never cites specific examples, and never expains why he didn't like guyett's fake dayvig. Also feels like he overreacts majorly to being asked why he finds him scummy, like he doesn't want to be seen as making a false accusation. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7209659#p7209659\">140</a> he says he's \"not too happy with Cavane's earlier posts\" while on the very same day he'd just criticized guyett for his earlier vote on Cavane. Observation of kaiserb lurking is worthless, doesn't actually draw a conclusion as to whether he thinks it makes him scummy. The \"did I just hammer him\" bit in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210001#p7210001\">155</a> is inexplicable for town, he posts it a minute after voting bacde and it makes zero sense that he'd suddenly think about a potential hammer vote a minute after voting him, but not before doing so, looks more than anything like he thought he was hammering as scum and was trying to make it look accidental. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7211133#p7211133\">246</a> he sets up the dichotomy of one of banana/guyett being scum without much reasoning at all, looks particularly bad given both flipped town. God <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213623#p7213623\">303</a> just looks awful, again it's a badly opportunistic vote with shoddy justification. Banana was scummy for pressuring bacde then backing off? It looks a hell of a lot like a pile-on vote. I know that's the third person I've said that about but it remains true and there's four scum alive right now. And since then he's gone to lurking and also was someone who sheeped the conman wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">performer/kyubey</div> - Somewhat liked kyubey's early posts. Like the fact that he tried to meta bacde in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7207838#p7207838\">79</a>, given experience level it seems genuine, and the fact that he just used it too question bacde rather than justify voting him I liked. I have in my notes I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7207942#p7207942\">83</a> because it seems like a sincere explanation of a read. After that it gets a little fuzzy. He seems to be trying and it's all well and good, but not a lot jumps out at me. He does, at least, seemingly have an honest suspicion of banana, that he does a lot to justify.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer is a horrid gimmick alt and I hate him. His replace in post manages to use a lot of words to say not a whole lot. He doesn't really draw strong conclusions or make decent analysis. Kind of puts a damper on my earlier read on kyubey. Still would probably weight kyubey's content more than two posts from his replacement, though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">radiantcowbells/theworst</div> - worst was essentially useless, but <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210508#p7210508\">237</a> was very slightly town in that he bothered to take a stance on bacde. RC is okay. Irritation at anen seems genuine, can see him as town pushing them for not living up to epxectations. The reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7245039#p7245039\">405</a> seems townish, though again not totally sure scum wouldn't just be lazy.

Vedith on review says a lot less than I like and spends too much time asking questions without having a lot of drive/initiative, though realize some of this could be a result of the game being stagnant. Actually think him butting heads against the mason probably points to him being stubborn town. responses to pressure in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7241565#p7241565\">393</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252339#p7252339\">444</a> seem genuine, latter in particular feels like him actually being disappointed by the gamestate.

I sort of liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7211371#p7211371\">247</a>, though on a reread I notice he does a ton of waffly opinions which annoys me. The line \"This is the exact same thing I was considering, but I am leaning town on Bacde at the moment so I doubt this is the case. I do however like you for bringing it up. \" I liked, it seemed a bit of an advanced thought that he was considering multiple possibilities.

I'm not sure how to actually read him based on this though - I could be wrong, I could be right, I don't know what it says about him either way.<br>\n<br>\nAlready went into why I found Cavane's play to be horrifically scummy, the short justification of \"a buncha people treated him weirdly\" doesn't do a whole lot for me, and not sure how him using different wording of \"aggro\" instead of \"defensiveness\" makes him town, it looked like shoddy reasoning either way.<br>\n<br>\nThe second post he liked from EVV, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213623#p7213623\">303</a>, I also really don't see as looking town. The reasoning looks cheap, like scum trying to justify piling on the largest wagon with a very flimsy suspicion. The supposed townslip of not knowing about the SK doesn't mean a whole lot to me, people get careless all the time and given the activity levels of this game (dead as hell) wouldn't suprirse me if scum simply didn't bother talking about the SK or notice that info was in the setup.<br>\n<br>\nNot sure how that reflects on CDB ultimately, disagree heavily with those reads but those are maybe not the easiest players to townread as scum. (this is what I hate about lists).<br>\n<br>\nehh, his points against kyubey's early play actually make some sense to me. I don't know that it really looks like after the fact justification, though. Kaiser trying to start a wagon seems to be the implied reasoning of kyubey's second vote. That it's \"lathered in unseriousness\" seems a product of RVS more than anything. Still though, the chain of posts about suspecting bacde look town to me, in particular 79 looks fairly townish. Not sure kyubey's experienced enough to fake meta-ing someone like that. It's a gradual questioning of bacde followed by dropping a vote on him when he doesn't get the answers he likes. The language doesn't bother me nearly as much. Agree that \"before I return to suspecting him\" is an awkward turn of phrase, but it might have something to do with kyubey being ESL (know this for a fact but can't show it). Not sure if it's scummy, would be a dumb thing to say as scum. The way he transitions to voting banana there is maybe a little scummier given it feels a bit like \"gotcha!\" reasoning when banana had already said bacde was null to him at that point. But ehh, this just feels like such a flimsy justification for a top scumread to be based around language in a handful of posts.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo much of this analysis seems to be focusing on phrasing/tone rather than actions and I'm not raelly a fan of it.

Also a small, trifling thing to focus on compared to the overall substance of the reads. He made the same point CDB made about kyubey going from serious back to RVS, but way earlier. Shouldn't that be worth something to him, since he thought similarly?

The big jump on your part from just seeing this slot as scummy to wanting to lynch it seems to be the replacement. However, he had not actually contributed anything to the game since the 14th, stating on the 16th that he has been busy.

I feel like it's a scum thing to ask too many questions to appear engaged in the game without actually contributing anything. They're also heavily pressuring bacde, in a way that looks a lot more like scum trying to grill someone rather than actual town inquisitiveness. \"why behave so unpleasantly?\" doesn't even really feel game-relevant, cavane seems to have used it like it's some indicator of scumminess which is ridiculous. \"why can't both of us be scum?\" is such a ridiculous question to ask and I'm not sure why town would ask it at all. He also asks for bacde'sd reasoning but doesn't seem to care too much, there's no insistence or follow-up at all.<br>\n<br>\nreasoning for voting guyett in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210268#p7210268\">182</a> I also don't like, statement that \"Nothing [Guyett]'s said or done thus far is helpful to the town.\" is insanely vague and fairly ridiculous. Thought guyett to that point was fairly town, but regardless of that, if you're going to single out someone as being \"not helpful\" why guyett of all people? There's a million people lurking their asses off, and he's the one being not helpful? Follows it up with saying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7210293#p7210293\">187</a> that \"Guyett's reasoning for trying to prevent the wagon on him is also pretty poor\", which is also vague as hell and doesn't actually explain why he thinks it's poor.<br>\n<br>\nThen, he posts essentially nothing but filler until showing up to make an INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT vote for banana in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7213766#p7213766\">306</a>. This is blatant, bold-faced opportunism. puts him at L-1 with his only comment being \"I am okay with removing banana's slot\" wwithout ever exlaining WHY. It's voting on the largest wagon with flimsy reasoning, this vote in and of itself was more or less a scumclaim.<br>\n<br>\nVote on mick in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7226815#p7226815\">345</a> is similarly terribad, mick was a wagon with some momentum, and all he says is \"I'm interested in hearing what he has to say\". That's the third time Cavane makes a sheepy wagon vote with a tiny, crappy little reason attached to it. He's made one original vote that was barely justified. He looks a lot like someone who's just going along with lynches because he can.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7226911#p7226911\">347</a> is filler and I don't like the way he laments both deaths being town - it feels like a \"look at me I'm so town\" type statement, where most people aren't really going to concern themselves too much with the deaths.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then again, from there, nothing but straight filler.<br>\n<br>\nThere's a lot of terrible lurkers in this game, Cavane takse top of the list for me though just because all his votes have been so opportunistic.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nStarting with my response to this.<br>\n<br>\nI later admitted that my initial vote on bacde was more due to me disliking his style than actual scumtells.  I actually had a pretty good feeling he was town by the end of the day, which is why I backed off of questioning him.  I have no clue why you think it was ridiculous to ask why Muffin and I couldn't both be scum.  Bacde had repeatedly stated that he felt strongly that one or the other of us was scum.  He specifically stated one us two.  If he had scumtells on both of us, why would it be one of us two?  I felt that was a pretty natural question to ask.<br>\n<br>\nWhat needs explaining about my statement on Guyett?  But since you insist, at the time I made that post, his play had consisted entirely of a trollclaim during RVS and, as you call them, filler posts.  Unhelpful.  Since you're scumreading me for similar reasons, I'm not sure why you disagree with me there.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the banana vote, there's really not much to say.  Your predecessor voted just before me based on Banana pretty much ruining his slot for whoever would have replaced him.  As stated in my vote post, I agreed with that.  I felt we had gained everything of value we were going to out of Day 1, but that we might learn something from banana's death, even if he wasn't scum.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I'm really not buying your case on me.  According to you, a town player isn't allowed to bandwagon.

You note yourself he's in several games. He didn't replace sitewide, only in this game specifically. He left this game for some reason, without saying anything in-thread, and chose to continue in his others. The most likely conclusion by far is that he couldn't handle being scum, and flaked from this rather than address the wagon on him. That tends to happen with people who don't know how to play scum, who have a guilty conscience about their role.

It's a little awkward, but he freaks out about possibly hammering on accident, apologizes, then checks to see if he possibly didn't mess up. There is a minute and 41 seconds between him apologizing and him confirming the five votes against Bacde. I see no real issue with the events.

You obvious didn't talk to him at night since town does not have night talk and you are not the a role cop if RC is aop so there is no way of knowing this.
