General Rules<br>\n1.1 This is a game. Have fun. Be civil to all players; don't let your emotions get too far out of hand.<br>\n1.2 Rule violations will be dealt with on a case by case basis. I am not afraid to modkill, should it be necessary, but I really don't want to have to.<br>\n1.3 If you think I made a mistake contact me.<br>\n1.4 Usually I will post in bolded green.<br>\n1.5 My decision is final about whatever is going on in this game. This means that these rules may be amended if necessary to suit a situation I have not foreseen.<br>\n1.6 If your role PM allows you to break any of the following rules, such as providing you with a quicktopic you may use, obviously, you may do so.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2. Votes and Lynches<br>\n2.1 To vote a person use vote tags, e.g. VOTE: Tasky or bold your vote. If your vote is already on someone, an unvote would be nice.<br>\n2.2 You may use abbreviations as long as it's clear who you want to vote.<br>\n2.3 If I think you meant to vote, I will count the vote.<br>\n2.4 As soon as the majority of the players vote at the same time for a player, that player is immediately lynched.<br>\n2.5 You may VOTE: No Lynch, as you would vote any player. If half of the players (rounded up) vote No Lynch, the day will end without lynch.<br>\n2.6 After a lynch, no one is considered dead until I lock the tread. Therefore every player is allowed to post during twilight.<br>\n<br>\n3. Do and Don't<br>\n3.1 The only place you are allowed to talk about this game is in this thread or in a PM addressed at me and only at me, unless your role PM states otherwise.<br>\n3.2 You may not edit or delete any posts of this thread.<br>\n3.3 Do not quote or pretend to quote any private communication with me. This includes your role PM.<br>\n3.4 Play to win. Don't do anything obviously detrimental to your faction on purpose.<br>\n3.5 If what you post cannot be easily read by all players in the game at the time it is posted, don't post it. This includes cryptography, invisible text, small text, and any other devilish scheme you may create.<br>\n3.6 If you are dead, don't post. A \"bah\" post is acceptable. You are only dead when I post that you are dead. Remember, however, that after the hammer, you may still post in twilight.<br>\n<br>\n4. Prods and Replacements<br>\n4.1 Notify me if you are going to be on V/LA or risk replacement.<br>\n4.2 If you do not post in thread for more than 72 hours without announcing a V/LA, you will be prodded.<br>\n4.3 If a player fails to pick up his prod and post in thread for more than 36 hours, he will be forced to replaced out or modkilled.<br>\n4.4 Every player may request a prod or a forced replacement. I will then consider his/her request.<br>\n4.5 The sooner I know you have to be replaced, the better it is for me and for the game. If you know you will have to replace out, please let me know in advance.<br>\n<br>\n5. Deadlines<br>\n5.1 First day's deadline will be 14 days after the game starts.<br>\n5.2 After that, the deadline will be 10 days after the daybreak post. <br>\n5.3 Deadline extensions may be granted in extraordinary situations.<br>\n5.4 Night deadline is always 48 hours.<br>\n5.5 Night actions I haven't received until after deadline will not happen (unless compulsory). If you wish not to perform any action, I prefer that to be stated explicitly.</div></div>", "time": "Mon Jan 17, 2011 3:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

I too, as indicated by a comment made earlier in this post (that is now obsolete but I don't feel like deleting for transparency reasons), believed he voted a player for reasons of not posting yet.

You stated that \"magnus is scum\", and voted for him. I stated that \"Javert is scum and this is why\", and voted for you.

What did you attack magnus for, again? Funny, I recall you saying that there was no reason and you were just reaction hunting. I never said I purposefully used a bad argument. I simply used the best argument I could, given the information we had. The first page or two of the game rarely yields any information that we can use to truly find someone's alignment, in my experience.

This is concerning, since it suggests David is more concerned with the attitude of the town as a whole, and how it behaves and reacts to certain actions (and suggests David seeks to control these aspects to some degree), rather than the alignments of individual players. This is an attitude which suggests scum motivation behind David's actions, especially considering the underwhelming amount of pressure on Javert at the time. His attempt to bring order to chaos I believe to be a result of his attempt to bring the game to a point where it can be predicted and controlled effectively, so that he may better fulfill his scum win condition. In particular, I believe this to be contrasted to a more town motivation, which would seek to see how Javert responds to the pressure being applied, in order to better gauge Javert's alignment, and the alignments of the players wagoning him, especially when he believes scum may have been prepared to take advantage of this situation and reveal themselves somewhat by joining the wagon (narrowing down suspects, of course, always being an important consideration for a pro-town player).<br>\nAlternatively, david may have seen this as an opportunity to behave in a manner he believed to be \"pro-town\" by diffusing an argument between townies. This is telling because he remains uncertain of Javerts alignment, but does not desire a wagon against javert for reaction purposes, and has in fact resisted the formation of such a wagon. Also considering his resistance to answering questions, it is difficult to imagine how he expects scum hunting to be done, having ruled out the two most generally used options.", "time": "Tue Jan 18, 2011 3:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=50", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

You don't learn much from player reactions if they know what attacks are coming there way. It's only really when you catch them off guard, or they miss something altogether that it can become useful. All I did was make the response Javert was going to make himself in the situation. There was more important issues to go after, the 2 lurker-posts who answered pointless questions but didn't comment at all on Javert's wagons.. I mean that was just downright scummy and by far the scummiest thing in the game so far when it happened.

I'm not throwing covert punches at all, I'm outright accusing Javert of hypocrisy. A lot of people are finding what I did scummy, and what Javert did pro-town. I just don't get it.

I don't really think Javert is scum, as he's been acting with mostly pro-town intentions, or so it seems. I don't like his hypocritical attack on me, but I don't think he's scum for it. Mute, on the other hand, isn't acting with any pro-town intention that I can see. He's done quite a few things that bother me.<br>\n<br>\nHere's a full case of why I'm suspicious of Mute.<br>\n-In ISOs 0 and 2, he places votes based on player's names. In ISO 3, he makes a statement suggesting his random votes accomplish a lot for town. Perhaps this is theory disagreement, but to me it looks like he's trying to make himself look more productive and pro-town than he is.<br>\n-In ISO 4 he makes a FoS against Javert. In ISO 5 he says that Javert's actions, as scum, wouldn't make sense. In ISO 6, he votes for Javert. In ISO 8, he says he feels justified in putting Javert at L-2. This seems contradictory to me.<br>\n<br>\nThis is in addition to his statement declaring a desire for a policy lynch that would hurt town and help scum. So yes, I think Mute is playing scummy.

That is just how I word my posts. I use sarcasm and make subtle jabs at people. This will come up later in your big wall post. In general the way I post isn't straight-forward and analytical, not everything is meant to be taken word for word. (I'm actually a writer, so that's partly why I hate purely informative prose). I could easily have voted and given that as my reason.. What difference does it make to you whether I ask it as a question and vote or just state it and vote, or ask it as a question and not vote. Either way it was pressuring you to post and me clearly stating that I disapprove of your post and found it scummy. The three all accomplish the same thing. You'll notice the question wasn't even directed at you. So yeah, I can do any of those things you stated, sure, but I didn't. That's my playstyle.<br>\n2. It was the most relevent discussion at the time. It was the focus of the most recent posts and it was definitely a wagon being formed. Whether it had 1 vote or 4 votes on it, it was far more useful to have been discussing that, than some silly questions at the time of your post. It's not the size of the wagon that I was referring to but more about how the first case on a player had kicked off and the people posting who were on at that time should have been focusing on it unless they had something better (which hey, there was just a page of RVS and a few silly questions, so i doubt they did)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n/Sidetrack.<br>\n<br>\n@Javert: I think that post(#47), on a standalone basis, is probably the scummiest post so far and is definitely not well thought out and is very scummy. As a whole given the way your wagon occurred and Ice's positioning on it I'd say he is likely scum and would be in my top few picks for a lynch today at this point of the game. However, his response to accusations has been somewhat formidable, although it's much easier to respond to accusations regarding a scummy post than it is to avoid making scumlike-slips in posts. <br>\n<br>\n@Oso: No fair <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br>\n<br>\nThat game was a one-off terrible game of mine that I was never even caught up with or tried to keep up with!

Use your gut and intuition, but bandwagoning alone won't get your far. Sometimes a wagon is the right place to be. (Kinda like this Ice wagon is tempting me right now)<br>\n<br>\n@magnus: I probably do underestimate some tells, it's probably largely based on how I play, and how I react to certain things (ie: people voting me and attacking certain aspects of my playstyle), generally it's me in Javert's position creating negative attention towards myself to help create discussion. (ie: <a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15318\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15318</a>) Anyways, point is, when I've been caught out it's not because of some \"pressure wagon\" getting to me, it's because I've been lazy keeping up and taken shortcuts or because as a whole players have analyzed my intent throughout the game. <br>\n<br>\n@Ice: Your post #70 does not come off too well either. Firstly, you are preparing yourself to vote for me should a wagon kick off there by reluctantly saying I looked town but relooking you're not sure. That alone wasn't that scummy, but combined with your attempt to turn all the attention to people who aren't posting at this point (scum are in the shadows, we dont have reads on lots of players, etc) seems scummy. There is a slight problem with a few people not posting, but all you've done is say \"hey some people aren't posting and we have no reads are them, and scum are probably in the shadows\" (trying to make us connect the dots and go after these people), why don't you do something about those lurkers?

Back to responding:<br>\n<br>\n@Rob: Calling you \"lurker/fence sitter scum\" was hyperbole and not something I even myself believed to be entirely true. (but hey it could be). This brings me back to my earlier point, there was some sarcasm or at least <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">jest</div> intended with that unfair labeling of yourself. Just like I did the same and labeled Mute as something similar, overly-cautious,twitchy scum or something.<br>\n<br>\nOh, I know he's a big boy and can defend himself. But sometimes hearing defences from other people can help players. It's helped me in the past. I was tunneling on someone pretty hard and any defense they said I just read as having scum intent and refused to see any town motivation to their play. It was only when another player stood up and defended them that I felt this player was in fact quite possibly town. And yeah, I did sink his ship somewhat, I'd rather let people know how clever I was for figuring it out than let it play it's course though. I do have an ego :/<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>- so 3 people are \"the town\"?</div></blockquote>\nAt that point in the game, more or less, yes. They were the 3 people actively posting and pretty much EVERYONE following Javert's random vote was wagoning onto Javert. So within the context of that post, yes, the town were tunneling on Javert. When taken out of context like you just did, well no 3 people is not the town. While I go read up on what fence-sitting is in terms of mafiascum meta, how about you go learn the importance of context.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>but what if some people actually thought J was scum and they were scum hunting, also since you diffused the point of J's plot you have basically made that entire thing wortless and actually TAKEN AWAY from scum hunting.</div></blockquote>\nThey were going after Javert for what was a null-tell more or less. I am under the impression that wagons such as that one are more of a distraction to town, and is a common place where town end up going wrong on day 1, so I tried to divert attention else where. Those people have their right to think Javert is scum and go after him, but I merely didn't feel their pressure was going to be very fruitful. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>DP, the wagon on him WAS helping the game progress, his vote declaration I don't think was never going to take off because once somebody declares something as fact especially this early on, that person is going to be suspect.

I still have not seen anybody make the barest hint of an argument that it is.  In fact, I was a bit surprised that players called me scummy for it.  Back in my day, many (if not most) games started off with multiple players flat-out saying \"X is scum\" and then trying to get people to join the wagon (for example, a common variant would be \"if you vote for X with me today, I will help you lynch Y tomorrow\").  This is a particularly useful strategy if you manage to randomly start a wagon on a newbie-scum who will come to thread and think \"oh shit.\"  Having a bandwagon start on me was certainly not the type of reaction I expected, but I felt I might as well see how large my wagon would get if I just sat there cryptically for a while.<br>\n<br>\nThis is absolutely different making <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">an argument</div> against somebody, and then coming back to say, \"just joking.\"  As a rule, Towns win by lynching scum, and scum are lynched without the help of night-actions when (i) Townspeople manage to argue that a scum should be lynched, or (ii) scum get caught up in their own words.

He presumably came across a game start like this at least once, and that's why he knew this was an action to find scummy reactions from other players. Therefore he wouldn't vote for you in the first place. <br>\nIn a lesser extend this has to be taken into account, as well:\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>You'll find that I play fairly conservatively as an IC, particularly during day 1. When I'm not being looked to for example, I tend to play more recklessly.</div></blockquote>\nThis could easily be lied, but I can see him doing that. ICs guide the games and are not guiding very well when they are setting up traps. \n<blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>But most importantly, why are you giving him a \"free pass\"? Perhaps it is better put this way: Would you give him a \"free pass\" if you had never played a game with him before? Do you think his posts are scummy?

The only way Javert's opening vote without explanation could be scummy is because he knows, with scum information, who scum is. Mute then said that this couldn't be the case, but proceeded to vote for him anyway. How is that twisting words or anything of what you said?\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>\nHe has just tried to sell us on something that just isn't so using a blatant distortion, again in my opinion.\n</div></blockquote>\nCan you try to explain this again?

I figured it was just RVS play that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> have been fueled with scum knowledge. As I've said countless times before, it was the strongest case I could make with what I had. I never said \"teehee I was faking it\". I never faked anything. Why do people keep making up things about what I did? I simply stated that I over-pushed the wagon based on the strength of the case.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Edger wrote:</cite>\nThis just isn't true. You completely misrepresent Mute as saying that his random votes \"accomplish a lot\". what he actually said was much more understated:\n</div></blockquote>\nNot at all. I asked him \"how do your votes help the game\" and he responds \"how don't they?\" and lists a bunch of things votes (and he's implying HIS votes) do to advance the game. It isn't a strong tell, but it's what I got out of it.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>\nsecondly I would like to add that i don't really care for the reason that Ice gave for his mute vote and I don't like the strong reaction he had to the policy lynching suggestion. I will be honest I am not 100% against a policy lynch if I know the player's habits and he is going to screw town over (furclow for example) and I don't think anyone in here has shown traits of being bad enough to deserve a PL.\n</div></blockquote>\nIf Javert had displayed furclow behavior, then I wouldn't have had such a strong reaction. Javert did nothing wrong when Mute proposed his PL, which is why I was disgusted.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>\nWhat you see above was the whole argument.

This looks to me as a clear case of fabricating evidence based on your current needs.\n</div></blockquote>\nI stated in my earlier post that you quoted that \"everything else just makes me want to vote him more\". These points you claim I fabricated were said everything else. Also, the point about the 2 random votes was something I was on his case about earlier, so that didn't pop out of nowhere. I hadn't mentioned his uncertainty about Javert is all.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>\nAs you can see, you argued that Javert could only know magnus_orion was scum if he, himself, was scum. That would be bussing. Mute thought that might warrant a Modkill. He was wrong, but his thought process was valid. He didn't say Javert was or wasn't scum. He just didn't think Javert was bussing, as you portrayed.\n</div></blockquote>\nThen what reason did Mute have to suspect Javert if he didn't think he had scum knowledge? It's the only way that his actions could be viewed as sucmmy, at least from what I can see.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>\nThe very same tactics you expressed were the correct way to act might just apply to both Mute and Javert. SPECIALLY Javert (Which you decided to vote in that post).\n</div></blockquote>\nI'm fairly certain I SPECIFICALLY said that Javert participated in doing this. I don't believe Mute did anything to advance the game at the beginnings.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>\nI thought B was so weak that it was an addition to A) to strengthen the vote. You said it was a SERIOUS vote.\n</div></blockquote>\nOK I see what you mean now. I had never seen anyone simply declare someone is scum on the first page before. This argument made sense at the time.\n<blockquote><div><cite>CS wrote:</cite>\nI think ICE saw that and thought them to be scummy and therefore voted for Mute. No scummy intentions.\n</div></blockquote>\nThis isn't exactly what happened. My primary reasoning for my vote on Javert was to get a better read on him, but I do tend to regularly advance games out of the RVS stage. I don't even consciously think about it anymore. Mute wasn't scummy for simply following my lead, but he is scummy for how he over reacted, considering a policy lynch based on RVS behavior.

{"number": 116, "id": "2739209", "user": "ICEninja", "user_id": "12670", "content": "Alright magnus, here is very specifically what I felt I accomplished in my vote.<br>\n<br>\nFirstly and most obviously, it drove us in to meaningful discussion and real votes. Unfortunately this lead to a bandwagon on me, but there have been some scummy jumps on to my wagon which could very well help town. This is what I was referring to when I said \"and then some\" when referring to that I had accomplished my goals.<br>\n<br>\nIn Javert's ISO 4, he explained exactly and clearly what he was intending to accomplish with his vote. Very specifically, he said this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>\nNot explaining a vote the instant you make it is not scummy, and I would be amused to see any person voting for me try to argue otherwise. I was hoping - at the least - to see magnus_orion's reaction, but with David Parker's post I suspect any reaction I may have gotten has now been lost.\n</div></blockquote>\nHe calls for people to actually explain why his actions were scummy, full well knowing that, considering this revelation, weren't. Granted this wasn't the reason I initially voted for him, as I insinuated that a player declaring someone scum has scum inside information, but he's right. He wanted to see a player's reaction to pressure, and had good intentions. Town points for being the first player to actively scum hunt with specific goals in mind.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, he examines my play more closely. He points out this about my play:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>\nEssentially, ICEninja complains about Mute for making two random votes because random votes do not advance the game. But immediately afterwards, when I make a vote that is seemingly not random - i.e., a post that will likely advance the game - ICEninja jumps on me as if it is suspicious in Post 22.\n</div></blockquote>\nWhile I didn't attack him to shut down action that would advance the game, and therefore this contradiction doesn't really stack, it shows more solid and genuine looking scum hunting from Javert. This wasn't exactly the reaction I was expecting, per se, and it had a dash of OMGUS in it, I felt that it was town driven suspicion. Javert fully knew that his vote was not scummy. Therefore, he attacked a vote that was based on actions that weren't scummy. This is a good and logical argument, if one assumes that I knew what he was doing at the beginning, that indicates further scum hunting.<br>\n<br>\nI generally regard the first player to make a well reasoned vote that makes sense to be pro-town. This is because scum, in my experience, are less likely to be making waves. It's simply safer for scum to sit back and wait for someone like Javert to throw down a vote on me and to pile up the votes after a lot of people suspect the player, much like what Jerbs and Prox have done.<br>\n<br>\nSince then, Javert hasn't read as the most town player, but I won't be voting him any time soon unless he says something that really bothers me. Hopefully you now have a good detailed understanding of everything I was thinking.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I'd like to finally take a breather for trying to explain to everyone why I'm not scum and point out to everyone how scummy Mute has been behaving.<br>\n<br>\nRight now, everyone who thinks that I twisted around Mute's words, read this statement:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mute, ISO 11 wrote:</cite>\nThe reasoning I had then was a scum-ploy to oust their partner to favor a town-reputation.\n</div></blockquote>\nThis is referring to the fact that he felt, at the time he voted Javert, that Javert was busing his partner to gain town cred. I would like to remind everyone that he made this statement IN BETWEEN his FoS and vote for Javert:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mute, ISO 5 wrote:</cite>\nProblem is, if he is scum, why would he be ousting his partner now?\n</div></blockquote>\nHe clearly felt that Javert would not be scum busing his partner. Yet now he goes back and states that his reasoning for voting Javert, which happens in his next post, was that he was ousting his partner to gain town cred.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, when questioned about why he found Javert scummy enough to vote, he made this very strange statement:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>\nYay best defense I have is nothing but needless WIFOM at this point which even I don't fully trust. =_=\n</div></blockquote>\nI can't quite put my finger on why this bugs me, but this just doesn't strike me as a town response to a very straightforward question.<br>\n<br>\nIn ISO 13, he states that he hasn't responded to CS's points simply because they weren't directed at him. That's a pretty weak excuse to not answer questions. In his own example of a guy addressing a crowd about him, I don't see any reason why the accused can't stand up and refute the points, once again speaking to everyone.<br>\n<br>\nThe funny thing, ISO 13 is all excuse as to why he isn't answering CS's questions, and he does absolutely nothing to actually respond. The whole post feels like a red herring to me. Especially with the amount of quotes he uses to fluff it up.<br>\n<br>\nIn ISO 14, he basically says everything all over again, and then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">finally</div> responds in very weak terms, and very briefly.<br>\n<br>\nIn ISO 15, he OMGUS attacks CS pretty hard. His reasoning for suspecting him is, as far as I can tell, \"he suspected me and attacked in a way that I couldn't easily defend\". He also makes a pretty bold statement:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>\nYou, Conspiracy, I feel are scum.\n</div></blockquote>\nThis is a pretty strong statement to not follow up with a vote. Is it because you realize how weak your attack on CS is, and have scum knowledge that he's town?", "time": "Wed Jan 19, 2011 2:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

He didn't add things to a case later on unless they happened after he made his initial case. Not the case here. Had he been actually reading Mute to see if he was a legitimate scum candidate, I'd bet money in Vegas that he would not only have referenced Mute's admission in Post-52, Town ICENinja would have also taken into account unvote <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2736113#p2736113\" class=\"postlink\">Post - 48</a> and, if not dropped it altogether, waited until he had a more solid body of posts to reference. Mute's unvote post (of Javert) is not the best Mea culpa I've seen, but if sincere (and I believe it is), it covers his(Mute's) jabs at Javert sufficiently in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\n******<br>\n<br>\n@Magus<br>\nYou can add the above to my reasons why I think ICENinja is scum.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I went back and re-read ICENinja to see why he was garnering votes, I was at the thin edge of giving him the benefit of the doubt. Why?<br>\nConSpiracy said this earlier<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>..<br>\nI have played my only game here on the site with ICE.

I had only seen one game from him and he was town. I was seriously entertaining the thought that despite Javert, Edgerobin and HP making some very good points, he might be acting scummy enough to not get NKed for a purpose, just overdoing it.<br>\n<br>\nThat all ended when he laid out his \"full case\" on Mute. With the post references he(ICENinja) gave, there is just no way around it in my eyes: He laid out a bunch of references, told people what he thought it was, but using those same references not only didn't support his case, it exposed him for what he is. Scum. He didn't get any actual supporting evidence for the claim of the contradiction until he went looking for it and even that evidence fails if you look at fairly, at least in my estimation.<br>\n<br>\nSo, to answer your original question, I borrow reasons from some other folks cases that I think are solid and spot on to add to what I've said so far.<br>\n<br>\nJavert <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2736379#p2736379\" class=\"postlink\">Post-54</a>: Agree with the entire post so I won't quote it, I'll just link it.<br>\n<br>\nEdgerobin <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2739280#p2739280\" class=\"postlink\">Post-117</a>:Specifically this part\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Town should be analysing people's posts.

However town also lurk, there is explanation for townies lurking, either disinterest or real life keeping them busy. Yes it is warning players not to lurk, if they can't handle the game they should not have signed or should replace out and send flowers to the mod as an apology for signing and then flaking. Assuming players signed to play the game and be involved in finding scum, lurking then becomes a scum tell. I see no point wagoning lurkers during the early stages of a day, it's much more beneficial to go after the information/reaction wagons such as Javerts/Ice's/Mute's/Mine where you will get accusation/defense/etc and just get more information on the table. Voting someone for not being caught up with the game isn't valuable until it actually gets to the point where we are about to lynch someone to end the day.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>don't like the fact that he has defended Javert for his attempt at reaction fishing while completely negating the whole exercise.

I post my thought process as it comes and there isn't a huge amount of filtering (when I'm town at least), and in general just react to posts and comment on them in the spur of the moment and post. I saw a bunch of silliness, and 3 people falling for this silliness, so having figured out what was going on I wanted to point out what was going on. <br>\n<br>\nAlso this link to magnus you are making with me is a HUGE stretch and how you can possibly fathom such a scum pairing on day 1 without a single flip is beyond me. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>David's reaction to magnus's questions is proof that he isn't taking the game serious OR magnus seriously.

It's the whole stop and think what you are trying to accomplish with his post. I mean what did he expect me to answer? He posted 6 questions, half of which I could have written several-thousand-word-essays to respond with. He didn't specify anything with the quesitons, just left open-ended broad questions. Would you rather I have written those thousand word essays as a response to show how serious I am about this game? I don't think anyone wants that. I opted for one liners instead.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Rob: By all means, I was curious as to Ice's wagon. I felt and still do feel it is a legitimately scummy wagon to some extent and was thinking of putting my vote on him, I don't need to hide that. You don't see any case from Parker about ICE because I haven't made one, the case has been made, when the case was first made I found Mute scummier than Ice based on the cases alone, based on the player reactions to the 2 wagons I found ICE somewhat scummier than Mute at times. He has made some comments which just don't rub off as town responses, but other posts such as his <a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2739616#p2739616\" class=\"postlink\">124</a> do seem like town responses. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI do agree with ICE that there is no reason for a claim at this point.

You seem to disagree with him a lot, but you make good points.

Do you feel like David is more likely to flip scum than other players right now?</div></blockquote>\n\nI actually have a feeling that he could be scum and here is why.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like the fact that he has defended Javert for his attempt at reaction fishing while completely negating the whole exercise. While I feel that yes Javert put the attention on himself, how can ANYONE think he was pro-town enough to be defended like DP was doing. The fact that he completely ruined the gambit to me means that he was doing 2 things.<br>\n<br>\n1. defending Javert because DP thinks (or maybe knows) he is town<br>\n2. taking the attention off magnus\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhich of DP's posts is this in reference to?<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to rebut your DP case in advance of DP doing so - but I'll say now that I think points 1-2  of yours aren't scummy (from DP), point 3 is kind of \"so what?\" (a single non-adding post is hardly uncommon), 4 is just wrong (I see that DP has already answered this point - so I will say I agree with him. He (wrongly imo) advoctates lurker lynching on the basis that lurking is scummy. He's wrong on that point, but if he thinks lurking is scummy, which a lot of people seem to, then it isn't a policy lynch)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>\nAnd no, it is absolutely not time for claim. My case against Mute is very sound, and hardly anyone has touched on it. A sizable case was just thrown down against DP, and while I may not fully agree with it, it carries some merit. A claim right now would help scum significantly, and town not at all.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nIf I was still deciding among my top suspects, this would have changed my mind in and of itself. This is just the mafia equivalent of \"hey, look over there\".<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Jav wrote:</cite>\nI would not be adverse to a hammer without even letting ICEninja claim if he is going to try and be squirrelly about it.

A lynch without a claim is bad - but not lynching somebody because they don't claim is infinitely worse.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>\nI think lurking is scummy. However town also lurk, there is explanation for townies lurking, either disinterest or real life keeping them busy. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yes it is warning players not to lurk, if they can't handle the game they should not have signed or should replace out and send flowers to the mod as an apology for signing and then flaking. Assuming players signed to play the game and be involved in finding scum, lurking then becomes a scum tell.</div> I see no point wagoning lurkers during the early stages of a day, it's much more beneficial to go after the information/reaction wagons such as Javerts/Ice's/Mute's/Mine where you will get accusation/defense/etc and just get more information on the table. Voting someone for not being caught up with the game isn't valuable until it actually gets to the point where we are about to lynch someone to end the day.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nScratch what I said above - you're pushing a policy lynch (though, not in the simplistic way ICE initially claimed).<br>\n<br>\nThe bolded part in particular sent the \"policy lynch alarm bells\" ringing for me. See, you aren't asking \"Is this player more likely to be scum than town?\" What you are saying is \"To discourage people from lurking, I am going to assume that lurking is motivated by scummy reasons\". Thus, you're basically pushing a policy lynch but disguising it as a proper lynch.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CS wrote:</cite>\n1. The vote may be dropped, the case certainly isn't. You voted for him for changing reasons. The vote was a bandwagon-vote, with no clear reason. No good.<br>\n2. Well, you were. That is even worse than still are. You changed your mind about it as soon as you are called scummy for mentioning a policy lynch. That seems to me you want to lose the attention.<br>\n3. Well, no need to quote ICE, since you can find yourself what is bad about this.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nThe interesting thing about this is that, as you point out, on each one Mute's response is basically to say that something WAS his position, but he's now changed. See:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>\n1. You call me out for my vote on Javert, which I should remind you has been dropped by now.<br>\n2. You say that I am \"subtly trying to get someone lynched\" by bringing up policy lynching inappropriately, which is not the case anymore.<br>\n3. I voted for him because I felt he was scummy in his posting in the beginning of the game.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nHe's not admitting he was wrong; nor is he actually defending himself in any real way.", "time": "Fri Jan 21, 2011 4:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

He never said Javert was scum with magnus.  Ice was the one who implied this.<br>\nHis \"disgust\" about the policy lynch still feels forced.<br>\nHis answers and reactios still feel forced and vary according to the way in which the town leans.\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>As you can see, you argued that Javert could only know magnus_orion was scum if he, himself, was scum. That would be bussing. Mute thought that might warrant a Modkill. He was wrong, but his thought process was valid. He didn't say Javert was or wasn't scum. He just didn't think Javert was bussing, as you portrayed.\n</div></blockquote>\nThen what reason did Mute have to suspect Javert if he didn't think he had scum knowledge? It's the only way that his actions could be viewed as sucmmy, at least from what I can see.</div></blockquote>\nNo.  Javert refused to answer questions.  Javert was deliberately uninformative.  Mute even stated that he would unvote if Javert provided reasons.\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>\nThe very same tactics you expressed were the correct way to act might just apply to both Mute and Javert. SPECIALLY Javert (Which you decided to vote in that post).\n</div></blockquote>\nI'm fairly certain I SPECIFICALLY said that Javert participated in doing this. I don't believe Mute did anything to advance the game at the beginnings.</div></blockquote>\nBut you didn't consider Javert was advancing the game at the beginning.  That's what I was getting at.  You never thougth Javert might be reaction hunting?<br>\n<br>\nI suppose this finally relies on your explanation that you, yourself, were reaction hunting no matter what you thought about Javert's possible motivations.  <br>\n<br>\nBut, as I expressed earlier, I have a lot of trouble trusting you.  I try to put myself in your shoes but things just don't fit.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ice wrote:</cite>People have done a lot of accusing me of being on and off opportunistic wagons, but people really need to be looking at Prox and Jerbs.

I haven't overlooked either of them.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>Jerbs too has only three posts this game, but I feel his posts to be more town-driven than anything.</div></blockquote>really?  Why?<br>\nI agree with David about the difference between Jerbs and prox.  Jerbs tries to posts more and fill but still active lurks.  Prox acknowledges he doesn't post much but seem to try and cover the game in a genuine way.  That being said, I wish he reads the whole game.  Not just skim posts entirely.<br>\n<br>\nI keep second guessing myself when I read ICE because he seems so logical within his posts.

You need to take thinks a bit more calmly.  Don't assume everything will be black or white.  Things don't have to follow one pattern.  Claiming and not claiming, agreeing or denouncing the claim... everything, will have a motive and that motive can be subject to questioning giving us more information.  <br>\n  <br>\nWhat you see as an opportunity for alleged scum to slip from your fingers, I see as an opportunity to keep on allowing players to link with each other forming a net that, one day, will come to scum's behinds.<br>\n<br>\nBased on the events of the game so far, I don't think you're scum.

You raise some decent points about him from the very early game but I've personally come to the conclusion that Mute was honest about his mafia experience when answering ICE game-start questions. I find new players hard to read when either alignment, to me at least, they can go from looking uber town to scummy as hell in the same post simply because of their inexperience and to be honest, from my own experience when I started playing mafia, I tend to have a soft spot for them (and yes, that attitude has bitten me in the ass from time to time).  So, I have no definite read on Mute but the impression I have of him at the moment is generally positive. I do know he won't be getting my vote today for anything that is based solely on what he has done in the game to this point.<br>\n<br>\nAs for what ICE as said about him (you and he are the only two voting Mute at the moment I think), well, you know what I think about him. Anything ICE has put forward about Mute is not even being considered by me at this point. If it turns out I'm wrong about ICE, then I'll re-read what he said about Mute in a different light. But I wouldn't put too much hope in his arguments swaying me even if he does ultimately flip town. As I said above, I don't think Mute has done anything irredeemable to this point in the game.<br>\n<br>\nThat pretty much sums up what I think of the case on Mute at the moment.<br>\n<br>\n******<br>\nThe David Parker Case: I stated earlier that I liked the way magnus was thinking and I don't consider his thoughts about DP as invalid but they are not the sort of thing you make a serious case out of without additional evidence, even on Day 1.

If I think somebody is scum, I am going to be push for their lynch unless there is a good reason to wait (i.e. waiting on a Cop result, seeing if there is a plan for night-actions which can increase the Town's chances of winning, etc.).  As I explained earlier, my tolerance for long games has become increasingly eroded over the several years I have been on scum (and despite the join date of this account, I have actually been around on scum since 2005), and so if I can get a lynch on the scummiest player in the game after discussion (i.e. not a randomwagon), I will push for it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.)</div> As an aside, it is funny how you say things are not \"black or white.\"  Although I (the player behind the account) agree with you, I try to play as Javert when I play under this account.

This is concerning, since it suggests David is more concerned with the attitude of the town as a whole, and how it behaves and reacts to certain actions (and suggests David seeks to control these aspects to some degree), rather than the alignments of individual players. This is an attitude which suggests scum motivation behind David's actions, especially considering the underwhelming amount of pressure on Javert at the time. His attempt to bring order to chaos I believe to be a result of his attempt to bring the game to a point where it can be predicted and controlled effectively, so that he may better fulfill his scum win condition. In particular, I believe this to be contrasted to a more town motivation, which would seek to see how Javert responds to the pressure being applied, in order to better gauge Javert's alignment, and the alignments of the players wagoning him, especially when he believes scum may have been prepared to take advantage of this situation and reveal themselves somewhat by joining the wagon (narrowing down suspects, of course, always being an important consideration for a pro-town player).<br>\nAlternatively, david may have seen this as an opportunity to behave in a manner he believed to be \"pro-town\" by diffusing an argument between townies. This is telling because he remains uncertain of Javerts alignment, but does not desire a wagon against javert for reaction purposes, and has in fact resisted the formation of such a wagon.

I will say that in the unlikely event (unlikely in my opinion at least) ICE does ultimately flip town, most of my bad feelings about David are going to go away.

DP's made some efforts at defending himself, so there is more I want to say. Let me go through this:<br>\n<br>\nTo begin with, I asked you to explain this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>\nI don't like the fact that he has defended Javert for his attempt at reaction fishing while completely negating the whole exercise. While I feel that yes Javert put the attention on himself, how can ANYONE think he was pro-town enough to be defended like DP was doing. The fact that he completely ruined the gambit to me means that he was doing 2 things.<br>\n1. defending Javert because DP thinks (or maybe knows) he is town<br>\n2. taking the attention off magnus\n</div></blockquote>\n\nI thought maybe I was missing something, but I'm not. Quoting from your ISO 21:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>\nthis is where he is defending (protecting, or whatever else you want to call it) Javert because people are voting him<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>\nI'm disappointed by players reactions to Javert's antics. They are searching for reactions and you guys are giving them - bad ones.<br>\n<br>\nHe is moving us out of RVS even if it's by drawing negative attention to himself. Now get your votes off him.<br>\n<br>\nI'll be looking at the various reactions to Javert to see which is most scummy.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nthis is where he admits he has ruined javert's attempt at reaction fishing\n<blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>\nSorry for ruining your little \"ploy\" but frankly I wasn't that interested in magnus's reaction and don't think it would have been as revealing as you are making it to be. It may have been interesting to see whether he bandwagoned you or not, but I could see him doing that as town or scum. As it stands, it was more important to diffuse the situation and get people off your back.\n</div></blockquote>\nSo yes, Javert's play while not being a town tell in my eyes, was definitely a move that benefited town (YEAH I KNOW CONTRADICTION)\n</div></blockquote>\n\nFrom the very first of those quotes you post, and it's even clearer in the second, DP clearly doesn't think Jav's \"antics\" are going to achieve anything. So he isnt \"undermining\" Javert - because he doesn't think there is anything to be undermined.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>\nand once that happened nobody paid any attention to magnus and what does DP get for taking the attention off magnus and defending Javert for his attempt to end RVS and reaction fish (which DP ruins) he gets this post from magnus\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhich just doesn't make sense. Plenty of people don't like gambits, and DP thought it was useless. It may have pulled attention off magnus, but you haven't proven at all that that is what DP was trying to do, let alone that he was trying to do it for scummy reasons as opposed to genuinely thinking the gambit was unreliable.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>\nit is just pinging on my scumdar, in the end it could be nothing but in my head I am skeptical about the whole thing and David is right in the middle of it all\n</div></blockquote>\n\nYou aren't being skeptical, you're being paranoid/conspiratorial. David makes a post attacking what he thinks is bad. In doing so, David defends Magnus. Big deal.<br>\n<br>\nAnd...coming right back to the very first quote I quoted from you, DP had been suspicious of ICE for some time. Painting it as a sudden turnabout is just rubbish.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>I will go ahead and point out the obvious:<br>\n<br>\nJust because ICEninja claims to only have one partner, it does not make it true.  Scum who seem to \"give up\" often leave Towns with at least one final poison pill as an attempt at sowing confusion.  I will believe it when I see it.<br>\n<br>\nConSpiracy, I am going to kindly ignore your commentary on how you think I should play.</div></blockquote>\n\n^ This. Especially given that  his 194 shows he was clearly still thinking about the game, including its saccharine ending of \"I'm helping town as much as I can at this point because in serious honestly, I would prefer town to win than the other scum team. I want them caught.\" It reads more like mafia trying to appear to be town's best friend (a really weird thing in and of itself) than mafia actually wanting to help the town. Basically, I'm treating everything he said as likely BS.</div></div>", "time": "Tue Jan 25, 2011 4:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

Scum can be caught using one post; you do not need a multitude of posts or a pattern to catch scum.

Your question itself both implies that (i) one post is not enough to catch scum, and (ii) I was not being condensed enough.

Scum can be caught using one post; you do not need a multitude of posts or a pattern to catch scum.  Post 47 is, in my opinion, one of those rare posts that is enough for me to push a lynch on alone.  Your question itself both implies that (i) one post is not enough to catch scum, and (ii) I was not being condensed enough.  Not only is one post sufficient to catch scum, but my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741548#p2741548\" class=\"postlink\">Post 148</a> is about as condensed as a case can possibly get. <br>\n<br>\nSecond, you had just asked me (essentially) the same question: what is &#8220;SO BAD&#8221; ICEninja?  And I had already responded to that in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2740121#p2740121\" class=\"postlink\">Post 138</a> &#8211; also in a &#8220;condensed&#8221; manner.<br>\n<br>\nSo when you then asked me for a &#8220;condensed case&#8221; on ICEninja, I felt you were just dragging your feet and being purposefully obstinate.  I was already being short and to the point about ICEninja, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> other players were making cases against ICEninja (see, e.g., edgerobin, HumblePoirot, Oso).  That&#8217;s a fairly strong indicator that you were not only turning a blind eye to my case, but to the ICEninja case as a whole.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone, cont. wrote:</cite>I will take note that you are ignoring a very strong case on David Parker, I just skimmed your posts and you have yet to comment on anything I have said about David's play and given he defended you early on for no reason what so ever, to me just makes me more skeptical of your relationship in this game.</div></blockquote>\nActually, I directly commented on the DavidParker &#8220;case&#8221; in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741241#p2741241\" class=\"postlink\">Post 145</a>.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone, Post 218 wrote:</cite>So today David votes me but doesn't give a reason, hasn't really even attempted to make a case on me, and Javert follows him</div></blockquote>\nI called you out as a probable scum-partner for ICEninja on Day One; my vote on you has nothing to do with DavidParker&#8217;s vote.  But nice try.<br>\n<br>\nThe case on you is largely based on the obliviousness (and constant questioning) you seem to show towards the possibility of ICEninja being scum, which is particularly absurd given that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">multiple</div> players in the game were making cases against ICEninja.  Furthermore, I felt that in the midst of the ICEninja wagon, you were pushing a DavidParker based on bad reasons (as I explained above in Post 145).  This is enough to vote for you right now.</div></blockquote>\n\nok see if I can do this real fast before bowling<br>\n<br>\n1. the odds of 1 post being enough to know somebody is scum is very rare, but I guess it is possible, although I can't ever remember any single post that makes me go OMG I am 100% sure he is scum, unless he slips HUGE and that one post wasn't a huge scum slip.<br>\n<br>\n2. your post 148 was referring to that one post, which is also the post that I agreed with your assessment, I didn't feel that 1 post was enough to lynch him. I started to read through and I kept getting distracted by David so I pointed out his multitude of posts<br>\n<br>\n3. your response to my \"what is so bad about Ice\" question was this <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RobCapone, what is \"so bad\" about ICEninja? I think he is lying; and I think he is scum. I read his explanations and I do not believe them. </div></blockquote>\nwhich is not enough to convince anyone to lynch somebody.<br>\n<br>\n4. as to what I was referring to about the points on Ice, if somebody is going to convince me to change my beliefs and follow them they need to A. tell exactly what this person did that was scummy and B. why that action was scummy.  this is how I play, I need more than <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think he is lying; and I think he is scum. I read his explanations and I do not believe them.</div></blockquote>\n\n5. your comments on DP's case were mostly dismissive. When a player comes in during RVS and declares somebody scum like you did, you deserve all the negative attention you got, and his defending you does warrant a raised eyebrow. Plus I didn't see that as somebody who was acting like an idiot, it looked like you knew exactly what you were doing.<br>\n<br>\n6. yes you called me out as a possible scum partner right after you put your own words inside a quote and made it look like Ice said it (if I was a mod I would have mod-killed you because it is easy for people to mis-understand who actually said it) you have no actual basis for making that accusation other than calling you out for something YOU did that was scummy. I don't care if you put \"this is how it reads to me\" before it, because I missed that when reading the first time, it was only later that I saw that but I don't even care you can call me whatever you want, doesn't mean it is actually true, cause I can assure you it isn't.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"font-size: 85%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">For the record, misquoting another player is not grounds for a modkill.

I'm still reserving to post some of my other scum suspects at this point while I gather my thoughts.</div></blockquote>\nAnother reason he should place his vote on ICENinja (at this point in the game he has no vote out), although he(DP) does state he wants to gather his thoughts on other suspects and post them. But I would like to point out that DP does(sort of) imply in that first quote, that he isn't placing a vote on ICE because his(ICE's) responses are \"somewhat formidable\" but in the second says that he \"doesn't seem to defend himself very well.\". Now I'm starting to get the distinct impression that David doesn't want to vote ICENinja no matter how scummy he looks. Just making cover noises.<br>\n<br>\nThat brings me to my post earlier today: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750442#p2750442\" class=\"postlink\">Post-227</a>. What David tried to log off as my voting him for MD reasons is actually the final nail in his coffin as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to put a quote wall up so here are the relevant posts.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2743223#p2743223\" class=\"postlink\">Post-179</a>:This is where I give my thoughts on two players, David is the second one, last half of the post. Please note, that even before the ICE flip, I thought that David might have been at least testing the waters to see if he could somehow derail the ICE wagon with some sort of jarring post that would take to spotlight off of ICE. The second, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750309#p2750309\" class=\"postlink\">Post-219</a>, is where I ask him about it directly. He tries in the post right after that to deflect, at least in my opinion, the vote by classifying my vote as voting based on an MD point rather than actual evidence in the thread. Well, there you go David. All tied up in a neat little package. You were not making an opinion known, you were desperate to get pressure off your partner and you blinked.<br>\n<br>\n****<br>\n<br>\nThat brings up the question though as to why David was getting desperate to save ICE. As town, David would have voted much earlier than he did. He voiced strong suspicions of ICE twice but didn't vote until he had no choice. As scum, David would have happily thrown a partner in that much trouble under a bus unless there is something about scum in this game that is not readily visible. It makes sense (not optimal play, I'll grant that, but defensible play) to at least try and find a way to save your partner if you are about to lose half your team on Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me to why I claimed. The way my role works make sense in a multi-group game(plus like I said above, I've confused the hell out of myself and maybe someone can point out something in this post that might help me clarify my thinking) and David's reluctance to vote ICE yesterday only makes sense, to me at least, if there is some overriding factor that would make a scum player deviate so badly from optimal play. David's play yesterday certainly wasn't town in relation to ICE nor is it what I would call \"normal\" scum play either.<br>\n<br>\nSecond reason why I claimed: As I said above, my role makes sense in a multi-group game and David has by his play, in my opinion, and pretty much confirmed in my mind that ICE did believe there are two scum groups, for whatever reason, and he wasn't just poisoning the well. So, if there are indeed two scum groups, my action last night may have had a better than average chance of preventing a second kill than a normal RB would as I can block my target's entire group as well if they are, in fact, in a group. I say <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MAY HAVE</div> because I can think of several other reasons why there would not have been a second kill when I was expecting one. And yes, I even include the fact that I may be completely wrong in everything I have said above.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'll definitely name my block target by the end of the day, no matter what happens.</div>Because if turns out there is only one killing group, my block pretty much clears the target. But we have some discussion out on the table now so I'll leave it up to you folks as to when you want another talking point. If you would rather wait until we clear up some of the current stuff under discussion that's fine with me. If you want it now, I'm good with that too.<br>\n<br>\nBut no matter what else happens today, you folks <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WILL</div> have the name of the player before the game day ends, I promise.", "time": "Tue Jan 25, 2011 6:13 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

Anyway, before doing it, you should be sure about the effects your power has on town.</div></blockquote>\n\n@Edger<br>\nThe reluctance stems from the fact that I believe that indicating, in thread, that you have sent a message to the Mod and he answered in a certain manner violates the spirit of the \"No Quote\" even if it doesn't violate the letter of those rules. It would have been better I think, had I just went ahead and responded \"I will\" to Javert's request and deal with any complications that may have happened, when they happened instead of letting my personal thoughts on the subject get into my post.<br>\n<br>\n1)On thinking, I can agree with that. Everyone gets a role PM and you are allowed to reference pretty heavily in the game. I can stretch my personal mafia philosophy to put later role clarifications in the same category as the original Role PM.<br>\n<br>\n2)Did that one.<br>\n<br>\n3)I have to disagree on that one. Last night when I chose you as a block target, I was betting on two night kills. My role powers (even before ICE's suggesting it) indicated to me that there might be multiple groups. Whether that meant two scums groups or a combo of scum and town groups was an open question in my mind. ICE's posts did nudge me into the scum/scum thinking though.<br>\n<br>\nAs I stated in my last, you were one of the people who made my short list on people I wouldn't mind going all the way to the end game with and wouldn't it be nice if I could use this to almost categorically clear a player(s). I genuinely stink at using an RB role. Normal RBs means you have to target the actual killer of the group to prevent the kill. I've never done that so far with the role as I seem much more likely to block a useful town PR or VT instead. JKs, I hate playing them. When successful,their results are ambiguous most of the time that they are hard to interpet, at least for me.<br>\n<br>\nBut this role, because of it's broader effects, has possibilities. If I target someone and they are part of a killing group, I stop the kill. Don't have to hit on the exact killer. The flip side of that is that if I target someone (and I am not blocked by another RB type) and a kill shows up, then I can take it that person is town (additional scum groups and third party aside here) rather Than scum who just didn't do anything. So if there is only one killing group in this game, you are Iron-Clad town, from my current POV, in my book based on the results of last night. Town benefits by knowing this. I admit, I could have waited to claim with this info at a later date as your play so far in the game, to me at least, has been town. Enough so that my being NKed with this info undisclosed wouldn't have hurt you or town.<br>\n<br>\nThe part that prompted my claim was two fold. First: My case against David only makes sense (to a greater or lesser extent depending on if my RC is believed and you folks think my thinking process valid) in a two scum group game. <br>\n<br>\nSecond: My actions last night may have prevented a second kill (barring actions by other town PRs of course and if there is indeed a second mafia) and that is something town needs to know about and they need to know at some point before night. The risk to myself is irrelevant, in my opinion. The info I have is more important that my continued presence in the game after tonight, at least in my opinion because if I am right about David and also right about two scum groups, then I have given town a start on chipping away at the second group.<br>\n<br>\n4)Yes, I covered what I think the the benefits are in #3 up there. I didn't want to side track the case on David immediately. Unfortunately, I couldn't see how I could get my thoughts out on David (and be taken seriously) without giving folks my claim as back-up to show why I was thinking like I was. It's all well and good to say I don't think ICE was lying, but without also showing how what he said tends to confirm something I was already thinking, it would be supremely easy to have that dismissed seeing as how ICE was scum. The holding off on naming my target until specifically asked for it, was to hopefully keep the game focused on David. I went ahead and stated it because if I don't, I'm afraid that will become the center of discussion instead. My claim is going to draw off enough discussion as it is, I really didn't want someone to get the target and tear off on a tangent based on what is, at the moment, equivocal evidence. You(Edgerobin) being the target is useful information. However, at this point in the game, it's fairly useless for determining alignment until other matters are answered. One on hand, my blocking you pretty much makes you town. On the other hand, you stand a decent chance of being part of a killing group. Depends on what position the 2 scum group switch ends up at and and how any other PRs in the game may have interacted last night, as to how my block ultimately will affect you.<br>\n<br>\nTo the last part, until Javert asked it, I never considered \"town\" a separate and distinct group. Allied? Yes. All having to cooperate to catch scum? Certainly. But since there is no pre-existing connection prior to the game (like with other groups) it fails, at least in my opinion, the \"Mafia Game\" definition of a group. Thinking how this role might affect a group that wasn't a group in my mind up until that point, never entered my thinking.<br>\n<br>\n******<br>\nFor any interested: Why I believe there are 2 Mafia Groups and why I think ICE confirmed that. <br>\n<br>\n1)My Role Powers.<br>\n<br>\n2)ICE was PISSED!!, he had certainly convinced himself there were two group and I don't think it was faked.\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICENinja wrote:</cite>Forget it, I'm not reading all this.

(And no, I'm not partnered with Ice and trying to save myself). We can confirm there is 2 killing parties, we can confirm Oso's claim, we can make potential connections to both mafia parties. Not to mention, that why are we trying to eliminate one mafia party altogether? You seem to be assuming that their night kills are only capable of hitting town.. There is a good probabilty of them hitting scum. I mean even if we knew 100% who ice's partner was, keeping him alive, turns him into more or less a random-vig who we will later lynch. There's no reason we should be speculating too hard into Ice's scum-buddy when there is no huge gain to lynching his scum buddy over lynching scum of the opposing party. (Once again, i'm not ice's buddy trying to save myself, I honestly believe this, I'd probably be trying to prove my innocence if I was just ice's buddy at this point).<br>\n<br>\nWe have role information suggesting Edge is scum, acting upon actual role information gives just as much information as lynching somene based on analysis, and more information into the setup of the game and I see it as more likely to hit scum as well. <br>\n<br>\n@Conspiracy: So you seem to be agreeing on 2 scum parties, then how does a group-roleblock not indicate scum? It doesn't mean it is for sure, but it definitely leads to that conclusion. Scum benefit more from night killing than not night killing. THere was only one night kill; something occurred to prevent a second night kill if there is two scum parties. We have a claim regarding a role that can stop a night kill (and can target one of two players to do so, with 2 scum teams). So yeah, his roleblock is definitely an indication towards scum. And yeah, I agree with Javert you do seem to be trying to deflect attention off Edge.<br>\n<br>\n@Javert,\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>DavidParker agreed that ICEninja had the &#8220;scummiest post of the game&#8221; and yet did not vote ICEninja</div></blockquote>\nWHile, I'm not digging up an exact quote to defend myself here, I stated at the time my scum hunting isn't based on post by post basis. I prefer to look at the poster in the \"bigger picture\". A single post of anyone regardless of alignment can be made to look scummy. And I've seen town players make really scummy posts at times, a personal favorite I've come back to a few times: <a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2635198#p2635198\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 8#p2635198</a> . I died in this game and remember following it. I literally facepalmed when I read this post... I couldn't believe what I was reading. Thinking back on it, posts like this made me realize how you can't just look at PBPA. It's not that useful. I previously stated in this thread as well, I don't believe a scummy post is enough to come to the conclusion someone is scum, you have to look at the bigger picture; look at the player's intent (or what you perceive that to be) in posting a certain post. <br>\n<br>\nI do however admit to flip-flopping somewhat with regard to how I viewed Ice's defense. Some of his posts were (like this one I linked) really bad. I found them scummy, others I found genuinely town (ie one of his last ones before claiming scum). I was leaning scum on Ice, but definitely not convinced, I was probably not willing to vote him as of his most recent post before his scum claim.<br>\n<br>\n@magnus: I agree. My play today has been forced onto a \"defensive\" back foot. I don't have a strong case on anyone at this point or have a strong scum read on anyone. I'm willing to believe Oso's claim and as a result believe that Edge is scum based on role information and setup speculation that I believe to be reliable, but that isn't a personal scum read of my own. I don't actually strongly believe in my own case on Rob at this point.<br>\n<br>\nSo, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div>,<br>\n<br>\nYou guys is referring to various claims,  by Rob/Oso now Mute (maybe yourself at times, I can't remember, and as I'm mid post not going to check now), that I was \"planning to derail the Ice wagon\"; that's why I was asking how big it was.. Because asking for a vote count and how many votes a player has suddenly became \"intent to derail the wagon\". Then Mute claims I had a \"semi-allegiance\" with Ice. This has probably been the worst mis-rep of what surpassed yesterday compared to what was done by Rob and others that I can see as merely being apart of his case, and his interpretation of my play. Ie: he sees me \"checking the ice wagon, and thinking of derailing it\", while in my eyes I'm just curious as to how large the wagon has become; whether it's worthwhile to join it at this point or whether the wagon is strong enough without me, as I wasn't sure of my read on Ice.. I wanted a vote player on a swingy-player I was undecided upon. That's all it was from my perspective. Other's saw it differently. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Edge wrote:</cite>However, something bothers me in your post. Oso's power is - apparently - very strong. Why are you trying to control it?<br>\n<br>\nI am more and ore convinced that - if there are two scum parties - one decided to No Kill to discredit ICE's post. After which, seeing that there was a super-RB claim, they realised they could easily build a case on the blocked player. </div></blockquote>\nWhy not? There was only one kill last night instead of two, when we are fairly certain there is 2 scum parties. I see no reason as to why town shouldn't voice that they'd like to see Edge roleblocked again tonight as it's quite likely that it prevented a night kill last night.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>I do like Edge's post about Javert trying to guide Oso, nobody should bs telling oso how to use his role<br>\n[/quote<br>\nOnce again, repeating myself, while I know Oso is a good player, whats wrong with players voicing their opinions as to how they'd use his role if they were him. I'm sure he can come to his own conclusions, but having some input isn't a bad thing. I definitely encourage him to roleblock Edge again tonight, seeing as there was only 1 night kill last night. <br>\n<br>\n@Javert: If we do lynch knife-mafia today; at which point their scum team should be dead; wouldn't it make more sense to roleblock Edge again preventing any night kills. At which point we can simply lynch Edge to confirm oso's claim. PR Oso will surely die happily with 3 scum and only 2 town dead largely due to his efforts, and town will be in a good position.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>If there are indeed two scum groups, getting rid of one of them entirely today if we can, is worth doing irrespective of what my results from last may indicate of a possible member of a second group.\n</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>\n\nOh sure, I'd agree to this to some extent, although there is some potential town benefit to having 2 scum groups with 1 player each who may hit each other, but that'd rely on town believing to a high-degree of success that they know who Ice's scum buddy is. With roleinformation/claims that can help us there (there was a knife-kill last night, same of ice's allegieance, so you couldn't have blocked his partner), the only thing we can conclude is Edge is not Ice's scum buddy. I mean, I'm all for your analysis, but especially since I know your connections with me to Ice are entirely wrong, I thoroughly believe Edge is a valuable lynch for today.<br>\n<br>\n@Magnus: I agree with a town-read on Javert, but not your reasoning; Scum can just as easily lay a gambit to gain negative attention, and while they know it may not back off and know a wagon on them will form, they also know that if they survive day 1 they will be in a very strong position as that wagon is harder to push later, with the reasoning that \"hey you were scummy on day one for that\", when they weren't lynched day 1 for that, so why lynch them on day 4 for it? <br>\n<br>\nAnyways, As I said in response to you, I'd like this to be point-counterpoint based, and I am largely defending, I don't have a huge belief in cases against many of the players who are currently active. If I had to guess, I'd say 1-2 scum are among the lurkers (Prox/manut), and there's scum among Mute/Conspiracy. I believe Edge is likely to flip scum but solely based on Oso's claim. For now, I'm stuck mostly defending myself it seems.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPreview Edit:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Con wrote:</cite>I like this post.</div></blockquote> Oh so you like a post that discredits 2 very pro-town players at this point. Figures.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Con wrote:</cite>When Oso claimed, the first thing popped in my mind that town consists of 2 power roles: Oso's rb and a doc.

Even if town are right in assuming 2 groups of 2 scum, we have no idea of scum pr's if any.

It's a perfectly reasonable assumption it will be a shooting mafia. Oh, and he put it in quotes. I guess you are just flowing on from Rob's post where he brought up that he may potentially not believe that pro-town-Oso and pro-town-Javert are town, so you throw in a quote to make Javert look scummy that isn't even a scummy quote.

But to give you my thoughts, there are at least two things that are going to have to happen for me to seriously push at Edger today. Confirming (not just speculation, no matter how strong that speculation is in my mind) a second group and determinging the chance that a second kill wasn't prevented by some other player(s) actions or inaction.<br>\n<br>\nSince neither of those things are likely to happen today, all my blocking him last night proves (provided I wasn't blocked) is that he had nothing at all to do with Humble's death. All I can really tell with any level of certainty, based on my action last night, is what Edger <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">didn't</div> do. Not what he might/might not have tried to do.<br>\n<br>\nEdger is getting some moderate pressure today from some players based on my action and, as far as I can see, that is about as far as we are going to be able to take it today because right now, we only have three definite pieces of the set-up: Humble's alignment, ICENinja's alignment and my claim (provided you think it is a true claim) and a decent chance (in my opinion) of having guessed correctly about a forth part. Not really strong enough to push a lynch on someone based on that alone. In my opinion, it would be pretty much an informational lynch that stood a chance of hitting scum and I have no way to quantify what that chance might be other than the obvious 1 in (Alive Players - 1).

Why on earth would the second mafia party not kill? It's blatantly obvious there is two mafia parties because of the \"knife\" and the \"gun\" flavor. ICE also claimed 2 parties. They had no benefit to trying to hide themselves by not night-killing. Furthermore, Edge is claiming that the second scum team took a gambit and that their gambit will pay off if Edge is lynched... How was this mafia to expect that there was a group-roleblock player who would claim day 2 making their no-night-kill gambit worthwhile??!??! Edge seems to be implying that the mafia no-killed to frame whoever the roleblocker targeted. But, they had no idea there was a roleblocker. Furthermore, while they may decide it's possible, they wouldn't have guessed it was a group-roleblocker. And it's a dumb gambit anyways, because even if they no-kill, theres a chance the roleblocker targets them and claims and gets them lynched even though they didn't kill. <br>\n<br>\nEdge is missing the obvious. The most logical alternative to Edge not being scum is that a doctor or protector of some kind saved the \"gun\" mafia's target. Edge implying that it was some gambit to discredit Ice's claim (which was obviously true) and also to frame him (LOLWOT how did they know this was going to happen) makes him seem a whole lot scummier.

In my opinion, he showed a marked reluctance to vote ICENinja and perhaps even considered testing the waters to see if he couldn't get some sort of pressure off ICE. David does deny that in later posts of his and his reasons aren't even really that bad. He states he didn't vote ICE until the end of the day because he was looking at other players as well and he flat denies doing anything to get pressure off of ICE. I'd counter his not voting ICE, for his stated reason, because he never does vote anyone. Nor does does he take as strong a stance, as he did with ICE, against anyone until ICE came out and admitted he was scum. Then he(David) votes.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</li><li>The forth post lays out the reason why I think David has altered his normal scum game. He found him in a not very common situation for Day 1 in a mini: He was about to lose half his team. In addition, his normal play style as scum (bussing for any reason at all, that he used in his defense) hasn't done much for him. He even admitted <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2754253#p2754253\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. He's changed up because of the situation he finds himself in and because of past experience.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</li><li>Those are my reason that don't rely on anyone else. But you can go ahead and add in RobCapone's concern here, in the first part of this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2758615#p2758615\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> as it ties in quite well of what I thought of David's suggestion <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2757676#p2757676\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>\n<blockquote><div><cite>David Parker wrote:</cite>..<br>\nI think lynching who Oso claims to have blocked last night gives us just as much and probably more info than lynching someone we think is partnered with Ice.

He spins it a bit later on in the post by referencing role-information is as good as analysis but even that fails at this point. Right now, all my information confirms (if you believe it) is what Edger didn't do and that is he didn't kill Humble. And actually advocating leaving town open to 2 NKs on purpose? I think he is doing exactly what he says he isn't and that's trying to keep from being lynched himself. I have my own concerns about Edger and many folks have voiced them in one form or another since I claimed so I don't want you guys to think I don't hear what you have been saying. I have.

First: Javert is slightly scummy to me. DP's recent activity is intriguingly weird. The two main events of the last pages are an attempt at telling Oso what to do at night, on which I already commented, and DP denying the option of a mafia no-kill. I could ask him to clarify this point, but to be honest what bothers me is that he is insisting on the existence of a doc. I smell a soft-fishing here. By all means, if a doc saved me, he must not claim to save my neck. We are very likely losing our claimed town rb tonight - if his claim, as I think, is true.<br>\n<br>\nRob's case on DP looked ill-defined at day start (see my ISO #6). Now not only DP tries to discuss in-thread the existence of a doc, but Javert is trying to plan Oso's future night activity. As their scumminess increases, Rob gains townpoints.<br>\n<br>\nI am sick of only posting about me being blocked and scum not killing or stuff like that.

Personally, I have a different opinion on a couple of points.</div></blockquote>\nOh, good, subtly buddy up to the guy who just replaced in since he posted the same mimic'd suspicions of me without coming to a strong opinion of his own yet.<br>\n<br>\nYeah, because as Ice's only scum buddy I would resort to role-fishing as a last resort to try help my scum buddy once I've been lynched.. Oh wait, my scum buddy would be already dead... How is role fishing a scum tell at all considering the person you are claiming as my partner is dead? There's definitely no benefit to role fishing here for scum lol. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not denying the option of a mafia-no-kill just saying its unlikely and not smart play for them if they had a night kill. My initial thought was actually that one mafia faction might have odd night kills, and the other faction have even night kills. But if both have nightkills every night then I am more inclined to believe that a PR prevented a kill last night than they no killed. No killing as mafia on night 1 is bad play. They have a chance of hitting Prs etc, and not night killing to confuse town with the 2 scum faction is not smart play. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>edge wrote:</cite>what bothers me is that he is insisting on the existence of a doc</div></blockquote>\n\nLOL? Major misrep more??!??! I believe your scum faction was roleblocked last night. The second most likely alternative is a doctor-like PR or something else saving the gun-mafia's target. The third most likely alternative for me is gun-mafia have even night kills and knife mafia having odd night kills. The Fourth most likely alternative is the gun-mafia choosing not to night kill. That is the least likely option. As I just stated there's no benefit to it. Those 4 options are ranked in what I perceive as the most likely to have happened last night. <br>\n<br>\nyadee yah.

Right now, I think the missing kills from last night can be attributed to several different factors: (i) the \"Shooting\" Mafia may have \"no-killed\" last night in an attempt to make Edgerobin look better today; (ii) there may have been a successful Doctor protection; and (iii) each scum group might very well have a nightkill immunity.<br>\n<br>\nI 100% stand by having Oso claim who he is going to role-block each night.

I am <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> about to get lynched.<br>\n<br>\nFor starters, I think we need to question our claimed Cop today.  For <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">several</div> reasons.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1.)</div> First, the one player who died Night One -- HumblePoirot -- is the player RobCapone claims to have investigated on Night One.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.)</div> Despite apparently having zero information on Day Two, RobCapone was 100% gung-ho against DavidParker for the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">entirety</div> of Day Two.  He voted DavidParker out of the gate, and never changed his vote to another player.  A <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">real</div> Cop would probably not exhibit \"100% certainty\" on a player they did not actually investigate, because if DavidParker was not lynched but RobCapone later died and showed as Cop, the natural conclusion we would be led to is that RobCapone had had a guilty result on DavidParker on Day Two.  In other words, RobCapone's play does not match how a Cop would play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3.)</div> Then, on Night Two, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">he investigates the player everybody was probably already thinking about lynching on Day Three</div>.  On Day Three, after knowing he was going to catch flak after mislynching DavidParker, he immediately calls out a guilty on Edgerobin.  As if that were even really necessary.  Why claim a guilty result on a player who is, in all probability, already going to get lynched?  Once again, this is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> how a Cop would play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4.)</div> Then on Night Three, instead of investigating me -- which would make sense given his investigation target for Night Two -- he conveniently claims to have investigated the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">one</div> player who died overnight.  (Just like Night One.)  It makes no sense that he would, for some reason, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">avoid</div> investigating me <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but also</div> investigate Edgerobin.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">5.)</div> RobCapone just claimed he investigated Amrun because he felt Amrun was \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">bussing Edgerobin</div>\".  But if <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I</div> am \"obviously scum,\" it would seriously only make the slightest <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">ounce</div> of sense if I were scum with Edgerobin.  Anybody who thinks I could have even possibly <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">bussed</div> ICEninja, in a game where each scum group apparently only has two members, is being absolutely ridiculous.  So his alleged reasons for investigating Amrun do not even make sense.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">6.)</div> I think the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">reason</div> RobCapone did not \"investigate\" me is because I am Town, and he therefore <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">cannot</div> claim a guilty on me.  But he also cannot afford to call me Town, because that takes a player out of the pool of possible mislynches.  Therefore, he goes with the \"safest\" route -- by giving us no information whatsoever.<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR: RobCapone has claimed to investigate exactly three players.  He claims he investigated the <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">only two players who have been night-killed</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> not only that, but that he investigated them <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">on the same night they died</div>.  He also claims he investigated the \"obvious\" scum on Night Two, but chose not to investigate the \"obvious\" scum on Night Three.  And if you lynch me, you will see that the \"obvious\" scum he actually claimed a guilty on was scum, but that the \"obvious\" scum he did not investigate is Town.<br>\n<br>\nIf I am lynched today, lynch RobCapone's ass tomorrow.  No questions, no qualms, no second chances.  I called him out as ICEninja's partner on Day One, and given the way he has played, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">still</div> think he is ICEninja's partner.<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I think Mute and ConSpiracy are the most likely candidates for Edgerobin's partner.  <br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, we need to hear who Oso claims to have role-blocked.  Seeing as it is Day Four, I also would not be averse to a mass-claim.

I can't explain really why there was no kills on N2 except as the above. With everyone hot to go after my N1 Target(Edger) regardless of what DavidParker flipped (and yes, I was in that group) No-Killing on Night 2 makes a lot sense when you consider the point of view of both groups. Knife Mafia lost one and stayed hidden D2, we lynched David instead. Gun Mafia <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WAS</div> going to lose Edger on Day 3 pretty much as a given, so <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BOTH</div> groups had a motive to not NK N2 and hope that I didn't by chance pick one of the (non Edger)/(non ICENinja) members of the respective groups so that they could line up my target for a lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nObviously, if both did no-kill for that reason, they arrived at it independent of one another so it is possible (barely in my opinion) that I prevented a kill N2. I think it much more likely, based on the way I would have played in their position, that I did nothing of any note N2. I blocked Javert but I think there is a high possibility that both groups chose to not kill that night.<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me to my vote today:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RobCapone</span><br>\n<br>\n[Note:Bold in the quotes put in by me]\n<blockquote><div><cite>The OP wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">HumblePoirot, vanilla townie, Stabbed N1</div><br>\nDavidParker, vanilla townie, Lynched D2.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Edgerobin, Gun mafia goon, lynched D3</div><br>\n{manutdforev10} replaced by <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Amrun, vanilla townie, Shot N3</div></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2774822#p2774822\" class=\"postlink\">RobCapone - [url=https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2774822#p2774822]here[/url]</a> wrote:</cite>I am cop<br>\n<br>\nIf town I get innocent<br>\nIf not I get guilty<br>\nHe did throw in a comment that I'm not guaranteed to be sane but n1 <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I got innocent on Humble</div> which confirmed I'm not insane or paranoid leaving normal or naive<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I got guilty on edge</div> so that eliminated naive.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2782532#p2782532\" class=\"postlink\">RobCapone [url=https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2782532#p2782532]here[/url]</a> wrote:</cite>we are doing great but I suck at choosing investigations.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't want to choose Javert because I felt he was obviously scum based on him being blocked and both kills failed. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">My inno last night was amrun</div>, I can't tell you why chose him but just something about his post yesterday bugged me it felt like he was bussing Edge since I got a guilty.<br>\n..<br>\n[snip]</div></blockquote>\nThree dead players that coincide with Rob's investigations. The two innocents show up on the dead list before we get his results, the scum shows up there as a direct result of two night actions. Mine, which incriminates him, and Rob's which leaves little room for doubt.<br>\n<br>\nN1 with only a single kill and my ability to block shared group powers, along with the individual targeted, pretty much guaranteed that Edger was swinging closer to the beginning of the game than the end of it. Rob fake claimed cop to get some humongous town cred by bussing Edger and added validity by claiming HumblePoirot as his Night 1 investigation. I bought it. Humble is a good player to confirm as town or scum early in the game if you can so his(Rob's) choice of Humble didn't register as even slightly off.<br>\n<br>\nWhat is off is his choice of investigation for last night. Not that he chose Amrun specifically but rather I thought he chose Edger as a target because of my block. He never did actually say though (or if he did, I couldn't find it) so it follows that since Javert was blocked on a No-Kill night, he'd target him. I know I suggested Prox or Jerbs as alternatives to whoever he(Rob) might be thinking of targeting but I wasn't surprised that he didn't pick either of them. With so much going on right at the moment, I would probably put the two \"lurkers\" low on the priority list if I were a cop instead of an RB.<br>\n<br>\nPoint being, there are two things has to do. 1)Avoid a counter claim and 2)Make sure no \"innocent\" he gets shows up as \"mafia\" in the dead list.<br>\n<br>\nHe can't do much about #1 except take a deep breath, cross his fingers and hope for the best. #2 is best done by selling the town the only result he knows is true (Edgerobin), referencing the dead guy (Humble) and then killing his investigation. If he happens to kill Member #2 of the opposite scum team, so much the better. He can sell a ture innocent to the town and have at least that person on his side for the rest of the game.", "time": "Tue Feb 08, 2011 6:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

And I think the other missing kill can be explained either by (i) a scum group no-killing; or (ii) a scum group trying to kill a member of the other scum group and failing because of some sort of unnightkillability.  There might even be some third explanation; but we won't know until we finish the mass-claim.<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nAnd just so it is clear: I do not think there is really a need for voting right now.<br>\n<br>\nPre-Post Edit: Mass-claim is not a \"scum move\"; it's a logical move that Towns make once the game has reached a point where either (i) the Town is in LyLo and so there is no harm in mass-claiming and potentially a boon, or (ii) the Town is in such a good position that the Town is better off coordinating to quickly root out the final scum instead of destroying ourselves with our ignorance.

We won't be sure until after the game is over but with the early indications of the thread's willingness to lynch Edger based on my block alone, I think it highly likely that both scum groups left me alone Night 2 hoping that 1)Gun Mafia: Lending weight to Edger's defense by No-Killing so as to make it look as if there is another role out there preventing kills, in addition to making ICENinja's rant look like he was just adding confusion and the possibility of framing block target when Edger flipped scum. 2)Knife Mafia: Down to one member, No-Killed to frame my target.<br>\n<br>\nThat is why I was (still am to certain degree) against pre-announcing my block targets. Unless it is bulletproofed, it's too easy to get a townie lynched. But seeing as how it's getting on into the game, most of my objections to announcing block targets are pretty much gone at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nSo, if I'm right and you didn't save me Night 2, you had an active save going into Night 3. Knife Mafia had to kill last night. A Claimed buffed-up RB and Claimed Cop with the only safe bet they can make is that both are true claiming and try and kill one of them. Rob is the most dangerous to either Mafia if true-claimed so he would most likely draw kills and by that thinking Doc protection, so I would be the target. I'm still alive so that points strongly to the fact I may have saved myself last night by blocking Prox or that Knife Mafia WIFOMed itself into targeting Rob and you prevented their kill.<br>\n<br>\nRob <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IS</div> Gun Mafia. The only reason I'm not dead by a bullet is because Gun Mafia went Doc hunting last night instead of taking a chance I'd draw Doc protection and having a failed kill. Rob knows he's mafia so it wouldn't be much of a stretch to convince himself that I was the more \"obvTown\" of the two claimed roles and more likely to draw protection than his role.<br>\n<br>\nSo, Rob is scum. Neither Javert or Prox look good but depending on what has actually happened, neither is obvScum based on my blocks alone.<br>\n<br>\nIt all depends on how you folks think the two scum groups acted N2. My personal opinion agrees a bit with what Rob said (I think it was Rob) that No-Killing early in the game is bad, we have Edger's flip and ICENinja's flip to reinforce that both groups were thinking that on N1. My claim changed that though, now No-Killing N2 looks attractive despite the fact is runs counter to generally \"good\" scum play.<br>\n<br>\nIf we are not going to lynch Rob today, my vote would be Prox (yes, I'm buying into the hype on this role a bit) as I think it more likely I blocked a kill N3 than on N2 but with an even chance (based on how I think things have worked so far in the game) that Prox is gonna flip town.<br>\n<br>\nRob is my choice for today with Prox as a distant second and Javert as <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VERY</div> distant third.

I am not advocating lynching the cop. I am advocating the lynch of the scum who has constructed a fake-claim of cop using the one piece of information he is certain of (His partner's, Edgerobin, alignment) and two pieces of information that were public knowledge before he made us aware of them. The alignment of HumblePoirot and Amrun.<br>\n<br>\nHe constructed the fake-claim N2 with input from his partner (who was going to be swinging in any case) so as to give him(you Rob) the maximum amount of town credibility with the least amount of risk. It is a gambit. The only dicey part is/was a counter claim and inadvertently \"clearing\" the remaining member of the Knife Mafia and either having him in the endgame with you (Rocks Fall, Everbody Dies) or show up as non-investigation immune scum in the dead list after being \"cleared\".<br>\n<br>\nAvoiding the first part relies partially on luck but also some not-to-difficult guess work based on my claimed role and the power you know at least one of the mafia groups have. I'ma guess 2 groups of plain-vanilla goon scum groups. With my claimed powers, taking the shot that there is no cop isn't that much of a risk. A cop/buffed RB on town side vs 2 plain vanilla scum groups is tilted in favor of town. What is much more likely is that the game is balanced on town side with super RB/&lt;weaker role(s) here&gt; combo rather than a super RB/Cop/&lt;whatever&gt; combo. The Cop false-claim isn't at that much of a risk for a counter even with only my claim showing.<br>\n<br>\nThe second part is easier but actually more risky if you think about it. You can only \"investigate\" dead folks. The only person whose alignment you are certain of (other than your own) is Edger's. Even selling \"innocents\" (fairly safe in a one Mafia Game) has different consequences here. So your targets have to already be dead or you have to kill them as you \"investigate\" them.", "time": "Wed Feb 09, 2011 8:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

There is a possibility that I did in fact block him from killing on N2. If we take it that Magnus saved me night 2 then he could have indeed been a second killer that was blocked.

So that block has a high probability of having done just exactly what we all thought it did: Blocked a kill. After I claimed, it became a bit more problematic. I got lucky N1. Unless I have been supremely lucky (as in all the stars aligned lucky) he is probably the only scum I blocked because I chose Edger and Javert to block for both the same reasons.

Many scum can do it right, but I guess your inexperience as scum handicapped you.</div></blockquote>\nI just read over ICEninja's posts, and found nothing about ICEninja claiming to be inexperienced as scum.  (I admit, though, that this is information can be deduced from ICEninja's signature.)  But in context of the game, this comment feels like it is referring to a conversation that I would expect to see in a scum quicktopic.  Something like:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja, Hypothetical QT Discussion wrote:</cite>Hey partner -- looks like it's just the two of us, so there's probably another scum team.  I've only finished one game as scum so far, so I'm a bit inexperienced, but I will try to play just like I normally do.  After all, we should try to lynch the other mafia team...</div></blockquote>\n\nI also think it is notable that the only time Prox actually interacted with anybody in the game over anything substantive was to argue with ICEninja after ICEninja was already lynched.  <br>\n<br>\nHere's my best guess for how things went down for ICEninja and Prox.  I am assuming at this point that scum could indeed talk with each other via a QuickTopic during the Day (though it is certainly not necessary to see the pairing).<br>\n<br>\nOnce the game gets rolling, Prox gets annoyed that ICEninja is being wagoned, so instead of doing anything, he only comments on ICEninja and claims he does not have time to read the game.  ICEninja complains about the game in the QuickTopic, and probably asks Prox to unvote in such a way that maybe other people will unvote, too.  Hence we get <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741933#p2741933\" class=\"postlink\">Post 156</a>, where Prox uses plenty of language in favor of ICEninja (\"I might be getting caught up in a fallacy,\" \"I'm sure both town AND scum try too hard to look like townies,\" and \"there's no need to rush.\")  But after assessing the situation and deciding that trying to save ICEninja is probably a lost cause, Prox just votes ICEninja again.  Which likely did not go over well with ICEninja.<br>\n<br>\nThen, when ICEninja has been lynched (and basically says \"I hate all of you, you suck\"), Prox throws in a jab -- \"I guess your inexperience as scum handicapped you.\"  Which ICEninja responds to in kind -- \"your reasons sucked.\"  Not only does this strike me as distancing, but it also strikes me as two scum who are angry at each other, and with each other's play.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then by Day Two, Prox realized he was probably not going to win and so just stopped trying.

If someone wanted to frame Javert, my block of him on a no-kill night would do that just great. Hell, even Javert figured he had and better than even chance of being lynched today with my block on him. They had no idea that the pressure would never really develop on Javert today. At least not enough to go out of their way to try and add to that by trying to night-kill frame him ESPECIALLY since they had two targets in me and you. And remember, if Magnus saved me night 2, gun mafia knows there is a protective role going into night 3. So they have two nice juicy town PRs and probably only one protector.<br>\n<br>\nB)Again, why. Same logic as above. Two PRs that way more dangerous to him than Amrun.<br>\n<br>\nThere is one other way that I did think of that we can both still be alive and both still be town (but it relies on you having very bad luck). Gun Mafia got so paranoid about losing another Night Kill that they bypassed the whole \"which PR might draw the protection\" dilemma and went Doc hunting. That they shot the target of your investigation was just pure coincidence. Bad luck does happen, just like good luck does and it has to be factored in but I just don't know how to do that with any accuracy.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have a problem with your choice of HumblePoirot. I've played with him before and he's a good town player so I also assume he's decent at playing scum. Targeting him for an investigation makes sense to me N1 in any game so you know you can trust him (if town) or get rid of him immediately (if scum). That he also drew a Night-Kill right out of the barn doesn't surprise me either. It makes sense (if you have played with him before) that he has a good chance of drawing the attention of both Mafia and Town PRs night 1, just on general principles.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have a problem with you investigating Edger. I blocked him on a night where we only had 1 kill when the general thinking was we should have had 2.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have a real problem with you not investigating me over someone else. My block of Edger and your investigation, if you are town, of Edger pretty much confirms me as town as there is no reason to set up that elaborate a bus on Day 2 with neither Edger or myself under any serious scrutiny Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have a real problem with you investigating Amrun in and of itself.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I do have a problem with is not investigating Javert. After your investigating Edger on my block, it looks as if you don't want to confirm him nor do you want to waste an NK on a very good chance at a mis-lynch if you are scum. As you said, he was so scummy you didn't feel the need to confirm him but the fact is that you had the claimed power to do just that, confirm him one way or the other and you didn't. It looks like you left mis-lynch material out there to use at your leisure.<br>\n<br>\nSo, bad luck if you are town. The game has played out to look(to me at least) as if you constructed a claim to bus a partner that was going to swing anyway, crossed your fingers, and then used someone already dead and someone that you killed to get \"confirmed\" alignments on your investigations for innocents while leaving the one person most implicated by my role-blocks just flapping in the breeze for use later.<br>\n<br>\nIt is not any one thing Rob, its the whole series of events. The most damning part of it is that after I claimed, most all of my results became subject to manipulation by scum (something I have to think on if I get a similar role again as far as when to claim goes) and you had the claimed power to clear or confirm Javert as scum and didn't. That is not town. That is not even anti-town. That is scum leaving usable material for later.<br>\n<br>\nBut<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: RobCapone</span><br>\nPending replacement, I'll vote Prox. If he does flip Knife Mafia then we have an explanation for one of the no-kills night two and the no-kill last night (not because of my block though). As I said earlier, most folks are assuming magnus saved me N2 so that would clear Javert based on my block. If this role can't definitively and reliably point out scum, I'll do my best to try and confirm town with it.", "time": "Thu Feb 10, 2011 6:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

It's me pretty much thinking out loud about the claimed PRs/VTs (and yes, I did try to step out of my role at look at my claim as well. So I included myself here).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Oso - Super RB.</div><br>\nClaimed Day 2 with a block of Edger. Edger flipped Gun Mafia. I'm not Gun Mafia as bussing Edger at that point makes no sense. ICE's flip would have confirmed to Gun Mafia there was a second group so no reason at all for either Edger or I to be worried in the slightest. Neither of us had any serious doubts thrown at us Day 1. Could be Knife Mafia though. I saw the trouble ICE was in and bussed him hard despite it being Day 1. Cobbled up this claim when we had a one kill night and ICE and I were reasonably certain there was a second group. I knew Edger stood a good chance of being \"other\" mafia because I did block Edger. I am an RB, just a scum RB. Plan being to No-Kill and frame my targets. Hopefully though, my play thus far has dispelled any thoughts along those lines.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Rob - Cop</div><br>\nClaimed Day 3 with a guilty on Edger. Edger flipped scum. Rob is not Knife Mafia. I have not blocked Rob(if you folks do believe my claim) so since ICENinja is dead there is no way I could have prevented any Knife Mafia kills so far in the game if Rob is Knife Mafia. So if Rob is Knife Mafia, any kill attempts he made would have to have failed by other means. He could be Gun Mafia based on the reasoning I used in previous posts. Small disclaimer here: I think my reasoning is sound but I will go so far as to give Rob the fact that what I am using to make me think he is guilty can be explained by a run of bad luck and coincidences and there is the matter that we have the whole game claimed right now and there is no counter to the Cop claim so at it's very base, either he is the Cop or the game doesn't have one. Everybody's own personal theory of game balance is going to have to come into play there. If you think game balance says there is a cop in this game, then no matter what I (or anyone else) say or how much sense it may(or may not) make, you really have no choice, Rob is the cop.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">magnus_orion - Nerfed Doctor</div><br>\nClaimed Day 4. No doubt in my mind. He is 100% what he claims to be. No Counter claim but even before that we had a no-kill night. Even hypothetically granting I blocked one of them by blocking Javert, he(magnus) pretty much had to stop one himself. I am reversing myself on one of the no-kills being explained by one (or both) of the Mafia groups deliberately No-Killing N2. Unlike N1, when Gun Mafia had no reason to think there was a role with my powers in the game, on Night 2 there is plenty of reason to believe (or strongly suspect) that there is a protector in the game but the only way to know for sure is to hit the obvious target. If you are right, you have confirmed the presence of a protector and in addition, shows you a claim you can't use as a false claim. If not, you just killed a dangerous PR. That is a Good/Very Good no-brainer choice there. I'm a bit put out with myself though, that it took me this long to shoot great big holes through that thought. So magnus is confirmed town in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Javert - VT</div><br>\nI think he is most probably town. That said, he was the target of a block by me on N2 (a no-kill night) so I'ma condense this a bit. If the missing knife kills are a result of a flaked player, he's probably town because magnus saved me from a gun kill N2 and Javert was blocked so he couldn't be killing anyone unless I just happened to luck out and get the second member of the gun mafia team and Magnus didn't save me. If the missing knife kill N2/N3 can't be explained by a flaked player and we've have had 2 active groups all three nights, then he's right back in the pool of suspects again in my mind. That is where I am going round and round in my mind in regards to Javert. If we have two active killing groups (prox not flaked knife mafia) then either magnus saved me from a \"double tap\" and Javert is town, or that magnus still saved me but I blocked one of the kills. Even if Prox(now Shattered) was Knife Mafia and flaked, Javert could have still been blocked and it only looks as if magnus saved me. If I am completely honest with myself, a part of the reason I am so put out with Rob at the moment may be because he <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DIDN'T INVESTIGATE JAVERT</div> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":mad:\" title=\"Mad\"> and solve this question for good. A result on a non-dead player would have been been good enough to class Rob as Town, but a result on a non-dead Javert, would have been just what would have cemented Rob as obvTown just as firmly as magnus is in my mind.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Shattered View Point(Prox), Mute, ConSpiracy, Jerbs - VTs</div><br>\nNeed to look at all of them in detail.

The Oso knife scum would at least have left that road open.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Magnus scum</div><br>\nIf Magnus is scum, he would be:<br>\nEdgerobin-partner: Let's get some quotes in\n<blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>Edgerobin is a high priority suspect, due to oso's claim.

If you block mafia however, you block the entire party, which is not a normal roleblocker. You role even has a different name than roleblocker.<br>\n<br>\nActually Oso, you got me thinking. I read up the rules about a roleblocker again and it contained this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Normal roleblocker rules wrote:</cite>The Roleblocker chooses one player per night to block from performing his or her night choice. The target's night choice will not be performed, and the target may or may not be informed he was blocked, depending on the game mechanics.

Whether a Roleblocker can themselves be blocked also varies.</div></blockquote>\nSo that part can be possible. However, this would imply that your role can be a roleblocker that roleblocks all of the same party. That doesn't explain the restriction of not being able to roleblock someone two nights in a row. <br>\nOn top of that, the name was still different and I came across this searching for the roleblock role:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>Role names should be standard, or non-flavored if original.</div></blockquote>\nBoth entertainer and medic student are not standard role names.

It would be a pretty good move since you had N2 2 scum possibilities to hit (edge wasn't possible) opposed to 7 townies. It would give town false information. On top of that there is the possibility of flaked night kills, as you said yourself, though I don't think that will be the thing.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why you and rob are both still breathing is also easily explainable. At first there has only been 1 night kill since you outed yourself. That isn't very much.<br>\n<br>\nA case on RobCapone was the first thing to happen when Day 4 started.

It isn't scummy to use the setup to bust scum. And it isn't outguessing the mod, one of the mafia players have lied and the mod had nothing to do with it. (Except for when this invalid mafia went trough)<br>\nWhat would you do when somebody fakeclaimed and you could bust it? Let it go because it is setup speculation?

However a setup with a cop and 8 VT's vs 2 mafia teams is far too imbalanced for a game. If this is the case though, we would have 2 mislynches and the scum would have to fake results for 3 nights.

The Entertainer role was essentially a stronger roleblocking role, as I realized two kills per night could make the game go too quickly.  I added in the one-shot factional NK immunity and the Med Student roles in order to further reduce the number of kills to approx 1/night, and to ensure that any player targeted for RB would not be auto confirmed scum.  A cop made me not use a doctor, but use my Med Student role instead.  The normalcy review thought that the Med Student was just a slight weakening of Doc and not counted as a new role, the flavor name was to ensure the player actually read the PM.  The Entertainer was my one new role.

I think it was that you had several different players presenting parts of a case that when added up (like Humble did in his last post), equaled scum enough to make everyone comfortable with their vote.<br>\n<br>\nThe lynch I regret is David's. Ego/confirmation bias, whichever, but I had convinced myself that since we had played together in a game recently, that he was deliberately screwing with his own meta. That I could \"logically\" (at least in my own mind) \"prove\" that by using what we thought the set-up was and the way he was hesitating with his D1 votes, I'd have bet money that he was Knife Mafia Goon on the flip.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\"> Apologies, David.<br>\n<br>\nRob, another blown call. I'd have also bet money that no one could innocently have chosen to investigate Amrun on the night he died. That Dead Inno-Live Scum-Dead Inno combo was just screaming at me to push the lynch on you.<br>\n<br>\nJavert, makes me glad I listen to my internal \"town\" gut reads as well as disregarding most of my gut \"scum\" reads. He is the second player recently I really didn't want to lynch despite the evidence strongly suggesting he should be. It's hard to seriously push a lynch on someone who looks more townie than Andy Griffith. Even if the events say you should. I just hope the trend holds because I'm 2 for 2 right now on that one.<br>\n<br>\nSame with Magnus. ConSpiracy did have a decent point. On the face of it, it <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DID</div> look as if this game violated the rules, at least in a small way. It was a minor leap of faith (in my mind) to disregard all of that because everything in the game pointed to Magnus=Town.<br>\n<br>\nMute, thanks for the complement. The only credit I'll take for being part of that \"team\" is not pushing Javert's lynch though. It's amazing how well the PR who gives the result can also diffuse it somewhat especially when another player has already posted (I quote magnus here) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Javert's not scum.

This only way the Town could really be victorious in this game is if the Entertainer survived.  But with a claim like that in a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mini Normal</div> game, I was highly skeptical from the get-go: when I play normal games, I do not want to see <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">anything</div> out of the ordinary (although I grudgingly have to accept that the rules allow mini games to have one new / variant role).  But what if the Entertainer was lynched Day One?  Or died Night One?  The game suddenly becomes severely imbalanced, especially if scum are killing different townspeople.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, adding even a 1-Shot Group Unnightkillable to each Mafia group drastically screws with the Town.  Basically, it means <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">it is unlikely there will be any cross-killing</div>.  And if there are no cross-kills, the Town <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">has to lynch all four scum</div>.  And consider: in a 13 player game with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">at least</div> a kill a night, the Town only gets <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">five</div> lynches.  If there are three kills every two nights, the Town only gets maybe <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">four</div> lynches.  In other words, you are demanding near <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">perfection</div> from the Town in order to win, while the scum can continually make mistakes in night choices.  Reducing the number of lynches for the Town while simultaneously demanding more accurate lynching from the Town is a Town disaster waiting to happen.<br>\n<br>\nI think the only reason this game <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">appeared</div> to be Town-biased at the end was (i) we had a phenomenal lynching record, and (ii) Prox missed sending in a nightkill on two critical nights after the power roles had practically been revealed.  As a result, the Town lucked out in  having all three power roles survive until almost the bitter end, which allowed for us to create a plan to seal the win (which still involved having to take on faith that Oso was Town).  That is certainly not what Mods should plan for when balancing set-ups.", "time": "Wed Feb 23, 2011 5:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}

So that would have been the same as Night 1, both groups trying to kill the same person. The main difference there being that this time magnus would have prevented both groups while I did nothing really useful at all except make it look like a townie was part of the mafia (which almost happened anyway).<br>\n<br>\nNight 3 might have been quite a bit different though. With Prox active, I would have expected to see two different night kills that night. Both groups would have known their kill was prevented and there was likely a Doc about and probably that Javert was a member of the opposite group. Jerbs went Doc hunting and perhaps (had he been active) Prox might have too but I suspect that if Prox had still been active, you might have seen me or Javert as the second NK on N3. I'd have guessed me. I discount Rob getting killed that night as one mafia (gun) would have known there was a Doc out there and perhaps Knife Mafia would have too. Had Prox still been participating (I had him pegged as just not posting, I didn't realized he had flaked) I probably wouldn't have chosen him as a target. I would probably have chosen Jerbs and perhaps sussed him out and prevented the Amrun kill. Jerbs and Prox were the only two I considered blocking N3 in any case.<br>\n<br>\nGoes back to what Javert said about swinginess. Say what you want about balance but no one, I suspect, takes into account a whole team getting wiped out because of killing/flaking that early into a game. And that is what this was. Had Prox stayed around I suspect the game would still be ongoing with town minus their RB and Cop at this point with a mis-lynch on Javert warming up in the bullpen.<br>\n<br>\nSo I think jimfinn and Javert are both right.

I admit that that's stronger then most protective roles (a doctor in a newbie game expects to stop something like 0.25 of a kill), but it doesn't look gamebreaking to me.

But clearly there is more to mafia to that.  I would suggest that after you've had a good deal more experience as scum that you reread this game; whether you know it or not, there <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">must</div> be subtle distinctions between your play here and your play as Town.  (For example, I still do not believe you ever would have actually said something like \"I was just joking when I said I had a solid tell\"; your posts simply did not give that impression at all, and your attempt at defending that course of action was certainly what really got my eye turned towards you.)  I lost my first <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">several</div> games as scum for reasons I did not fully understand at the time, and as a result I still after five years of playing dread getting scum roles.  But as I gained experience, my scum play has steadily improved, and I can now read my old games where I originally thought \"Town totally lucked out catching me,\" and now I can see the tiny mistakes I made that players caught on to (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">even if</div> they seemed to mainly push a point that I did not truly think was indicative of alignment.)  Sometimes there is more to a case than what is clearly written on the page; I could not (and still cannot) adequately express <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> I thought you were scum, but there was something in your posting that just did not seem like it was written by a Townsperson.<br>\n<br>\nOn that note, please remember that even what appear to be the most hardened hearts can actually be won over.  Speaking as the player behind the character, I was second-guessing the case on you a good bit, and I came close to unvoting you at least twice.  But it served my purposes -- in other words, I felt I could get a better read on you -- to act as though I was practically convinced.  Townies who make it clear they have doubts are giving scum the ammunition they need to wiggle out of a lynch.  When I play as Javert, I (generally) try to put the squeeze on players very early and very tightly to see how they react.  Although I never quite expressed it, I could definitely sense the more \"terrified\" side of your posting by about page 6 or so (in the sense that it suggested \"Oh God, I'm caught\").<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I think Prox had some good advice in the QuickTopic; subtle appeals to emotion, a good revamp post of the game that potentially pushes new and interesting topics / suspicions, a poignant role-claim, etc., can all do what might seem the impossible: stopping yourself from getting lynched.  Sometimes just having a forceful personality can do something towards stopping a lynch (for example, I certainly did not roll over and die on Days Three and Four just because I most definitely looked like I was scum due to the circumstances of the game, and I think it helped).  <br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I don't think that pointing out a second scum team is against any rules; it is a legitimate strategy to try to get the Town to look for the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">other</div> scum team while ignoring your partner.  I also don't think it is against any rules to suggest (or admit) that the scum team can talk to each other during the Day; again, that is information that might help the Town search for the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">other</div> (still-coordinating) scum team.  Most all information (even <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">true</div> information) can be used or twisted by scum to their advantage, and so admitting to it is not necessarily against one's win condition.", "time": "Fri Feb 25, 2011 6:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16143&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "16143"}
