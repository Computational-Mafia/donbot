General Rules<br>1.1 This is a game. Have fun. Be civil to all players; don't let your emotions get too far out of hand.<br>1.2 Rule violations will be dealt with on a case by case basis. I am not afraid to modkill, should it be necessary, but I really don't want to have to.<br>1.3 If you think I made a mistake contact me.<br>1.4 Usually I will post in bolded green.<br>1.5 My decision is final about whatever is going on in this game. This means that these rules may be amended if necessary to suit a situation I have not foreseen.<br>1.6 If your role PM allows you to break any of the following rules, such as providing you with a quicktopic you may use, obviously, you may do so.<br><br><br>2. Votes and Lynches<br>2.1 To vote a person use vote tags, e.g. VOTE: Tasky or bold your vote. If your vote is already on someone, an unvote would be nice.<br>2.2 You may use abbreviations as long as it's clear who you want to vote.<br>2.3 If I think you meant to vote, I will count the vote.<br>2.4 As soon as the majority of the players vote at the same time for a player, that player is immediately lynched.<br>2.5 You may VOTE: No Lynch, as you would vote any player. If half of the players (rounded up) vote No Lynch, the day will end without lynch.<br>2.6 After a lynch, no one is considered dead until I lock the tread. Therefore every player is allowed to post during twilight.<br><br>3. Do and Don't<br>3.1 The only place you are allowed to talk about this game is in this thread or in a PM addressed at me and only at me, unless your role PM states otherwise.<br>3.2 You may not edit or delete any posts of this thread.<br>3.3 Do not quote or pretend to quote any private communication with me. This includes your role PM.<br>3.4 Play to win. Don't do anything obviously detrimental to your faction on purpose.<br>3.5 If what you post cannot be easily read by all players in the game at the time it is posted, don't post it. This includes cryptography, invisible text, small text, and any other devilish scheme you may create.<br>3.6 If you are dead, don't post. A \"bah\" post is acceptable. You are only dead when I post that you are dead. Remember, however, that after the hammer, you may still post in twilight.<br><br>4. Prods and Replacements<br>4.1 Notify me if you are going to be on V/LA or risk replacement.<br>4.2 If you do not post in thread for more than 72 hours without announcing a V/LA, you will be prodded.<br>4.3 If a player fails to pick up his prod and post in thread for more than 36 hours, he will be forced to replaced out or modkilled.<br>4.4 Every player may request a prod or a forced replacement. I will then consider his/her request.<br>4.5 The sooner I know you have to be replaced, the better it is for me and for the game. If you know you will have to replace out, please let me know in advance.<br><br>5. Deadlines<br>5.1 First day's deadline will be 14 days after the game starts.<br>5.2 After that, the deadline will be 10 days after the daybreak post. <br>5.3 Deadline extensions may be granted in extraordinary situations.<br>5.4 Night deadline is always 48 hours.<br>5.5 Night actions I haven't received until after deadline will not happen (unless compulsory). If you wish not to perform any action, I prefer that to be stated explicitly.</span></span></span>"}

The 1/2 game is because we broke the setup and the mod stopped it . A friend of mine introduced me to mafia and allowed me to contribute in his games. I've read like 13-15 gamse. I know the wiki. I've played some lame games on other sites too. I've played some basic mafia IRL too. That's about it. Without being arrogant, I'd like to consider myself a decent player.

Thinking along the same lines as mute providing different alternatives and asking for an explanation.  <br><br>Javert answers 7 minutes later with a response I don't know wether to take seriously or not.  It's just too brief and seems purposely uninformative.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>My vote was not a lurker vote.

It feels disingenuous, especially when you compare this comment to what happened next.<br><br>Essentially, ICEninja complains about Mute for making two random votes because random votes do not advance the game.  But immediately afterwards, when I make a vote that is seemingly not random - i.e., a post that will likely advance the game - ICEninja jumps on me as if it is suspicious in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2735162#p2735162\" class=\"postlink\">Post 22</a>.  Basically, ICEninja took the only feasibly interesting vote in the game at the time and called it suspicious - indeed, he went so far as to call it one of his most \"solid\" tells.  This is patently absurd.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1.)</span> ICEninja, if your tell is so \"solid,\" can you cite me to a couple games that proved its \"solidity\" to you?<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.)</span> Furthermore, how do you propose I should have \"advanced the game\" when I join the thread, seeing nothing of interest that has happened so far?<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.)</span> Mute, why did you FoS me on Page 1 instead of voting for me?  If you have enough reason to FoS somebody on Page 1, then voting them is obviously more justified than keeping your random vote.  You only voted me after a couple other players shared your mentality.  This hints at opportunism on your behalf."}

You state he deserves your vote for playing against a town win-con, but you actually believe him to be scum?? At this point I sure as hell don't believe Javert to be scum. That's obviously subject to change, scum have motive to draw negative attention to themselves to help end RVS (ie: win town cred by appearing reckless), so the whole thing to me is really a WIFOM-filled Null-tell. Javert doesn't seem super-town but he is helping the town with his play.

They were \"valid\" points, but they just weren't thought out points. They didn't look into the intent behind Javert's play, and while it was what some would consider bad play (hey a policy lynch was even mentioned so it must have been bad play), it definitely helped move the game forward. The intent behind Javert's actions was town-like, the means was scum-like, as said, I see it as a null tell, but it is a step forward for town in finding scum. To me, \"diffusing the situation\" was a matter of focusing the town on actual scum hunting, I mean someone was more than welcome to show how what Javert did was more likely scum than town, but no one actually did that.

I simply wanted to know if he was random voting for the purpose of having fun (completely innocent) or, more tellingly, if he was random voting because he though he was helping the game along. By random voting and claiming he was attempting to advance the game, I get the impression that he is trying to make himself look as if he is doing more, posting more, etc. than he really is.<br><br>Furthermore, I am absolutely disgusted by his consideration of policy lynching on day 2.

Most players, now, have made at least one (and many of us have made several) posts that contribute to the discussion and can be used to get reads on players.

I view the votes made against Javert as what I call \"anti-RVS\" votes, actions to garner reactions and advance discussion. Regardless of alignment, I make these votes and back out on them just like I would RVS votes, because I don't usually believe alignment can be determined by what happens on the first 2 pages of a game, barring strange occurrences.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>I rather doubt that ICEninja would have eventually said \"I was purposefully using hyperbole to try to see who else would vote Javert\" if somebody had not called him out on it explicitly.<br></div></blockquote><br>This isn't exactly what I did.

You stated that \"magnus is scum\", and voted for him. I stated that \"Javert is scum and this is why\", and voted for you. You unvoted when it was obvious the purpose of your vote was served, and I unvoted when it was obvious the purpose of my vote was served. You are somewhat hypocritical to be calling me scummy for this.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>And now you are trying to explain it away as being the Surprise Cookie Inspector. Attacking a player with a bad argument and then explaining it away as purposefully using a bad argument is not sitting with me.<br></div></blockquote><br>Amusing analogy. What did you attack magnus for, again? Funny, I recall you saying that there was no reason and you were just reaction hunting. I never said I purposefully used a bad argument. I simply used the best argument I could, given the information we had. The first page or two of the game rarely yields any information that we can use to truly find someone's alignment, in my experience. At least not until we have more back information.<br><blockquote><div><cite>CS wrote:</cite>I have played my only game here on the site with ICE.

Speaking from a psychological tell, people often project their scummy play on to other people. It may be worth considering that he is scum, and seeing me as scummy for doing something similar to what he did, completely unconsciously.<br><blockquote><div><cite>magnus wrote:</cite>1)How exactly has the game developed \"quickly and nicely\"?<br>2)How has your vote served its purpose?<br>3)How has your vote served additional purpose (the \"and then some\" refereed to)?<br>4)Why do you get a town impression from Javert responding to your overly strong accusation?<br></div></blockquote><br>I added numbering to make responses clearer.<br>1) The beginning of this game was more random than most random voting stages entail, in my personal experience. It began fairly uselessly. Things developed in to deep and serious discussion very quickly, and that is exactly how I like it.<br>2) I feel like I got a better read from Javert based on his response to my vote for him.<br>3) Additionally, my vote has generated further discussion amongst other players. This helps my reads as well. I'll likely begin making full fledged cases earlier this game than I normally do.<br>4) It wasn't just how he responded to my overly strong accusation, I felt like Javert (at the point of saying that, his more recent posts have piqued my interest somewhat) had very town motivated actions overall.<br><blockquote><div><cite>magnus wrote:</cite>Part 2 is confusing because it is hard to figure out that he is talking about Mute here, and not explaining his unvote on Javert.

This is concerning, since it suggests David is more concerned with the attitude of the town as a whole, and how it behaves and reacts to certain actions (and suggests David seeks to control these aspects to some degree), rather than the alignments of individual players. This is an attitude which suggests scum motivation behind David's actions, especially considering the underwhelming amount of pressure on Javert at the time. His attempt to bring order to chaos I believe to be a result of his attempt to bring the game to a point where it can be predicted and controlled effectively, so that he may better fulfill his scum win condition. In particular, I believe this to be contrasted to a more town motivation, which would seek to see how Javert responds to the pressure being applied, in order to better gauge Javert's alignment, and the alignments of the players wagoning him, especially when he believes scum may have been prepared to take advantage of this situation and reveal themselves somewhat by joining the wagon (narrowing down suspects, of course, always being an important consideration for a pro-town player).<br>Alternatively, david may have seen this as an opportunity to behave in a manner he believed to be \"pro-town\" by diffusing an argument between townies. This is telling because he remains uncertain of Javerts alignment, but does not desire a wagon against javert for reaction purposes, and has in fact resisted the formation of such a wagon. Also considering his resistance to answering questions, it is difficult to imagine how he expects scum hunting to be done, having ruled out the two most generally used options."}

But I will post my dislike for any, what I perceive as, pointless questions.<br><br>You seem to also overestimate the ability of town players to discover and figure out player alignments in the first few pages. You're quite right in that I'm not entirely focused on figuring out player alignments on a constant basis, I'm seeing how players react to each other, looking into their intentions, and looking at the game as a whole. With only 1.5-2 pages of actual discussion, I find it hard to believe that anyone feels strongly that they know who is scum and town at this point. I have 2ish moderately-weak scum reads and 1 strong town read, and 2ish weak town reads. But really, my posts are intended to get as much information that can be useful in discovering scum just not a post by post basis which a lot of people seem to do."}

Mute, on the other hand, isn't acting with any pro-town intention that I can see. He's done quite a few things that bother me.<br><br>Here's a full case of why I'm suspicious of Mute.<br>-In ISOs 0 and 2, he places votes based on player's names. In ISO 3, he makes a statement suggesting his random votes accomplish a lot for town. Perhaps this is theory disagreement, but to me it looks like he's trying to make himself look more productive and pro-town than he is.<br>-In ISO 4 he makes a FoS against Javert. In ISO 5 he says that Javert's actions, as scum, wouldn't make sense. In ISO 6, he votes for Javert. In ISO 8, he says he feels justified in putting Javert at L-2. This seems contradictory to me.<br><br>This is in addition to his statement declaring a desire for a policy lynch that would hurt town and help scum. So yes, I think Mute is playing scummy. Does that mean I'm ready to declare him scum and lynch him? Absolutely not, it is page 3."}

That is just how I word my posts. I use sarcasm and make subtle jabs at people. This will come up later in your big wall post. In general the way I post isn't straight-forward and analytical, not everything is meant to be taken word for word. (I'm actually a writer, so that's partly why I hate purely informative prose). I could easily have voted and given that as my reason.. What difference does it make to you whether I ask it as a question and vote or just state it and vote, or ask it as a question and not vote. Either way it was pressuring you to post and me clearly stating that I disapprove of your post and found it scummy. The three all accomplish the same thing. You'll notice the question wasn't even directed at you. So yeah, I can do any of those things you stated, sure, but I didn't. That's my playstyle.<br>2. It was the most relevent discussion at the time. It was the focus of the most recent posts and it was definitely a wagon being formed. Whether it had 1 vote or 4 votes on it, it was far more useful to have been discussing that, than some silly questions at the time of your post. It's not the size of the wagon that I was referring to but more about how the first case on a player had kicked off and the people posting who were on at that time should have been focusing on it unless they had something better (which hey, there was just a page of RVS and a few silly questions, so i doubt they did)<br><br><br>/Sidetrack.<br><br>@Javert: I think that post(#47), on a standalone basis, is probably the scummiest post so far and is definitely not well thought out and is very scummy. As a whole given the way your wagon occurred and Ice's positioning on it I'd say he is likely scum and would be in my top few picks for a lynch today at this point of the game. However, his response to accusations has been somewhat formidable, although it's much easier to respond to accusations regarding a scummy post than it is to avoid making scumlike-slips in posts. <br><br>@Oso: No fair <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br><br>That game was a one-off terrible game of mine that I was never even caught up with or tried to keep up with!

Use your gut and intuition, but bandwagoning alone won't get your far. Sometimes a wagon is the right place to be. (Kinda like this Ice wagon is tempting me right now)<br><br>@magnus: I probably do underestimate some tells, it's probably largely based on how I play, and how I react to certain things (ie: people voting me and attacking certain aspects of my playstyle), generally it's me in Javert's position creating negative attention towards myself to help create discussion. (ie: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15318\">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15318</a><!-- l -->) Anyways, point is, when I've been caught out it's not because of some \"pressure wagon\" getting to me, it's because I've been lazy keeping up and taken shortcuts or because as a whole players have analyzed my intent throughout the game. <br><br>@Ice: Your post #70 does not come off too well either. Firstly, you are preparing yourself to vote for me should a wagon kick off there by reluctantly saying I looked town but relooking you're not sure. That alone wasn't that scummy, but combined with your attempt to turn all the attention to people who aren't posting at this point (scum are in the shadows, we dont have reads on lots of players, etc) seems scummy. There is a slight problem with a few people not posting, but all you've done is say \"hey some people aren't posting and we have no reads are them, and scum are probably in the shadows\" (trying to make us connect the dots and go after these people), why don't you do something about those lurkers? That's what I was doing with my vote on Rob... <br><br>Btw, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>.

Back to responding:<br><br>@Rob: Calling you \"lurker/fence sitter scum\" was hyperbole and not something I even myself believed to be entirely true. (but hey it could be). This brings me back to my earlier point, there was some sarcasm or at least <span style=\"font-style: italic\">jest</span> intended with that unfair labeling of yourself. Just like I did the same and labeled Mute as something similar, overly-cautious,twitchy scum or something.<br><br>Oh, I know he's a big boy and can defend himself. But sometimes hearing defences from other people can help players. It's helped me in the past. I was tunneling on someone pretty hard and any defense they said I just read as having scum intent and refused to see any town motivation to their play. It was only when another player stood up and defended them that I felt this player was in fact quite possibly town. And yeah, I did sink his ship somewhat, I'd rather let people know how clever I was for figuring it out than let it play it's course though. I do have an ego :/<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>- so 3 people are \"the town\"?</div></blockquote><br>At that point in the game, more or less, yes. They were the 3 people actively posting and pretty much EVERYONE following Javert's random vote was wagoning onto Javert. So within the context of that post, yes, the town were tunneling on Javert. When taken out of context like you just did, well no 3 people is not the town. While I go read up on what fence-sitting is in terms of mafiascum meta, how about you go learn the importance of context.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>but what if some people actually thought J was scum and they were scum hunting, also since you diffused the point of J's plot you have basically made that entire thing wortless and actually TAKEN AWAY from scum hunting.</div></blockquote><br>They were going after Javert for what was a null-tell more or less. I am under the impression that wagons such as that one are more of a distraction to town, and is a common place where town end up going wrong on day 1, so I tried to divert attention else where. Those people have their right to think Javert is scum and go after him, but I merely didn't feel their pressure was going to be very fruitful. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>DP, the wagon on him WAS helping the game progress, his vote declaration I don't think was never going to take off because once somebody declares something as fact especially this early on, that person is going to be suspect.

That's why I didn't feel bad about derailing his wagon. And you know fully well that I didn't \"eliminate everything good that could have come out of it\". <br><br><br>*holds breath and hits submit*<br><br>Also, I hate these huge wall posts.

I still have not seen anybody make the barest hint of an argument that it is.  In fact, I was a bit surprised that players called me scummy for it.  Back in my day, many (if not most) games started off with multiple players flat-out saying \"X is scum\" and then trying to get people to join the wagon (for example, a common variant would be \"if you vote for X with me today, I will help you lynch Y tomorrow\").  This is a particularly useful strategy if you manage to randomly start a wagon on a newbie-scum who will come to thread and think \"oh shit.\"  Having a bandwagon start on me was certainly not the type of reaction I expected, but I felt I might as well see how large my wagon would get if I just sat there cryptically for a while.<br><br>This is absolutely different making <span style=\"font-style: italic\">an argument</span> against somebody, and then coming back to say, \"just joking.\"  As a rule, Towns win by lynching scum, and scum are lynched without the help of night-actions when (i) Townspeople manage to argue that a scum should be lynched, or (ii) scum get caught up in their own words.  There is little to no reason to purposefully set forward an argument you think to be bad to \"gauge reactions.\"<br><br>I think that had the Town largely agreed with your post -- and thought me scummy for not explaining myself -- you most certainly would not have said \"wait a minute, guys, I was just joking around with my argument.\"  I do not get the feeling that you were just \"gauging reactions\"; I think you were legitimately trying to paint me as scummy.  It is precisely because I do not believe that you would have stepped in that I think you are scum.

However, you had no reason to explain your argument until somebody actually called you out on it.)<br><br>So not only do I think you were trying to paint me as scummy for something that was not scummy, but now I think you're lying about why you did so.

So it isn't as strange as I first said.</span><br>There are, however, 2 reasons I am not taking these \"odd\" actions into account as scum tells: (Posted those earlier)<br><blockquote><div><cite>me wrote:</cite>It would be unfair to judge him for 1 game experience.</div></blockquote><br>I just played 1 game with him. I don't think I know him well enough to say his actions are non-ICE actions and therefore scummy actions. <br><blockquote><div><cite>me wrote:</cite>He has played this game many times so he has presumably gotten these situations a few time.</div></blockquote><br>Reading his sig, he has played 14 games. He presumably came across a game start like this at least once, and that's why he knew this was an action to find scummy reactions from other players. Therefore he wouldn't vote for you in the first place. <br>In a lesser extend this has to be taken into account, as well:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>You'll find that I play fairly conservatively as an IC, particularly during day 1. When I'm not being looked to for example, I tend to play more recklessly.</div></blockquote><br>This could easily be lied, but I can see him doing that. ICs guide the games and are not guiding very well when they are setting up traps. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>But most importantly, why are you giving him a \"free pass\"? Perhaps it is better put this way: Would you give him a \"free pass\" if you had never played a game with him before? Do you think his posts are scummy? If you think ICEninja is acting differently than you would expect, why did not even ask him any questions about his behavior before giving him a \"free pass\"?</div></blockquote><br>I would also give him a free pas if I haven't played with him before. I also didn't feel to ask him some questions. To me, this \"reaction provoker\"thingie isn't a scum tell. Don't forget you did the same: Doing something odd to provoke reactions <span style=\"font-style: italic\">(or after rereading: to stop RVS)</span>. Right now, you are basicly saying you did something scummy, too.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ICEninja's behaviour</span><br>Since every body seems to think ICE action was scummy, I read it back. I noticed that he didn't want to provoke reactions and that I was wrong... <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">  It was to end the RVS. Though I don't think there is something wrong with that. There was no attempt of anyone to end the RVS at that point, even after ICE said this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I feel like the beginnings of this game haven't been particularly productive. They usually aren't great, but as David pointed out, this stage has been even more random than is normal.</div></blockquote><br>Then Javert random voted and ICE tried to stop the RVS through voting Javert with a reason. The reason was bad, but we did go out of the RVS. Luckily for us Mute and Oso searched for a stupid reason to follow ICE into getting a first bandwagon. I think ICE saw that and thought them to be scummy and therefore voted for Mute. No scummy intentions.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Magnus case on DP</span><br>Magnus, please put some white lines between the sentences.

Unfortunately this lead to a bandwagon on me, but there have been some scummy jumps on to my wagon which could very well help town. This is what I was referring to when I said \"and then some\" when referring to that I had accomplished my goals.<br><br>In Javert's ISO 4, he explained exactly and clearly what he was intending to accomplish with his vote. Very specifically, he said this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>Not explaining a vote the instant you make it is not scummy, and I would be amused to see any person voting for me try to argue otherwise. I was hoping - at the least - to see magnus_orion's reaction, but with David Parker's post I suspect any reaction I may have gotten has now been lost.<br></div></blockquote><br>He calls for people to actually explain why his actions were scummy, full well knowing that, considering this revelation, weren't. Granted this wasn't the reason I initially voted for him, as I insinuated that a player declaring someone scum has scum inside information, but he's right. He wanted to see a player's reaction to pressure, and had good intentions. Town points for being the first player to actively scum hunt with specific goals in mind.<br><br>Secondly, he examines my play more closely. He points out this about my play:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>Essentially, ICEninja complains about Mute for making two random votes because random votes do not advance the game. But immediately afterwards, when I make a vote that is seemingly not random - i.e., a post that will likely advance the game - ICEninja jumps on me as if it is suspicious in Post 22.<br></div></blockquote><br>While I didn't attack him to shut down action that would advance the game, and therefore this contradiction doesn't really stack, it shows more solid and genuine looking scum hunting from Javert. This wasn't exactly the reaction I was expecting, per se, and it had a dash of OMGUS in it, I felt that it was town driven suspicion. Javert fully knew that his vote was not scummy. Therefore, he attacked a vote that was based on actions that weren't scummy. This is a good and logical argument, if one assumes that I knew what he was doing at the beginning, that indicates further scum hunting.<br><br>I generally regard the first player to make a well reasoned vote that makes sense to be pro-town. This is because scum, in my experience, are less likely to be making waves. It's simply safer for scum to sit back and wait for someone like Javert to throw down a vote on me and to pile up the votes after a lot of people suspect the player, much like what Jerbs and Prox have done.<br><br>Since then, Javert hasn't read as the most town player, but I won't be voting him any time soon unless he says something that really bothers me. Hopefully you now have a good detailed understanding of everything I was thinking.<br><br>Now, I'd like to finally take a breather for trying to explain to everyone why I'm not scum and point out to everyone how scummy Mute has been behaving.<br><br>Right now, everyone who thinks that I twisted around Mute's words, read this statement:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute, ISO 11 wrote:</cite>The reasoning I had then was a scum-ploy to oust their partner to favor a town-reputation.<br></div></blockquote><br>This is referring to the fact that he felt, at the time he voted Javert, that Javert was busing his partner to gain town cred. I would like to remind everyone that he made this statement IN BETWEEN his FoS and vote for Javert:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute, ISO 5 wrote:</cite>Problem is, if he is scum, why would he be ousting his partner now?<br></div></blockquote><br>He clearly felt that Javert would not be scum busing his partner. Yet now he goes back and states that his reasoning for voting Javert, which happens in his next post, was that he was ousting his partner to gain town cred.<br><br>Also, when questioned about why he found Javert scummy enough to vote, he made this very strange statement:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>Yay best defense I have is nothing but needless WIFOM at this point which even I don't fully trust. =_=<br></div></blockquote><br>I can't quite put my finger on why this bugs me, but this just doesn't strike me as a town response to a very straightforward question.<br><br>In ISO 13, he states that he hasn't responded to CS's points simply because they weren't directed at him. That's a pretty weak excuse to not answer questions. In his own example of a guy addressing a crowd about him, I don't see any reason why the accused can't stand up and refute the points, once again speaking to everyone.<br><br>The funny thing, ISO 13 is all excuse as to why he isn't answering CS's questions, and he does absolutely nothing to actually respond. The whole post feels like a red herring to me. Especially with the amount of quotes he uses to fluff it up.<br><br>In ISO 14, he basically says everything all over again, and then <span style=\"font-style: italic\">finally</span> responds in very weak terms, and very briefly.<br><br>In ISO 15, he OMGUS attacks CS pretty hard. His reasoning for suspecting him is, as far as I can tell, \"he suspected me and attacked in a way that I couldn't easily defend\". He also makes a pretty bold statement:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>You, Conspiracy, I feel are scum.<br></div></blockquote><br>This is a pretty strong statement to not follow up with a vote. Is it because you realize how weak your attack on CS is, and have scum knowledge that he's town?"}

I will be honest I am not 100% against a policy lynch if I know the player's habits and he is going to screw town over (furclow for example) and I don't think anyone in here has shown traits of being bad enough to deserve a PL. I do think if a few more days go by and we have some genuine lurkers, I will definitely be up for a lurker policy lynch, but it's too early in the game for that.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I really don't see where this is coming from. You're spending an inordinate amount of time telling us what you will do in the event that people are lurking.

I figured it was just RVS play that could have been fueled with scum knowledge. As I've said countless times before, it was the strongest case I could make with what I had. I never said \"teehee I was faking it\". I never faked anything. Why do people keep making up things about what I did? I simply stated that I over-pushed the wagon based on the strength of the case.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>It just doesn't make sense to me that you'd think it more likely that scum-Javert would be outing a scummbuddy than baiting. You're basically saying that you thought it more likely he'd outright break the rules than bait. <br><br>Secondly, you're understating your backtrack significantly. If you genuinely thought his action was only possibly scummy, then describing it in the way that you did was lying. The line between rhetorical hyperbole that everybody uses to persuade people and outright lying is often not that clear, but here I don't think it can seriously be argued that you weren't lying about your opinion on Javert at some point.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Vollkan wrote:</cite>This just isn't true. You completely misrepresent Mute as saying that his random votes \"accomplish a lot\". what he actually said was much more understated:<br></div></blockquote><br>Not at all. I asked him \"how do your votes help the game\" and he responds \"how don't they?\" and lists a bunch of things votes (and he's implying HIS votes) do to advance the game. It isn't a strong tell, but it's what I got out of it.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Ah...\"It isn't a strong tell\" - code for \"I'm wrong but I am not going to admit it\".<br><br>Quoting Mute's post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>How don't they? Voting to get people involved, get discussions going, acquire info, find people whom are felt to be scum, etc etc etc. I prefer to vote for random reasons until a point where serious discussion is reached, and the RVS ends and the game proper begins. Then my votes get based on solid reasoning.<br>I do not feel it has yet but we are close with your current post.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>You described him as saying his votes \"accomplish a lot\" and that he is listing a bunch of things. Read the damn list. He is basically just claiming the conventional justification for RVS - namely, to get things moving. His list is entirely accurate as a statement of the purpose of RVS and, to that end, two votes (or three, or four) is just as valid as one.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DavidParker wrote:</cite>I'd just like to post my agreement with Rob that 3-4 days before deadline if the activity and content of some of the players in this game doesn't pick up I will fully support a lynch of one of these players. It makes the game more enjoyable and.. is just more helpful if everyone is actively posting their opinions (as wrong as some people mind find those opinions to be). <br><br>Yes, I know I don't support policy lynches, but 3-4 days before deadline, lynching someone for not posting any content is not what I consider a policy lynch, but a player being anti-town and lurking, which is definitely a scum tell in current meta.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again - what is the point of this? <br><br>If you think lurkers are scummy, you are just warning them not to lurk?<br><br>If you don't think lurkers are scummy, why the hell are you even contemplating lynching them?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>MO wrote:</cite>@edge: commentary on ICE's more recent play. Your accusation involving hyperbole keeps getting referred to... the original accusation is interesting because you seem to claim ICE should've known what Javert was doing. Why do you believe this to be the case?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Sorry, I thought I'd been clear on this.<br><br>Town should be analysing people's posts. They don't always, but we have to assume that they will. Now, on reading Javert's post there are only, in my view, four possible interpretations:<br>1) Javert is insane<br>2) Javert is scum outing a scumbuddy<br>3) Javert is scum pretending to out his partner<br>4) Javert is null trying to bait (I say null because obviously scum can try baiting as well)<br><br>1) isn't worth taking seriously. 2) would be against the rules. 3) would have no point (it doesn't clearly say \"this guy is my partner\", nor is it in any way going to get the target lynched, since it premises the target's scummines on Javert's own). 4), of course, is the most likely - no matter what Jav's alignment.<br><br>So, if he was thinking at all about Jav's alignment, he should have concluded that the best thing to do would be to hold off and see what happens. The fact that he didn't can only suggest that he wasn't interested in Jav's alignment."}

This seems contradictory to me.</div></blockquote><br>You string together some points that are true on the face of them. He (Mute) did FOS Javert then he also proceeded to vote him later and he did state that he felt justified at putting him at what he(Mute) thought was L-2 at the time of voting Javert.<br><br>My problem is that in Mute's ISO #5 (I'll quote it) he isn't saying Javert isn't scum, he's questioning the reason for your vote and than asking Javert directly about his vote on magnus.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Also, the only way Javert could overtly know that magnus is scum is if he is his scum buddy. I too, as indicated by a comment made earlier in this post (that is now obsolete but I don't feel like deleting for transparency reasons), believed he voted a player for reasons of not posting yet. Simply declaring a player scum without \"if\" is one of the most solid scum tells in the game, I'd say. I don't usually make serious votes like this so early, but...<br>Vote Javert.</div></blockquote><br>Problem is, if he is scum, why would he be ousting his partner now?<br>Under rules section 3:<br><blockquote><div><cite>jimfinn wrote:</cite>3.4 Play to win.

He quotes your vote post, asks why would Javert(scum) out magnus(scum) at this point in the game. He's questioning your vote, not stating his opinion other than implicitly agreeing that if Javert is town, his behavior is anti-town when he concedes this point <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Though, I agree this level of obfuscating (please tell me I've used that word correctly here, I've never used it before <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> ) is counter to the town as well.\"</span><br><br>The way you strung the ISOs together, it sounds like \"Mute FOSed Javert, then Mute said it doesn't make sense for Javert to be scum, <span class=\"noboldsig\">then he went and voted him anyway</span>, that's a scummy contradiction\". When what actually happened is Mute FOSed Javert, questioned your stated reasons for voting Javert and asked Javert directly what exactly he was doing, then voted Javert(as far as I can see at least) for his flippant response. One of the reasons I voted Javert as well. As far as I can tell, aside from the question he asks Javert at the end of that post, ISO 5 has nothing whatsoever to do with Mute's eventual vote of Javert.<br><br>That's where the distortion is at, you painted another player in the absolutely worst possible light with that string of ISOs by dropping an unrelated post in there and trying to get it to say what you wanted to."}

Yet you neglect to point out that in that same post Mute also cops to dismissing that reason it because it's a flawed premise.<br><br>The question I have is this: Why wasn't Post-52 included when you stated you had your \"full case\" laid out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2737433#p2737433\" class=\"postlink\">Post - 78</a>? The posts you mention are Mute's ISOs 0,2,3,4,5,6 and 8 (Game Posts 7,12,17,21,23,28 and 33). Post-52 isn't mentioned at all.<br><br>I'll answer what I think the answer to that is for the folks at home. Because it's a case put together with duct tape and chewing gum. I've played with ICENinja before (granted only one game) but in that game I was scum, he was town. One thing that impressed me about him was how difficult it would be to get him lynched, he was an NK candidate for sure. He didn't add things to a case later on unless they happened after he made his initial case. Not the case here. Had he been actually reading Mute to see if he was a legitimate scum candidate, I'd bet money in Vegas that he would not only have referenced Mute's admission in Post-52, Town ICENinja would have also taken into account unvote <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2736113#p2736113\" class=\"postlink\">Post - 48</a> and, if not dropped it altogether, waited until he had a more solid body of posts to reference. Mute's unvote post (of Javert) is not the best Mea culpa I've seen, but if sincere (and I believe it is), it covers his(Mute's) jabs at Javert sufficiently in my opinion.<br><br>******<br><br>@Magus<br>You can add the above to my reasons why I think ICENinja is scum.<br><br>When I went back and re-read ICENinja to see why he was garnering votes, I was at the thin edge of giving him the benefit of the doubt. Why?<br>ConSpiracy said this earlier<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>..<br>I have played my only game here on the site with ICE. His first vote struck me as really, really odd, not as ICE would do.<br>His \"gambit\" thing also wasn't something I would think ICE to do.</div></blockquote><br>I had already thought there was something off about ICE when I read that, wasn't really thinking it was scummy though. I had only seen one game from him and he was town. I was seriously entertaining the thought that despite Javert, Edgerobin and HP making some very good points, he might be acting scummy enough to not get NKed for a purpose, just overdoing it.<br><br>That all ended when he laid out his \"full case\" on Mute. With the post references he(ICENinja) gave, there is just no way around it in my eyes: He laid out a bunch of references, told people what he thought it was, but using those same references not only didn't support his case, it exposed him for what he is. Scum. He didn't get any actual supporting evidence for the claim of the contradiction until he went looking for it and even that evidence fails if you look at fairly, at least in my estimation.<br><br>So, to answer your original question, I borrow reasons from some other folks cases that I think are solid and spot on to add to what I've said so far.<br><br>Javert <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2736379#p2736379\" class=\"postlink\">Post-54</a>: Agree with the entire post so I won't quote it, I'll just link it.<br><br>Edgerobin <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2739280#p2739280\" class=\"postlink\">Post-117</a>:Specifically this part<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Town should be analysing people's posts. They don't always, but we have to assume that they will. Now, on reading Javert's post there are only, in my view, four possible interpretations:<br>1) Javert is insane<br>2) Javert is scum outing a scumbuddy<br>3) Javert is scum pretending to out his partner<br>4) Javert is null trying to bait (I say null because obviously scum can try baiting as well)<br><br>1) isn't worth taking seriously. 2) would be against the rules. 3) would have no point (it doesn't clearly say \"this guy is my partner\", nor is it in any way going to get the target lynched, since it premises the target's scummines on Javert's own). 4), of course, is the most likely - no matter what Jav's alignment.<br><br>So, if he was thinking at all about Jav's alignment, he should have concluded that the best thing to do would be to hold off and see what happens.

However town also lurk, there is explanation for townies lurking, either disinterest or real life keeping them busy. Yes it is warning players not to lurk, if they can't handle the game they should not have signed or should replace out and send flowers to the mod as an apology for signing and then flaking. Assuming players signed to play the game and be involved in finding scum, lurking then becomes a scum tell. I see no point wagoning lurkers during the early stages of a day, it's much more beneficial to go after the information/reaction wagons such as Javerts/Ice's/Mute's/Mine where you will get accusation/defense/etc and just get more information on the table.

I post my thought process as it comes and there isn't a huge amount of filtering (when I'm town at least), and in general just react to posts and comment on them in the spur of the moment and post. I saw a bunch of silliness, and 3 people falling for this silliness, so having figured out what was going on I wanted to point out what was going on. <br><br>Also this link to magnus you are making with me is a HUGE stretch and how you can possibly fathom such a scum pairing on day 1 without a single flip is beyond me. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>David's reaction to magnus's questions is proof that he isn't taking the game serious OR magnus seriously.

It's the whole stop and think what you are trying to accomplish with his post. I mean what did he expect me to answer? He posted 6 questions, half of which I could have written several-thousand-word-essays to respond with. He didn't specify anything with the quesitons, just left open-ended broad questions. Would you rather I have written those thousand word essays as a response to show how serious I am about this game? I don't think anyone wants that. I opted for one liners instead.<br><br><br>@Rob: By all means, I was curious as to Ice's wagon. I felt and still do feel it is a legitimately scummy wagon to some extent and was thinking of putting my vote on him, I don't need to hide that. You don't see any case from Parker about ICE because I haven't made one, the case has been made, when the case was first made I found Mute scummier than Ice based on the cases alone, based on the player reactions to the 2 wagons I found ICE somewhat scummier than Mute at times. He has made some comments which just don't rub off as town responses, but other posts such as his [url=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2739616#p2739616\"]124[/url] do seem like town responses. <br><br><br>I do agree with ICE that there is no reason for a claim at this point.

You seem to disagree with him a lot, but you make good points. I am concerned, however, that a lot of your post was dedicated to disagreeing with him and not a lot of it was dedicated to analyzing his alignment. Do you feel that his actions were scummy? Do you feel like David is more likely to flip scum than other players right now?</div></blockquote><br><br>I actually have a feeling that he could be scum and here is why.<br><br>I don't like the fact that he has defended Javert for his attempt at reaction fishing while completely negating the whole exercise. While I feel that yes Javert put the attention on himself, how can ANYONE think he was pro-town enough to be defended like DP was doing. The fact that he completely ruined the gambit to me means that he was doing 2 things.<br><br>1. defending Javert because DP thinks (or maybe knows) he is town<br>2. taking the attention off magnus<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Which of DP's posts is this in reference to?<br><br>I don't want to rebut your DP case in advance of DP doing so - but I'll say now that I think points 1-2  of yours aren't scummy (from DP), point 3 is kind of \"so what?\" (a single non-adding post is hardly uncommon), 4 is just wrong (I see that DP has already answered this point - so I will say I agree with him. He (wrongly imo) advoctates lurker lynching on the basis that lurking is scummy. He's wrong on that point, but if he thinks lurking is scummy, which a lot of people seem to, then it isn't a policy lynch)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>And no, it is absolutely not time for claim. My case against Mute is very sound, and hardly anyone has touched on it. A sizable case was just thrown down against DP, and while I may not fully agree with it, it carries some merit. A claim right now would help scum significantly, and town not at all.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>If I was still deciding among my top suspects, this would have changed my mind in and of itself. This is just the mafia equivalent of \"hey, look over there\".<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Jav wrote:</cite>I would not be adverse to a hammer without even letting ICEninja claim if he is going to try and be squirrelly about it. If I had another vote, I would vote him again right now.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I agree. A lynch without a claim is bad - but not lynching somebody because they don't claim is infinitely worse.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>I think lurking is scummy. However town also lurk, there is explanation for townies lurking, either disinterest or real life keeping them busy. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes it is warning players not to lurk, if they can't handle the game they should not have signed or should replace out and send flowers to the mod as an apology for signing and then flaking. Assuming players signed to play the game and be involved in finding scum, lurking then becomes a scum tell.</span> I see no point wagoning lurkers during the early stages of a day, it's much more beneficial to go after the information/reaction wagons such as Javerts/Ice's/Mute's/Mine where you will get accusation/defense/etc and just get more information on the table. Voting someone for not being caught up with the game isn't valuable until it actually gets to the point where we are about to lynch someone to end the day.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Scratch what I said above - you're pushing a policy lynch (though, not in the simplistic way ICE initially claimed).<br><br>The bolded part in particular sent the \"policy lynch alarm bells\" ringing for me. See, you aren't asking \"Is this player more likely to be scum than town?\" What you are saying is \"To discourage people from lurking, I am going to assume that lurking is motivated by scummy reasons\". Thus, you're basically pushing a policy lynch but disguising it as a proper lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CS wrote:</cite>1. The vote may be dropped, the case certainly isn't. You voted for him for changing reasons. The vote was a bandwagon-vote, with no clear reason. No good.<br>2. Well, you were. That is even worse than still are. You changed your mind about it as soon as you are called scummy for mentioning a policy lynch. That seems to me you want to lose the attention.<br>3. Well, no need to quote ICE, since you can find yourself what is bad about this.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>The interesting thing about this is that, as you point out, on each one Mute's response is basically to say that something WAS his position, but he's now changed. See:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>1. You call me out for my vote on Javert, which I should remind you has been dropped by now.<br>2. You say that I am \"subtly trying to get someone lynched\" by bringing up policy lynching inappropriately, which is not the case anymore.<br>3. I voted for him because I felt he was scummy in his posting in the beginning of the game.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>He's not admitting he was wrong; nor is he actually defending himself in any real way."}

Basically, I've come closer to where Javert was since I last posted.<br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@ICE:</span><br>Ice still keeps on twisting the point about mute.  <br>mute voted Javert for ignoring the questions  and causing confusion.  He never said Javert was scum with magnus.  Ice was the one who implied this.<br>His \"disgust\" about the policy lynch still feels forced.<br>His answers and reactios still feel forced and vary according to the way in which the town leans.<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>As you can see, you argued that Javert could only know magnus_orion was scum if he, himself, was scum. That would be bussing. Mute thought that might warrant a Modkill. He was wrong, but his thought process was valid. He didn't say Javert was or wasn't scum. He just didn't think Javert was bussing, as you portrayed.<br></div></blockquote><br>Then what reason did Mute have to suspect Javert if he didn't think he had scum knowledge? It's the only way that his actions could be viewed as sucmmy, at least from what I can see.</div></blockquote><br>No.  Javert refused to answer questions.  Javert was deliberately uninformative.  Mute even stated that he would unvote if Javert provided reasons.<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Poirot wrote:</cite>The very same tactics you expressed were the correct way to act might just apply to both Mute and Javert. SPECIALLY Javert (Which you decided to vote in that post).<br></div></blockquote><br>I'm fairly certain I SPECIFICALLY said that Javert participated in doing this. I don't believe Mute did anything to advance the game at the beginnings.</div></blockquote><br>But you didn't consider Javert was advancing the game at the beginning.  That's what I was getting at.  You never thougth Javert might be reaction hunting?<br><br>I suppose this finally relies on your explanation that you, yourself, were reaction hunting no matter what you thought about Javert's possible motivations.  <br><br>But, as I expressed earlier, I have a lot of trouble trusting you.  I try to put myself in your shoes but things just don't fit.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ice wrote:</cite>People have done a lot of accusing me of being on and off opportunistic wagons, but people really need to be looking at Prox and Jerbs. Do they really believe in votes for me, or are they just trying to push a mislynch?<br></div></blockquote>Don't worry.  I haven't overlooked either of them.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>Jerbs too has only three posts this game, but I feel his posts to be more town-driven than anything.</div></blockquote>really?  Why?<br>I agree with David about the difference between Jerbs and prox.  Jerbs tries to posts more and fill but still active lurks.  Prox acknowledges he doesn't post much but seem to try and cover the game in a genuine way.  That being said, I wish he reads the whole game.  Not just skim posts entirely.<br><br>I keep second guessing myself when I read ICE because he seems so logical within his posts.  But then I remember what he did and how he conviniently changes his mind.  Edgerobin pins him down with precision.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>Edger, two things. One, I never once thought that Javert was going to push a lynch on a scum buddy at the beginning of day 1. Outing him now would potentially give Javert some town cred later if magnus gets lynched.

No rush at all to lynch ICE or even, to get a claim from him.

HumblePoirot, it is intriguing that you say you are tired of quickhammers.

A moderate set of players seemed to have discussed something in the first 2 days and you thought that was enough to lynch?  I think that every player needs to make their views sufficiently clear so they can be held accountable after the subsequent flips on day and night.  <br><br>At this point, I'm confident I want a claim and I'm very confident that ICE is the right lynch.

You need to take thinks a bit more calmly.  Don't assume everything will be black or white.  Things don't have to follow one pattern.  Claiming and not claiming, agreeing or denouncing the claim... everything, will have a motive and that motive can be subject to questioning giving us more information.  <br>  <br>What you see as an opportunity for alleged scum to slip from your fingers, I see as an opportunity to keep on allowing players to link with each other forming a net that, one day, will come to scum's behinds.<br><br>Based on the events of the game so far, I don't think you're scum.

You raise some decent points about him from the very early game but I've personally come to the conclusion that Mute was honest about his mafia experience when answering ICE game-start questions. I find new players hard to read when either alignment, to me at least, they can go from looking uber town to scummy as hell in the same post simply because of their inexperience and to be honest, from my own experience when I started playing mafia, I tend to have a soft spot for them (and yes, that attitude has bitten me in the ass from time to time).  So, I have no definite read on Mute but the impression I have of him at the moment is generally positive. I do know he won't be getting my vote today for anything that is based solely on what he has done in the game to this point.<br><br>As for what ICE as said about him (you and he are the only two voting Mute at the moment I think), well, you know what I think about him. Anything ICE has put forward about Mute is not even being considered by me at this point. If it turns out I'm wrong about ICE, then I'll re-read what he said about Mute in a different light. But I wouldn't put too much hope in his arguments swaying me even if he does ultimately flip town. As I said above, I don't think Mute has done anything irredeemable to this point in the game.<br><br>That pretty much sums up what I think of the case on Mute at the moment.<br><br>******<br>The David Parker Case: I stated earlier that I liked the way magnus was thinking and I don't consider his thoughts about DP as invalid but they are not the sort of thing you make a serious case out of without additional evidence, even on Day 1. Much like the poke that I at made a Javert at the beginning of the game: Enough to start a suspicion perhaps but it won't stand alone as the meat of a case. As a valid supporting reason? Without a strong pattern of other scummy behavior to back it up it may fail even that test.<br><br>RobCapone's vote is the stronger of the two there on DP, in my opinion.

I'm not saying that is/was what DP was trying to do but if I wasn't convinced that my vote right now is on the right person for today, I would certainly be exploring it today. A scum flip of ICE guarantees I'll be asking DP myself to explain those 3 points tomorrow. In addition, if Javert ever ends up on the dead list at any point as scum, I'll be poking David as well.<br><br>But, he's not the choice for serious pressure or a lynch today in my opinion. Too much in my mind that I would hold against David is too connected the ultimate alignment of other players.<br><br>@HumblePoirot.

This is an attitude which suggests scum motivation behind David's actions, especially considering the underwhelming amount of pressure on Javert at the time. His attempt to bring order to chaos I believe to be a result of his attempt to bring the game to a point where it can be predicted and controlled effectively, so that he may better fulfill his scum win condition. In particular, I believe this to be contrasted to a more town motivation, which would seek to see how Javert responds to the pressure being applied, in order to better gauge Javert's alignment, and the alignments of the players wagoning him, especially when he believes scum may have been prepared to take advantage of this situation and reveal themselves somewhat by joining the wagon (narrowing down suspects, of course, always being an important consideration for a pro-town player).<br>Alternatively, david may have seen this as an opportunity to behave in a manner he believed to be \"pro-town\" by diffusing an argument between townies. This is telling because he remains uncertain of Javerts alignment, but does not desire a wagon against javert for reaction purposes, and has in fact resisted the formation of such a wagon. Also considering his resistance to answering questions, it is difficult to imagine how he expects scum hunting to be done, having ruled out the two most generally used options.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>it is just pinging on my scumdar, in the end it could be nothing but in my head I am skeptical about the whole thing and David is right in the middle of it all<br><br>and now like I pointed out DP earlier, DP asks for how many votes on Ice (hasn't voted him yet)<br>later asks for a vote count (still hasn;t voted him yet)<br><br>and he even says he finds Ice scummy and when I ask him about his case for Ice he leaves this little gem in his wall of text<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Rob: By all means, I was curious as to Ice's wagon. I felt and still do feel it is a legitimately scummy wagon to some extent and <span class=\"noboldsig\">was thinking of putting my vote on him, </span>I don't need to hide that. <span class=\"noboldsig\">You don't see any case from Parker about ICE because I haven't made one, </span>the case has been made, when the case was first made <span class=\"noboldsig\">I found Mute scummier than Ice based on the cases alone, based on the player reactions to the 2 wagons I found ICE somewhat scummier than Mute at times. </span>He has made some comments which just don't rub off as town responses, but other posts such as his [url=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2739616#p2739616\"]124[/url] do seem like town responses. </div></blockquote><br><br>so he basically says he agrees with 2 cases made by other people but as time goes on he finds Ice more scummy (<span class=\"noboldsig\">the way I see it is he becomes scummier the larger the wagon gets)</span><br><br>and what happens when Ice is at L-2?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DavidParker wrote:</cite>How can a player who has no votes or pressure on him flail?? <br><br>The last thing you comment on isn't all that weird or uncommon. Scum would rather avoid a wagon if they can. So maybe you've made yourself too easy/scummy a target and scum are just watching the wagon kick off. Or they could be taking advantage of your poor response. There is motive for both. <br><br>(OR YOU COULD BE SCUM CAUGHT!)</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">now i end this by saying that i don't think that Ice is off the hook because his play is definitely scummy and I don't want to de-rail his wagon because I am not 100% sure that DP is scum but when you add all of this and look at who DP has voted for, you will see he has only made 1 vote before he puts Ice at L-1 and that was me for not commenting about the Javert case because I had to go to work and had to shovel snow first. </span><br><br>Whew sorry about that."}

Basically it boils down to what RobCapone pointed out in his case against DP. Some of the points Rob picked out indicate, to me at least, that DP might have been thinking of making a stab at derailing ICENinja's wagon (I interpreted those points a bit different than Rob did I think). I will say that in the unlikely event (unlikely in my opinion at least) ICE does ultimately flip town, most of my bad feelings about David are going to go away.

[b]RobCapone+7[b]. DP's made some efforts at defending himself, so there is more I want to say. Let me go through this:<br><br>To begin with, I asked you to explain this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>I don't like the fact that he has defended Javert for his attempt at reaction fishing while completely negating the whole exercise. While I feel that yes Javert put the attention on himself, how can ANYONE think he was pro-town enough to be defended like DP was doing. The fact that he completely ruined the gambit to me means that he was doing 2 things.<br>1. defending Javert because DP thinks (or maybe knows) he is town<br>2. taking the attention off magnus<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I thought maybe I was missing something, but I'm not. Quoting from your ISO 21:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>this is where he is defending (protecting, or whatever else you want to call it) Javert because people are voting him<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>I'm disappointed by players reactions to Javert's antics. They are searching for reactions and you guys are giving them - bad ones.<br><br>He is moving us out of RVS even if it's by drawing negative attention to himself. Now get your votes off him.<br><br>I'll be looking at the various reactions to Javert to see which is most scummy.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>this is where he admits he has ruined javert's attempt at reaction fishing<br><blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>Sorry for ruining your little \"ploy\" but frankly I wasn't that interested in magnus's reaction and don't think it would have been as revealing as you are making it to be. It may have been interesting to see whether he bandwagoned you or not, but I could see him doing that as town or scum. As it stands, it was more important to diffuse the situation and get people off your back.<br></div></blockquote><br>So yes, Javert's play while not being a town tell in my eyes, was definitely a move that benefited town (YEAH I KNOW CONTRADICTION)<br></div></blockquote><br><br>From the very first of those quotes you post, and it's even clearer in the second, DP clearly doesn't think Jav's \"antics\" are going to achieve anything. So he isnt \"undermining\" Javert - because he doesn't think there is anything to be undermined.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DP wrote:</cite>and once that happened nobody paid any attention to magnus and what does DP get for taking the attention off magnus and defending Javert for his attempt to end RVS and reaction fish (which DP ruins) he gets this post from magnus<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Which just doesn't make sense. Plenty of people don't like gambits, and DP thought it was useless. It may have pulled attention off magnus, but you haven't proven at all that that is what DP was trying to do, let alone that he was trying to do it for scummy reasons as opposed to genuinely thinking the gambit was unreliable.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>it is just pinging on my scumdar, in the end it could be nothing but in my head I am skeptical about the whole thing and David is right in the middle of it all<br></div></blockquote><br><br>You aren't being skeptical, you're being paranoid/conspiratorial. David makes a post attacking what he thinks is bad. In doing so, David defends Magnus. Big deal.<br><br>And...coming right back to the very first quote I quoted from you, DP had been suspicious of ICE for some time. Painting it as a sudden turnabout is just rubbish.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Javert wrote:</cite>I will go ahead and point out the obvious:<br><br>Just because ICEninja claims to only have one partner, it does not make it true.  Scum who seem to \"give up\" often leave Towns with at least one final poison pill as an attempt at sowing confusion.  I will believe it when I see it.<br><br>ConSpiracy, I am going to kindly ignore your commentary on how you think I should play.</div></blockquote><br><br>^ This. Especially given that  his 194 shows he was clearly still thinking about the game, including its saccharine ending of \"I'm helping town as much as I can at this point because in serious honestly, I would prefer town to win than the other scum team. I want them caught.\" It reads more like mafia trying to appear to be town's best friend (a really weird thing in and of itself) than mafia actually wanting to help the town. Basically, I'm treating everything he said as likely BS."}

I'm not happy but I'm not unhappy with your input.</div></blockquote><br>Note he unvotes Rob at that point but doesn't re-place his vote on anyone. \"...<span style=\"font-style: italic\">I'd say he</span>[ICENinja]<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> is likely scum and would be in my top few picks for a lynch today at this point of the game.</span>...indicates to me that he should be placing his vote, onto ICENinja, if he's going to take it off RobCapone.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2738459#p2738459\" class=\"postlink\">Post-96</a>. Pretty sure this is in response to Magnus' question to David in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2738368#p2738368\" class=\"postlink\">Post-93</a>: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">David, what's your opinion on ICE?</span>.

I'm still reserving to post some of my other scum suspects at this point while I gather my thoughts.</div></blockquote><br>Another reason he should place his vote on ICENinja (at this point in the game he has no vote out), although he(DP) does state he wants to gather his thoughts on other suspects and post them. But I would like to point out that DP does(sort of) imply in that first quote, that he isn't placing a vote on ICE because his(ICE's) responses are \"somewhat formidable\" but in the second says that he \"doesn't seem to defend himself very well.\". Now I'm starting to get the distinct impression that David doesn't want to vote ICENinja no matter how scummy he looks. Just making cover noises.<br><br>That brings me to my post earlier today: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750442#p2750442\" class=\"postlink\">Post-227</a>. What David tried to log off as my voting him for MD reasons is actually the final nail in his coffin as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to put a quote wall up so here are the relevant posts.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2743223#p2743223\" class=\"postlink\">Post-179</a>:This is where I give my thoughts on two players, David is the second one, last half of the post. Please note, that even before the ICE flip, I thought that David might have been at least testing the waters to see if he could somehow derail the ICE wagon with some sort of jarring post that would take to spotlight off of ICE. The second, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750309#p2750309\" class=\"postlink\">Post-219</a>, is where I ask him about it directly. He tries in the post right after that to deflect, at least in my opinion, the vote by classifying my vote as voting based on an MD point rather than actual evidence in the thread. Well, there you go David. All tied up in a neat little package. You were not making an opinion known, you were desperate to get pressure off your partner and you blinked.<br><br>****<br><br>That brings up the question though as to why David was getting desperate to save ICE. As town, David would have voted much earlier than he did. He voiced strong suspicions of ICE twice but didn't vote until he had no choice. As scum, David would have happily thrown a partner in that much trouble under a bus unless there is something about scum in this game that is not readily visible. It makes sense (not optimal play, I'll grant that, but defensible play) to at least try and find a way to save your partner if you are about to lose half your team on Day 1.<br><br>Which brings me to why I claimed. The way my role works make sense in a multi-group game(plus like I said above, I've confused the hell out of myself and maybe someone can point out something in this post that might help me clarify my thinking) and David's reluctance to vote ICE yesterday only makes sense, to me at least, if there is some overriding factor that would make a scum player deviate so badly from optimal play. David's play yesterday certainly wasn't town in relation to ICE nor is it what I would call \"normal\" scum play either.<br><br>Second reason why I claimed: As I said above, my role makes sense in a multi-group game and David has by his play, in my opinion, and pretty much confirmed in my mind that ICE did believe there are two scum groups, for whatever reason, and he wasn't just poisoning the well. So, if there are indeed two scum groups, my action last night may have had a better than average chance of preventing a second kill than a normal RB would as I can block my target's entire group as well if they are, in fact, in a group. I say <span class=\"noboldsig\">MAY HAVE</span> because I can think of several other reasons why there would not have been a second kill when I was expecting one. And yes, I even include the fact that I may be completely wrong in everything I have said above.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'll definitely name my block target by the end of the day, no matter what happens.</span>Because if turns out there is only one killing group, my block pretty much clears the target. But we have some discussion out on the table now so I'll leave it up to you folks as to when you want another talking point. If you would rather wait until we clear up some of the current stuff under discussion that's fine with me. If you want it now, I'm good with that too.<br><br>But no matter what else happens today, you folks <span class=\"noboldsig\">WILL</span> have the name of the player before the game day ends, I promise."}

It would have been better I think, had I just went ahead and responded \"I will\" to Javert's request and deal with any complications that may have happened, when they happened instead of letting my personal thoughts on the subject get into my post.<br><br>1)On thinking, I can agree with that. Everyone gets a role PM and you are allowed to reference pretty heavily in the game. I can stretch my personal mafia philosophy to put later role clarifications in the same category as the original Role PM.<br><br>2)Did that one.<br><br>3)I have to disagree on that one. Last night when I chose you as a block target, I was betting on two night kills. My role powers (even before ICE's suggesting it) indicated to me that there might be multiple groups. Whether that meant two scums groups or a combo of scum and town groups was an open question in my mind. ICE's posts did nudge me into the scum/scum thinking though.<br><br>As I stated in my last, you were one of the people who made my short list on people I wouldn't mind going all the way to the end game with and wouldn't it be nice if I could use this to almost categorically clear a player(s). I genuinely stink at using an RB role. Normal RBs means you have to target the actual killer of the group to prevent the kill. I've never done that so far with the role as I seem much more likely to block a useful town PR or VT instead. JKs, I hate playing them. When successful,their results are ambiguous most of the time that they are hard to interpet, at least for me.<br><br>But this role, because of it's broader effects, has possibilities. If I target someone and they are part of a killing group, I stop the kill. Don't have to hit on the exact killer. The flip side of that is that if I target someone (and I am not blocked by another RB type) and a kill shows up, then I can take it that person is town (additional scum groups and third party aside here) rather Than scum who just didn't do anything. So if there is only one killing group in this game, you are Iron-Clad town, from my current POV, in my book based on the results of last night. Town benefits by knowing this. I admit, I could have waited to claim with this info at a later date as your play so far in the game, to me at least, has been town. Enough so that my being NKed with this info undisclosed wouldn't have hurt you or town.<br><br>The part that prompted my claim was two fold. First: My case against David only makes sense (to a greater or lesser extent depending on if my RC is believed and you folks think my thinking process valid) in a two scum group game. <br><br>Second: My actions last night may have prevented a second kill (barring actions by other town PRs of course and if there is indeed a second mafia) and that is something town needs to know about and they need to know at some point before night. The risk to myself is irrelevant, in my opinion. The info I have is more important that my continued presence in the game after tonight, at least in my opinion because if I am right about David and also right about two scum groups, then I have given town a start on chipping away at the second group.<br><br>4)Yes, I covered what I think the the benefits are in #3 up there. I didn't want to side track the case on David immediately. Unfortunately, I couldn't see how I could get my thoughts out on David (and be taken seriously) without giving folks my claim as back-up to show why I was thinking like I was. It's all well and good to say I don't think ICE was lying, but without also showing how what he said tends to confirm something I was already thinking, it would be supremely easy to have that dismissed seeing as how ICE was scum. The holding off on naming my target until specifically asked for it, was to hopefully keep the game focused on David. I went ahead and stated it because if I don't, I'm afraid that will become the center of discussion instead. My claim is going to draw off enough discussion as it is, I really didn't want someone to get the target and tear off on a tangent based on what is, at the moment, equivocal evidence. You(Edgerobin) being the target is useful information. However, at this point in the game, it's fairly useless for determining alignment until other matters are answered. One on hand, my blocking you pretty much makes you town. On the other hand, you stand a decent chance of being part of a killing group. Depends on what position the 2 scum group switch ends up at and and how any other PRs in the game may have interacted last night, as to how my block ultimately will affect you.<br><br>To the last part, until Javert asked it, I never considered \"town\" a separate and distinct group. Allied? Yes. All having to cooperate to catch scum? Certainly. But since there is no pre-existing connection prior to the game (like with other groups) it fails, at least in my opinion, the \"Mafia Game\" definition of a group. Thinking how this role might affect a group that wasn't a group in my mind up until that point, never entered my thinking.<br><br>******<br>For any interested: Why I believe there are 2 Mafia Groups and why I think ICE confirmed that. <br><br>1)My Role Powers.<br><br>2)ICE was PISSED!!, he had certainly convinced himself there were two group and I don't think it was faked.<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICENinja wrote:</cite>Forget it, I'm not reading all this.

He went in as \"I'ma play as town and it going to be genuine because I REALLY AM hunting scum.\" Unfortunately for him, the theory was good but the execution failed. When he says he said what he did was \"to help town win (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2744361#p2744361\" class=\"postlink\">Post-194</a>)\" was a partial lie. He wants town to win but because of revenge not because he's being nice. If someone(s) called him out and he got lynched over it, it was automatically scum logic because \"he was playing as town\". It's the revenge part of it that makes me certain that he believed there are two groups and I am willing to believe him when he says he is certain there is another scum group.<br><br>Take points 1 and 2, and that's why I am more than willing to believe there are 2 Mafia in this game even though we have no objective proof of it as yet."}

A nightkill is a \"team\" power. Almost all other powers present in a mini-normal are individual powers unless specifically assigned by the mod to a team. Team in my mind equates directly to \"shared\". If anyone got the impression I said that I blocked an entire team, apologies for the wording. Never did I think my block was a blanket covering every member of an entire group. That is why Javert's question threw me so much. But I did know I wasn't going to answer him definitively at that time. He raised a point I absolutely hadn't considered based on how I assumed my role worked.<br><br>Nice dig at the end of that though David. Makes me look scummy and stupid all for the price of one sentence.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I was desperate to get pressure of my partner?? I'd love a single quote that shows this in the entire thread, because that's just a huge misrep. I was asking about the wagon as I was contemplating joining it and I felt he was near L-1, so I wanted others and myself aware of the state of the wagon. I had every intention of quite probably joining the wagon, you are basically saying me asking about the wagon but not joining it = intent to derail it?? </div></blockquote><br>There is no quote I can use. My accusation of you as ICE's partner is based on my interpretation of a pattern of behavior you showed in relation to him yesterday. There is no single quote from any of your posts that proves that. I'm asking the rest of the thread to accept my interpretation as valid.<br><br>and then this gem...<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, I hate to bring up self-meta, but this was brought up by someone in another game against me, funnily enough it might help here; my entire history of playing scum I've almost always bussed the shit out of my partners especially when they've played poorly. Even when they've played perfectly I've still bussed for no good reason. Scum-David definitely would have bussed Scum-Ice in this game, I'm just saying.</div></blockquote><br>Yes, I remember how you threw MichelSableheart under a bus in our last game together. As far as I can see, you do throw partners under a bus for \"no good reason\". Didn't work so well for you then did it? Three scum swinging in three days if I recall.<br><br>Point being, this I believe is a fairly extraordinary for your scum team. About to lose half the team on Day-1, so a change up in the way you play would be appropriate for this game.

(And no, I'm not partnered with Ice and trying to save myself). We can confirm there is 2 killing parties, we can confirm Oso's claim, we can make potential connections to both mafia parties. Not to mention, that why are we trying to eliminate one mafia party altogether? You seem to be assuming that their night kills are only capable of hitting town.. There is a good probabilty of them hitting scum. I mean even if we knew 100% who ice's partner was, keeping him alive, turns him into more or less a random-vig who we will later lynch. There's no reason we should be speculating too hard into Ice's scum-buddy when there is no huge gain to lynching his scum buddy over lynching scum of the opposing party. (Once again, i'm not ice's buddy trying to save myself, I honestly believe this, I'd probably be trying to prove my innocence if I was just ice's buddy at this point).<br><br>We have role information suggesting Edge is scum, acting upon actual role information gives just as much information as lynching somene based on analysis, and more information into the setup of the game and I see it as more likely to hit scum as well. <br><br>@Conspiracy: So you seem to be agreeing on 2 scum parties, then how does a group-roleblock not indicate scum? It doesn't mean it is for sure, but it definitely leads to that conclusion. Scum benefit more from night killing than not night killing. THere was only one night kill; something occurred to prevent a second night kill if there is two scum parties. We have a claim regarding a role that can stop a night kill (and can target one of two players to do so, with 2 scum teams). So yeah, his roleblock is definitely an indication towards scum.

I prefer to look at the poster in the \"bigger picture\". A single post of anyone regardless of alignment can be made to look scummy. And I've seen town players make really scummy posts at times, a personal favorite I've come back to a few times: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2635198#p2635198\">viewtopic.php?p=2635198#p2635198</a><!-- l --> . I died in this game and remember following it. I literally facepalmed when I read this post... I couldn't believe what I was reading. Thinking back on it, posts like this made me realize how you can't just look at PBPA. It's not that useful. I previously stated in this thread as well, I don't believe a scummy post is enough to come to the conclusion someone is scum, you have to look at the bigger picture; look at the player's intent (or what you perceive that to be) in posting a certain post. <br><br>I do however admit to flip-flopping somewhat with regard to how I viewed Ice's defense. Some of his posts were (like this one I linked) really bad. I found them scummy, others I found genuinely town (ie one of his last ones before claiming scum). I was leaning scum on Ice, but definitely not convinced, I was probably not willing to vote him as of his most recent post before his scum claim.<br><br>@magnus: I agree. My play today has been forced onto a \"defensive\" back foot. I don't have a strong case on anyone at this point or have a strong scum read on anyone. I'm willing to believe Oso's claim and as a result believe that Edge is scum based on role information and setup speculation that I believe to be reliable, but that isn't a personal scum read of my own. I don't actually strongly believe in my own case on Rob at this point.<br><br>So, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>,<br><br>You guys is referring to various claims,  by Rob/Oso now Mute (maybe yourself at times, I can't remember, and as I'm mid post not going to check now), that I was \"planning to derail the Ice wagon\"; that's why I was asking how big it was.. Because asking for a vote count and how many votes a player has suddenly became \"intent to derail the wagon\". Then Mute claims I had a \"semi-allegiance\" with Ice. This has probably been the worst mis-rep of what surpassed yesterday compared to what was done by Rob and others that I can see as merely being apart of his case, and his interpretation of my play. Ie: he sees me \"checking the ice wagon, and thinking of derailing it\", while in my eyes I'm just curious as to how large the wagon has become; whether it's worthwhile to join it at this point or whether the wagon is strong enough without me, as I wasn't sure of my read on Ice.. I wanted a vote player on a swingy-player I was undecided upon. That's all it was from my perspective. Other's saw it differently. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Edge wrote:</cite>However, something bothers me in your post. Oso's power is - apparently - very strong.

There was only one kill last night instead of two, when we are fairly certain there is 2 scum parties.

With roleinformation/claims that can help us there (there was a knife-kill last night, same of ice's allegieance, so you couldn't have blocked his partner), the only thing we can conclude is Edge is not Ice's scum buddy. I mean, I'm all for your analysis, but especially since I know your connections with me to Ice are entirely wrong, I thoroughly believe Edge is a valuable lynch for today.<br><br>@Magnus: I agree with a town-read on Javert, but not your reasoning; Scum can just as easily lay a gambit to gain negative attention, and while they know it may not back off and know a wagon on them will form, they also know that if they survive day 1 they will be in a very strong position as that wagon is harder to push later, with the reasoning that \"hey you were scummy on day one for that\", when they weren't lynched day 1 for that, so why lynch them on day 4 for it? <br><br>Anyways, As I said in response to you, I'd like this to be point-counterpoint based, and I am largely defending, I don't have a huge belief in cases against many of the players who are currently active. If I had to guess, I'd say 1-2 scum are among the lurkers (Prox/manut), and there's scum among Mute/Conspiracy. I believe Edge is likely to flip scum but solely based on Oso's claim.

Not to mention, that why are we trying to eliminate one mafia party altogether? You seem to be assuming that their night kills are only capable of hitting town.. There is a good probabilty of them hitting scum. I mean even if we knew 100% who ice's partner was, keeping him alive, turns him into more or less a random-vig who we will later lynch. There's no reason we should be speculating too hard into Ice's scum-buddy when there is no huge gain to lynching his scum buddy over lynching scum of the opposing party.

But to give you my thoughts, there are at least two things that are going to have to happen for me to seriously push at Edger today. Confirming (not just speculation, no matter how strong that speculation is in my mind) a second group and determinging the chance that a second kill wasn't prevented by some other player(s) actions or inaction.<br><br>Since neither of those things are likely to happen today, all my blocking him last night proves (provided I wasn't blocked) is that he had nothing at all to do with Humble's death. All I can really tell with any level of certainty, based on my action last night, is what Edger <span class=\"noboldsig\">didn't</span> do. Not what he might/might not have tried to do.<br><br>Edger is getting some moderate pressure today from some players based on my action and, as far as I can see, that is about as far as we are going to be able to take it today because right now, we only have three definite pieces of the set-up: Humble's alignment, ICENinja's alignment and my claim (provided you think it is a true claim) and a decent chance (in my opinion) of having guessed correctly about a forth part. Not really strong enough to push a lynch on someone based on that alone. In my opinion, it would be pretty much an informational lynch that stood a chance of hitting scum and I have no way to quantify what that chance might be other than the obvious 1 in (Alive Players - 1). Too many unknowns at the moment."}

Why on earth would the second mafia party not kill? It's blatantly obvious there is two mafia parties because of the \"knife\" and the \"gun\" flavor. ICE also claimed 2 parties. They had no benefit to trying to hide themselves by not night-killing. Furthermore, Edge is claiming that the second scum team took a gambit and that their gambit will pay off if Edge is lynched... How was this mafia to expect that there was a group-roleblock player who would claim day 2 making their no-night-kill gambit worthwhile??!??! Edge seems to be implying that the mafia no-killed to frame whoever the roleblocker targeted. But, they had no idea there was a roleblocker. Furthermore, while they may decide it's possible, they wouldn't have guessed it was a group-roleblocker. And it's a dumb gambit anyways, because even if they no-kill, theres a chance the roleblocker targets them and claims and gets them lynched even though they didn't kill. <br><br>Edge is missing the obvious. The most logical alternative to Edge not being scum is that a doctor or protector of some kind saved the \"gun\" mafia's target. Edge implying that it was some gambit to discredit Ice's claim (which was obviously true) and also to frame him (LOLWOT how did they know this was going to happen) makes him seem a whole lot scummier. He definitely isn't thinking through his defense to Oso's claim very well."}

Glad to have you.<br><br>@Here is the recap.<br><br>My vote <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750309#p2750309\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> of DavidParker here and two follow up posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750442#p2750442\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2752198#p2752198\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> (this is the post I claimed in, so it has a bit more that just David in there) and finally <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2753874#p2753874\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>. <br><br>Basically, in those four posts give the meat of the main points as to why I think David is ICENinja's partner.<br><br><ul><li>First three posts are poking at his behavior yesterday. In my opinion, he showed a marked reluctance to vote ICENinja and perhaps even considered testing the waters to see if he couldn't get some sort of pressure off ICE. David does deny that in later posts of his and his reasons aren't even really that bad. He states he didn't vote ICE until the end of the day because he was looking at other players as well and he flat denies doing anything to get pressure off of ICE. I'd counter his not voting ICE, for his stated reason, because he never does vote anyone. Nor does does he take as strong a stance, as he did with ICE, against anyone until ICE came out and admitted he was scum. Then he(David) votes.<br><br></li><li>The forth post lays out the reason why I think David has altered his normal scum game. He found him in a not very common situation for Day 1 in a mini: He was about to lose half his team. In addition, his normal play style as scum (bussing for any reason at all, that he used in his defense) hasn't done much for him. He even admitted <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2754253#p2754253\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. He's changed up because of the situation he finds himself in and because of past experience.<br><br></li><li>Those are my reason that don't rely on anyone else. But you can go ahead and add in RobCapone's concern here, in the first part of this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2758615#p2758615\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> as it ties in quite well of what I thought of David's suggestion <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2757676#p2757676\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br><blockquote><div><cite>David Parker wrote:</cite>..<br>I think lynching who Oso claims to have blocked last night gives us just as much and probably more info than lynching someone we think is partnered with Ice. (And no, I'm not partnered with Ice and trying to save myself). We can confirm there is 2 killing parties, we can confirm Oso's claim, we can make potential connections to both mafia parties. Not to mention, that why are we trying to eliminate one mafia party altogether? You seem to be assuming that their night kills are only capable of hitting town.. There is a good probabilty of them hitting scum. I mean even if we knew 100% who ice's partner was, keeping him alive, turns him into more or less a random-vig who we will later lynch. There's no reason we should be speculating too hard into Ice's scum-buddy when there is no huge gain to lynching his scum buddy over lynching scum of the opposing party. (Once again, i'm not ice's buddy trying to save myself, I honestly believe this, I'd probably be trying to prove my innocence if I was just ice's buddy at this point).<br>..</div></blockquote><br>Suggesting flipping Edger at this point for simple information? He spins it a bit later on in the post by referencing role-information is as good as analysis but even that fails at this point. Right now, all my information confirms (if you believe it) is what Edger didn't do and that is he didn't kill Humble. And actually advocating leaving town open to 2 NKs on purpose? I think he is doing exactly what he says he isn't and that's trying to keep from being lynched himself. I have my own concerns about Edger and many folks have voiced them in one form or another since I claimed so I don't want you guys to think I don't hear what you have been saying. I have. When we confirm a second group, and I think we will at some point, I'll be right in there grilling Edger. I think our time (this game day at least) is best spent making the best possible attempt we can to eliminate ICE's partner on the assumption there are 2/2-man scum groups, eliminating one NK.</li></ul>"}

Personally, I have a different opinion on a couple of points. First: Javert is slightly scummy to me. DP's recent activity is intriguingly weird. The two main events of the last pages are an attempt at telling Oso what to do at night, on which I already commented, and DP denying the option of a mafia no-kill. I could ask him to clarify this point, but to be honest what bothers me is that he is insisting on the existence of a doc. I smell a soft-fishing here. By all means, if a doc saved me, he must not claim to save my neck. We are very likely losing our claimed town rb tonight - if his claim, as I think, is true.<br><br>Rob's case on DP looked ill-defined at day start (see my ISO #6).

There's definitely no benefit to role fishing here for scum lol. <br><br>I'm not denying the option of a mafia-no-kill just saying its unlikely and not smart play for them if they had a night kill. My initial thought was actually that one mafia faction might have odd night kills, and the other faction have even night kills. But if both have nightkills every night then I am more inclined to believe that a PR prevented a kill last night than they no killed. No killing as mafia on night 1 is bad play. They have a chance of hitting Prs etc, and not night killing to confuse town with the 2 scum faction is not smart play. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>edge wrote:</cite>what bothers me is that he is insisting on the existence of a doc</div></blockquote><br><br>LOL? Major misrep more??!??! I believe your scum faction was roleblocked last night. The second most likely alternative is a doctor-like PR or something else saving the gun-mafia's target. The third most likely alternative for me is gun-mafia have even night kills and knife mafia having odd night kills. The Fourth most likely alternative is the gun-mafia choosing not to night kill. That is the least likely option. As I just stated there's no benefit to it. Those 4 options are ranked in what I perceive as the most likely to have happened last night. <br><br>yadee yah.

Reconciling N2 is still a bit ambiguous but much less so now in my mind.<br><br>Point 3: Rob got a guilty on Edger last night so my block of him(Edger) N1 adds weight, at least in my mind, that Rob is telling the absolute truth here. As I said above, Javert's status based solely on my block is still a bit ambiguous, at least in my mind.<br><br>Point 4: Jury is still out on that one. Best I could come up with is Kill/Blocked(or protected) Kill N1. And Blocked(or protected) Kill N2, with one group(or maybe even both) No-Killing N2 in the hopes of getting a frame fitted on the person I blocked if that person wasn't part of their group.<br><br>So, while I think the idea of getting Ice's partner has merit as it would cut down on townie deaths (1 possible NK instead of 2), the old \"bird in the hand\" saying comes to mind here.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Edgerobin</span><br><br>Based pretty much solely on how the claimed town PRs seems to have interacted over the last 2 nights."}

That being, I checked jimfinn's prior mod-related experience and looked for things that can explain last night's anomaly.  Right now, I think the missing kills from last night can be attributed to several different factors: (i) the \"Shooting\" Mafia may have \"no-killed\" last night in an attempt to make Edgerobin look better today; (ii) there may have been a successful Doctor protection; and (iii) each scum group might very well have a nightkill immunity.<br><br>I 100% stand by having Oso claim who he is going to role-block each night.

I am <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> about to get lynched.<br><br>For starters, I think we need to question our claimed Cop today.  For <span style=\"font-style: italic\">several</span> reasons.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1.)</span> First, the one player who died Night One -- HumblePoirot -- is the player RobCapone claims to have investigated on Night One.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.)</span> Despite apparently having zero information on Day Two, RobCapone was 100% gung-ho against DavidParker for the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">entirety</span> of Day Two.  He voted DavidParker out of the gate, and never changed his vote to another player.  A <span style=\"font-style: italic\">real</span> Cop would probably not exhibit \"100% certainty\" on a player they did not actually investigate, because if DavidParker was not lynched but RobCapone later died and showed as Cop, the natural conclusion we would be led to is that RobCapone had had a guilty result on DavidParker on Day Two.  In other words, RobCapone's play does not match how a Cop would play.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.)</span> Then, on Night Two, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">he investigates the player everybody was probably already thinking about lynching on Day Three</span>.  On Day Three, after knowing he was going to catch flak after mislynching DavidParker, he immediately calls out a guilty on Edgerobin.  As if that were even really necessary.  Why claim a guilty result on a player who is, in all probability, already going to get lynched?  Once again, this is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> how a Cop would play.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4.)</span> Then on Night Three, instead of investigating me -- which would make sense given his investigation target for Night Two -- he conveniently claims to have investigated the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">one</span> player who died overnight.  (Just like Night One.)  It makes no sense that he would, for some reason, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">avoid</span> investigating me <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but also</span> investigate Edgerobin.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">5.)</span> RobCapone just claimed he investigated Amrun because he felt Amrun was \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">bussing Edgerobin</span>\".  But if <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> am \"obviously scum,\" it would seriously only make the slightest <span style=\"font-style: italic\">ounce</span> of sense if I were scum with Edgerobin.  Anybody who thinks I could have even possibly <span style=\"font-style: italic\">bussed</span> ICEninja, in a game where each scum group apparently only has two members, is being absolutely ridiculous.  So his alleged reasons for investigating Amrun do not even make sense.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">6.)</span> I think the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">reason</span> RobCapone did not \"investigate\" me is because I am Town, and he therefore <span style=\"font-style: italic\">cannot</span> claim a guilty on me.  But he also cannot afford to call me Town, because that takes a player out of the pool of possible mislynches.  Therefore, he goes with the \"safest\" route -- by giving us no information whatsoever.<br><br>~<br><br>TL;DR: RobCapone has claimed to investigate exactly three players.  He claims he investigated the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">only two players who have been night-killed</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> not only that, but that he investigated them <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">on the same night they died</span>.  He also claims he investigated the \"obvious\" scum on Night Two, but chose not to investigate the \"obvious\" scum on Night Three.  And if you lynch me, you will see that the \"obvious\" scum he actually claimed a guilty on was scum, but that the \"obvious\" scum he did not investigate is Town.<br><br>If I am lynched today, lynch RobCapone's ass tomorrow.  No questions, no qualms, no second chances.  I called him out as ICEninja's partner on Day One, and given the way he has played, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">still</span> think he is ICEninja's partner.<br><br>For the record, I think Mute and ConSpiracy are the most likely candidates for Edgerobin's partner.  <br><br>~<br><br>In any case, we need to hear who Oso claims to have role-blocked.  Seeing as it is Day Four, I also would not be averse to a mass-claim.  We are in a good position, and I do not want to see it go to waste."}

I can't explain really why there was no kills on N2 except as the above. With everyone hot to go after my N1 Target(Edger) regardless of what DavidParker flipped (and yes, I was in that group) No-Killing on Night 2 makes a lot sense when you consider the point of view of both groups. Knife Mafia lost one and stayed hidden D2, we lynched David instead. Gun Mafia <span class=\"noboldsig\">WAS</span> going to lose Edger on Day 3 pretty much as a given, so <span class=\"noboldsig\">BOTH</span> groups had a motive to not NK N2 and hope that I didn't by chance pick one of the (non Edger)/(non ICENinja) members of the respective groups so that they could line up my target for a lynch today.<br><br>Obviously, if both did no-kill for that reason, they arrived at it independent of one another so it is possible (barely in my opinion) that I prevented a kill N2. I think it much more likely, based on the way I would have played in their position, that I did nothing of any note N2. I blocked Javert but I think there is a high possibility that both groups chose to not kill that night.<br><br>Which brings me to my vote today:<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RobCapone</span><br><br>[Note:Bold in the quotes put in by me]<br><blockquote><div><cite>The OP wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">HumblePoirot, vanilla townie, Stabbed N1</span><br>DavidParker, vanilla townie, Lynched D2.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Edgerobin, Gun mafia goon, lynched D3</span><br>{manutdforev10} replaced by <span class=\"noboldsig\">Amrun, vanilla townie, Shot N3</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone - <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2774822#p2774822\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> wrote:</cite>I am cop<br><br>If town I get innocent<br>If not I get guilty<br>He did throw in a comment that I'm not guaranteed to be sane but n1 <span class=\"noboldsig\">I got innocent on Humble</span> which confirmed I'm not insane or paranoid leaving normal or naive<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I got guilty on edge</span> so that eliminated naive.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2782532#p2782532\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> wrote:</cite>we are doing great but I suck at choosing investigations.<br><br>I didn't want to choose Javert because I felt he was obviously scum based on him being blocked and both kills failed. <span class=\"noboldsig\">My inno last night was amrun</span>, I can't tell you why chose him but just something about his post yesterday bugged me it felt like he was bussing Edge since I got a guilty.<br>..<br>[snip]</div></blockquote><br>Three dead players that coincide with Rob's investigations. The two innocents show up on the dead list before we get his results, the scum shows up there as a direct result of two night actions. Mine, which incriminates him, and Rob's which leaves little room for doubt.<br><br>N1 with only a single kill and my ability to block shared group powers, along with the individual targeted, pretty much guaranteed that Edger was swinging closer to the beginning of the game than the end of it. Rob fake claimed cop to get some humongous town cred by bussing Edger and added validity by claiming HumblePoirot as his Night 1 investigation. I bought it. Humble is a good player to confirm as town or scum early in the game if you can so his(Rob's) choice of Humble didn't register as even slightly off.<br><br>What is off is his choice of investigation for last night. Not that he chose Amrun specifically but rather I thought he chose Edger as a target because of my block. He never did actually say though (or if he did, I couldn't find it) so it follows that since Javert was blocked on a No-Kill night, he'd target him. I know I suggested Prox or Jerbs as alternatives to whoever he(Rob) might be thinking of targeting but I wasn't surprised that he didn't pick either of them. With so much going on right at the moment, I would probably put the two \"lurkers\" low on the priority list if I were a cop instead of an RB.<br><br>Point being, there are two things has to do. 1)Avoid a counter claim and 2)Make sure no \"innocent\" he gets shows up as \"mafia\" in the dead list.<br><br>He can't do much about #1 except take a deep breath, cross his fingers and hope for the best. #2 is best done by selling the town the only result he knows is true (Edgerobin), referencing the dead guy (Humble) and then killing his investigation. If he happens to kill Member #2 of the opposite scum team, so much the better. He can sell a ture innocent to the town and have at least that person on his side for the rest of the game."}

We won't be sure until after the game is over but with the early indications of the thread's willingness to lynch Edger based on my block alone, I think it highly likely that both scum groups left me alone Night 2 hoping that 1)Gun Mafia: Lending weight to Edger's defense by No-Killing so as to make it look as if there is another role out there preventing kills, in addition to making ICENinja's rant look like he was just adding confusion and the possibility of framing block target when Edger flipped scum. 2)Knife Mafia: Down to one member, No-Killed to frame my target.<br><br>That is why I was (still am to certain degree) against pre-announcing my block targets. Unless it is bulletproofed, it's too easy to get a townie lynched. But seeing as how it's getting on into the game, most of my objections to announcing block targets are pretty much gone at the moment.<br><br>So, if I'm right and you didn't save me Night 2, you had an active save going into Night 3. Knife Mafia had to kill last night. A Claimed buffed-up RB and Claimed Cop with the only safe bet they can make is that both are true claiming and try and kill one of them. Rob is the most dangerous to either Mafia if true-claimed so he would most likely draw kills and by that thinking Doc protection, so I would be the target. I'm still alive so that points strongly to the fact I may have saved myself last night by blocking Prox or that Knife Mafia WIFOMed itself into targeting Rob and you prevented their kill.<br><br>Rob <span class=\"noboldsig\">IS</span> Gun Mafia. The only reason I'm not dead by a bullet is because Gun Mafia went Doc hunting last night instead of taking a chance I'd draw Doc protection and having a failed kill. Rob knows he's mafia so it wouldn't be much of a stretch to convince himself that I was the more \"obvTown\" of the two claimed roles and more likely to draw protection than his role.<br><br>So, Rob is scum. Neither Javert or Prox look good but depending on what has actually happened, neither is obvScum based on my blocks alone.<br><br>It all depends on how you folks think the two scum groups acted N2. My personal opinion agrees a bit with what Rob said (I think it was Rob) that No-Killing early in the game is bad, we have Edger's flip and ICENinja's flip to reinforce that both groups were thinking that on N1. My claim changed that though, now No-Killing N2 looks attractive despite the fact is runs counter to generally \"good\" scum play.<br><br>If we are not going to lynch Rob today, my vote would be Prox (yes, I'm buying into the hype on this role a bit) as I think it more likely I blocked a kill N3 than on N2 but with an even chance (based on how I think things have worked so far in the game) that Prox is gonna flip town.<br><br>Rob is my choice for today with Prox as a distant second and Javert as <span class=\"noboldsig\">VERY</span> distant third. As a matter of fact, I can't really see any way Javert would get my vote today."}

I am not advocating lynching the cop. I am advocating the lynch of the scum who has constructed a fake-claim of cop using the one piece of information he is certain of (His partner's, Edgerobin, alignment) and two pieces of information that were public knowledge before he made us aware of them. The alignment of HumblePoirot and Amrun.<br><br>He constructed the fake-claim N2 with input from his partner (who was going to be swinging in any case) so as to give him(you Rob) the maximum amount of town credibility with the least amount of risk. It is a gambit. The only dicey part is/was a counter claim and inadvertently \"clearing\" the remaining member of the Knife Mafia and either having him in the endgame with you (Rocks Fall, Everbody Dies) or show up as non-investigation immune scum in the dead list after being \"cleared\".<br><br>Avoiding the first part relies partially on luck but also some not-to-difficult guess work based on my claimed role and the power you know at least one of the mafia groups have. I'ma guess 2 groups of plain-vanilla goon scum groups. With my claimed powers, taking the shot that there is no cop isn't that much of a risk. A cop/buffed RB on town side vs 2 plain vanilla scum groups is tilted in favor of town. What is much more likely is that the game is balanced on town side with super RB/&lt;weaker role(s) here&gt; combo rather than a super RB/Cop/&lt;whatever&gt; combo. The Cop false-claim isn't at that much of a risk for a counter even with only my claim showing.<br><br>The second part is easier but actually more risky if you think about it. You can only \"investigate\" dead folks. The only person whose alignment you are certain of (other than your own) is Edger's. Even selling \"innocents\" (fairly safe in a one Mafia Game) has different consequences here. So your targets have to already be dead or you have to kill them as you \"investigate\" them."}

There is a possibility that I did in fact block him from killing on N2. If we take it that Magnus saved me night 2 then he could have indeed been a second killer that was blocked.

So that block has a high probability of having done just exactly what we all thought it did: Blocked a kill. After I claimed, it became a bit more problematic. I got lucky N1. Unless I have been supremely lucky (as in all the stars aligned lucky) he is probably the only scum I blocked because I chose Edger and Javert to block for both the same reasons. I liked the way they were posting and wasn't searching for scum in either case. I was trying to use this role to <span class=\"noboldsig\">CONFIRM TOWNIES</span>. By the way I read my role (and from what ICENinja said before he swung) two kills in a night + my block = a confirmed townie.<br><br>But since each night that I blocked, there is a missing kill, no one who I blocked is off my suspect list by any means. I haven't come right and said it but I'm sure Javert realizes this as well. I am not going to vote him today, but he has no guarantee that  he won't be swinging before the end of the game because of my blocking him on a no-kill night whether I push it or not."}

Many scum can do it right, but I guess your inexperience as scum handicapped you.</div></blockquote><br>I just read over ICEninja's posts, and found nothing about ICEninja claiming to be inexperienced as scum.  (I admit, though, that this is information can be deduced from ICEninja's signature.)  But in context of the game, this comment feels like it is referring to a conversation that I would expect to see in a scum quicktopic.  Something like:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja, Hypothetical QT Discussion wrote:</cite>Hey partner -- looks like it's just the two of us, so there's probably another scum team.  I've only finished one game as scum so far, so I'm a bit inexperienced, but I will try to play just like I normally do.  After all, we should try to lynch the other mafia team...</div></blockquote><br><br>I also think it is notable that the only time Prox actually interacted with anybody in the game over anything substantive was to argue with ICEninja after ICEninja was already lynched.  <br><br>Here's my best guess for how things went down for ICEninja and Prox.  I am assuming at this point that scum could indeed talk with each other via a QuickTopic during the Day (though it is certainly not necessary to see the pairing).<br><br>Once the game gets rolling, Prox gets annoyed that ICEninja is being wagoned, so instead of doing anything, he only comments on ICEninja and claims he does not have time to read the game.  ICEninja complains about the game in the QuickTopic, and probably asks Prox to unvote in such a way that maybe other people will unvote, too.  Hence we get <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741933#p2741933\" class=\"postlink\">Post 156</a>, where Prox uses plenty of language in favor of ICEninja (\"I might be getting caught up in a fallacy,\" \"I'm sure both town AND scum try too hard to look like townies,\" and \"there's no need to rush.\")  But after assessing the situation and deciding that trying to save ICEninja is probably a lost cause, Prox just votes ICEninja again.  Which likely did not go over well with ICEninja.<br><br>Then, when ICEninja has been lynched (and basically says \"I hate all of you, you suck\"), Prox throws in a jab -- \"I guess your inexperience as scum handicapped you.\"  Which ICEninja responds to in kind -- \"your reasons sucked.\"  Not only does this strike me as distancing, but it also strikes me as two scum who are angry at each other, and with each other's play.<br><br>And then by Day Two, Prox realized he was probably not going to win and so just stopped trying.  Which means no Stabbings on N2 or N3."}

If someone wanted to frame Javert, my block of him on a no-kill night would do that just great. Hell, even Javert figured he had and better than even chance of being lynched today with my block on him. They had no idea that the pressure would never really develop on Javert today. At least not enough to go out of their way to try and add to that by trying to night-kill frame him ESPECIALLY since they had two targets in me and you. And remember, if Magnus saved me night 2, gun mafia knows there is a protective role going into night 3. So they have two nice juicy town PRs and probably only one protector.<br><br>B)Again, why. Same logic as above. Two PRs that way more dangerous to him than Amrun.<br><br>There is one other way that I did think of that we can both still be alive and both still be town (but it relies on you having very bad luck). Gun Mafia got so paranoid about losing another Night Kill that they bypassed the whole \"which PR might draw the protection\" dilemma and went Doc hunting. That they shot the target of your investigation was just pure coincidence. Bad luck does happen, just like good luck does and it has to be factored in but I just don't know how to do that with any accuracy.<br><br>I don't have a problem with your choice of HumblePoirot. I've played with him before and he's a good town player so I also assume he's decent at playing scum. Targeting him for an investigation makes sense to me N1 in any game so you know you can trust him (if town) or get rid of him immediately (if scum). That he also drew a Night-Kill right out of the barn doesn't surprise me either. It makes sense (if you have played with him before) that he has a good chance of drawing the attention of both Mafia and Town PRs night 1, just on general principles.<br><br>I don't have a problem with you investigating Edger. I blocked him on a night where we only had 1 kill when the general thinking was we should have had 2.<br><br>I don't have a real problem with you not investigating me over someone else. My block of Edger and your investigation, if you are town, of Edger pretty much confirms me as town as there is no reason to set up that elaborate a bus on Day 2 with neither Edger or myself under any serious scrutiny Day 1.<br><br>I don't have a real problem with you investigating Amrun in and of itself.<br><br>What I do have a problem with is not investigating Javert. After your investigating Edger on my block, it looks as if you don't want to confirm him nor do you want to waste an NK on a very good chance at a mis-lynch if you are scum. As you said, he was so scummy you didn't feel the need to confirm him but the fact is that you had the claimed power to do just that, confirm him one way or the other and you didn't. It looks like you left mis-lynch material out there to use at your leisure.<br><br>So, bad luck if you are town. The game has played out to look(to me at least) as if you constructed a claim to bus a partner that was going to swing anyway, crossed your fingers, and then used someone already dead and someone that you killed to get \"confirmed\" alignments on your investigations for innocents while leaving the one person most implicated by my role-blocks just flapping in the breeze for use later.<br><br>It is not any one thing Rob, its the whole series of events. The most damning part of it is that after I claimed, most all of my results became subject to manipulation by scum (something I have to think on if I get a similar role again as far as when to claim goes) and you had the claimed power to clear or confirm Javert as scum and didn't. That is not town. That is not even anti-town. That is scum leaving usable material for later.<br><br>But<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: RobCapone</span><br>Pending replacement, I'll vote Prox. If he does flip Knife Mafia then we have an explanation for one of the no-kills night two and the no-kill last night (not because of my block though). As I said earlier, most folks are assuming magnus saved me N2 so that would clear Javert based on my block. If this role can't definitively and reliably point out scum, I'll do my best to try and confirm town with it."}

It's me pretty much thinking out loud about the claimed PRs/VTs (and yes, I did try to step out of my role at look at my claim as well. So I included myself here).<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Oso - Super RB.</span><br>Claimed Day 2 with a block of Edger. Edger flipped Gun Mafia. I'm not Gun Mafia as bussing Edger at that point makes no sense. ICE's flip would have confirmed to Gun Mafia there was a second group so no reason at all for either Edger or I to be worried in the slightest. Neither of us had any serious doubts thrown at us Day 1. Could be Knife Mafia though. I saw the trouble ICE was in and bussed him hard despite it being Day 1. Cobbled up this claim when we had a one kill night and ICE and I were reasonably certain there was a second group. I knew Edger stood a good chance of being \"other\" mafia because I did block Edger. I am an RB, just a scum RB. Plan being to No-Kill and frame my targets. Hopefully though, my play thus far has dispelled any thoughts along those lines.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Rob - Cop</span><br>Claimed Day 3 with a guilty on Edger. Edger flipped scum. Rob is not Knife Mafia. I have not blocked Rob(if you folks do believe my claim) so since ICENinja is dead there is no way I could have prevented any Knife Mafia kills so far in the game if Rob is Knife Mafia. So if Rob is Knife Mafia, any kill attempts he made would have to have failed by other means. He could be Gun Mafia based on the reasoning I used in previous posts. Small disclaimer here: I think my reasoning is sound but I will go so far as to give Rob the fact that what I am using to make me think he is guilty can be explained by a run of bad luck and coincidences and there is the matter that we have the whole game claimed right now and there is no counter to the Cop claim so at it's very base, either he is the Cop or the game doesn't have one. Everybody's own personal theory of game balance is going to have to come into play there. If you think game balance says there is a cop in this game, then no matter what I (or anyone else) say or how much sense it may(or may not) make, you really have no choice, Rob is the cop.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">magnus_orion - Nerfed Doctor</span><br>Claimed Day 4. No doubt in my mind. He is 100% what he claims to be. No Counter claim but even before that we had a no-kill night. Even hypothetically granting I blocked one of them by blocking Javert, he(magnus) pretty much had to stop one himself. I am reversing myself on one of the no-kills being explained by one (or both) of the Mafia groups deliberately No-Killing N2. Unlike N1, when Gun Mafia had no reason to think there was a role with my powers in the game, on Night 2 there is plenty of reason to believe (or strongly suspect) that there is a protector in the game but the only way to know for sure is to hit the obvious target. If you are right, you have confirmed the presence of a protector and in addition, shows you a claim you can't use as a false claim. If not, you just killed a dangerous PR. That is a Good/Very Good no-brainer choice there. I'm a bit put out with myself though, that it took me this long to shoot great big holes through that thought. So magnus is confirmed town in my opinion.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Javert - VT</span><br>I think he is most probably town. That said, he was the target of a block by me on N2 (a no-kill night) so I'ma condense this a bit. If the missing knife kills are a result of a flaked player, he's probably town because magnus saved me from a gun kill N2 and Javert was blocked so he couldn't be killing anyone unless I just happened to luck out and get the second member of the gun mafia team and Magnus didn't save me. If the missing knife kill N2/N3 can't be explained by a flaked player and we've have had 2 active groups all three nights, then he's right back in the pool of suspects again in my mind. That is where I am going round and round in my mind in regards to Javert. If we have two active killing groups (prox not flaked knife mafia) then either magnus saved me from a \"double tap\" and Javert is town, or that magnus still saved me but I blocked one of the kills. Even if Prox(now Shattered) was Knife Mafia and flaked, Javert could have still been blocked and it only looks as if magnus saved me. If I am completely honest with myself, a part of the reason I am so put out with Rob at the moment may be because he <span class=\"noboldsig\">DIDN'T INVESTIGATE JAVERT</span> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":mad:\" title=\"Mad\"> and solve this question for good. A result on a non-dead player would have been been good enough to class Rob as Town, but a result on a non-dead Javert, would have been just what would have cemented Rob as obvTown just as firmly as magnus is in my mind.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Shattered View Point(Prox), Mute, ConSpiracy, Jerbs - VTs</span><br>Need to look at all of them in detail. I have to admit I've been concentrating on my own role and how the other PRs might have interacted as they claimed so of all the claimed Vanillas, only Javert, DavidParker(deceased) and to a lesser degree Shattered(Prox) and Jerbs have gotten any thought by me."}

Although I still think he is Edge's partner, I would like to point this out.<br>If you don't have the time to read this, read the blue lines. However, it is important to understand my line of thought and I highly suggest at least skimming through it.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup deduction</span><br>According to the mass-claim we have this:<br>2 knife mafia (presumably goons)<br>2 gun mafia (presumably goons)<br>1 entertainer (conditioned super roleblocker)<br>1 cop<br>1 medic student (conditioned doc)<br>6 VT<br><br>I don't think the mafias have any special powers. If one has a power, the other should have one, too. With both one power the setup is far too balanced towards the mafia. Those should be either 1-shot or a semi-useful role (voyeur, bodyguard, etc.) to stop them making overpowered. On top of that we would have been very unlucky to have both goons killed which is just a 25% chance to occur.<br>On top of that the scum has a possibility of having a day-QT, as ICE said when he outed himself. I know this doesn't have to be true, but he didn't lie about the 2 scum teams either.<br><br>However, 2 goon mafia with the entertainer, cop and medic student is far too balanced towards town. If either the entertainer or the cop outs himself he can be protected by the med student and won't be attacked until the med student is killed. If one of the entertainer or the cop is killed fast town can fully rely on the other and when the med student is killed both the entertainer and the cop have a free night.<br>Even if both mafias have a one-shot power, those can't be useful enough to help mafia enough to wall up against 3 powers.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: The entertainer/cop/med student is overpowered and one of them must have lied</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rules application</span><br>We have a medic student and an entertainer. Both roles are odd and don't occur often. I searched for some statistics and found this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>New/variant roles may be included in limited number (no more than 1 in a Mini, 2 in a Large), and should be based on the usual role mechanics: Killing, Protecting, Investigating, Blocking, Voting, Enabling and Communication.</div></blockquote><br>This means that there may just be 1 special role. <br>After that I searched if 1 of both roles can be normal and found this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>Roles which are explicitly Normal include:<br>Vanilla Townie, Sane Cop, Doctor, Vigilante, Roleblocker, Mason, Jailkeeper, Tracker, Watcher, Gunsmith, Miller, Bodyguard, Role Cop, Doublevoter, Hider, Neighbor, Bulletproof, Jack of All Trades, Serial Killer, Mafia Traitor, Mafia Godfather, Mafia Framer, Mafia-aligned versions of above roles</div></blockquote><br>This are the non-variant possible modifiers:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>Modifiers which are explicitly Normal include:<br>Even/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Macho, Weak, Back-Up (with or without primary role present)</div></blockquote><br>Let's read back both the medic student and the entertainer to see if both apply for variant role.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus_Orion wrote:</cite>I'm the doc. Well, sort of. The role's name is given as \"Med Student\" I can protect someone each night. I'm not told whether or not the protection was successful... If it is successful, however, then my protections no longer work after that point. I basically become a vanilla.<br>I think I was probably successful Night 2 when I protected oso. <br>I protected Javert N1, and Rob N3 (cause Oso said to, and I didn't really think it mattered cause I thought I was successful N2)</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus_Orion wrote:</cite>I re-read my role pm to clarify 1 thing, and noticed something else, so I have 2 clarifications to make<br>1. The protection stops working the night after a successful protection, so presumably I can block all kills during 1 night<br>2. I may be able to successfully protect tonight if I was successful night 2, I had assumed I can never protect successfully again, but upon re-reading I noticed that its possible to interpret my role pm as only preventing me from protecting only one night after I successfully make a protection.</div></blockquote><br>Apart fromt he ambiguity about changing his RC, this is definitely a variant role. The Non-Consecutive Night comes near, but isn't the same: He can protect consecutive nights, but doesn't know the second time the protection doesn't count.<br><br>Let's see the entertainer role, then:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>Claim: Entertainer (for the purposes of this game that means roleblocker)<br><br>I function as a normal roleblocker but have a restriction and a bonus. I can't target the same player two nights in a row but if I block a member of a group, I block any team abilities they have as well (whether the person I actually target has any abilities or not). It probably goes without saying but I'll say it anyway: Town wins, I win.</div></blockquote><br>This also is definitely a variant role. Non of the \"possible\" modifiers do not even come close to this.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: 1 of them is scum, or both of them are scum</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup deduction II</span><br>This brings me to the second point. If either Oso or Magnus is scum, the setup can only be (cop/)entertainer, (cop/)med student. However, only an entertainer or a med student is far too overpowered towards town. That would mean (if town loses night 1 either the entertainer or the med student) the setup would be either 7:2:2 or 8:2:1. Both are far to much scum favored and there has to be at least one cross kill to grant town a win (in the second one that isn't true, but is very difficult to win without). A game that is based on a cross kill is extremely town unfavoured. <br>A cop, however, doesn't make the other role overpowered (as a doc would) and would lessen the uphill battle. <br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: The cop is town</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Oso scum</span><br>If Oso is scum, he would have given us a very good fake-claim. He has to be scum with either Edgerobin or ICEninja.<br>Edgerobin-partner: Very unlikely, since he solely caused suspicion on edge.<br>ICEninja-partner: This one is more interesting. He was the fourth voter of the ICE wagon and could be scum throwing his partner under the bus. A scum day-QT would make this possibility a lot higher, but still. All Oso did day 1 after voting ICE was focussing on ICE. An experienced player would know the first wagon to be made doesn't necessarely have to be the lynch. The Oso knife scum would at least have left that road open.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Magnus scum</span><br>If Magnus is scum, he would be:<br>Edgerobin-partner: Let's get some quotes in<br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>Edgerobin is a high priority suspect, due to oso's claim. However, there are plausible alternative explanations for the lack of kill</div></blockquote><br>True, when I read this, I immediately thought about him being the med student (although it could be a fake doc crumb). However, this gives a great connection to me: Yes edge is my scumpartner, but I'd rather let him live. It leaves a bus attempt wide open.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>Edgerobin is scum, 99.999999999%<br>However, Javert's point about role-blocking edge is good. So let's take out ICE's partner first.</div></blockquote><br>Exactly the same. <br>These are the only things about Edge that said Edgetown/Edgescum. He only asked questions in the other Edge-mentions. Let's give that a gun mafia possibility.<br>ICE-partner: I have pointed this out earlier, but I will do it again.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>I'm still gonna need ICE to clarify the stuff I mentioned in 106, but as of right now I'm not really supportive of the ICE wagon... that being said, Poirot has mentioned things to the effect that more interesting things lie after this wagon was pursued somewhat, but the initial foundation, at least, I feel is pretty shaky. I'll need to look into these later things poirot's referred to when I have more time...</div></blockquote><br>That's ICE-partner +1. I give it a +2 because he kept asking about ICE without forming an opinion. Those questions weren't calling ICE either scum or town. So magnus is also possible to be scum with Ice.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: Magnus is scum, Oso is high likely to be town</span></span><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Magnus_Orion</span><br><br>Well guys, that is a sudden change isn't it?"}

The \"can't target the same player two nights in a row\" is a safety valve to keep from shutting down one mafia completely by blocking one person continuously (a good example here would have been Edger).<br><br>But I do agree with Javert, it could still be non-normal because we have two roles that don't conform exactly (as in 100%) to the accepted \"normal\" versions of the role.<br><br>All I know for sure is that before ConSpiracy posted, I wasn't even thinking of voting magnus and that hasn't changed.<br><br>I'll be voting Shattered Viewpoint just as soon as I am certain he's oriented to the game and answered some of the questions directed at him."}

Both roles are odd and don't occur often. I searched for some statistics and found this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>New/variant roles may be included in limited number (no more than 1 in a Mini, 2 in a Large), and should be based on the usual role mechanics: Killing, Protecting, Investigating, Blocking, Voting, Enabling and Communication.</div></blockquote><br>This means that there may just be 1 special role. <br>After that I searched if 1 of both roles can be normal and found this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>Roles which are explicitly Normal include:<br>Vanilla Townie, Sane Cop, Doctor, Vigilante, Roleblocker, Mason, Jailkeeper, Tracker, Watcher, Gunsmith, Miller, Bodyguard, Role Cop, Doublevoter, Hider, Neighbor, Bulletproof, Jack of All Trades, Serial Killer, Mafia Traitor, Mafia Godfather, Mafia Framer, Mafia-aligned versions of above roles</div></blockquote><br>This are the non-variant possible modifiers:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal game rules wrote:</cite>Modifiers which are explicitly Normal include:<br>Even/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Macho, Weak, Back-Up (with or without primary role present)</div></blockquote><br>Let's read back both the medic student and the entertainer to see if both apply for variant role.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus_Orion wrote:</cite>I'm the doc. Well, sort of. The role's name is given as \"Med Student\" I can protect someone each night. I'm not told whether or not the protection was successful... If it is successful, however, then my protections no longer work after that point. I basically become a vanilla.<br>I think I was probably successful Night 2 when I protected oso. <br>I protected Javert N1, and Rob N3 (cause Oso said to, and I didn't really think it mattered cause I thought I was successful N2)</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus_Orion wrote:</cite>I re-read my role pm to clarify 1 thing, and noticed something else, so I have 2 clarifications to make<br>1. The protection stops working the night after a successful protection, so presumably I can block all kills during 1 night<br>2. I may be able to successfully protect tonight if I was successful night 2, I had assumed I can never protect successfully again, but upon re-reading I noticed that its possible to interpret my role pm as only preventing me from protecting only one night after I successfully make a protection.</div></blockquote><br>Apart fromt he ambiguity about changing his RC, this is definitely a variant role. The Non-Consecutive Night comes near, but isn't the same: He can protect consecutive nights, but doesn't know the second time the protection doesn't count.<br><br>Let's see the entertainer role, then:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>Claim: Entertainer (for the purposes of this game that means roleblocker)<br><br>I function as a normal roleblocker but have a restriction and a bonus. I can't target the same player two nights in a row but if I block a member of a group, I block any team abilities they have as well (whether the person I actually target has any abilities or not). It probably goes without saying but I'll say it anyway: Town wins, I win.</div></blockquote><br>This also is definitely a variant role. Non of the \"possible\" modifiers do not even come close to this.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: 1 of them is scum, or both of them are scum</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup deduction II</span><br>This brings me to the second point. If either Oso or Magnus is scum, the setup can only be (cop/)entertainer, (cop/)med student. However, only an entertainer or a med student is far too overpowered towards town. That would mean (if town loses night 1 either the entertainer or the med student) the setup would be either 7:2:2 or 8:2:1. Both are far to much scum favored and there has to be at least one cross kill to grant town a win (in the second one that isn't true, but is very difficult to win without). A game that is based on a cross kill is extremely town unfavoured. <br>A cop, however, doesn't make the other role overpowered (as a doc would) and would lessen the uphill battle. <br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: The cop is town</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Oso scum</span><br>If Oso is scum, he would have given us a very good fake-claim. He has to be scum with either Edgerobin or ICEninja.<br>Edgerobin-partner: Very unlikely, since he solely caused suspicion on edge.<br>ICEninja-partner: This one is more interesting. He was the fourth voter of the ICE wagon and could be scum throwing his partner under the bus. A scum day-QT would make this possibility a lot higher, but still. All Oso did day 1 after voting ICE was focussing on ICE. An experienced player would know the first wagon to be made doesn't necessarely have to be the lynch. The Oso knife scum would at least have left that road open.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Magnus scum</span><br>If Magnus is scum, he would be:<br>Edgerobin-partner: Let's get some quotes in<br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>Edgerobin is a high priority suspect, due to oso's claim. However, there are plausible alternative explanations for the lack of kill</div></blockquote><br>True, when I read this, I immediately thought about him being the med student (although it could be a fake doc crumb). However, this gives a great connection to me: Yes edge is my scumpartner, but I'd rather let him live. It leaves a bus attempt wide open.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>Edgerobin is scum, 99.999999999%<br>However, Javert's point about role-blocking edge is good. So let's take out ICE's partner first.</div></blockquote><br>Exactly the same. <br>These are the only things about Edge that said Edgetown/Edgescum. He only asked questions in the other Edge-mentions. Let's give that a gun mafia possibility.<br>ICE-partner: I have pointed this out earlier, but I will do it again.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnus wrote:</cite>I'm still gonna need ICE to clarify the stuff I mentioned in 106, but as of right now I'm not really supportive of the ICE wagon... that being said, Poirot has mentioned things to the effect that more interesting things lie after this wagon was pursued somewhat, but the initial foundation, at least, I feel is pretty shaky. I'll need to look into these later things poirot's referred to when I have more time...</div></blockquote><br>That's ICE-partner +1. I give it a +2 because he kept asking about ICE without forming an opinion. Those questions weren't calling ICE either scum or town. So magnus is also possible to be scum with Ice.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Conclusion: Magnus is scum, Oso is high likely to be town</span></span><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Magnus_Orion</span><br><br>Well guys, that is a sudden change isn't it?</div></blockquote><br><br>So am I to take all this to mean you think I'm knife mafia (cause you think javert is gun)? K. I think you're arguments are flawed from their initial premises. I do see how you can interpret those quotes that way, but the \"crumb\" interpretations were correct. I was saying those things because I could've protected javert night 1, instead of oso blocking edge, and if my block worked n2, it would make it highly likely edge was scum. And if it didn't work, it would make it nearly absolute that Edge was town. I didn't have a strong read on edge, so I was relying primarily on role info in regards to edge."}

If you block mafia however, you block the entire party, which is not a normal roleblocker. You role even has a different name than roleblocker.<br><br>Actually Oso, you got me thinking. I read up the rules about a roleblocker again and it contained this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Normal roleblocker rules wrote:</cite>The Roleblocker chooses one player per night to block from performing his or her night choice. The target's night choice will not be performed, and the target may or may not be informed he was blocked, depending on the game mechanics.

It would be a pretty good move since you had N2 2 scum possibilities to hit (edge wasn't possible) opposed to 7 townies. It would give town false information. On top of that there is the possibility of flaked night kills, as you said yourself, though I don't think that will be the thing.<br><br>The reason why you and rob are both still breathing is also easily explainable. At first there has only been 1 night kill since you outed yourself. That isn't very much.<br><br>A case on RobCapone was the first thing to happen when Day 4 started. I myself was also suspicious about him investigating humble poirot and the claim could be faked easily. Both scum could think of that.<br><br>You not being killed can be explained with a quote from another game with 2 mafias as well. <br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=15315\" class=\"postlink\">This game</a><br>The mafias had a confirmed townie in the game but both decided to attack town, because they thought the other mafia to attack the confirmed townie.<br>True, the mafia couldn't have an overkill.

A roleblock can also stop the mafia from killing. If a RB targets a goon that submits the night kill, he will be roleblocked and the kill won't go through. The modifier wasn't necessary for the roleblocker to be effective.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>I am effective at blocking both town at mafia.

The Entertainer role was essentially a stronger roleblocking role, as I realized two kills per night could make the game go too quickly.

A cop made me not use a doctor, but use my Med Student role instead.  The normalcy review thought that the Med Student was just a slight weakening of Doc and not counted as a new role, the flavor name was to ensure the player actually read the PM.

That Dead Inno-Live Scum-Dead Inno combo was just screaming at me to push the lynch on you.<br><br>Javert, makes me glad I listen to my internal \"town\" gut reads as well as disregarding most of my gut \"scum\" reads. He is the second player recently I really didn't want to lynch despite the evidence strongly suggesting he should be. It's hard to seriously push a lynch on someone who looks more townie than Andy Griffith. Even if the events say you should. I just hope the trend holds because I'm 2 for 2 right now on that one.<br><br>Same with Magnus. ConSpiracy did have a decent point. On the face of it, it <span class=\"noboldsig\">DID</span> look as if this game violated the rules, at least in a small way. It was a minor leap of faith (in my mind) to disregard all of that because everything in the game pointed to Magnus=Town.<br><br>Mute, thanks for the complement. The only credit I'll take for being part of that \"team\" is not pushing Javert's lynch though. It's amazing how well the PR who gives the result can also diffuse it somewhat especially when another player has already posted (I quote magnus here) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Javert's not scum. Please don't vote him.\"</span></span><br><br>ConSpiracy, Jerbs, Mute, Amrun, Edgerobin and ICENinja; I look forward to playing with you all again at some point.

This only way the Town could really be victorious in this game is if the Entertainer survived.  But with a claim like that in a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Mini Normal</span> game, I was highly skeptical from the get-go: when I play normal games, I do not want to see <span style=\"font-style: italic\">anything</span> out of the ordinary (although I grudgingly have to accept that the rules allow mini games to have one new / variant role).  But what if the Entertainer was lynched Day One?  Or died Night One?  The game suddenly becomes severely imbalanced, especially if scum are killing different townspeople.<br><br>Additionally, adding even a 1-Shot Group Unnightkillable to each Mafia group drastically screws with the Town.  Basically, it means <span style=\"font-style: italic\">it is unlikely there will be any cross-killing</span>.  And if there are no cross-kills, the Town <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">has to lynch all four scum</span>.  And consider: in a 13 player game with <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at least</span> a kill a night, the Town only gets <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">five</span> lynches.  If there are three kills every two nights, the Town only gets maybe <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">four</span> lynches.  In other words, you are demanding near <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">perfection</span> from the Town in order to win, while the scum can continually make mistakes in night choices.  Reducing the number of lynches for the Town while simultaneously demanding more accurate lynching from the Town is a Town disaster waiting to happen.<br><br>I think the only reason this game <span style=\"font-style: italic\">appeared</span> to be Town-biased at the end was (i) we had a phenomenal lynching record, and (ii) Prox missed sending in a nightkill on two critical nights after the power roles had practically been revealed.  As a result, the Town lucked out in  having all three power roles survive until almost the bitter end, which allowed for us to create a plan to seal the win (which still involved having to take on faith that Oso was Town).  That is certainly not what Mods should plan for when balancing set-ups."}

JK is even worse, in my opinion, because it adds a \"Did I save the target or block the killer\" dilemma on a no-kill night with the same questions an RB has on a night that a kill is successful.<br><br>This role had didn't have the early ability to definitively locate scum (even though it did end up doing that) but it did have the ability to universally clear a player from N1. We had two groups but it applies even in a 1 group game. 2 Kills in this game=Block target is innocent.<br><br>I'd be happy to play this RB role again sometime in the future."}

So that would have been the same as Night 1, both groups trying to kill the same person. The main difference there being that this time magnus would have prevented both groups while I did nothing really useful at all except make it look like a townie was part of the mafia (which almost happened anyway).<br><br>Night 3 might have been quite a bit different though. With Prox active, I would have expected to see two different night kills that night. Both groups would have known their kill was prevented and there was likely a Doc about and probably that Javert was a member of the opposite group. Jerbs went Doc hunting and perhaps (had he been active) Prox might have too but I suspect that if Prox had still been active, you might have seen me or Javert as the second NK on N3. I'd have guessed me. I discount Rob getting killed that night as one mafia (gun) would have known there was a Doc out there and perhaps Knife Mafia would have too. Had Prox still been participating (I had him pegged as just not posting, I didn't realized he had flaked) I probably wouldn't have chosen him as a target. I would probably have chosen Jerbs and perhaps sussed him out and prevented the Amrun kill. Jerbs and Prox were the only two I considered blocking N3 in any case.<br><br>Goes back to what Javert said about swinginess. Say what you want about balance but no one, I suspect, takes into account a whole team getting wiped out because of killing/flaking that early into a game. And that is what this was.

The roleblocker is there to prevent kills. Even with the chances you mention, you expect the roleblocker to actually stop less then a single kill, and that's in the worst case scenario for the town. I don't have the time to do the full calculation, but I'm estimating that overall, with the chance of making it one more night but also the chance of dying early, we can expect the roleblocker to stop 1 kill in the entire game. I admit that that's stronger then most protective roles (a doctor in a newbie game expects to stop something like 0.25 of a kill), but it doesn't look gamebreaking to me. It means that we finally have found a protective role that will probably actually influence the game.\""}

But clearly there is more to mafia to that.  I would suggest that after you've had a good deal more experience as scum that you reread this game; whether you know it or not, there <span style=\"font-style: italic\">must</span> be subtle distinctions between your play here and your play as Town.  (For example, I still do not believe you ever would have actually said something like \"I was just joking when I said I had a solid tell\"; your posts simply did not give that impression at all, and your attempt at defending that course of action was certainly what really got my eye turned towards you.)  I lost my first <span style=\"font-style: italic\">several</span> games as scum for reasons I did not fully understand at the time, and as a result I still after five years of playing dread getting scum roles.  But as I gained experience, my scum play has steadily improved, and I can now read my old games where I originally thought \"Town totally lucked out catching me,\" and now I can see the tiny mistakes I made that players caught on to (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">even if</span> they seemed to mainly push a point that I did not truly think was indicative of alignment.)  Sometimes there is more to a case than what is clearly written on the page; I could not (and still cannot) adequately express <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> I thought you were scum, but there was something in your posting that just did not seem like it was written by a Townsperson.<br><br>On that note, please remember that even what appear to be the most hardened hearts can actually be won over.  Speaking as the player behind the character, I was second-guessing the case on you a good bit, and I came close to unvoting you at least twice.  But it served my purposes -- in other words, I felt I could get a better read on you -- to act as though I was practically convinced.  Townies who make it clear they have doubts are giving scum the ammunition they need to wiggle out of a lynch.  When I play as Javert, I (generally) try to put the squeeze on players very early and very tightly to see how they react.  Although I never quite expressed it, I could definitely sense the more \"terrified\" side of your posting by about page 6 or so (in the sense that it suggested \"Oh God, I'm caught\").<br><br>For the record, I think Prox had some good advice in the QuickTopic; subtle appeals to emotion, a good revamp post of the game that potentially pushes new and interesting topics / suspicions, a poignant role-claim, etc., can all do what might seem the impossible: stopping yourself from getting lynched.  Sometimes just having a forceful personality can do something towards stopping a lynch (for example, I certainly did not roll over and die on Days Three and Four just because I most definitely looked like I was scum due to the circumstances of the game, and I think it helped).  <br><br>~<br><br>For the record, I don't think that pointing out a second scum team is against any rules; it is a legitimate strategy to try to get the Town to look for the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">other</span> scum team while ignoring your partner.  I also don't think it is against any rules to suggest (or admit) that the scum team can talk to each other during the Day; again, that is information that might help the Town search for the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">other</span> (still-coordinating) scum team.  Most all information (even <span style=\"font-style: italic\">true</span> information) can be used or twisted by scum to their advantage, and so admitting to it is not necessarily against one's win condition."}
