You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a \u201cNo Action\u201d PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br><br>Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone\u2019s fate.<br>3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>7. This game will have 2 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br><br>Miscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don\u2019t get missed.<br>5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging."}

But with each of them making a couple comments about them, you end up spending a lot of time responding to each of them, partially your fault, partially theirs. You don't have to respond, but if you don't you'll be accused of ignoring and sidestepping accusations. Still that's just fluff to me on both sides. It doesn't convince me that you're scum by any means, but I don't look at outside games for the sake of reading people's styles and reactions because 1) I'd rather spend my time focusing on productive things, such as IRL stuff, and 2) people don't play the same each and every game, but they don't always play differently just because they have different roles/alignments."}

Especially with AP being close to a lynch, we need reasons for that wagon. This is obviously not a strong scumread, but he is easily the least active player in the game right now.<br><br><br>Could Go Either Way:<br>Lord Voldemort \u2013 I still don\u2019t have a good feeling about him from Day 1. His one-liner posting style and drop in activity after I called him out seems like caught scum being more cautious. This is not a strong read, I could easily be mistaken here due to my read on Projectmatt.<br><br>Projectmatt \u2013 His constant defense of Voldemort  is really what puts these two in this category. They could be super obvious scum, could be Masons, could be lovers. Who knows? All I know is that Matt is way too invested in saving Voldemort from pressure to be totally innocent."}

If we look at his list of games we can see that this is actually the only mafia game he is currently playing. It's painfully obvious that he actually spends almost all of his time on site messing around in the general threads and playing casual games.

Your explanation equates to \"Cooldog is too horrible a player to be scum\". Which is a horrible reason for me to move my vote. I still believe you Vs. AP is town vs. town bickering because you're both holding grudges based on previous game experiences with each other. Neither of you have good reasons for wanting the other lynched. Your reason is just strong-ER than AP's.<br><br>If you would of made your case on AP like, at this point in the game, 20 pages later, I would be more inclined to believe you and go with your wagon.<br><br>But the fact that you both pretty much had your rock solid cases against the other ones scumminess within the first 5 pages of the game, that leads me to believe that both of you are just lynching each other based on bad blood, not real scumhunting. And there's no way for either of you to fix that perception until you come up with more than just one reason to lynch a person.<br><br>By the way, you're pretty much at L-1. Because AP is going to hammer you. Might as well claim now. I think you are a horrible lynch today, because with you gone there isn't going to be a foil for AngryPidgeon to stop him from taking  the reigns of the town in case he is scum. But honestly maybe this horrible lynch will show you that if you only have one good reason to lynch a person, and that reason is proven not to be enough to convince even a fraction of the town to join your side, you should drop that scumread and focus your attention somewhere else. Rather than stubbornly tunnel your way to death. It is a team game after all."}

The guy who just 'nailed' the scumteam in this game by means of wagon analysis sans flips on D1.  Also didn't you insult Mastin's town-play earlier?  Lol.  And the other 2 votes on my wagon are scum votes, so that should tell you how sexy my wagon is.  (Im sexy and I know it. Chaa chaaa)<br><br>Re meta: Yeh, Im kinda getting there.  I need to discuss mafia theory more (not here, oh god not in this thread please).  I definitely can read people better after seeing some of their other games.  I guess I got a bad taste of the term 'meta' from 1347 (you know why) and also people using meta to push site-flakers and people with slightly different playstyles across like 2 games.<br><br>My best theory on scumhunting is to look for things that _town wouldn't do_.  Scum will often potentially do X (or Y if you expect them to do X ---&gt;&gt;&gt; WIFOM ^ WIFOM) but town will almost always react specifically in certain situations.  So look for lack of that.  (This wall of incredibly generic mafia theory fluff sponsored by McDonalds).  And I don't think town-Thor would force a dichotomy so early because he wouldn't be willing to commit to backpedaling/dying if he were wrong.  And he is acting far too confident in a case based off one point that is quite weak.<br><br>Back to meta: ya, I thought mastin was scum in 1377 for his playstyle.  TBH, I like using meta to DISPROVE scum/town tells (not use meta to generate them).  Like now I know that Mastin doing VCA on D1 is just him.  Its meta, but I know its just null for him and not scum/town.  And yes Im waffling (and scummy for admitting it)  But seriously Id love to discuss this with you out of thread where you aren't playing against my wincon actively.<br><br>@Thor: I never said it was MY town play.  Im just obvtown in general this game.  Its easier to detect obvtown after they've flipped.  - GreyICE."}

If you honestly expect me to say that my day 1 'case' was rock-solid, then god help you.  It was. a. day. 1. GUTREAD.  And then you pushing me for 'lying' never really gave me a reason to think that you were town.  I even recalled in my head you hemming and hawing about Gorkcat's \"Sane day cop\" claim and ultimately deciding that he was being genuine.  The fact that you never did anything similar for me struck me wrong (and now I am making a shitty meta case).  So ya.  I guess my suspicions on you came down to \"I don't think Thor would be this dumb as town\" and I know thats a terrible reason to vote someone (oops, actually I was voting CoolDog all day).  But really this is all coming down to a misunderstanding as near as I can tell and I'm ultimately ok with that.

I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">can</span> see scum motive in his recent posts, but I'm not convinced, yet. Not nearly enough to lynch him today.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>Do you think his rebuttal to my case holds water?</div></blockquote> Quite frankly, I'm skimming most of the walls at the moment. I honestly don't really remember the AP case by you that well, and similarly, don't remember his response to it. And quite frankly, I think that whatever response he did make would be null, with him saying those words as either alignment.<br><br>When it comes to AP, it's who he's pushing and why that's more important than his words on both offense and defense.

Yes, I realize it might sound that way, but I don't policy lynch people. I lynch for scum, and right now, of the five possible names, Cooldog's the only one I'm confident enough in. He's closer to null than he is to scum, but he's the player I've got the most suspicion on right now. It happens to be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">incredibly</span> weak, but it's all I've got.<br><br>His status as a near-universal scumread is an added bonus, as his death removes his \"smokescreen\", so to speak, from the game. (This is why you think policy, no?) It allows the town to focus their reads and hone in on the scum, rather than being distracted. But beyond that, he's also someone whose death gives insight into interactions, and as an added bonus, allows four players who are far more informative regardless of alignment have an extra day to be, well, informative. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>There are plenty of reasons to lynch Cooldog.

Time to lay down the law. So bluntly:<br>AP's town. At first, I wasn't sure of it, 'cause it's fully possible he's tailoring his play this game to match my expectations of him as town. I don't think this is the case, however, because his play here still feels natural, is reminding me of town-AP, and to use non-meta non-specific-player reasons, he's bringing up good points, he's pushing in good ways, his reads and their changes seem legitimate and fully natural. He's locking onto things exactly as I'd expect a town player to do, and I'm following his thought process. His jumps seem reasonable, and the way he's playing, quite frankly, would be suicide as scum.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">We are not lynching AP. Not today, not ever.</span><br><br>Cooldog is a meh-lynch. He's a smokescreen, and is in many player's scum-lists, but lynching him is less-than-ideal, if for no other reason than because he's not very likely to flip scum. Of the candidates, he's the most likely other than Bacde, but he's not high on my list.<br>If it came down to Cooldog and almost any other player, I'd choose Cooldog for a lynch, but <span class=\"noboldsig\">he is not a good lynch</span>.<br><br>denis is another name people are throwing around as a possible lynch candidate. This is something I've already explained. Though denis's posting is clearly not ideal, the key here is to look at what he's doing and why, rather than how he's done it. I've previously said he seems to be a weird hybrid of Thor and myself, and I stick by that statement. His reasonings seem to be much like my own, so I find his thought process fairly easy to follow along with. While I could see his posting coming from scum, the town train of thought is much stronger. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Denis is not a d1 lynch.</span><br><br>Thor is a little more complicated. I'll admit, I can't read Thor worth a damn. His posts raise good points, but I can connect the dots as both town and scum pretty much equally as well. If he is town, though, his insight is useful and I want to keep his voice around for a while. If he is scum, then I think keeping him alive for a while will be the best way to find scumbuddies. And if he's scum, it'll be easier to catch him through his scumbuddies than it will through him. Basically, if Thor is town, he's someone we do NOT want to mislynch d1 (I've seen how well that works out--see also: Judge, Jury, and Executioner Mafia) and if he's scum, I think<br>-He'd be better to keep alive for a while, and<br>-That it'd be hard to even get a lynch on him d1.<br>Basically, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Thor is not a good d1 lynch.</span><br><br>Now Bacde, on the other hand..."}

Thor even ADMITS that his suspicions on AP have nothing to do with saying AP claimed to have a Meta Case. It's just the fact that he lied about skimming two previous games to justify a gut-read.<br><br>Cooldog possibly lied about another players argument in general, saying that it didn't exist when in reality, it provably did. And went one step further to MISQUOTE ME and pretend like my case didn't exist even after I proved that it did.<br><br>BOTH CASES are at their core \"Did this player really read the threads in question?\". Both are not provable beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br><br>Hence why Thor thinks his AP case is without a doubt true and everyone else is wrong. And hence why I believe my Cooldog lynch is without a doubt true, and everyone else is wrong. <br><br>Occam's Razor is a null argument when you consider this is a Mafia Game. You don't vote for who you think is going to give you least amount of reads and information on his flip. You vote for the person who's the scummiest, and if you can't figure that out collectively, whoever's going to give you the most answers. Because Cooldogs lynch is more advantageous at proving who is the scum and who is the town. AP's lynch only proves that either AP is town or scum. Cooldog can potentially implicate the entire scumteam based on his flip. AP can't do that."}

You're using theory like \"lack of scum = town\" to try to say you're town without saying you're town. Which brings me exactly into my next point -- another reason why you're scum:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4490720#p4490720\" class=\"postlink\">post 753</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>Thor's pedantry with AP - yeah, I get caught up in details.

I've done this as town before, so I guess that makes me.... _____? Anyone wanna guess?\"<br><br>Scum have a subconscious aversion to lying, and you've just totally conveniently fucking HIGHLIGHTED it for all of us to see.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ everyone else:</span> Look above, where Thor says \"what I'm doing is just a more functional way to say I'm town because I'm noting that there is no evidence of me being scum. Lack of scum = town\" and \"yeah, I get caught up in details. Guilty as charged. That doesn't actually make me scum though. I have completed town games with me describing that as how I scumhunt, so...?\" &lt;-- those two phrases are a perfect example of what I'm talking about.<br><br>Which is: Scum like Thor often don't straight up SAY they are town, they try to HINT AT IT, or even to PROVE IT, in other ways. It's a very common and reliable scum tell. And Thor didn't know this before. Now he does, so he's going to change his play, but that doesn't change the fact that he is scum.<br><br>And now to finish Thor off:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4490720#p4490720\" class=\"postlink\">post 753</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>Let me know if there's any major points you feel I dodged - I was going to reply to all of them till i realized I should say 'nyah-nyah' instead.</div></blockquote><br>And now you're trying to end the post on a light note so people will think \"MAN, he sure showed Lord Voldemort! Holy shit, he's not only town but he's a fucking comedian too! Wow, this guy is good at this game!\" which is completely stupid, because you're not only scum, but you're not funny either.<br><br>So, once more,  I'll point out some of the relevant things WHICH YOU SKIPPED in your ever-so-convenient paraphrase:<br><br>- Why do you try to make people look bad in almost EVERY SINGLE POST YOU MAKE? In case you didn't know, THAT'S A SCUM TACTIC.<br><br>- Why do you ignore the main points of people that say you're scummy, and instead focus on small details involving other people? THAT'S A SCUM TACTIC.<br><br>- Why are you speaking patronizingly to me like you think I'm just another stupid player, when you clearly have underestimated both my superb scumhunting skills, AND the rock-solid strength of my inimitable resolve to get you utterly and irrevocably lynched? THAT'S A NERVOUS AND DESPERATE SCUM TACTIC.<br><br>Shit, I don't even have to do work to get you lynched here.<br><br>You're doing it all yourself."}

Someone with bad reads who can't be controlled, is even more dangerous than someone with good reads who can be reasoned with and possibly distracted from who scum are. Why?

He cites people as town or scum, and loudly and bombastically proclaims it so. Yet, ere doth he screech his misgivings about them in manners that offend and annoy, ne'er doth he elucidate on any reasoning thereof. When queried about this questionable quandary,  quarrelsome and wroth doth he become. Flexing and prancing and squealing aloud, whilst answers are meant yet to occlude. He sits upon wagons, adding nothing thereupon, save for questionable entrietes to others to join him there-on. Sidelining and avoiding other debates, he shuffles in shadows and awkwardly debates with red bile and wroth still belching twixt his poison lips, he cavorts, and capers, and acts the twit. Yet still we do sit, with no deeper enlightenment, upon heavier thoughts, that may or may not bounce through his skull. His goal is to avoid, evade, and downplay. No actual desire upon him, but maybe a goal of potential mislynches, and these billowing clouds of vapid accusation.

When queried about this questionable quandary,  quarrelsome and wroth doth he become. Flexing and prancing and squealing aloud, whilst answers are meant yet to occlude. He sits upon wagons, adding nothing thereupon, save for questionable entrietes to others to join him there-on. Sidelining and avoiding other debates, he shuffles in shadows and awkwardly debates with red bile and wroth still belching twixt his poison lips, he cavorts, and capers, and acts the twit. Yet still we do sit, with no deeper enlightenment, upon heavier thoughts, that may or may not bounce through his skull. His goal is to avoid, evade, and downplay. No actual desire upon him, but maybe a goal of potential mislynches, and these billowing clouds of vapid accusation.

You haven't read the whole thread either. Every time a new post is made, everyone who didn't make that post hasn't read the whole thread. This sounds nitpicky, but let me explain some more:<br><br>If a lynch had taken place on page 5, Thor would have flipped scum, and at that point I would have read the whole thread, and would therefore, in your eyes, have been \"qualified\" to be certain that Thor was scum. And I was. But that doesn't mean that should change now that there are more pages. If there are newer leads, great. I welcome that. But it doesn't change that Thor is scum.<br><br>Usually all I will have read in depth of a game is the first few pages, where scum is at their weakest. They don't have anything to dig their claws into, because there's nothing much happening in the game yet. Thor is chronically overconfident in his games, because he relegates most of his play to newbie games and therefore doesn't have as much relative experience playing with people who can read through that shit.<br><br>I, unfortunately for him, CAN read through that shit. And he's dropping Thor-scum tells in spades. Unfortunately, he also knows how to look like town to newbies, he's been practicing that for a number of years now, so I can't expect you to grasp that. You clearly have less experience than your join date implies, but you should trust me when I say: Thor is scum beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br><br>Now vote for him, please."}

You haven't read the whole thread either. Every time a new post is made, everyone who didn't make that post hasn't read the whole thread. This sounds nitpicky, but let me explain some more:<br><br>If a lynch had taken place on page 5, Thor would have flipped scum, and at that point I would have read the whole thread, and would therefore, in your eyes, have been \"qualified\" to be certain that Thor was scum. And I was. But that doesn't mean that should change now that there are more pages. If there are newer leads, great. I welcome that. But it doesn't change that Thor is scum.<br><br>Usually all I will have read in depth of a game is the first few pages, where scum is at their weakest. They don't have anything to dig their claws into, because there's nothing much happening in the game yet. Thor is chronically overconfident in his games, because he relegates most of his play to newbie games and therefore doesn't have as much relative experience playing with people who can read through that shit.<br><br>I, unfortunately for him, CAN read through that shit. And he's dropping Thor-scum tells in spades. Unfortunately, he also knows how to look like town to newbies, he's been practicing that for a number of years now, so I can't expect you to grasp that. You clearly have less experience than your join date implies, but you should trust me when I say: Thor is scum beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br><br>Now vote for him, please.</div></blockquote><br><br>I just want to verify whether you haven't caught up yet or you just chose not to read the rest of it.<br><br>And no, my vote's fine thanks  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\">"}

So I still have to revisit that exchange from yesterday to see if Denis' fakeclaim is more town motivated than Bacde's reaction to it. Thor's endorsement of Bacde being town is pretty damning though.

It wasn't until after I saw good reasoning about Thor being scum that I realized his reasons for \"townreading\" me were mostly made up to gain my support (AtE, I know its stupid).  I will also admit that I overreacted and responded emotionally to AP fossing me due to a misunderstanding, and I took an anti-town stance by becoming upset with him and fossing him back.  I took an anti-town stance, but not a scumstance.  I no longer think AP is scum.  I take the same backpedal stance with Mastin, who I no longer feel is scum.  Denisatp also seems clear to me.  Smashbard also seems obviously town to me.  At this point I am ok with being lynched because I realize that the town will gain a certain amount of information from my lynch, however if pressured I will defend myself about any specific questions because I would prefer to lynch mafia.<br><br>I will also say that I didn't take an anti-AP stance until after AP started tunneling me.

Hell I've continuously said \"IF IF IF\" because I can't be 100% sure of anybodies flip except for Cool Dog.<br><br>Which is going to be scum by the way.<br><br><br><br><br>To AP: I've already said it a few times. But I don't believe that scum would be as dick as Dunham has been all game. He's purposefully acting in a way that is going to get him lynched due to how unpopular his opinions are, such as not following Mastins request for a list of reads. Scum wouldn't be ballsy enough to pull something like that and raise the ire of Mastin, who is pretty much the defacto town leader at this point.<br><br>The only thing that makes him scummy to me is his A) Refusal to post his reads when everybody else has except Slandaar, and B) His constant defense of Cool Dog. Which got Thor lynched and we lynched scum. So I can't deny that maybe scum really is dumb enough to just keep throwing themselves at defending Cool Dog just because he's maybe newb scum who doesn't know how to defend himself properly."}

Unless you believe there's a Serial Killer in this set up, which at this time has zero evidence to support, a Doctor would be absolutely pointless unless you think town has a Vig/Cop/Gunsmith/Neighbor so far as the power roles. But your analysis doesn't even hint that town may have some sort of a kill role, making a Mafia Doctor utterly pointless.<br><br><br>Charter is confirmed town due to no real Neighbor counter claim.<br><br>Cool Dog is sadly confirmed town because Dunham has no reservations saying Cool Dog was 100% town, which he only could have said with such conviction if he had Gunsmithed Cool Dog Night 1. Despite all his scumminess, I am forced to accept that he is just newb town. At least knowing this, I am more inclined to listen to what he has to say so long as he doesn't take this as an excuse to lurk the rest of the game.<br><br>This leaves AngryPidgeon, Mastin, Bacde, Denis, Projectmatt, Slandaar and myself.<br><br>I don't see Mastin as scum, as his wagon analysis is too genuine. Like I said, if he is scum, we're fucked.

Which means he's being far too bold to be scum that is afraid to be lynched.<br><br>I don't see myself as scum, for obvious reasons.<br><br>This leaves AngryPidgeon, Bacde &amp; Denis.<br><br>For the moment, I don't see AngryPidgeon as scum. His super push against Metalmarsh has severely damaged his credibility in my eyes, but his fresh analysis today reads to me like someone actually trying to figure out the set up, and not just throwing a distracting monkey wrench into the thick of things. Also, for him to be scum means that him and Thor must of  thought of the greatest scum gambit of all time by bussing each other right out of the gate to leave the survivor with town cred. Which I find highly unlikely.<br><br>My gut tells me that Denis is town. But at this point we're reaching process of elimination so if he's town than I have to believe that somebody above is scum. I would like Cool Dog &amp; Charters extended thoughts on Denis' alignment because they are the only confirmed town around that I can trust their reads 100%.<br><br>Either way, I think that leaves us with a Bacde lynch for today.

He was also trying really hard to prevent an AP or Thor lynch from going through until late Day 1, possibly trying to get the Godfather to save some face seeing it as a losing fight. He's pulled a lot of gutsy gambits, including appeals to emotion, offering himself as the lynch knowing it buys him town points, 1v1ing AngryPidgeon &amp; buddying up to me to try and get Cooldog lynched. Which worked, because I had to revisit his entire ISO just to reconsider things that I previously ignored because he was so solidly behind me being town so I didn't even think he could be scummy, that AP was just tunneling him based off of a silly fake Vig Claim reaction that Denis elicited.<br><br>I should be clear, I still don't believe Bacde to be scum due to that fakeclaim reaction. But I CAN see how some of his other interactions are scummy now that I can read him objectively.<br><br>Probably the most damning of evidence showing Bacde has to be at least one of the remaining scum is that he himself has said that the only possible list of scum suspects left were Him/Cool Dog/Charter/Metalmarsh.<br><br>Considering one of them flipped town, and the other two are confirmed town, Bacde pretty much HAS to be scum by admission.<br><br>If that's the case, I seriously need to reconsider my thoughts on at least Mastin, Slandaar &amp; Projectmatt.<br><br><br>But as far as I can tell right now, the only ones I consider Obvtown right now are Charter &amp; Cool Dog.

Your explanation equates to \"Cooldog is too horrible a player to be scum\". Which is a horrible reason for me to move my vote. I still believe you Vs. AP is town vs. town bickering because you're both holding grudges based on previous game experiences with each other. Neither of you have good reasons for wanting the other lynched. Your reason is just strong-ER than AP's.<br><br>If you would of made your case on AP like, at this point in the game, 20 pages later, I would be more inclined to believe you and go with your wagon.<br><br>But the fact that you both pretty much had your rock solid cases against the other ones scumminess within the first 5 pages of the game, that leads me to believe that both of you are just lynching each other based on bad blood, not real scumhunting. And there's no way for either of you to fix that perception until you come up with more than just one reason to lynch a person.<br><br>By the way, you're pretty much at L-1. Because AP is going to hammer you. Might as well claim now. I think you are a horrible lynch today, because with you gone there isn't going to be a foil for AngryPidgeon to stop him from taking  the reigns of the town in case he is scum. But honestly maybe this horrible lynch will show you that if you only have one good reason to lynch a person, and that reason is proven not to be enough to convince even a fraction of the town to join your side, you should drop that scumread and focus your attention somewhere else.

In a clinch.<br><br>Which means to me that if that is the case, I don't believe Denis is mafia. Because his constant berating of Cool Dog wouldn't come from calculating scum who's planning on manipulating the town into one final mislynch. Also, Denis' admittance to not having much to go on is just as genuine as my own admittance, so I don't think scum would try to do that to gain sympathy points while at the same time insulting the other players.<br><br>Charter is confirmed town. So if Mastin isn't killed tonight it's going to be this guy. If both of them are alive and someone else is killed, then Mastin is scum. Guaranteed. There's no other way that scum would be so cocky as to allow more than 1 confirmed townie to stay for Lylo tomorrow when it's 3 to a lynch. That's allowing the town too great a chance to rally together 3 on 2.<br><br>Slandaar is most probably scum at this point, no matter which person is pointed to as his scum partner. He has not contributed enough to be a convincingly town player. The only way he's going to clear himself in my mind is by nightkill or if he claims Cop and nobody counter claims.<br><br>Otherwise, why the hell was there a Gunsmith in this set up and not just a traditional cop?<br><br>That leaves Projectmatt. He could go either way to me as this point. His case against me is very poor. So that swings to me like it could be just town trying to find something concrete, or scum also trying to find something to scoot suspicions away from him. This strategy will sadly backfire on him no matter what because once I flip Projectmatt is going to look very scummy, regardless of his real alignment. So when I flip, don't suspect Projectmatt solely on that evidence, because you will mislynch and lose the game if that's all you have on Matt to lynch him tomorrow."}
