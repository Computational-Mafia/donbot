You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>\n6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 2 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>\n1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>\n2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.", "time": "Fri Nov 09, 2012 12:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

Thor I'll have you know that plenty of people have given me a townread, despite my protests.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not gonna lie, you guys are really filling up this game with a LOT of words that don't really help anyone actually find scum.

Another great example of this would be AP and Thor uselessly bantering.<br>\n<br>\nIn games I've played on epicmafia, the best d1 lynches are wallflower lynches (actually epicmafia is a LOT more claims-based than mafiascum, but in the lack of claims its best to lynch wallflower posters or lurkers).  Metalmarsh is the perfect example of this.  He barely posts anything of content, and when confronted about it he makes a half-assed argument against me and projectmatt just because we changed our minds.  Oh did I mention he didn't even switch his vote?  He's hoping that other people will find the scumreads after he just diverts the attention away from himself.

But with each of them making a couple comments about them, you end up spending a lot of time responding to each of them, partially your fault, partially theirs. You don't have to respond, but if you don't you'll be accused of ignoring and sidestepping accusations. Still that's just fluff to me on both sides. It doesn't convince me that you're scum by any means, but I don't look at outside games for the sake of reading people's styles and reactions because 1) I'd rather spend my time focusing on productive things, such as IRL stuff, and 2) people don't play the same each and every game, but they don't always play differently just because they have different roles/alignments.", "time": "Tue Nov 13, 2012 2:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

I actually like that case, I think it's a pretty solid case for what it is. The problem is that the counter is that he's just semi-functional town. If we look at his list of games we can see that this is actually the only mafia game he is currently playing. It's painfully obvious that he actually spends almost all of his time on site messing around in the general threads and playing casual games.

Your explanation equates to \"Cooldog is too horrible a player to be scum\". Which is a horrible reason for me to move my vote. I still believe you Vs. AP is town vs. town bickering because you're both holding grudges based on previous game experiences with each other. Neither of you have good reasons for wanting the other lynched. Your reason is just strong-ER than AP's.<br>\n<br>\nIf you would of made your case on AP like, at this point in the game, 20 pages later, I would be more inclined to believe you and go with your wagon.<br>\n<br>\nBut the fact that you both pretty much had your rock solid cases against the other ones scumminess within the first 5 pages of the game, that leads me to believe that both of you are just lynching each other based on bad blood, not real scumhunting. And there's no way for either of you to fix that perception until you come up with more than just one reason to lynch a person.<br>\n<br>\nBy the way, you're pretty much at L-1. Because AP is going to hammer you. Might as well claim now. I think you are a horrible lynch today, because with you gone there isn't going to be a foil for AngryPidgeon to stop him from taking  the reigns of the town in case he is scum.

I've been trying to get people to talk about it to no avail at all and suddenly it's become popular to say that it is \"bad\" but no one has said why yet (besides AP, who says it isn't a lie, but that's a lie, so...)<br>\n<br>\nAlso, tunneling is not a scumtell and I *have* given reads and opinions on *literally every other player in the game* so if I am tunneling it's only in my vote, and not in my ability to scumhunt or address others - which makes a big difference in how it works. Would you like to tell me who or what I'm ignoring while tunneling?

Thor does have a \"case\" against AP, but it seems so wishy-washy and easy to back away from that I'm not a huge fan of it.

The guy who just 'nailed' the scumteam in this game by means of wagon analysis sans flips on D1.  Also didn't you insult Mastin's town-play earlier?  Lol.  And the other 2 votes on my wagon are scum votes, so that should tell you how sexy my wagon is.  (Im sexy and I know it. Chaa chaaa)<br>\n<br>\nRe meta: Yeh, Im kinda getting there.  I need to discuss mafia theory more (not here, oh god not in this thread please).  I definitely can read people better after seeing some of their other games.  I guess I got a bad taste of the term 'meta' from 1347 (you know why) and also people using meta to push site-flakers and people with slightly different playstyles across like 2 games.<br>\n<br>\nMy best theory on scumhunting is to look for things that _town wouldn't do_.  Scum will often potentially do X (or Y if you expect them to do X ---&gt;&gt;&gt; WIFOM ^ WIFOM) but town will almost always react specifically in certain situations.  So look for lack of that.  (This wall of incredibly generic mafia theory fluff sponsored by McDonalds).  And I don't think town-Thor would force a dichotomy so early because he wouldn't be willing to commit to backpedaling/dying if he were wrong.  And he is acting far too confident in a case based off one point that is quite weak.<br>\n<br>\nBack to meta: ya, I thought mastin was scum in 1377 for his playstyle.  TBH, I like using meta to DISPROVE scum/town tells (not use meta to generate them).  Like now I know that Mastin doing VCA on D1 is just him.  Its meta, but I know its just null for him and not scum/town.  And yes Im waffling (and scummy for admitting it)  But seriously Id love to discuss this with you out of thread where you aren't playing against my wincon actively.<br>\n<br>\n@Thor: I never said it was MY town play.  Im just obvtown in general this game.  Its easier to detect obvtown after they've flipped.  - GreyICE.", "time": "Mon Nov 19, 2012 7:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

I even recalled in my head you hemming and hawing about Gorkcat's \"Sane day cop\" claim and ultimately deciding that he was being genuine.  The fact that you never did anything similar for me struck me wrong (and now I am making a shitty meta case).  So ya.  I guess my suspicions on you came down to \"I don't think Thor would be this dumb as town\" and I know thats a terrible reason to vote someone (oops, actually I was voting CoolDog all day).

But Bacde is scum.</div></blockquote> Not sold yet. I had a strong townread on him, and a lot of what he's said I can see town motive. I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can</div> see scum motive in his recent posts, but I'm not convinced, yet. Not nearly enough to lynch him today.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>Do you think his rebuttal to my case holds water?</div></blockquote> Quite frankly, I'm skimming most of the walls at the moment. I honestly don't really remember the AP case by you that well, and similarly, don't remember his response to it. And quite frankly, I think that whatever response he did make would be null, with him saying those words as either alignment.<br>\n<br>\nWhen it comes to AP, it's who he's pushing and why that's more important than his words on both offense and defense. And that's what I'm trying to look at. Right now, it's looking town, so case be damned, I'm not lynching him today.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>So basically...policy?</div></blockquote> Not really, no. Yes, I realize it might sound that way, but I don't policy lynch people. I lynch for scum, and right now, of the five possible names, Cooldog's the only one I'm confident enough in. He's closer to null than he is to scum, but he's the player I've got the most suspicion on right now. It happens to be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">incredibly</div> weak, but it's all I've got.<br>\n<br>\nHis status as a near-universal scumread is an added bonus, as his death removes his \"smokescreen\", so to speak, from the game. (This is why you think policy, no?) It allows the town to focus their reads and hone in on the scum, rather than being distracted. But beyond that, he's also someone whose death gives insight into interactions, and as an added bonus, allows four players who are far more informative regardless of alignment have an extra day to be, well, informative. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nThere are plenty of reasons to lynch Cooldog.

At first, I wasn't sure of it, 'cause it's fully possible he's tailoring his play this game to match my expectations of him as town. I don't think this is the case, however, because his play here still feels natural, is reminding me of town-AP, and to use non-meta non-specific-player reasons, he's bringing up good points, he's pushing in good ways, his reads and their changes seem legitimate and fully natural. He's locking onto things exactly as I'd expect a town player to do, and I'm following his thought process. His jumps seem reasonable, and the way he's playing, quite frankly, would be suicide as scum.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">We are not lynching AP. Not today, not ever.</div><br>\n<br>\nCooldog is a meh-lynch. He's a smokescreen, and is in many player's scum-lists, but lynching him is less-than-ideal, if for no other reason than because he's not very likely to flip scum. Of the candidates, he's the most likely other than Bacde, but he's not high on my list.<br>\nIf it came down to Cooldog and almost any other player, I'd choose Cooldog for a lynch, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">he is not a good lynch</div>.<br>\n<br>\ndenis is another name people are throwing around as a possible lynch candidate. This is something I've already explained. Though denis's posting is clearly not ideal, the key here is to look at what he's doing and why, rather than how he's done it. I've previously said he seems to be a weird hybrid of Thor and myself, and I stick by that statement. His reasonings seem to be much like my own, so I find his thought process fairly easy to follow along with. While I could see his posting coming from scum, the town train of thought is much stronger. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Denis is not a d1 lynch.</div><br>\n<br>\nThor is a little more complicated. I'll admit, I can't read Thor worth a damn. His posts raise good points, but I can connect the dots as both town and scum pretty much equally as well. If he is town, though, his insight is useful and I want to keep his voice around for a while. If he is scum, then I think keeping him alive for a while will be the best way to find scumbuddies. And if he's scum, it'll be easier to catch him through his scumbuddies than it will through him. Basically, if Thor is town, he's someone we do NOT want to mislynch d1 (I've seen how well that works out--see also: Judge, Jury, and Executioner Mafia) and if he's scum, I think<br>\n-He'd be better to keep alive for a while, and<br>\n-That it'd be hard to even get a lynch on him d1.<br>\nBasically, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Thor is not a good d1 lynch.</div><br>\n<br>\nNow Bacde, on the other hand...", "time": "Tue Nov 20, 2012 11:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

It's just the fact that he lied about skimming two previous games to justify a gut-read.<br>\n<br>\nCooldog possibly lied about another players argument in general, saying that it didn't exist when in reality, it provably did.

Both are not provable beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br>\n<br>\nHence why Thor thinks his AP case is without a doubt true and everyone else is wrong. And hence why I believe my Cooldog lynch is without a doubt true, and everyone else is wrong. <br>\n<br>\nOccam's Razor is a null argument when you consider this is a Mafia Game. You don't vote for who you think is going to give you least amount of reads and information on his flip. You vote for the person who's the scummiest, and if you can't figure that out collectively, whoever's going to give you the most answers. Because Cooldogs lynch is more advantageous at proving who is the scum and who is the town. AP's lynch only proves that either AP is town or scum. Cooldog can potentially implicate the entire scumteam based on his flip. AP can't do that.", "time": "Tue Nov 20, 2012 11:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

Because I'm the obvious night kill for tonight, no matter WHO the other scum are. Because they know I'm not stupid, and they know they can't control me in any way, shape, or form. Someone with bad reads who can't be controlled, is even more dangerous than someone with good reads who can be reasoned with and possibly distracted from who scum are. Why? Because reads can change, and the fact that you can't control that person when they get the RIGHT reads makes them the most dangerous player in the game for scum. Which is what I am.<br>\n<br>\nSo kindly hop on my wagon, follow me and I'll lead the way, and then when Thor flips scum, we can lynch whoever the fuck you want tomorrow.

No fucking reason whatsoever. I know you're town, and I know Cooldog's town, and you should know I'm town for the same fucking reason.

You haven't read the whole thread either. Every time a new post is made, everyone who didn't make that post hasn't read the whole thread. This sounds nitpicky, but let me explain some more:<br>\n<br>\nIf a lynch had taken place on page 5, Thor would have flipped scum, and at that point I would have read the whole thread, and would therefore, in your eyes, have been \"qualified\" to be certain that Thor was scum. And I was. But that doesn't mean that should change now that there are more pages. If there are newer leads, great. I welcome that. But it doesn't change that Thor is scum.<br>\n<br>\nUsually all I will have read in depth of a game is the first few pages, where scum is at their weakest. They don't have anything to dig their claws into, because there's nothing much happening in the game yet. Thor is chronically overconfident in his games, because he relegates most of his play to newbie games and therefore doesn't have as much relative experience playing with people who can read through that shit.<br>\n<br>\nI, unfortunately for him, CAN read through that shit. And he's dropping Thor-scum tells in spades. Unfortunately, he also knows how to look like town to newbies, he's been practicing that for a number of years now, so I can't expect you to grasp that. You clearly have less experience than your join date implies, but you should trust me when I say: Thor is scum beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br>\n<br>\nNow vote for him, please.", "time": "Tue Nov 20, 2012 6:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

You haven't read the whole thread either. Every time a new post is made, everyone who didn't make that post hasn't read the whole thread. This sounds nitpicky, but let me explain some more:<br>\n<br>\nIf a lynch had taken place on page 5, Thor would have flipped scum, and at that point I would have read the whole thread, and would therefore, in your eyes, have been \"qualified\" to be certain that Thor was scum. And I was. But that doesn't mean that should change now that there are more pages. If there are newer leads, great. I welcome that. But it doesn't change that Thor is scum.<br>\n<br>\nUsually all I will have read in depth of a game is the first few pages, where scum is at their weakest. They don't have anything to dig their claws into, because there's nothing much happening in the game yet. Thor is chronically overconfident in his games, because he relegates most of his play to newbie games and therefore doesn't have as much relative experience playing with people who can read through that shit.<br>\n<br>\nI, unfortunately for him, CAN read through that shit. And he's dropping Thor-scum tells in spades. Unfortunately, he also knows how to look like town to newbies, he's been practicing that for a number of years now, so I can't expect you to grasp that. You clearly have less experience than your join date implies, but you should trust me when I say: Thor is scum beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br>\n<br>\nNow vote for him, please.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI just want to verify whether you haven't caught up yet or you just chose not to read the rest of it.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no, my vote's fine thanks  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\">", "time": "Tue Nov 20, 2012 7:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}

As he is actively showing us a pattern of bandwagon hopping involving Bacde.

But I do see interactions with Thor and defenses of Charter and an interesting interaction with Cooldog. So I would probably buy Thor/Bacde/Charter or Thor/Bacde/Cooldog from this post.<br>\n<br>\nMM 217 returns suspicions of buddying with Bacde, as he calls Bacde town despite just moments prior Bacde was a large proprietor of his lynch. Then again, this seems indicative of a lot of MM&#8217;s posts. He thinks in unconventional ways, such as voting people he thinks are buddying him and not minding votes on him because it&#8217;s gathering information. So it could just be MM&#8217;s weird playstyle.<br>\n<br>\nMM 273 definitely implicates a possible connection between MM as being scumbuddies with Thor. Thanks to Lord Voldemorts observations. But this doesn&#8217;t necessarily connect MM with Bacde.<br>\n<br>\nBacde 383 could be buddying with Thor, saying his strong play could be used to lynch easier targets. Bacde possibly trying to work as a team with the Godfather?<br>\n<br>\nBacde 410 is scummy because he&#8217;s been calling for more votes on Cooldog but then says he doesn&#8217;t like AP and myself being on the wagon. He retracts this statement when it comes to me in 480, but still.<br>\n<br>\nBacde 486 seems like coaching Thor to start defending himself.<br>\n<br>\nAlmost 400 posts later of Bacde just arguing with Denis and AP doesn&#8217;t prove much to me in interactions. I don&#8217;t see why it&#8217;s so scummy to suggest the claimed Vig kill somebody.<br>\n<br>\nMM 809 and 810 don&#8217;t seem like scum connections to me. It definitely implicates MM as a possible partner with Cooldog, but his suspicions of Bacde in the middle of a huge blow up with AP and Thor&#8217;s wagons doesn&#8217;t seem like scum interactions to me. Not until the end of the day anyway when Bacde and MM both hop on the Thor wagon at the last moments. Metalmarsh seems scummier for this than Bacde because at least Bacde seems convinced of Thor&#8217;s alignment. MM just seems to be jumping on with a &#8220;Me too&#8221; kind of attitude to gain some town cred after it&#8217;s clear his Godfather is getting lynched.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo TL;DR.

I will also admit that I overreacted and responded emotionally to AP fossing me due to a misunderstanding, and I took an anti-town stance by becoming upset with him and fossing him back.  I took an anti-town stance, but not a scumstance.  I no longer think AP is scum.  I take the same backpedal stance with Mastin, who I no longer feel is scum.  Denisatp also seems clear to me.  Smashbard also seems obviously town to me.

Also, for him to be scum means that him and Thor must of  thought of the greatest scum gambit of all time by bussing each other right out of the gate to leave the survivor with town cred. Which I find highly unlikely.<br>\n<br>\nMy gut tells me that Denis is town. But at this point we're reaching process of elimination so if he's town than I have to believe that somebody above is scum.

He was also trying really hard to prevent an AP or Thor lynch from going through until late Day 1, possibly trying to get the Godfather to save some face seeing it as a losing fight. He's pulled a lot of gutsy gambits, including appeals to emotion, offering himself as the lynch knowing it buys him town points, 1v1ing AngryPidgeon &amp; buddying up to me to try and get Cooldog lynched.

Your reason is just strong-ER than AP's.<br>\n<br>\nIf you would of made your case on AP like, at this point in the game, 20 pages later, I would be more inclined to believe you and go with your wagon.<br>\n<br>\nBut the fact that you both pretty much had your rock solid cases against the other ones scumminess within the first 5 pages of the game, that leads me to believe that both of you are just lynching each other based on bad blood, not real scumhunting. And there's no way for either of you to fix that perception until you come up with more than just one reason to lynch a person.<br>\n<br>\nBy the way, you're pretty much at L-1. Because AP is going to hammer you. Might as well claim now. I think you are a horrible lynch today, because with you gone there isn't going to be a foil for AngryPidgeon to stop him from taking  the reigns of the town in case he is scum. But honestly maybe this horrible lynch will show you that if you only have one good reason to lynch a person, and that reason is proven not to be enough to convince even a fraction of the town to join your side, you should drop that scumread and focus your attention somewhere else. Rather than stubbornly tunnel your way to death. It is a team game after all.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is the only post that makes me think Smashbard might be town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4490227#p4490227\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4490227#p4490227\" data-post-id=\"4490227\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 685</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19351\">Smashbard</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nMy top scumreads at the moment:<br>\nCooldog<br>\nCharter<br>\nDenis<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Thor (Only if Cooldog flips scum)</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nPossible distancing.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4492034#p4492034\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4492034#p4492034\" data-post-id=\"4492034\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 875</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19351\">Smashbard</a> wrote:</cite>Reasons I don't trust Voldemort:<br>\n<br>\nHe professes how obvtown he is.

Your points of me \"distancing\" from Thor are really bad, as I'm not the only one who's said that AP Vs. Thor was Town Vs. Town. Bacde said it too, and he was town.

I even said as much. I didn't WANT to get off my suspicions of Cool Dog, but I had no other choice. This is what anyone would do town or scum in order to not be completely retarded, so it should be a null read to you, not instantly scum.<br>\n<br>\nBesides, if you've suddenly found all this Day 1 \"evidence\" that I'm super suspicious, why are you not voting for me?

I'm today's lynch, because honestly nobodies going to come forward with more information other than \"Gee Smashbards Day 1 suspicions don't look so good, and Slandaar, Denis &amp; Projectmatt don't have enough to go off of by comparison\". So lynch me and move on. Because I'm honestly not going to keep batting away Day 1 accusations like gnat flies on the carcass of an ass.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOnce I die, if Mastin isn't killed tonight I will be shocked, and the rest of you should be very concerned as well.<br>\n<br>\nI see Cool Dog living until Lylo, because he reads to me as the most vulnerable townie to manipulate and easiest to convince to vote the wrong way. In a clinch.<br>\n<br>\nWhich means to me that if that is the case, I don't believe Denis is mafia. Because his constant berating of Cool Dog wouldn't come from calculating scum who's planning on manipulating the town into one final mislynch. Also, Denis' admittance to not having much to go on is just as genuine as my own admittance, so I don't think scum would try to do that to gain sympathy points while at the same time insulting the other players.<br>\n<br>\nCharter is confirmed town. So if Mastin isn't killed tonight it's going to be this guy. If both of them are alive and someone else is killed, then Mastin is scum. Guaranteed. There's no other way that scum would be so cocky as to allow more than 1 confirmed townie to stay for Lylo tomorrow when it's 3 to a lynch. That's allowing the town too great a chance to rally together 3 on 2.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar is most probably scum at this point, no matter which person is pointed to as his scum partner. He has not contributed enough to be a convincingly town player. The only way he's going to clear himself in my mind is by nightkill or if he claims Cop and nobody counter claims.<br>\n<br>\nOtherwise, why the hell was there a Gunsmith in this set up and not just a traditional cop?<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves Projectmatt. He could go either way to me as this point. His case against me is very poor. So that swings to me like it could be just town trying to find something concrete, or scum also trying to find something to scoot suspicions away from him. This strategy will sadly backfire on him no matter what because once I flip Projectmatt is going to look very scummy, regardless of his real alignment. So when I flip, don't suspect Projectmatt solely on that evidence, because you will mislynch and lose the game if that's all you have on Matt to lynch him tomorrow.", "time": "Sat Dec 08, 2012 1:24 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23922&start=1350", "forum": "53", "thread": "23922"}
