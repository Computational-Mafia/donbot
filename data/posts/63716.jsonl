You may not quote your role PM, you may not quote any other PMs from me, and you may not quote the time at which I sent you any PM.<br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">Blue</div> is the colour I'll use to post vote counts, edit things into other people's posts, etc. Do not use this or impersonate me.<br>\n4. If you have a question or concern, or if you think that I may have made an error, do not hesitate to ask in-topic or by pm. Be sure to bold requests directed at me so that I see them.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Lynching, and Deadlines:<br>\n5. Votes must be bolded. Some mods require you to unvote before changing your vote; I do not.<br>\n6. A lynch requires a majority (over 50%) vote.<br>\n7. You may also vote for no lynch to happen on that day by typing Vote: No lynch. A no-lynch only requires a 50% vote to go through.<br>\n8. Each day will have a 2-week deadline. If you do not achieve a lynch before deadline, there will be no lynch.<br>\n<br>\nNight Phase and Actions:<br>\n9. The night phase will last for 48 hours.<br>\n10. You may not use an ability on yourself unless otherwise specified.<br>\n11. If a limited-shot ability fails, the shot is still used, unless otherwise specified.<br>\n12. Night deadline might be extended if I need a replacement.<br>\n<br>\nProdding and Stuff:<br>\n13. If a player fails to post for 48 consecutive hours, he will be prodded. If that player does not post for another 24 hours after he's been prodded, he'll be replaced.<br>\n14. If you are going away, or if you have limited access to the site, notify me by pm or in-topic so that I know not to prod or replace you. If you're going to be V/LA over the night phase and have a night action, you may send in your action early. The maximum amount of time you may go without posting due to V/LA is 120 hours (five days).<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample VT Role PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Welcome, X!<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie.</div></div><br>\nYou have no special abilities, but you have your vote and your brain.<br>\nYou win when all threats to the Town are eliminated and at least one Town member is alive.</div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Oct 12, 2015 7:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

Like saying that signaling to town that we're out of RVS was a play to look like town. Doesn't make sense to me. And saying that Keyser not understanding that Lapsa was quoting the wiki was \"disingenuous.\" It seems much more likely to me, regardless of alignment, that Keyser just didn't know what Lapsa was posting. And there's not really a scum motivation for it, but Aris treats it as such. The reasoning just strikes me as the kind of thing scum would do when they know they're going after a wagon where the reasoning is already established but they don't want to look like they're just sheeping. So they heap on anything else they can find.<br>\n-Nothing else has really stood out to me as being alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nBlueMoonRising:<br>\n<br>\n-Not a whole lot yet, but for some reason I get a gut townvibe from his posts so far. Just the vote on Lapsa, the curtness, the (probable) wait-and-see approach...all things I feel like I see from town in early game. Not terribly strong, I'd call it a weak townlean and want to come back later. This is the kind of slot where other factors are better for reading the slot (not going to expand on that right now because if this slot is scum I don't want to give any ideas on what I'm looking for).<br>\n-EDIT AFTER INITIAL ENTRY: And then he goes and posts #210, in which he is directing play. There are a lot of scummy possibilities for this post, including coaching buddies, preemptively distancing himself from a mislynch and subtly trying to project an image of ignorance. The last sentence in particular bugs me because it seems like an afterthought; \"Oh by the way I don't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> know whether he's town.\"<br>\n<br>\nGarmr:<br>\n<br>\n-I get a minor townvibe from #70 given the way Garmr describes his RVS-stage attitude in #124. It just seems like Garmr trying to get things moving a little bit but he doesn't have a lot to go on. At the same time it's a very shallow push. Which basically means that Garmr isn't trying that hard to get things moving, and that can be antithetical to some scum's early-game mentality: to try to appear super towny.<br>\n-That being said, I was totally fooled by scumGarmr the last time I played with him so I don't know if I'll ever feel very comfortable townreading him this game.<br>\n-The push on Trivium (who is my top townread atm) gives me bad feelings, but at the same time it is literally impossible that the entire wagon is driven by scum so there must be some town out there who are on the wagon and just are not seeing what I'm seeing. I kind of knew that would happen because the post that made me townread triv the most is one that appears town to me because I know that I'm town.<br>\n-So basically my read on Garmr is somewhere between null and null-town, with a general wariness attached.<br>\n<br>\nGimlear:<br>\n<br>\n-The questioning of Keyser (which may have actually sparked the early wagon on him), denouncing of the push on Keyser and subsequent L-1'ing of Trivium could come from either alignment. But if it does come from scum, it means Gimlear is a competent and thoughtful scum player. Which is just something I want to take note of for future assessment of the slot.<br>\n-That being said, the arc and posting style does feel genuine to me. So not interested in chasing Gimlear right now.<br>\n<br>\nGrayfoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:<br>\n<br>\n-Slight scumlean mostly just for #138. Looks like scum hesitation to appear too scummy while still wanting to hop on a juicy wagon. Other than that not much to go on. This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br>\n<br>\nJJD:<br>\n<br>\n-JJD was the first, I believe, to jump on the Keyser thing. So while I do think it was low-hanging fruit for scum, I think you kind of have to give the benefit of the doubt to the first person to jump on the first wagon. That's just getting town out of RVS, which is something any alignment would do.<br>\n-The pushing on Keyser kinda strikes me as coming from town. Just seems like a natural path for town to go: sees something easy to talk about -&gt; votes to get town out of RVS -&gt; continues questioning player -&gt; responses don't make much sense, and you're already voting them, so you continue to argue.<br>\n-Begins assessing how other players have interacted with the wagon in #153, which supports the get-town-out-of-RVS theory for his push on Keyser.<br>\n-Yeah I just see a lot of questioning and trying to move the game forward. Reads like town. Not that scum can't fake it, but this early in the game it feels towny to me.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>\n-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>\n-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>\n-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLapsa:<br>\n<br>\n-There are really only two things in Lapsa's ISO that I see to look at: his vote/unvote on Trivium and his vote on makara. The vote on Trivium put Triv at L-2, and then he unvoted after Gray put Triv at L-1 (and also after I suggested that we shouldn't lynch Triv). I can see scum motivation behind it, but the town explanation seems a bit more plausible to me (that Lapsa wanted to let more happen in D1/didn't feel that strongly about Triv being scum.) It also kind of seems antithetical to a scum mindset just because why would he want to work against a mislynch? (this is assuming the point of view of scumLapsa/townTriv)<br>\n-The makara vote supports the explanation of Lapsa wanting more things to happen in D1 as well. Makara has probably posted the least out of all the players just because of the V/LA, and while Lapsa's vote didn't come with an explanation, I read it with an implication that Lapsa is trying to get makara to do more.<br>\n-Not sure what to make of Lapsa voting for BMR and makara in the same post. Maybe that's like a weird form of FoS?<br>\n<br>\nmakara:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer:<br>\n<br>\n-Early-game enthusiasm could just be the excitement of a player who hasn't played much or a scum player hoping to come across as friendly/towny/fun. Not really sure which direction to go.<br>\n-Parts of #73 strike me as being pretty shallow, like the chiming in on the Keyser stuff. Which pings as scummy. He does say a couple ISO posts later that he doesn't want to lynch Keyser, but that's after I start arguing for Keyser being town.<br>\n-Jumps on the Triv wagon later (Perf says it's L-1 but for some reason I feel like he was mistaken), which is sketchy but not more sketchy than some of the other people on the wagon IMO.<br>\n-So yeah a scumlean here.<br>\n<br>\nTrivium:<br>\n<br>\n-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>\n-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy:<br>\n<br>\n-Not really sure what to make of the early-game pre-flip association stuff. I guess I could see him using it as town as just a thought organizer, but then scum can use those techniques as a means to force their reads into a more genuine-looking perspective. So. Null I guess.<br>\n-His positioning on the Trivium wagon is prime scum real estate. The positioning is honestly the thing that made me raise an eyebrow when he made the vote. His reasoning, which goes above some other peoples' reasons for voting Triv, are actually not all that bad.<br>\n-Not a big fan of #191. It's like he's giving himself an out in case he wants to bail from the Trivium wagon.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueMoonRising</span><br>\n<br>\nI think this is a good place to be right now.", "time": "Fri Oct 16, 2015 1:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

I basically feel like the only way to prevent myself from being lynched i say claiming that I am inexperienced, but that seems like its not completely the case. I have played a few games already, and learned quite a lot from them. I just don't instinctively get how not to look scummy. Its like a paradox, look at it from my point of view- I am constantly trying to scumhunt, but my inherent, instinctual response to everything is a want to keep myself alive. So even if I ever were to catch scum, of course it would be incredibly easy for them to turn it around on me. And so if I want to survive, it only makes me more scummy. If I act like I don't care about staying alive anymore, I look scummy. If I ignore the wagon ad just focus on more scumhunting (or my attempt at it) I would look like I was trying to detract attention from myself, and I would look scummy.

There's not much else I've found notable from him but overall I want an explanation other than \"reread it\". PEDIT: he has kinda responded to this already but his response doesn't get at my question - how does the fact that a position is popular somehow not make it bad?<br>\nGimlear - Originally had him listed as null but after reading through ISO again I'm starting to get suspicious. He places an RVS vote, asks Keyser two questions and then disappears. When he gets back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7303194#p7303194\">155</a> it felt like he was going along with the popular opinion in the town.

Though there wasn't really a very good answer he could have given.<br>\n<br>\nFirst off, I think asking for a self read is more often scummy than than not.  It reeks of caring too much about how you appear.<br>\n<br>\nBut in this situation I find it way scummier because of the reason he gave.  Like if he said he was scumhunting and wanted to use trivs read to get a better read I'd say it was a bad reason but I can see it being bad-town.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason he gave though doesn't sound like bad-town, it sounds like scum:  The reason you ask reads from someone before they flip is so if they flip green you can read them and know they're real honest reads to help w/ your own.   But for him to ask for a read on himself makes no sense because he doesn't need to know his own alignment.  He can only want that read out there so the TOWN can use that to help w/ reading HIM.  And again, Scum cares alot about how other people read them.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, here was the entirety of what he posted before asking that question: <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7297762#p7297762\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7297762#p7297762\" data-post-id=\"7297762\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 12</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24435\">GrayFoxxxx</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: lapsa</span><br>\n<br>\nLAPPSSAAAAAA</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7298397#p7298397\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7298397#p7298397\" data-post-id=\"7298397\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 24</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24435\">GrayFoxxxx</a> wrote:</cite>Bump</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299626#p7299626\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299626#p7299626\" data-post-id=\"7299626\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 37</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24435\">GrayFoxxxx</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299616#p7299616\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299616#p7299616\" data-post-id=\"7299616\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 36</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22393\">Garmr</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299355#p7299355\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299355#p7299355\" data-post-id=\"7299355\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 35</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24613\">Lapsa</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299310#p7299310\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299310#p7299310\" data-post-id=\"7299310\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 33</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25845\">Keyser S&#246;ze</a> wrote:</cite>Are you bored Lapsa?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nDid YOU really need to ask this question?</div></blockquote><br>\nAre you not entertained.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNot</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7302885#p7302885\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7302885#p7302885\" data-post-id=\"7302885\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 138</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24435\">GrayFoxxxx</a> wrote:</cite>I would also like to vote trivium, but I don't know the vote count.<br>\nIt's too early to be troubled like this</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7302908#p7302908\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7302908#p7302908\" data-post-id=\"7302908\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 141</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24435\">GrayFoxxxx</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: triv</span><br>\n<br>\nI have parallel thinking with the people voting him.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nHe couldn't really be expecting much of a read from triv", "time": "Sat Oct 17, 2015 1:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

I do this when the votes are very split up between pages and we are far into a day. This is page 6. To go back and check is easy. This looks like scum hesitation to me. How were you \"troubled like this\"?? Was the lack of VC troubling? because the wagon is still small at this point and you should have been able to figure this out.<br>\nGreyfoxx: Finally votes, thanks to Gramr, and with such a good reason. So good. So Baaaaaaaaaaah!  This is very possibly scum.<br>\nZulfy: Quotes me, twice. Points out a discrepancy in my Keyser read (though not really, as it was a progression within the same post, but I digress). Then votes Triv without mentioning him?? Weird. Maybe scum slipping a vote in slyly? I don't think so though. I'm not null on this post, I'm torn on it. No ranking available at this time.<br>\nPerformer: Asks Triv in the post noted below to explain the buddying read between Tools and Keyser. Then brings him to L-1 in the next post?? I don't like this at all. I think the mention/pic of the honey means that he's blindly sheeping, which doesn't help him any at all.<br>\nToolsend then mentions his townread on Triv and it makes sense.

I don't like it when I am conflicted for too long and it generally degrades to a null-scum read because town are more pushy and scum more null a lot of the time. I think that's a good spot for Zulf right now in fact. He also then comments on the fact that we can finally put some pressure on somebody, woohoo, but refrains from doing so himself.

And the distinction that mafia players act differently with or without daychat is probably something Keyser believes independent of his alignment so I don't particularly care about that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299941#p7299941\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7299941#p7299941\" data-post-id=\"7299941\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 46</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23679\">JarJarDrinks</a> wrote:</cite>Really?

Keyser -is- kind of easy to critique since hes been the loudest poster thus far, but...

Grey's intentions for that are either selfish or scummy. I can expand if requested, but basically it is a way to make himself appear more towny upon the lynch (if scum) or a way to make sure he isn't pegged as being \"not mentioned by scum in their reads\" (a common way to identify scum, even if not necessarily accurate) if of either alignment.

It's confbias-y/reach-y, but I've found myself doing that as town before. I think this would come from eager town, which Aris certainly demonstrated with his first several posts that he was eager to start the game. So null on this I think. Want to try to look for more definitive things, as definitive as you can get in mafia anyway.<br>\n-#334 is a little suspicious to me though. He turns around on Keyser and says he thinks he was making something out of nothing, then starts looking on the Triv wagon for possible scum. Just seems like he was kind of following the way most people were going...<br>\n-The intent to hammer BMR in #409 also pings and fits in with the \"going with the flow\" hypothesis. It's definitely a hesitant post which fits in with expected scum approach to a mislynch, but obviously that only works if the BMR slot is in fact town.<br>\n-Yeah pretty wishy washy on this slot. I guess I would lean scum, the intent to hammer being the biggest thing. Looking at overall support for wagons might help my read here.<br>\n<br>\nBMR/AP:<br>\n<br>\n-Didn't really notice #83 before, in which he forgoes the Keyser wagon for Lapsa. Also kind of easy to pursue as scum, but Lapsa tends to attract suspicion from town as well for his playstyle.<br>\n-Then goes after JJD in #120 as well, which is not an easy place to be as scum I think. The combo Lapsa and JJD votes slide a little more town to me.<br>\n-#210 still sucks but I at least see town motivation for the last sentence that I didn't consider before, which is basically just trying to manipulate people into not hammering.<br>\n-I don't know...there's clearly a trend of going against the grain with most of the posts that BMR had, skimpy as they were. Which, if scum, I would guess would be an attitude of not wanting to be associated with mislynches. Idk...reading this again makes me think a little more town. The whole thing about continuing to post elsewhere on site while avoiding this game and then replacing out is a red flag for me, but there are many reasons a person might replace out. For this I think the acceptable town answer would have to be that he just didn't feel like putting in the effort to claw his way out of L-1. He already wasn't putting a ton of effort into this game so that explanation could fit.<br>\n-AP's replacing in makes me paranoid af. I know he's a good scum player (certainly was in person, and I know that can be very different from the way people play online, but I feel like he has a reputation on-site as being really good as scum as well) and I definitely see scummy possibilities here. Like he comes in and immediately starts trying to get people to unvote him, both explicitly (asking JJD to defend his reasoning in #425) and implicitly (#429, where he does a big catch-up post; the antithesis of BMR's inactivity that was clearly driving suspicion on the slot). The thing is that town doesn't want to be mislynched either, I know that for sure and I mislynched Titus in my last towngame when she replaced into a slot that was under fire near deadline too. So.<br>\n-I guess more than anything it's that AP seemed to go through the first several pages of the game looking for somebody to vote for, saw Keyser and slapped his vote there. Kind of supports the notion that he was just trying to get people off his back.<br>\n-Quite antsy about this slot. Another thing I have to take into consideration is the way this wagon built up, it seemed to grow pretty quickly and I could easily see some of the votes coming from scum. Whereas if this wagon was on scum then how would scum have interacted with it? I don't see a whole lot of arms-length buddying-type activity going on here, with the possible exception of Garmr saying he would be interested in seeing how the slot would flip but then not really seeming to want to vote it.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr:<br>\n<br>\n-One of the first proponents of a Triv wagon (pretty sure anyway).<br>\n-I don't understand the whole \"Triv's lack of self-defense is scummy\" thing. One, he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> defending himself by the time Garmr posted #194. Two, why would scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> defend themselves?<br>\n-#301 is still weird, for reasons I've noted before. It's a reachy thing to suppose and I just don't see town pushing their scum buddy up to L-1 with the intention of making the wagon fall apart. Other reasons for pushing their buddy up to L-1, sure, but that? The logic is based on unrealistic assumptions, and while Garmr says later (#344) that he wasn't assuming this to be true, #301 is worded as an assumption: personally I think...\"<br>\n-The main thing here is just Garmr really wanting to lynch Triv, to the point of coming up with reach reasoning to do so. I feel like that ties him to BMR/AP because he kept trying to get people back to the Triv wagon while BMR was being run up and why wouldn't scum want to push that? Only other explanation I can think of in the scenario in which BMR/AP is town and Garmr is scum is where both Garmr's scumbuds were already on the BMR wagon.<br>\n-I could lynch Garmr.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer:<br>\n<br>\n-Puts Triv at L-1 in #150, first time I believe. I actually vaguely recall Triv not actually being at L-1 at the time? But regardless, Perf believed that he was putting Triv at L-1 and that's what's important.<br>\n-Unvotes Triv in #224, at this point Triv was L-2 so I suppose the wagon might have already been showing signs of falling apart. I was defending Triv...as scum, Perf could have been looking for an out to hop off the wagon. OK so the unvote isn't necessarily towny.<br>\n-Hops on the BMR wagon.<br>\n-The reasoning posted for voting BMR makes me a little less suspicious of Perf now. Just looking over his ISO again it looks a little more like town trying to figure stuff out than scum with a plan or ulterior motive. The thing holding me back from a townread is the quickness with which his reads changed and the fact that they tended to change along with popular opinion.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\ntl;dr: Aris &amp; Perf <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_up.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":up:\" title=\"Up Arrow\">, BMR/AP <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_right.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":right:\" title=\"Right Arrow\">, Garmr <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_down.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":down:\" title=\"Down Arrow\"><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Garmr</span>", "time": "Mon Oct 26, 2015 6:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

{"number": 535, "id": "7335032", "user": "AngryPidgeon", "user_id": "19184", "content": "I'm going to list people in roughly T-&gt;S order as I think of it.<br>\n<br>\nToolenduso has been very objectively pro-town this game.  Supplying the links to Keyser games is still the most standout indication of it, but providing information and not wielding it like a bat or otherwise trying to make a contriver point off of it is town-motivated.  The readslists and points made at various points are well-formed and combined with the effort that went into it all, I really think this is just an obviously town slot.  The defense of Trivium in particular seems fairly unlikely from scum, regardless of Triv's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nI read your last bit about me and BMR.  I generally dislike meta, but if you've played with MonkeyMan before...this is basically just his MO.  Lurk a lot, push fairly superficial observations and get lots of flak for being judgmental about many things (like the hammer post).  You mentioned thinking I'm a good scum player and I will only add that I do take pride in my scumgames, perhaps more than most people.  I'm town in this game though and mentioning that I have a good scum game isn't going to get you closer to figuring that out.  The biggest feeling I absorbed from your last post is that you want to think I'm town but are having doubts and don't really want to commit to it.  Thats fine, I've been there at various points in my past.  You're gonna have to talk to me though; it feels like you are putting up a barrier preemptively to keep me at arm's length.  I'm not gonna figure out my own alignment for you, so lets talk?  I really really think you are town here and being pro-town so all the more reason to talk some things out.  Unfortunately this Day phase is mostly over, but if we are around Tomorrow I'd like to discuss some things about Performer, Lapsa, and Garmr for sure.<br>\n<br>\nJar Jar Drinks isn't quite the same level of town for me, but may as well be.  I'm seeing a lot of indications that his reads are updating organically and his suspicions all make a huge amount of sense if you look at it from his perspective.  The zulfy push that I mentioned about buddying him really stands out as a paranoia that Town is likely to exhibit but scum doesn't really gain too much from arguing.  The push on Keyser early on was very much progressing the game state and sticking his neck out.  Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7308526#p7308526\">248</a> really hit the nail on the head as I was reading through that part of the game about Gray who was previously kinda getting by.  The points on Lapsa are also pro-town points to be making.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nKeyser is definitely someone I'm taking a bigger picture approach to reading and the more I read Keyser posts the more I think hes just town.  My gut was really torn at some of the early self-defending which felt a bit fake and I was concerned that some of the posting schtick was really a mask to distract from some scummy elements.  At this point, I'm convinced that Keyser is mostly carefree and just doing things how he wants with little regard for how his posts will come across, ironically the opposite of my prior opinion.  But frankly, just the tone of his posts would be really hard to fake.  The zeal, confidence and occasional cluelessness that gets meshed in when someone argues with him would be really tiring to do as scum and while I'm not really able to rule that out as a possibility, I think its less likely than him just being blatant town here.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy...nothing really specific about Zulfy that screams town to me; I just really like the air behind most of his posts.  Hes very analytical but also abridged which makes him easy to understand.  Low fluff to content which is refreshing at least if not towny.  I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7296346#p7296346\">80[/post and [post]122</a> in particular.  The only things making me a little concerned are that he was fairly aware of the tunnel on Trivium when called out on it.  The refusal to vote BMR felt a little white-knighty, but makes sense in the context of his push on Trivium at least.  Sooo I'm reasonably confident about Zulfy being town, but thats definitely a notch below my previous mentioned reads.<br>\n<br>\nTrivium: This read got more town, the more I read.  I could pin down a couple things in particular but the self reflection after the meta of Keyser came out felt fairly genuine.  I'm largely drinking Tool's koolaid on this slot so rather than rehash that I'll just take a lazy approach and ....link <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7307463#p7307463\">216</a><br>\n<br>\nAristophanes: I really should have more to say about Aris right now but I'm getting lazier as I write this.  The post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7301248#p7301248\">100</a>? read really town to me.  For similar reasons that I thought Tool came off as town, the questioning of the meta links for Keyser aligned with some prodding I would have done around that time.  The post seemed very aware of what was going on and the careful  developing of the discussion without interjecting personal bias or leading questions looked like genuine scumhunting over fake scumhunting.  Aris on the last few pages has been more of a blur to me since it happened all at once and I read it all at once.  My main gripe with Aris is the Lapsa read which seems to be like Schrodinger's leopard.  Lapsa is town stop harassing him for the playstyle!; but lapsa is actually only null-town because he's...been protown?  Really want to discuss that further with him because I'm not sure why hes seeing Lapsa town and when it comes to interacting with people scumreading him, just makes melodramatic gestures in defense of Lapsa without really doing anything to dismantle the pressure.  But ya.  I generally like Aris's other content and I'm willing to call Aris probably town.<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\nBleh, I'm heading home so I'll be on in a couple hours to move my vote if needed.<br>\n<br>\nQuick summary of everyone else<br>\n<br>\nMakara/Lapsa: Kind of feel the same about both of these.  I've seen a couple things that I've liked, but Lapsa is coasting really hard on not explaining things and Makara had a post that I recall thinking looked hedgy.  Null and would really like to discuss these slots Tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nGimlear: I don't really remember much of anything from Gimlear.  Quick skim of the ISO tells me that I should devote some time to thinking about this.  Null.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr: Already talked about Garmr previously.  Thought his reaction to my entrance was off and the whole spiel about the Trivium wagon was definitely less-than-town imo.  I recall thinking that Garmr had some things that I liked so I'll likely go through some of his posts again when I have the time.  Leaning scum.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer: Stances have been expressed by other people for the most part.  The case on BMR and  Aristophanes rang bells and especially the Aris one looked like an attempt to open up a wagon there without sticking his neck out.  Still not totally sold on that, so null scum.<br>\n<br>\nGrayFoxx: Probably scum?  Not sure why Gray managed to get by all Day with minimal amounts of scrutiny.  Unfortunately the V/La is alignment neutral.  I wouldn't really feel bad about lynching him anyways though because I think hes the scummiest person in the game and he had his chance to post content.  The question to Trivium and follow up on why he asked it looked ridiculously scum motivated and the sheep vote on to the triv wagon was pretty much scum behavior.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: GrayFox</span> for now.", "time": "Mon Oct 26, 2015 11:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

Pretty clear when Triv votes Gray in #583 that he's doing it because he thinks Gray is the most likely lynch.<br>\n-Aris: Thinks Gray looks scummy in #334, his first mention of Gray.

Not that many mentions of Gray except the one above.  Kind of weird that someone would call a post genuine and not associate that with being towny at least a little bit.

The Lapsa/Garmr posts towards the end of the Day are interesting.  Garmr declaring intent to vote Gray is fine.  Lapsa jumps on him for ??? in response to him saying he'll go through with the lynch.  Lapsa needling Garmr over something mostly irrelevant doesn't really seem like the Lapsa from the rest of Day 1.  What exactly is wrong with garmr expressing intent to hammer at the end of the day?  I have some idea of why it might make sense to find Garmr's post scummy, but Lapsa ignoring the DL to go after Garmr while Garmr hammered just strikes me as weird.<br>\n<br>\n@Zulfy, can you explain why you didn't believe Triv's claim at all?

I typically don't see a reason to be conservative with votes on D1, where gauging reactions and interacting with people is more important than being precise right away.  I could have kept reading and ultimately would have concluded that Keyser looked better as the Day went on, but I would have voted Keyser if I had just replaced in on the first few pages so I didn't see any reason to hold back on doing it then either.<br>\n<br>\nI realize that Gimlear and Makara need some attention too.  Neither left a strong impression on me at the end of Day 1, so I was kind of surprised and not-at-all surprised to see Gimlear taking some heat Today, in particular from you.  So I'm working on sorting exactly where I am with that group.  Garmr's backing off of the Trivium wagon after the claim and having previously asked me to hammer looked like town.  Possibly too erratic to be scum?  His response to me bringing up the Godfather Tell seemed more disappointed than confrontational or over-defensive which I might expect scum to be if they were being accused of being blatantly scum motivated.  What is your read on Garmr right now?  I know hes getting a replacement supposedly so I'm sure that will give us more on the slot to work with.<br>\n<br>\nI have a few questions but they all kind of boil down to: if not Gimlear, who would you be voting for?  Which is not to say I think Gimlear is a bad vote, but I'm not sure where other people are stacking up in your mind.", "time": "Sun Nov 01, 2015 10:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

Not flipping out, just caps lock for emphasis. We should definitely look at the D1 wagons, because that's where nearly the entire player-base is at. However, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't ALSO look at the ones who didn't join either wagon. To rephrase that last sentence, we should also look at people who did not join that wagon, people like Keyser Planet.

Triv took a step back, looked at his posting and realized that that's exactly what he was doing. Then he acknowledged it and gave his reasons for doing so.<br>\n<br>\nThat's what his defense was.

{"number": 972, "id": "7372606", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "Was looking through Garmr's ISO again and found myself seeing very possible scum motivation behind his arc. Like I think Garm is a pretty capable scum player and therefore think he could easily resist the temptation of going for every wagon that comes up and instead stick to his guns (which outwardly implies stubborn townie, but can also come from scum who don't want to do a ton of work or are having a tough time finding people they think genuinely look scummy).<br>\n<br>\nSo with Garm doggedly sticking to the Triv wagon to the very end, pushing against the BMR wagon and then hammering gray despite the claim, there are definitely probable explanations for both town and scum:<br>\n<br>\n-Town: Really, really thought Triv looked bad and didn't know alignment of players telling him otherwise so didn't trust them. Thought BMR was town and therefore tried to get town not to mislynch. Didn't want to no lynch and figured that with triv's claim gray might be lying anyway.<br>\n-Scum: Thought triv looked bad and sensed that wagon could come back around to him, or couldn't find anyone else he really thought looked scummy enough to push without having to come up with a thin case. BMR was a buddy (feel like I have a reason not to believe this but I'd have to go back and look for it) or just didn't think BMR looked scummy enough to vote and knew he would have to explain himself if BMR was lynched and flipped town. Saw opportunity to hammer town PR in gray and took it, also knowing scum had a shot at a second PR that night and it was worth possibly getting lynched D2 to have two town PR investigatives gone.<br>\n<br>\nDid a tiny bit of meta work with garm too because I was curious to see how stubborn he is about stuff/his approach to easy wagons. Garm was scum in Mini 1700 and resisted joining the wagon on Blocky (who ended up being the D1 lynch and was town), until the very end of D1 (from the timing it looked like a deadline lynch, much like in this game). Meanwhile Garm was pushing somebody else (fraggernaut) who wound up being town. So yeah, even if BMR/AP is town in this game, scumGarmr could have easily just resisted going for that wagon. And if BMR/AP is a scumbuddy, there's an obvious reason not to vote for it. Of note is that Garmr's approach to the blocky wagon in 1700 was not to defend it the way he defended BMR in this game, but rather to fence sit on that slot but stay off the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nAlso of not was that garmr voted fraggernaut early in that game and parked his vote there for a long time (he eventually unvoted and didn't vote again until hammering blocky).<br>\n<br>\nI also looked at a game where garmr was town, NY 187 (pariah). In this one he also parked his vote on somebody early and stubbornly held onto it for most of D1.<br>\n<br>\nSo, lesson number one is that Garmr tends to latch onto a suspect early in D1 and cling stubbornly to it no matter what. That seems to be non-alignment indicative for him.<br>\n<br>\nHe actually held onto this one as the wagon built up and then fell apart, and he kept hanging onto it as town momentum built on prolapsed brain, who wound up being the D1 lynch and was town. Weird thing is, Garmr didn't mention prolapsed at all until after D1.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah I don't really feel comfortable eliminating Garmr, and in fact might want to lynch him. woo moving backwards", "time": "Sat Nov 07, 2015 1:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

{"number": 975, "id": "7372688", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "The thing about JJD's case on Lapsa (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7333506#p7333506\" class=\"postlink\">#505</a>) is that it doesn't take into account the fact that most of what Lapsa says goes unexplained. So when JJD argues that Lapsa wasn't putting effort into defending Triv, that view is based on posts that look like every other post Lapsa has made in this game -- short and vague. And when he offers further evidence in the fact that Lapsa moved Triv from town to null, it implies that Lapsa actually thought that small action would add pressure to Triv...which doesn't seem likely to me. Lapsa still never voted Triv and didn't seem like he would have iirc.<br>\n<br>\nSo what <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> we have in the way of reading Lapsa? We have his votes, and we have a steady stream of posts where he pushes and prods various people in one way or another -- what I believe to be his brand of scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nHis votes are all over the place and clearly do not follow momentum with the exception of the BMR wagon (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">note to self: should we get a scumflip on either of those slots, that should very much be considered</div>.) I tend to think that that's more likely to come from town, but...it's not the most convincing thing ever.<br>\n<br>\nSince I'm on a bit of a meta streak I'll do a little work with Lapsa's meta too. Let's see what we can find.<br>\n<br>\n-Mini 1636: Lapsa was VT (pretty sure vanilla anyway). Votes were all over the place, posting style was similar to this game.<br>\n-Newbie 1548: Lapsa was town tracker. Vote hopped a little but kept it on Thor most of the day. Longer posts in a back-and-forth with Thor, but Thor tends to spur on that kind of thing and Lapsa's replies were still short quips, just several short quips packed into one post.<br>\n-Mewbie 1538: Lapsa was VT and replaced in in post #143. So he only was in the game for like four days before D1 ended, and he only had one vote.<br>\n-Mini 1652: Lapsa was town vig. He vote hops pretty much the same way he did in this game. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>\n-Mini 1666: Lapsa was VT. Vote hopped a fair amount. Lol like every time Lapsa is in a game with VDA he votes him. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>\n-Mini 1687: Lapsa was VT (I was in this one with him). Vote hopped a bit but parked on Thor and Math/Pers for a while. Posting style was similar to this game.<br>\n-NY 188: Lapsa was werewolf gunsmith (it was multiball). Vote hopped quite a bit, including one on his partner so let's remember that should we get a scumflip from Lapsa this game. The posting style is similar to this game in that it's mostly short quips and he posts a lot of silly gifs/youtube music, but...it kinda feels a little different. His sentences are more complete, more well-structured. He seems to explain things a little bit more.<br>\n<br>\nLong and short of it -- Lapsa always posts like this and always vote hops.

One is that the reasons for his townreads on me (reasonable and active, basically) and his townlean on Zulfy (\"I agree with him\") are thin. This can come from scum more concerned with finding scumreads than townreads. The scum lean on Trivium comes amid pressure on Trivium and feels kind of like a fence-sitting cop-out type move latching onto other players' attitudes toward Triv. His BMR vote also comes right as pressure is beginning to mount on BMR and uses others' reasoning.<br>\n-Supporting Garmr's weird point in #304 could just be a matter of opinion, or it could be because the suggestion that scum pushed Triv up to L-1 could come in handy for scumMak to use later. If we get a scumflip on the slot we should look at this post again.<br>\n-#477 also rings as convenient for scum: \"The BMR replacement doesn't look as easy to lynch, good thing I left this back door open to get on the Triv wagon.\"<br>\n<br>\nI see three completed games for mak, all three of which he was town in and all three of which are newbies:<br>\n<br>\n-In 1651 he replaced in. His first reads list is very similar to this game, and his townreads are actually similarly thin in that game as well. His vote put a person at L-1 and that person wound up being town. So....not too far off from this game, actually.<br>\n-In 1654 he was replaced after 544 posts in the game (he made 63 posts). I believe that was the same time he replaced out of this game and for the same reasons. Anyway early on he sheeps somebody else and votes TSO, acknowledging he's sheeping. Votes crashingwaves in #117 partially because he's not posting very much, which smacks of his vote on BMR in this game. Again posts a reads list where the reasoning for his town reads is thin.<br>\n-So that leaves 1639, in which he played all the way through. Voting and reads lists seem a little different in this game, but that could be a product of the game environment.<br>\n<br>\nOK, so...some of the things mak did in this game that looked pretty scummy are things he appears to do regularly as town.

There's not much else I've found notable from him but overall I want an explanation other than \"reread it\".

He places an RVS vote, asks Keyser two questions and then disappears. When he gets back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7303194#p7303194\">155</a> it felt like he was going along with the popular opinion in the town.

Firstly, I find that sideways jab at Garmr to be pretty odd.  Makara mostly lurked and Garmr was actually around and making cases on Trivium and getting attention for it.  Why call out Makara over Garmr for this?  Back to my original point, why does trivium being a COP matter at all?  Performer's point seems to be that people who tunneled on a townie are suspect.  Thats a pretty shallow point to making considering tunneling is typically more of a playstyle thing than it is alignment indicative and there really is no analysis from Performer (meta or otherwise) to indicate that this particular case is scummy.  Ok, so maybe Performer is more into heurisitcs than I am and thinks that these playersa re scummy for tunneling a townie.  Why not say that then?; Once again bringing up that Trivium was a cop looks to me like an attempt to pass off a pretty shallow point as something more than it is by bringing this up.  Naturally people feel shitty about having forced a cop to claim on D1.  Performer is kind of blaming Makara for it in a way and of course people are going to be sympathetic to that because they will agree on an emotional level that losing the cop sucked.  Furthermore,if I'm expected to believe that this is all just how Performer thinks (plausible) then I'm left wondering why he didn't say anything similar about the gray wagon in the same stride.  Gray flipped PR and I tunneled Gray pretty hard yet Performer doesn't really mention that at all.  Aris got an honorable mention in the performer post for asking Garmr to hammer, but that is only really a peripherally related train of thought.<br>\n<br>\nDoes that answer your question?<br>\n<br>\nRe why did I bring it up.

{"number": 1243, "id": "7396351", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "Well that was kind of unexpected. Had Keyser like third for people I would have expected to die last night.<br>\n<br>\nKind of wish it would have been performer -- no offense, but if you're town like I'm thinking you are, it would have helped to have you dead so town couldn't get distracted and possibly mislynch you.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, here's what I did during the night. I went through the mod's VCs for D2 looking at how each slot interacted with the mak/sky and garmr/const wagons, then went through each ISO looking for mentions of mak. I did Keyser too but obv that's not very helpful any more.<br>\n<br>\nRemoved a couple thoughts on perf for reasons. But I suspect he's town.<br>\n<br>\nmak votes: perf (RVS), BMR, Triv, Gim<br>\nsky votes: Const<br>\n<br>\nJJD:<br>\n<br>\n-Looks like JJD revived the wagon on makara as of the #968 VC.<br>\n-D1, JJD doesn't interact with mak until mak says that JJD's Post #125 gave him \"bad vibes.\" JJD slightly scumreads mak in #418.<br>\n-D2, JJD needles mak for accusing gim of following the popular trends. Lapsa is his main push to begin the day but by #787 he's calling for a compromise lynch on mak. Votes mak in #954 and points out again that he's looking like a good compromise lynch.<br>\n-JJD is like super obvious town. He would be my number one choice of NK as scum unless they have a useful result from makara. Yet JJD may yet actually be alive tomorrow if Perf was truly softing bodyguard like I thought he was.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy:<br>\n<br>\n-Zulfy votes for mak in the very first VC of D2. He unvotes and then moves to Lapsa, but still. He rejoins the mak wagon as of the #1098 VC.<br>\n-D1: Mostly treats mak the same way as everyone else, asking him to clarify stuff from time to time/minor challenges to points made. Asks Triv to investigate makara in #562.<br>\n-D2: Votes mak to begin the day, unvotes without explanation in #744. Suggests scum-mak in #745. #798 could be read as Zulf trying to get me to vote mak. Says sky is \"definitely scum\" before voting her in #1082, and this was before she claimed cop.<br>\n-Zulfy is also super obvious town per the associatives.<br>\n<br>\nPerf:<br>\n<br>\n-Perf led the charge on constantine D2. Puts sky at L-1 as of the #1098 VC.<br>\n-D1: Perf votes mak (RVS?) in his second post, #20.<br>\n-D2: Perf comes out saying mak looks scummy at the beginning of D2, #696. Asks JJD to join Const wagon because mak couldn't claim (referencing my argument) in #973. Says he's still not comfortable with lynching the slot in #1038 after sky replaced in. There's also the whole asking sky about her predecessor fakeclaiming cop thing in #1036. Still not sure about this. It was obviously not too tough a test given the spoilered bit, but I guess why test your partner like this in the first place? Idk...I could see this stuff meaning perf is a partner but I just don't feel confident in it. Seems like a place scum would want to push an associative case.<br>\n<br>\nGimlear:<br>\n<br>\n-Though Gim started out D2 voting for Lapsa, mak went straight for Gim.<br>\n-D1: Not a whole lot of interaction with mak. Some needling of the slot, and he cautions aris not to townread mak with the logic aris uses at one point.<br>\n-D2: Says he's scumreading mak in #767. At this point there were no votes on mak. Joins the const counterwagon in #969. Specifies later that if there's a replacement for mak he would be one of his top lynch choices. Says my meta defense of mak is weak and votes sky in #1119.<br>\n-Yeah Gim does not look like a partner of this slot.<br>\n<br>\nAP:<br>\n<br>\n-BMR doesn't appear to have mentioned mak at all.<br>\n-AP didn't vote D2 until the #1009 VC, then voted for mak. Unvoted for my sake I think and then put mak at L-1 again later.<br>\n-D1: Challenges mak's scumlean on BMR and hints at scumreading mak in #513. Says he would like to pay more attention to mak on D2.<br>\n-D2: Has mak at null in #758, reiterates wish to see more attention paid to mak in #780. Votes mak in #987 basically saying he's sheeping JJD, AP was the second vote on mak. Says we don't need to wait for mak to roleclaim in #1017. Unvotes to give me time to say stuff, then puts mak back at L-1 when Keyser unvotes.<br>\n-Overall looks pretty good for AP, but there are things that make me think possible scum partner. Like having mak at null for so long and then jumping on after JJD set up the wagon. Yes, AP was on relatively early, but it was also approaching deadline and JJD had already pointed out that mak was a common scum read for a lot of people and therefore looked like a likely compromise lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAris:<br>\n<br>\n-Doesn't vote D2 until the #886 VC, where he votes for Const just after he replaces in. Keeps his vote there the rest of the day save for a quick hop over to Perf for one VC.<br>\n-D1: Says mak forgetting where his vote was reads as town to him in #482.<br>\n-D2: Puts mak at null in #857. Says he'd rather go for const or perf but will look back at mak in #957.<br>\n-This looks like it could come from a partner. Very easily.<br>\n<br>\nConstantine:<br>\n<br>\n-Coming into D2, Garmr parked on Lapsa until he was replaced. Const came in and waited a bit then unvoted. Voted mak and then immediately unvoted without really explaining why.<br>\n-D1 (as Garmr): Asks mak if he wants to compromise lynch Lapsa in #692. Would tend to think scum partners wouldn't brazenly coordinate in the open like this.<br>\n-D2 (as Const): The vote for mak doesn't come with explanation (\"God it feels good to do that\"), and the unvote doesn't come with explanation either (\"i think this is the only game mak replaced out of,\" which was actually not true). In #992/993, basically says he wants to lynch mak but is waiting for a replacement.<br>\n-These ISOs don't give me a whole lot that look explicitly like partners, but I could see that explanation fitting, given that Const was the counterwagon to mak/Sky. Want to hear why he voted and why he unvoted.<br>\n<br>\nLapsa:<br>\n<br>\n-Votes AP, then Const, then AP again, then unvotes, then \"votes\" sky after my hammer.<br>\n-D1: Lists mak as null in #129. Votes mak three times beginning in #193. Townreads mak in #243, than again in #404.<br>\n-D2: Nullreads (scumleans?) mak in #810, with garmr above mak on the null list and AP at bottom. Votes const in #974. Says he dislikes the makara lynch because of AP's vote in #990.<br>\n-Could see this as partner behavior.<br>\n<br>\nFinal thoughts:<br>\n<br>\n-The only way JJD is not town is if he's like an arsonist or a survivor, and I'm not going to work under that assumption.<br>\n-Zulfy is very probably town, gim does not look like a partner.<br>\n-AP has <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> stuff in his ISO that suggests partner, but I will point out that mak was the second person on the BMR wagon after I started it on D1. So I don't really think he is.<br>\n-Aris and Lapsa both look like possible partners.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like to hear thoughts from anybody else who did associative stuff during the night.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Constantne: Please explain your vote and unvote of sky yesterday.</div>", "time": "Mon Nov 16, 2015 5:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

I'm inclined to believe that these townreads of Makara's are all town.  The reads on tool and Zulfy at least feel like \"blah blah I need to call someone town and these guys seem fairly town\".  Just the way he townread them there feels like he knew he could go back and justify the reads easily later because they are town and he genuinely sees them that way.  Keyser read doesn't read the same as the other 2 to me, but I don't really think that affects my thoughts on this.<br>\n<br>\nHard scumread and vote on my slot which makes me more interested in the null-scum reads than anything here.  Probably definitely at least one scum in there.  <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Trivium</div>, JarJar, Gimlear, Performer...Just based on reading Makara's reads on these 2, I'm more suspicious of Gimlear.  Makara's performer read comes off as apologetic and preemptively defensive.  The \"I tend to scumread people [Performer] who...\" is pretty weak.  Its like a justification or inherent backpedal present in the own read.  Reads as if he feels guilty about this one, so gonna say Performer probably town for that?  The Gimlear one is totally the opposite impression.  Makara went off just to ISO Gimlear?  This read feels a bit more confident although I'm not really seeing what its based on.  Makara seems to kind of believe this one and the conclusion that Gimlear is just going along with the town especially gives me that impression.<br>\n<br>\nNull reads of <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">GrayFox</div>, Aris, Garmr, Lapsa.

Slightly interesting that hes promising to reread the slot; the only other time he implied such initiative was with Gimlear in this post.  I'm not too concerned with Makara null-reading Aris considering Aris's presence to that point in the game, but this read comes off a little guilty; giving it way more time than it should, all things considered.  The Lapsa read sounds a bit concerned, like he is legitimately concerned with Lapsa's scumread on him.  ~Could~ be a scum/scum thing with Makara moderately annoyed that hes getting bussed.  Lack of daytalk sort of supports this, but eh.  Could easily see this being scum overdefensive in response to town.  And the inconsistency with his previous read on Lapsa...I don't know.  I'd expect scum to be more aware of how they are reading their buddies than they are townies, but its just weird.

There's not much else I've found notable from him but overall I want an explanation other than \"reread it\". PEDIT: he has kinda responded to this already but his response doesn't get at my question - how does the fact that a position is popular somehow not make it bad?<br>\nGimlear - Originally had him listed as null but after reading through ISO again I'm starting to get suspicious. He places an RVS vote, asks Keyser two questions and then disappears. When he gets back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7303194#p7303194\">155</a> it felt like he was going along with the popular opinion in the town.

I don't think it'd the greatest case, but being early in both the game and the wagon, that is forgivable.<br>\nKeyser: The build up to this is reasonable and the points are okay. I like this vote.

I do this when the votes are very split up between pages and we are far into a day. This is page 6. To go back and check is easy. This looks like scum hesitation to me. How were you \"troubled like this\"?? Was the lack of VC troubling? because the wagon is still small at this point and you should have been able to figure this out.<br>\nGreyfoxx: Finally votes, thanks to Gramr, and with such a good reason.

Points out a discrepancy in my Keyser read (though not really, as it was a progression within the same post, but I digress). Then votes Triv without mentioning him?? Weird. Maybe scum slipping a vote in slyly? I don't think so though. I'm not null on this post, I'm torn on it. No ranking available at this time.<br>\nPerformer: Asks Triv in the post noted below to explain the buddying read between Tools and Keyser. Then brings him to L-1 in the next post?? I don't like this at all. I think the mention/pic of the honey means that he's blindly sheeping, which doesn't help him any at all.<br>\nToolsend then mentions his townread on Triv and it makes sense.

There's not much else I've found notable from him but overall I want an explanation other than \"reread it\". PEDIT: he has kinda responded to this already but his response doesn't get at my question - how does the fact that a position is popular somehow not make it bad?<br>\nGimlear - Originally had him listed as null but after reading through ISO again I'm starting to get suspicious. He places an RVS vote, asks Keyser two questions and then disappears. When he gets back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7303194#p7303194\">155</a> it felt like he was going along with the popular opinion in the town.

His playstyle is very cryptic to me which makes it hard for me to read him.  Performer is playing more like he did in the 2nd day of the last (only?) game I had with him.

Thus Zulfy gets negative points.<br>\nPerf and Lapsa are strong possibilities as well, as they are mentioned in the list as town and can easily be hidden in the overall format of the post if they are teammates. I suppose the same can be said about me if you like, but I am discounting that.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer comes up a lot in that, I know, but the \"Cop claim\" thing doesn't strike me as scummates talking. <br>\nZulfy is extremely likely, and I can't say I've had them as a townread for most of the game.<br>\nConstantine, as Skybird's counterwagon and vote is unlikely, but not impossible.<br>\nLapsa is still extremely possible.

Like saying that signaling to town that we're out of RVS was a play to look like town. Doesn't make sense to me. And saying that Keyser not understanding that Lapsa was quoting the wiki was \"disingenuous.\" It seems much more likely to me, regardless of alignment, that Keyser just didn't know what Lapsa was posting. And there's not really a scum motivation for it, but Aris treats it as such. The reasoning just strikes me as the kind of thing scum would do when they know they're going after a wagon where the reasoning is already established but they don't want to look like they're just sheeping. So they heap on anything else they can find.<br>\n-Nothing else has really stood out to me as being alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nBlueMoonRising:<br>\n<br>\n-Not a whole lot yet, but for some reason I get a gut townvibe from his posts so far. Just the vote on Lapsa, the curtness, the (probable) wait-and-see approach...all things I feel like I see from town in early game. Not terribly strong, I'd call it a weak townlean and want to come back later. This is the kind of slot where other factors are better for reading the slot (not going to expand on that right now because if this slot is scum I don't want to give any ideas on what I'm looking for).<br>\n-EDIT AFTER INITIAL ENTRY: And then he goes and posts #210, in which he is directing play. There are a lot of scummy possibilities for this post, including coaching buddies, preemptively distancing himself from a mislynch and subtly trying to project an image of ignorance. The last sentence in particular bugs me because it seems like an afterthought; \"Oh by the way I don't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> know whether he's town.\"<br>\n<br>\nGarmr:<br>\n<br>\n-I get a minor townvibe from #70 given the way Garmr describes his RVS-stage attitude in #124. It just seems like Garmr trying to get things moving a little bit but he doesn't have a lot to go on. At the same time it's a very shallow push. Which basically means that Garmr isn't trying that hard to get things moving, and that can be antithetical to some scum's early-game mentality: to try to appear super towny.<br>\n-That being said, I was totally fooled by scumGarmr the last time I played with him so I don't know if I'll ever feel very comfortable townreading him this game.<br>\n-The push on Trivium (who is my top townread atm) gives me bad feelings, but at the same time it is literally impossible that the entire wagon is driven by scum so there must be some town out there who are on the wagon and just are not seeing what I'm seeing. I kind of knew that would happen because the post that made me townread triv the most is one that appears town to me because I know that I'm town.<br>\n-So basically my read on Garmr is somewhere between null and null-town, with a general wariness attached.<br>\n<br>\nGimlear:<br>\n<br>\n-The questioning of Keyser (which may have actually sparked the early wagon on him), denouncing of the push on Keyser and subsequent L-1'ing of Trivium could come from either alignment. But if it does come from scum, it means Gimlear is a competent and thoughtful scum player. Which is just something I want to take note of for future assessment of the slot.<br>\n-That being said, the arc and posting style does feel genuine to me. So not interested in chasing Gimlear right now.<br>\n<br>\nGrayfoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:<br>\n<br>\n-Slight scumlean mostly just for #138. Looks like scum hesitation to appear too scummy while still wanting to hop on a juicy wagon. Other than that not much to go on. This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br>\n<br>\nJJD:<br>\n<br>\n-JJD was the first, I believe, to jump on the Keyser thing. So while I do think it was low-hanging fruit for scum, I think you kind of have to give the benefit of the doubt to the first person to jump on the first wagon. That's just getting town out of RVS, which is something any alignment would do.<br>\n-The pushing on Keyser kinda strikes me as coming from town. Just seems like a natural path for town to go: sees something easy to talk about -&gt; votes to get town out of RVS -&gt; continues questioning player -&gt; responses don't make much sense, and you're already voting them, so you continue to argue.<br>\n-Begins assessing how other players have interacted with the wagon in #153, which supports the get-town-out-of-RVS theory for his push on Keyser.<br>\n-Yeah I just see a lot of questioning and trying to move the game forward. Reads like town. Not that scum can't fake it, but this early in the game it feels towny to me.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>\n-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>\n-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>\n-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLapsa:<br>\n<br>\n-There are really only two things in Lapsa's ISO that I see to look at: his vote/unvote on Trivium and his vote on makara. The vote on Trivium put Triv at L-2, and then he unvoted after Gray put Triv at L-1 (and also after I suggested that we shouldn't lynch Triv). I can see scum motivation behind it, but the town explanation seems a bit more plausible to me (that Lapsa wanted to let more happen in D1/didn't feel that strongly about Triv being scum.) It also kind of seems antithetical to a scum mindset just because why would he want to work against a mislynch? (this is assuming the point of view of scumLapsa/townTriv)<br>\n-The makara vote supports the explanation of Lapsa wanting more things to happen in D1 as well. Makara has probably posted the least out of all the players just because of the V/LA, and while Lapsa's vote didn't come with an explanation, I read it with an implication that Lapsa is trying to get makara to do more.<br>\n-Not sure what to make of Lapsa voting for BMR and makara in the same post. Maybe that's like a weird form of FoS?<br>\n<br>\nmakara:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer:<br>\n<br>\n-Early-game enthusiasm could just be the excitement of a player who hasn't played much or a scum player hoping to come across as friendly/towny/fun. Not really sure which direction to go.<br>\n-Parts of #73 strike me as being pretty shallow, like the chiming in on the Keyser stuff. Which pings as scummy. He does say a couple ISO posts later that he doesn't want to lynch Keyser, but that's after I start arguing for Keyser being town.<br>\n-Jumps on the Triv wagon later (Perf says it's L-1 but for some reason I feel like he was mistaken), which is sketchy but not more sketchy than some of the other people on the wagon IMO.<br>\n-So yeah a scumlean here.<br>\n<br>\nTrivium:<br>\n<br>\n-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>\n-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy:<br>\n<br>\n-Not really sure what to make of the early-game pre-flip association stuff. I guess I could see him using it as town as just a thought organizer, but then scum can use those techniques as a means to force their reads into a more genuine-looking perspective. So. Null I guess.<br>\n-His positioning on the Trivium wagon is prime scum real estate. The positioning is honestly the thing that made me raise an eyebrow when he made the vote. His reasoning, which goes above some other peoples' reasons for voting Triv, are actually not all that bad.<br>\n-Not a big fan of #191. It's like he's giving himself an out in case he wants to bail from the Trivium wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueMoonRising</span><br>\n<br>\nI think this is a good place to be right now.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7308813#p7308813\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7308813#p7308813\" data-post-id=\"7308813\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 255</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7005\">toolenduso</a> wrote:</cite>Forgot to respond to this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7307864#p7307864\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7307864#p7307864\" data-post-id=\"7307864\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 223</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26322\">Trivium</a> wrote:</cite>Tool, why are you defending people so much?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nEarlier in the game I did feel more confident in my townreads than my scumreads, but I have also had my vote on people for serious reasons and been developing scumreads.<br>\n<br>\nAlso I didn't want you or Keyser to get lynched so I was trying to get people not to do that.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7320303#p7320303\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7320303#p7320303\" data-post-id=\"7320303\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 377</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7005\">toolenduso</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7319443#p7319443\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7319443#p7319443\" data-post-id=\"7319443\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 364</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7005\">toolenduso</a> wrote:</cite>One or two of the votes on the wagon make me a little leery</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThought I'd expand on this.

In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>\n-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>\n-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nmakara:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nTrivium:<br>\n<br>\n-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>\n-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7327940#p7327940\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7327940#p7327940\" data-post-id=\"7327940\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 455</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7005\">toolenduso</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nHe's my strongest townread and therefore I would not feel good about voting for him at all.

At the end of d1, Lap voted Garm to get town credit. However, the public posts from him on d3, as well as Lapsa's posts in my private neighborizer thread with him, have been moving me to gradually scumlean him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><br>\nRegarding Pidgeon: Pidgeon voted Sky on d2. In my neighborizer PT, Lapsa asked me about recruiting Pidgeon on night 3 (he still thought I was unlimited Town Neighborizer). He stated that Pidgeon's \"experience could get us out of trouble.\" I have a theory about the real reason why Lapsa asked me to neighborize Pidgeon. He wanted V/LA for 7 days until 11/28. This is the 1st time I saw anyone ask for such a huge length of V/LA. I'd imagine that would work so conveniently for Pidgeon to lurk. He added he thought Zulfy was also a good recruit but he trusted Pidgeon more. </div><br>\n<br>\nHe also wanted to perform a fake claim to \"protect us,\" which at the time, I replied back in the PT along the lines of \"this is completely absurd.\" This is why we saw his fake claim of the very specific Neighborizer claim, from Lapsa. I told him that if the circumstances permitted, I'd claim but if not, I could wait for d4 to claim. He then had the gall to tell me he didn't think me claiming was a good idea. Scum tell.<br>\n<br>\nSome other things he brought up in the PT:<br>\n-Was scumreading Ari because his main problem with him is he seems extremely low on content<br>\n-He claimed VT.

Do you all share one neighborhood or is it separate neighborhoods?  Assuming we haven't already, I really want to mass claim today.  If Lapsa is town then I doubt there are any other PRs out there at all.  Follower and 2-shot cop are fairly powerful and ~could~ exist by themselves but I'd usually expect an average of 3 town PRs in a mini normal game.  Neighborizer does have some utility in that if it neighborizes one of the other two PRs, it can claim results for them and protect them that way.  Actually, I think Lapsa is probably town.  There is no way this claim is fake; could be a scum neighborizer but we've already seen Makra flip scum PR in the rolecop and frankly Neighborizer/2xCop/Follower vs OddRoleCop is fairly balanced.

Looks like town and quacks like town.  Loosely concerned about Lapsa's vote on him, but JarJar's tunnel on Lapsa really makes no sense from scum/scum in this case.  So very probably town.<br>\n<br>\nI am about to run and go to brunch with my family, so I'll finish summarizing my thoughts when I get back.  Constantine/Lapsa are more prolific and deserve a bit more thought anyhow.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to rule out Tool at this point, I think that the most likely partner for Tool is either Gimlear or Aris if he is scum.  Still other people are more likely so I won't be voting here Today.", "time": "Tue Nov 24, 2015 7:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

Votes him in #636. This was after I had pushed a Garmr wagon, failed to gain any support and then voted Gray before going to bed before deadline. There was no real danger of Garmr being lynched there; people weren't even sure Gray was going to get lynched at that point.<br>\n-In #810 he still has Garmr at null, now like a green color and in the middle of the null list. Says the Garmr read is \"slippery.\"<br>\n-Votes Const in #974. This is closing in on the deadline of D2 and just after I posted my POE thoughts on Garmr/Const, concluding that I didn't want to eliminate him from the lynch pool and would actively consider lynching him. Also JJD had just asked lapsa if he wanted to help lynch constantine. Lapsa proceeds to vote AP 14 posts later.<br>\n-Votes Const again in #1120. This is right after Gim puts Sky at L-1.<br>\n-Admits in #1211 that he was trying to build a counterwagon to sky.<br>\n-In #1386, seems certain Const is scum. Reinforces that with reasoning in #1394.<br>\n-Post fakeclaim, Lapsa votes const in #1407. This is where I'll stop since I don't need a refresher on the recent stuff.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr/Const:<br>\n<br>\n-Votes lapsa and claims he's a partner with triv in #63, expands on that in #124.<br>\n-Pushes a lapsa/perf team in #328. Quite strangely, Garmr suggests that Lapsa and perf's thoughts are so similar that it looks like they're in a neighborhood together. Obviously this was before N1 so Perf had not yet neighborized Lapsa, but this...merits some thought.<br>\n-Includes Lapsa as a list of players he'd like to lynch in #410.<br>\n-Continues to push the lapsa/performer thing in #466 and #637.<br>\n-Gets all pissy about Lapsa \"dodging questions\" beginning in #650.<br>\n-Begins D2 with a naked vote on Lapsa in #689.<br>\n-Tries to get makara to help him lynch Lapsa in #692.<br>\n-In #694, tries to imply that Aristophanes is also a partner with Lapsa, I think?<br>\n-Pretty much continues to try to lynch Lapsa until he replaces out.<br>\n-Constantine doesn't say anything substantial about Lapsa until his 11th post, made near deadline D2, in which he vows to push Lapsa the next day.<br>\n-Says in #1160 that Lapsa and Perf are \"probably scum together.\" So basically he's just picking up Garmr's torch and running with it.<br>\n-Votes Lapsa in #1364.<br>\n-Says in #1371 that he pushed a case on gim and lapsa being scum together.....? Did he mean Performer and Lapsa?<br>\n-In #1372, thinks he's been lynched and calls for town to lynch Lapsa next.<br>\n-Switches to Gim in #1373 upon finding out he wasn't lynched, says he was thinking about switching to Gim anyway.<br>\n-The infamous #1398, where Const is the first person to doubt Lapsa's neighborizer claim and basically says that performer said something he didn't say.<br>\n-And again, don't need a refresher on the most recent stuff so I'm skipping it.<br>\n<br>\nSo after this I just feel like Constantine needs rope so hard. Garmr posted something about Perf and Lapsa looking like they were in a neighborhood D1, and then Perf turned out to be a neighborizer and he neighborized Lapsa N1. The prior knowledge theory is further supported by Constantine's immediate assumption that Lapsa was lying about his claim. Then the fact that Constantine came into the game and quickly started pushing a Lapsa/perf team just like his predecessor also rings suspicious (theory: scumConst came in and read the scumchat thread and saw something from Garmr saying \"imma push a perf/lapsa team the whole game\" and everybody else going \"genius!\" and so Const just keeps doing it when he replaces in).<br>\n<br>\nWhether Constantine would be partners with Lapsa or Performer gets a little more tricky. Garmr bringing up the neighborhood D1 implies that he knew of the neighborizer before anybody was neighborized, which points to Perf. The strong, constant, replacement-spanning fighting between the Garmr slot and Lapsa means basically that if those slots were buddies they agreed to bus each other and never let go early in the game. The consistency of that trend actually makes me believe it a little.<br>\n<br>\nEither way Constantine looks suspicious af.", "time": "Wed Nov 25, 2015 6:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=1575", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

By 'also' I mean that Constantine seems to be townreading Aris here even if he isn't directly saying it.<br>\n<br>\nStill I thought about it a bit and I can see Constantine's perspective on the performer thing.  Performer's post, in hindsight, does look an awful lot like he was saying that lapsa was lying.

That in itself is weird but I don't think Constantine is the world's most team oriented player.  Meh.  Writing it out like that, I do have to agree that its suspicious.  Lapsa and Constantine are suspicious after recent posts.  One of them is looking likely after this whole ordeal though and I'm still more inclined to vote Lapsa of the 2 since I had reason to think that Garmr was town at the end of D1.

{"number": 1619, "id": "7424588", "user": "AngryPidgeon", "user_id": "19184", "content": "When I first read the Gimlear post about 4-5 scum I thought that looked ridiculous and possibly fabricated, but I'm actually inclined to think the opposite after reflecting on it.  I think someone trying to fake towncred would not be so far off base or would just ask without providing numbers; I kind of like the (slight) proactive suggestion of 4-5 there.  It looks more like he genuinely doesn't know I think.  The handling of the Constantine drama is fairly consistent and makes a lot of sense to me as well.<br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to agree that one scum in Lapsa/Constantine seems probable.  Lapsa trying to disprove/rule-out that he could be on a team with Constantine makes me inclined to think they are not on a team.  Especially given Constantine's attempt to doubledown on the Lapsa scumread and threaten to replace out should Lapsa not be lynched.  I'm not really seeing scum/scum here..its just a bit too much?  Basically Constantine's arguments have a ring to them like he does believe them.  While that doesn't make him town, it does mean that hes not likely scum with Lapsa.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy and Tool..If Zulfy is scum then the only partner I'd really buy right now is Aristophanes.  My previous paranoia about Zulfy maybe bussing Tool randomly really seems exceedingly unlikely on review.  There is just no reason to do that at all.  The one thing thats got me a little concerned about Zulfy is that he led the Keyser push and wasn't getting any support for it.  Then Keyser dies the next night.  Could kind of see him deciding that lynching Keyser was not possible and just killing him, but I can see a couple reasons for the Keyser kill and that doesn't mean a huge amount on its own.<br>\n<br>\nTool placed vote number 3 on Aristophanes and then later commented he was suspicious about how the pressure on Aristophanes dropped off.  While I agree with the vote and that suspicion, I realize that the vote came after Aris got 2 votes rather quickly and hes currently in favor of lynching one or both of Lapsa/Constantine which ironically contributes to Aris not really getting much attention.  SHRUG??  I don't think Tool is scum with Lapsa, Zulfy, or Constantine.  I'd buy Aris or mayyyybe Gimlear but I'm leaning town on Gimlear and also Tool.<br>\n<br>\nBasically I could see Aris + pretty much anyone being a buddy given Aris's dropping off the radar.  No one really has any interactions there that spring to mind as interesting except Aris telling Garmr to hammer GrayFoxx which my gut is inclined to think is not likely to be an instance of coaching.<br>\n<br>\nI'm trying to sort possible scum pairings in order of likelihood.  I still think that Aris could be scum with almost anyone, with Aris+Constantine being fairly unlikely.  Aris/Lapsa makes rather a lot of sense given the timing of the neighborizer thing and the Aris wagon.<br>\n<br>\nConstantine/Lapsa does not seem likely to me and neither does Constantine/Aris.  If Constantine flips scum then I'll probably end up being rather concerned about Tool as I can't really think of any other likely budy.  Gimlear was on Constantine fairly early Today and for Gimlear/Constantine to be a team, then Gimlear certainly avoided going after low hanging fruit in other places Today which is a pretty hard bus to be pulling.<br>\n<br>\nLapsa..makes sense with Aristophanes and possibly Gimlear.

{"number": 1659, "id": "7430588", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "Finally got moved into our new place.<br>\n<br>\nI do think Lapsa and Aris are likely scum. Like if they aren&#8217;t partners I&#8217;m pretty sure one of them is scum. There are some alternate explanations for why scumLapsa would gambit like that that don&#8217;t involve Aris (just trying to confuse and distract town, for instance, or for towncred).<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that makes me think Lapsa is scum aside from the fakeclaim itself is this disagreement between him and perf about what was said in the neighborhood thread. Performer says that he told Lapsa not to fakeclaim and Lapsa insisted on doing it anyway. Lapsa says that Performer told him not to fakeclaim and Lapsa agreed not to do it, then later changed his mind.<br>\n<br>\nThese are not opinions, these are facts that can be proven or disproven. So why would two players, who both have access to the thread that can prove or disprove a version of events, have two different versions of the same event? My thought is that Lapsa needs town to believe his narrative in order to support his justification for fakeclaiming: he first agreed, which clears the way for him to later change his mind because &#8220;town was pulling apart.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, that explanation doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense. Lapsa thought fakeclaiming would help town work together and get a better idea of where scum are? No. In theory there&#8217;s no reason to think that muddying up the waters makes them clearer. In reality, the fakeclaim led to a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\n(need to re-read gim's reasoning for Lapsa being town)<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m feeling like AP is town. He&#8217;s claimed VT, and I went back and found some posts that fit in with that. In #554 (D1), he says &#8220;If I had a role worthy of CCing a cop, I would have done it in this post.&#8221; In #1489 (D3), he says &#8220;I doubt there are any other PRs out there at all.&#8221; That was before AP claimed vanilla. Those posts together just read like AP looking at the game through a VT&#8217;s eyes. He certainly didn&#8217;t leave a back door open to fakeclaim a PR later. In fact, the whole push for a massclaim reads as something a vanilla would do. So it fits with his claim. Unless scumAP decided really early in the game that he wasn&#8217;t going to claim a PR, which I feel like isn&#8217;t the greatest move for scum to make. There&#8217;s also the mounting number of times AP has defended people who turned out to be town and the time that he was one of the first votes on a scumwagon. Especially if one of Lapsa or Aris flips scum I think we can rule out AP.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy I have my doubts about but am leaning town. The associatives with the mak/sky slot made me feel like Zulfy was probtown but AP pointed out Zulfy&#8217;s switch to absolute confidence that sky would flip scum pre-fakeclaim. That does make me hesitate a little bit. His voting record is also not the greatest, though I don&#8217;t think voting record can be used reliably in this game with the number of wagons on town we&#8217;ve had that so many people have participated in. I pointed out before that Zulfy has had some posts that look like towny paranoia and that still rings true. If we get a scumflip in Aris or Lapsa, associatives might help read Zulfy better. But I&#8217;m leaning town on him.<br>\n<br>\nNo way JJD is scum, for reasons I&#8217;ve already laid out.<br>\n<br>\nSo that leaves Gim, Lapsa and Aris. If two scum are in that pool it means we have a 67% chance of hitting scum if we were to lynch randomly. And Lapsa/Aris as a partnership makes sense.<br>\n<br>\nSo there&#8217;s the question of who to lynch first between Lapsa and Aris. I&#8217;m thinking Aris, and the reason is basically one that AP already point out: Aris could be scum with anyone. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s technically true, but for instance, what if Zulfy was pushing a case on me to distract town from lynching his partner Aris? I feel like the Lapsa partner explanation makes more sense, but the possibility of that is enough to make me want to lynch Aris first as the common partner.", "time": "Sun Nov 29, 2015 3:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

I'm reading a book right now called \"User Story Mapping\".  Its basically about how to communicate as a team effectively in order to write software.  That may seem mostly unrelated, but one of the key points in the book is that \"shared documents does not mean shared understanding\".  Basically people misunderstand each other regularly; even when reading the same material they may interpret it in different ways.  So while that may only seem peripherally related to the the Neighborhood discussion here, this is basically how I feel about it: That different narratives of what happened in the neighborhood is really not that alarming.  That said I'm still suspicious of Lapsa.  I'm especially curious about Performer allegedly changing his read on Lapsa up (or perhaps he just excluded it because he was talking TO Lapsa?).<br>\n<br>\nPoE makes sense to me there.  Gimlear pushed Constantine hard yesterday and I'm a little surprised that he isn't rethinking his read on Lapsa given the Constantine flip.  He did acknowledge his Lapsa read though.  I could see Gimlear/Lapsa being plausible given what happened yesterday.  Also Performer was a confirmed PR, but one with no more use to town.  He may have been killed just for being townread by most, but his primary suspect was Lapsa and the two other people on the Lapsa wagon are now gone.  Not sure if I want to revive the Aris wagon or push for Lapsa whom Performer and Constantine were keen to lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7430625#p7430625\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7430625#p7430625\" data-post-id=\"7430625\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1662</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24613\">Lapsa</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: toolenduso</span></div></blockquote><br>\nWhy?", "time": "Sun Nov 29, 2015 5:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}

It works out like this:<br>\n<br>\n-Zulfy is almost certainly not lying and is probably the night kill tonight. He kinda crumbed, it makes very little sense for a scumZulfy to fakeclaim right now, the setup spec he did kinda makes sense and it explains a lot of his actions.<br>\n-AP has claimed VT, so him performing a night action <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">as town</div> can't be the reason the motion detector was tripped last night.<br>\n-It would be crazy as shit for town to have any more PRs (besides, we've massclaimed and nobody else has claimed a PR), so that can't be the reason the motion detector was tripped.<br>\n-AP claimed yesterday. So if he's town, there would be no reason for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">most</div> scum PRs to target him.

But the result could have been nothing because they were a rolecop (for instance, what if makara investigated Keyser N1 and that's the reason Zulfy's detector was tripped that night?).<br>\n<br>\nIf scum was under the impression that town had no power roles left save for Perf, whose one shot had already been used up, then a scumwatcher's target last night would probably be \"idk just choose somebody, you probably won't get a result anyway.\" But if they had reason to suspect that somebody else was a PR, for instance if gim is town and scum fell for his attempt to hint that he was a PR, then a scumwatcher would want to target whoever they suspected that that PR would want to target.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, at this part of the hypothetical scenario we're making so many assumptions that continuing to theorize won't be very useful. Just wanted to follow the thought to its conclusion.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nGiven the amount of power town has, I think it's a given that scum has to have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">something</div> besides an odd-night rolecop. Whether a watcher or voyeur-type role is likely is something we could debate, but I don't know how we could distinguish between the likelihood of scum having some PR with scum having one of those specific PRs.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So to recap, the way I see it is that either AP is scum or scum has a watcher/voyeur-type role.</div><br>\n<br>\nIf AP is scum I am going to buy him a freaking drink or something the next time I see him because <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">bravo</div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Lynching order</div></div><br>\n<br>\nI'd like to point out that Aris's approach to Zulfy's claim kinda looks bad regardless of AP's alignment because Aris immediately latched onto Zulfy's claim with no questioning and voted AP.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: side note</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I am aware that JarJar did the same thing, but JarJar's associatives with mak/sky and his overall play make him very unlikely scum imo.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSo if AP is scum, Aris's immediate vote looks like bussing. If AP is town, it looks like Aris taking advantage of an easy mislynch in the face of town wanting to lynch Aris.<br>\n<br>\nThe second one is actually less convincing to me than the first because I would think scum might temper their enthusiasm a bit for a wagon they know is on town. But still a likely scenario imo.<br>\n<br>\nIs it a better idea to lynch Aris before AP? I honestly don't know. I want to consider that some.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">AP's response to Zulfy's claim</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAP's response to all of this was to assert that Zulfy is lying and vote him. This actually looks pretty bad for AP imo. First, he says that follower, cop and neighborizer is a fair amount of power for town to have, but then says later that it doesn't make sense for scum to have another PR. Those two ideas conflict with each other -- if town has a lot of power, it would make sense for the mod to balance that out by giving scum power.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, he doesn't consider the circumstances surrounding Zulfy's claim, like the fact that fakeclaiming scum would have to expect they would be lynched the next day when AP flipped town.<br>\n<br>\nWhat this looks like to me is scumAP in a corner and searching for a way out. He sees the possible explanation of scum targeting him at night and tripping Zulfy's motion sensor, but for some reason doesn't point to that as the likely explanation for Zulfy's result.<br>\n<br>\nWhy? My theory is that AP is trying to hide his knowledge about his own team's PRs/not give any info to town on what scum might have. That explains his assertion that scum having a second PR is unlikely despite the amount of power town has.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Final thoughts</div></div><br>\n<br>\nSo there is a possibility that Zulfy is telling the truth and AP is still town, but I don't think we can really guess at the likelihood of that scenario without more information. AP's response makes me think it's more likely that he's just scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd while Aris does look bad, and has for a while, part of my read on him is based on AP. If we lynch AP and he flips town then imo Aris might actually look a little less like scum, and maybe we lynch somebody else instead.<br>\n<br>\nSo I do support an AP lynch.

He told us he was scumreading makara but never pursued his lynch.<br>\n<br>\nHe also told us he was scumreading AP and then never really did anything there either.  In fact, after Zulfy caught AP, Lapsa barely acknowledged it and then finally voted him after I already posted my intent to hammer.<br>\n<br>\nBut the main reason to vote for Lapsa is because I believe I'm practically confirmed town for the following reasons:<br>\n<br>\n- I was a huge part of getting makara lynched.  That lynch seemed very unlikely to happen.  It pretty much stalled and I reignited the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n- I've been very open w/ my reads all game.  The one bad thing that can be said about me is that I was townreading AP most of the game.  Nothing I can say there except that he had me fooled.  But @ least I was clear about townreading him unlike Lapsa who almost never commited to reads for p much the whole game.<br>\n<br>\n- Everyone in the town has townread me all game.  Now that might not mean all that much cause it's possible that I just had people fooled.

So when JJD argues that Lapsa wasn't putting effort into defending Triv, that view is based on posts that look like every other post Lapsa has made in this game -- short and vague. And when he offers further evidence in the fact that Lapsa moved Triv from town to null, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">it implies that Lapsa actually thought that small action would add pressure to Triv...which doesn't seem likely to me</div>. Lapsa still never voted Triv and didn't seem like he would have iirc.<br>\n<br>\nSo what <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> we have in the way of reading Lapsa? We have his votes, and we have a steady stream of posts where he pushes and prods various people in one way or another -- what I believe to be his brand of scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nHis votes are all over the place and clearly do not follow momentum with the exception of the BMR wagon (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">note to self: should we get a scumflip on either of those slots, that should very much be considered</div>.) I tend to think that that's more likely to come from town, but...it's not the most convincing thing ever.<br>\n<br>\nSince I'm on a bit of a meta streak I'll do a little work with Lapsa's meta too. Let's see what we can find.<br>\n<br>\n-Mini 1636: Lapsa was VT (pretty sure vanilla anyway). Votes were all over the place, posting style was similar to this game.<br>\n-Newbie 1548: Lapsa was town tracker. Vote hopped a little but kept it on Thor most of the day. Longer posts in a back-and-forth with Thor, but Thor tends to spur on that kind of thing and Lapsa's replies were still short quips, just several short quips packed into one post.<br>\n-Mewbie 1538: Lapsa was VT and replaced in in post #143. So he only was in the game for like four days before D1 ended, and he only had one vote.<br>\n-Mini 1652: Lapsa was town vig. He vote hops pretty much the same way he did in this game. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>\n-Mini 1666: Lapsa was VT. Vote hopped a fair amount. Lol like every time Lapsa is in a game with VDA he votes him. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>\n-Mini 1687: Lapsa was VT (I was in this one with him). Vote hopped a bit but parked on Thor and Math/Pers for a while. Posting style was similar to this game.<br>\n-NY 188: Lapsa was werewolf gunsmith (it was multiball). Vote hopped quite a bit, including one on his partner so let's remember that should we get a scumflip from Lapsa this game. The posting style is similar to this game in that it's mostly short quips and he posts a lot of silly gifs/youtube music, but...it kinda feels a little different. His sentences are more complete, more well-structured. He seems to explain things a little bit more.<br>\n<br>\nLong and short of it -- Lapsa always posts like this and always vote hops. The one scum game I could find provides a minor reason to townread him IMO just because of the differences in posting style.<br>\n<br>\nI'm eliminating him from my lynch pool today.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nbolded part is interesting. tool is right - didn't try to actually pressure triv.<br>\nit's just that read became weaker<br>\n<br>\nlol about VDA. i have issues with that guy. he's really sly hence i try to sort him out asap.<br>\nthat game i learned that one shouldn't carelessly push - he turned out to be cop (and replaced out)<br>\n<br>\nabout mini 1687 - i didn't park on Thor. i'm actually bit embarased about how he used me.<br>\nat least i was right about him at the end of the game<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7373794#p7373794\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7373794#p7373794\" data-post-id=\"7373794\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 986</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19184\">AngryPidgeon</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7372103#p7372103\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7372103#p7372103\" data-post-id=\"7372103\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 965</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24830\">St Constantine the Hermit</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Makara</span><br>\n<br>\nGod it feels good to do that</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7372113#p7372113\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7372113#p7372113\" data-post-id=\"7372113\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 967</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24830\">St Constantine the Hermit</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Makara</span><br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nUhhhh.

Didn't feel overly self-conscious which is generally a scum-tell. I'm pretty sure Keyser is town. <br>\ntoolenduso - Good and sensible reasoning, overall I feel that most of his posts are town-motivated. He is one of the most active participants in scumhunting which earns him a townread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Town Leans</div><br>\nZulfy - I agree with his logic and thought process. He explains well and is also good with questioning. Overall feels town motivated to me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFF00\">Null Reads</div><br>\nAristophanes - I'm really having difficulty getting any reads on Aristophanes right now. It's getting late, I'll probably do an Aris-focused reread tomorrow and draw conclusions from there but for now I'm listing him as null.<br>\nGrayfoxx - Really hasn't posted much. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7302908#p7302908\">141</a> was basically a sheep, and then his last two posts treat Trivium's lynch as a foregone conclusion. Not sure what to make of it.<br>\nLapsa - I like some of his insight on the game but I'm not sure what is going on with his voting. If it's because of my lack of content, I am working on that.<br>\nGarmr - Push on Trivium seems town-motivated. Can you pls explain <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7302953#p7302953\">143</a>?

There's not much else I've found notable from him but overall I want an explanation other than \"reread it\". PEDIT: he has kinda responded to this already but his response doesn't get at my question - how does the fact that a position is popular somehow not make it bad?<br>\nGimlear - Originally had him listed as null but after reading through ISO again I'm starting to get suspicious. He places an RVS vote, asks Keyser two questions and then disappears. When he gets back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7303194#p7303194\">155</a> it felt like he was going along with the popular opinion in the town. Since then there hasn't been much of note to me.<br>\nPerformer - Really not much real content either. I tend to scumread people who jump on popular wagons without really showing much independent though themselves, and Performer has done just this.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Scum Reads</div><br>\nBlueMoonRising - No content.

Like saying that signaling to town that we're out of RVS was a play to look like town. Doesn't make sense to me. And saying that Keyser not understanding that Lapsa was quoting the wiki was \"disingenuous.\" It seems much more likely to me, regardless of alignment, that Keyser just didn't know what Lapsa was posting. And there's not really a scum motivation for it, but Aris treats it as such. The reasoning just strikes me as the kind of thing scum would do when they know they're going after a wagon where the reasoning is already established but they don't want to look like they're just sheeping. So they heap on anything else they can find.<br>\n-Nothing else has really stood out to me as being alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nBlueMoonRising:<br>\n<br>\n-Not a whole lot yet, but for some reason I get a gut townvibe from his posts so far. Just the vote on Lapsa, the curtness, the (probable) wait-and-see approach...all things I feel like I see from town in early game. Not terribly strong, I'd call it a weak townlean and want to come back later. This is the kind of slot where other factors are better for reading the slot (not going to expand on that right now because if this slot is scum I don't want to give any ideas on what I'm looking for).<br>\n-EDIT AFTER INITIAL ENTRY: And then he goes and posts #210, in which he is directing play. There are a lot of scummy possibilities for this post, including coaching buddies, preemptively distancing himself from a mislynch and subtly trying to project an image of ignorance. The last sentence in particular bugs me because it seems like an afterthought; \"Oh by the way I don't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> know whether he's town.\"<br>\n<br>\nGarmr:<br>\n<br>\n-I get a minor townvibe from #70 given the way Garmr describes his RVS-stage attitude in #124. It just seems like Garmr trying to get things moving a little bit but he doesn't have a lot to go on. At the same time it's a very shallow push. Which basically means that Garmr isn't trying that hard to get things moving, and that can be antithetical to some scum's early-game mentality: to try to appear super towny.<br>\n-That being said, I was totally fooled by scumGarmr the last time I played with him so I don't know if I'll ever feel very comfortable townreading him this game.<br>\n-The push on Trivium (who is my top townread atm) gives me bad feelings, but at the same time it is literally impossible that the entire wagon is driven by scum so there must be some town out there who are on the wagon and just are not seeing what I'm seeing. I kind of knew that would happen because the post that made me townread triv the most is one that appears town to me because I know that I'm town.<br>\n-So basically my read on Garmr is somewhere between null and null-town, with a general wariness attached.<br>\n<br>\nGimlear:<br>\n<br>\n-The questioning of Keyser (which may have actually sparked the early wagon on him), denouncing of the push on Keyser and subsequent L-1'ing of Trivium could come from either alignment. But if it does come from scum, it means Gimlear is a competent and thoughtful scum player. Which is just something I want to take note of for future assessment of the slot.<br>\n-That being said, the arc and posting style does feel genuine to me. So not interested in chasing Gimlear right now.<br>\n<br>\nGrayfoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:<br>\n<br>\n-Slight scumlean mostly just for #138. Looks like scum hesitation to appear too scummy while still wanting to hop on a juicy wagon. Other than that not much to go on. This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br>\n<br>\nJJD:<br>\n<br>\n-JJD was the first, I believe, to jump on the Keyser thing. So while I do think it was low-hanging fruit for scum, I think you kind of have to give the benefit of the doubt to the first person to jump on the first wagon. That's just getting town out of RVS, which is something any alignment would do.<br>\n-The pushing on Keyser kinda strikes me as coming from town. Just seems like a natural path for town to go: sees something easy to talk about -&gt; votes to get town out of RVS -&gt; continues questioning player -&gt; responses don't make much sense, and you're already voting them, so you continue to argue.<br>\n-Begins assessing how other players have interacted with the wagon in #153, which supports the get-town-out-of-RVS theory for his push on Keyser.<br>\n-Yeah I just see a lot of questioning and trying to move the game forward. Reads like town. Not that scum can't fake it, but this early in the game it feels towny to me.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>\n-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>\n-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>\n-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLapsa:<br>\n<br>\n-There are really only two things in Lapsa's ISO that I see to look at: his vote/unvote on Trivium and his vote on makara. The vote on Trivium put Triv at L-2, and then he unvoted after Gray put Triv at L-1 (and also after I suggested that we shouldn't lynch Triv). I can see scum motivation behind it, but the town explanation seems a bit more plausible to me (that Lapsa wanted to let more happen in D1/didn't feel that strongly about Triv being scum.) It also kind of seems antithetical to a scum mindset just because why would he want to work against a mislynch? (this is assuming the point of view of scumLapsa/townTriv)<br>\n-The makara vote supports the explanation of Lapsa wanting more things to happen in D1 as well. Makara has probably posted the least out of all the players just because of the V/LA, and while Lapsa's vote didn't come with an explanation, I read it with an implication that Lapsa is trying to get makara to do more.<br>\n-Not sure what to make of Lapsa voting for BMR and makara in the same post. Maybe that's like a weird form of FoS?<br>\n<br>\nmakara:<br>\n<br>\n-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer:<br>\n<br>\n-Early-game enthusiasm could just be the excitement of a player who hasn't played much or a scum player hoping to come across as friendly/towny/fun. Not really sure which direction to go.<br>\n-Parts of #73 strike me as being pretty shallow, like the chiming in on the Keyser stuff. Which pings as scummy. He does say a couple ISO posts later that he doesn't want to lynch Keyser, but that's after I start arguing for Keyser being town.<br>\n-Jumps on the Triv wagon later (Perf says it's L-1 but for some reason I feel like he was mistaken), which is sketchy but not more sketchy than some of the other people on the wagon IMO.<br>\n-So yeah a scumlean here.<br>\n<br>\nTrivium:<br>\n<br>\n-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>\n-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy:<br>\n<br>\n-Not really sure what to make of the early-game pre-flip association stuff. I guess I could see him using it as town as just a thought organizer, but then scum can use those techniques as a means to force their reads into a more genuine-looking perspective. So. Null I guess.<br>\n-His positioning on the Trivium wagon is prime scum real estate. The positioning is honestly the thing that made me raise an eyebrow when he made the vote. His reasoning, which goes above some other peoples' reasons for voting Triv, are actually not all that bad.<br>\n-Not a big fan of #191. It's like he's giving himself an out in case he wants to bail from the Trivium wagon.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueMoonRising</span><br>\n<br>\nI think this is a good place to be right now.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^ i think that's what triggered makara bus on bmr<br>\n<br>\nanother thing to note:<br>\ni jumpvoted bmr-&gt;makara BEFORE tool gave his reads while makara did so afterwards", "time": "Sun Dec 13, 2015 5:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63716&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "63716"}
