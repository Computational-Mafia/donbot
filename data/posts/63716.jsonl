Some mods require you to unvote before changing your vote; I do not.<br>6. A lynch requires a majority (over 50%) vote.<br>7. You may also vote for no lynch to happen on that day by typing Vote: No lynch. A no-lynch only requires a 50% vote to go through.<br>8. Each day will have a 2-week deadline.

If you are going away, or if you have limited access to the site, notify me by pm or in-topic so that I know not to prod or replace you. If you're going to be V/LA over the night phase and have a night action, you may send in your action early.

Like saying that signaling to town that we're out of RVS was a play to look like town. Doesn't make sense to me. And saying that Keyser not understanding that Lapsa was quoting the wiki was \"disingenuous.\" It seems much more likely to me, regardless of alignment, that Keyser just didn't know what Lapsa was posting. And there's not really a scum motivation for it, but Aris treats it as such. The reasoning just strikes me as the kind of thing scum would do when they know they're going after a wagon where the reasoning is already established but they don't want to look like they're just sheeping. So they heap on anything else they can find.<br>-Nothing else has really stood out to me as being alignment indicative.<br><br>BlueMoonRising:<br><br>-Not a whole lot yet, but for some reason I get a gut townvibe from his posts so far. Just the vote on Lapsa, the curtness, the (probable) wait-and-see approach...all things I feel like I see from town in early game. Not terribly strong, I'd call it a weak townlean and want to come back later. This is the kind of slot where other factors are better for reading the slot (not going to expand on that right now because if this slot is scum I don't want to give any ideas on what I'm looking for).<br>-EDIT AFTER INITIAL ENTRY: And then he goes and posts #210, in which he is directing play. There are a lot of scummy possibilities for this post, including coaching buddies, preemptively distancing himself from a mislynch and subtly trying to project an image of ignorance. The last sentence in particular bugs me because it seems like an afterthought; \"Oh by the way I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> know whether he's town.\"<br><br>Garmr:<br><br>-I get a minor townvibe from #70 given the way Garmr describes his RVS-stage attitude in #124. It just seems like Garmr trying to get things moving a little bit but he doesn't have a lot to go on. At the same time it's a very shallow push. Which basically means that Garmr isn't trying that hard to get things moving, and that can be antithetical to some scum's early-game mentality: to try to appear super towny.<br>-That being said, I was totally fooled by scumGarmr the last time I played with him so I don't know if I'll ever feel very comfortable townreading him this game.<br>-The push on Trivium (who is my top townread atm) gives me bad feelings, but at the same time it is literally impossible that the entire wagon is driven by scum so there must be some town out there who are on the wagon and just are not seeing what I'm seeing. I kind of knew that would happen because the post that made me townread triv the most is one that appears town to me because I know that I'm town.<br>-So basically my read on Garmr is somewhere between null and null-town, with a general wariness attached.<br><br>Gimlear:<br><br>-The questioning of Keyser (which may have actually sparked the early wagon on him), denouncing of the push on Keyser and subsequent L-1'ing of Trivium could come from either alignment. But if it does come from scum, it means Gimlear is a competent and thoughtful scum player. Which is just something I want to take note of for future assessment of the slot.<br>-That being said, the arc and posting style does feel genuine to me. So not interested in chasing Gimlear right now.<br><br>Grayfoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:<br><br>-Slight scumlean mostly just for #138. Looks like scum hesitation to appear too scummy while still wanting to hop on a juicy wagon. Other than that not much to go on. This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br><br>JJD:<br><br>-JJD was the first, I believe, to jump on the Keyser thing. So while I do think it was low-hanging fruit for scum, I think you kind of have to give the benefit of the doubt to the first person to jump on the first wagon. That's just getting town out of RVS, which is something any alignment would do.<br>-The pushing on Keyser kinda strikes me as coming from town. Just seems like a natural path for town to go: sees something easy to talk about -&gt; votes to get town out of RVS -&gt; continues questioning player -&gt; responses don't make much sense, and you're already voting them, so you continue to argue.<br>-Begins assessing how other players have interacted with the wagon in #153, which supports the get-town-out-of-RVS theory for his push on Keyser.<br>-Yeah I just see a lot of questioning and trying to move the game forward. Reads like town. Not that scum can't fake it, but this early in the game it feels towny to me.<br><br>Keyser:<br><br>-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br><br><br>Lapsa:<br><br>-There are really only two things in Lapsa's ISO that I see to look at: his vote/unvote on Trivium and his vote on makara. The vote on Trivium put Triv at L-2, and then he unvoted after Gray put Triv at L-1 (and also after I suggested that we shouldn't lynch Triv). I can see scum motivation behind it, but the town explanation seems a bit more plausible to me (that Lapsa wanted to let more happen in D1/didn't feel that strongly about Triv being scum.) It also kind of seems antithetical to a scum mindset just because why would he want to work against a mislynch? (this is assuming the point of view of scumLapsa/townTriv)<br>-The makara vote supports the explanation of Lapsa wanting more things to happen in D1 as well. Makara has probably posted the least out of all the players just because of the V/LA, and while Lapsa's vote didn't come with an explanation, I read it with an implication that Lapsa is trying to get makara to do more.<br>-Not sure what to make of Lapsa voting for BMR and makara in the same post. Maybe that's like a weird form of FoS?<br><br>makara:<br><br>-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br><br>Performer:<br><br>-Early-game enthusiasm could just be the excitement of a player who hasn't played much or a scum player hoping to come across as friendly/towny/fun. Not really sure which direction to go.<br>-Parts of #73 strike me as being pretty shallow, like the chiming in on the Keyser stuff. Which pings as scummy. He does say a couple ISO posts later that he doesn't want to lynch Keyser, but that's after I start arguing for Keyser being town.<br>-Jumps on the Triv wagon later (Perf says it's L-1 but for some reason I feel like he was mistaken), which is sketchy but not more sketchy than some of the other people on the wagon IMO.<br>-So yeah a scumlean here.<br><br>Trivium:<br><br>-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br><br>Zulfy:<br><br>-Not really sure what to make of the early-game pre-flip association stuff. I guess I could see him using it as town as just a thought organizer, but then scum can use those techniques as a means to force their reads into a more genuine-looking perspective. So. Null I guess.<br>-His positioning on the Trivium wagon is prime scum real estate. The positioning is honestly the thing that made me raise an eyebrow when he made the vote. His reasoning, which goes above some other peoples' reasons for voting Triv, are actually not all that bad.<br>-Not a big fan of #191. It's like he's giving himself an out in case he wants to bail from the Trivium wagon.</div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueMoonRising</span><br><br>I think this is a good place to be right now."}

I basically feel like the only way to prevent myself from being lynched i say claiming that I am inexperienced, but that seems like its not completely the case. I have played a few games already, and learned quite a lot from them. I just don't instinctively get how not to look scummy. Its like a paradox, look at it from my point of view- I am constantly trying to scumhunt, but my inherent, instinctual response to everything is a want to keep myself alive. So even if I ever were to catch scum, of course it would be incredibly easy for them to turn it around on me. And so if I want to survive, it only makes me more scummy. If I act like I don't care about staying alive anymore, I look scummy. If I ignore the wagon ad just focus on more scumhunting (or my attempt at it) I would look like I was trying to detract attention from myself, and I would look scummy. And even after this look at my possible actions, you can see how my brain prioritizes my survival, and so by posting this message, I look scummy. So I've had an idea. I will start asking other people some questions, and it will make me look scummy. Scum will probably point that out. but here goes- the main things I still want to know and are probably already here, posted somewhere I skimmed over-<br>1. Tool, why are you defending people so much?<br>2.  Grayfoxx- Why do you want my read on you (null, but slightly scummy because you haven't contributed much)? I understand that if I were to flip scum that read would be seen as manipulative or whatever, but how does that help town? And how would my read on you if I were town help town? There is no way for you to find out whether someone else is mafia or not from my opinion of you, so why even want to know?<br>3. Bluemoon- If soeone hammers before the day is used up, why would that make them scummy if I were scum. (post 210)<br>I will try to find more. I especially want Grayfoxx's answer to number 2, even if I'm just being blind, I will have probably learned something if my implied point is wrong."}

There's not much else I've found notable from him but overall I want an explanation other than \"reread it\".

Though there wasn't really a very good answer he could have given.<br><br>First off, I think asking for a self read is more often scummy than than not.  It reeks of caring too much about how you appear.<br><br>But in this situation I find it way scummier because of the reason he gave.  Like if he said he was scumhunting and wanted to use trivs read to get a better read I'd say it was a bad reason but I can see it being bad-town.<br><br>The reason he gave though doesn't sound like bad-town, it sounds like scum:  The reason you ask reads from someone before they flip is so if they flip green you can read them and know they're real honest reads to help w/ your own.   But for him to ask for a read on himself makes no sense because he doesn't need to know his own alignment.  He can only want that read out there so the TOWN can use that to help w/ reading HIM.  And again, Scum cares alot about how other people read them.<br><br>Furthermore, here was the entirety of what he posted before asking that question: <br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7297762#p7297762\" class=\"postlink\">post 12</a>, GrayFoxxxx wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: lapsa</span><br><br>LAPPSSAAAAAA</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7298397#p7298397\" class=\"postlink\">post 24</a>, GrayFoxxxx wrote:</cite>Bump</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7299626#p7299626\" class=\"postlink\">post 37</a>, GrayFoxxxx wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7299616#p7299616\" class=\"postlink\">post 36</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7299355#p7299355\" class=\"postlink\">post 35</a>, Lapsa wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7299310#p7299310\" class=\"postlink\">post 33</a>, Keyser S\u00f6ze wrote:</cite>Are you bored Lapsa?</div></blockquote><br><br>Did YOU really need to ask this question?</div></blockquote><br>Are you not entertained.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7302885#p7302885\" class=\"postlink\">post 138</a>, GrayFoxxxx wrote:</cite>I would also like to vote trivium, but I don't know the vote count.<br>It's too early to be troubled like this</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7302908#p7302908\" class=\"postlink\">post 141</a>, GrayFoxxxx wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: triv</span><br><br>I have parallel thinking with the people voting him.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>He couldn't really be expecting much of a read from triv"}

I do this when the votes are very split up between pages and we are far into a day. This is page 6. To go back and check is easy. This looks like scum hesitation to me. How were you \"troubled like this\"?? Was the lack of VC troubling? because the wagon is still small at this point and you should have been able to figure this out.<br>Greyfoxx: Finally votes, thanks to Gramr, and with such a good reason. So good. So Baaaaaaaaaaah!  This is very possibly scum.<br>Zulfy: Quotes me, twice. Points out a discrepancy in my Keyser read (though not really, as it was a progression within the same post, but I digress). Then votes Triv without mentioning him?? Weird. Maybe scum slipping a vote in slyly? I don't think so though. I'm not null on this post, I'm torn on it. No ranking available at this time.<br>Performer: Asks Triv in the post noted below to explain the buddying read between Tools and Keyser. Then brings him to L-1 in the next post?? I don't like this at all. I think the mention/pic of the honey means that he's blindly sheeping, which doesn't help him any at all.<br>Toolsend then mentions his townread on Triv and it makes sense.

But nobody should be townreading him right now.<br><br>And like, are people saying that if votes start piling up on Lapsa he'd just walk willingly into the noose regardless of alignment?  If so that's pretty shitty."}

I don't like his style of posting a big long catchup, posting a bit of fluff and then another big long catch up although I can be guilty of this sometimes. Ideally I would like steady contribution, but I know firsthand that sometimes that isn't possible. I think the content of his posts is good though and seems to spark discussion and have good insight. I will probably be able to get a much better read on him d2. I am also eagerly awaitng part two !"}

It's very odd that Blue's wagon grew like this because he lurked and flaked - the pattern from Blue was scummy, yes, but I've replaced into town role when the predecessor was scummy as hell, in past games.

It's confbias-y/reach-y, but I've found myself doing that as town before. I think this would come from eager town, which Aris certainly demonstrated with his first several posts that he was eager to start the game. So null on this I think. Want to try to look for more definitive things, as definitive as you can get in mafia anyway.<br>-#334 is a little suspicious to me though. He turns around on Keyser and says he thinks he was making something out of nothing, then starts looking on the Triv wagon for possible scum. Just seems like he was kind of following the way most people were going...<br>-The intent to hammer BMR in #409 also pings and fits in with the \"going with the flow\" hypothesis. It's definitely a hesitant post which fits in with expected scum approach to a mislynch, but obviously that only works if the BMR slot is in fact town.<br>-Yeah pretty wishy washy on this slot. I guess I would lean scum, the intent to hammer being the biggest thing. Looking at overall support for wagons might help my read here.<br><br>BMR/AP:<br><br>-Didn't really notice #83 before, in which he forgoes the Keyser wagon for Lapsa. Also kind of easy to pursue as scum, but Lapsa tends to attract suspicion from town as well for his playstyle.<br>-Then goes after JJD in #120 as well, which is not an easy place to be as scum I think. The combo Lapsa and JJD votes slide a little more town to me.<br>-#210 still sucks but I at least see town motivation for the last sentence that I didn't consider before, which is basically just trying to manipulate people into not hammering.<br>-I don't know...there's clearly a trend of going against the grain with most of the posts that BMR had, skimpy as they were. Which, if scum, I would guess would be an attitude of not wanting to be associated with mislynches. Idk...reading this again makes me think a little more town. The whole thing about continuing to post elsewhere on site while avoiding this game and then replacing out is a red flag for me, but there are many reasons a person might replace out. For this I think the acceptable town answer would have to be that he just didn't feel like putting in the effort to claw his way out of L-1. He already wasn't putting a ton of effort into this game so that explanation could fit.<br>-AP's replacing in makes me paranoid af. I know he's a good scum player (certainly was in person, and I know that can be very different from the way people play online, but I feel like he has a reputation on-site as being really good as scum as well) and I definitely see scummy possibilities here. Like he comes in and immediately starts trying to get people to unvote him, both explicitly (asking JJD to defend his reasoning in #425) and implicitly (#429, where he does a big catch-up post; the antithesis of BMR's inactivity that was clearly driving suspicion on the slot). The thing is that town doesn't want to be mislynched either, I know that for sure and I mislynched Titus in my last towngame when she replaced into a slot that was under fire near deadline too. So.<br>-I guess more than anything it's that AP seemed to go through the first several pages of the game looking for somebody to vote for, saw Keyser and slapped his vote there. Kind of supports the notion that he was just trying to get people off his back.<br>-Quite antsy about this slot. Another thing I have to take into consideration is the way this wagon built up, it seemed to grow pretty quickly and I could easily see some of the votes coming from scum. Whereas if this wagon was on scum then how would scum have interacted with it? I don't see a whole lot of arms-length buddying-type activity going on here, with the possible exception of Garmr saying he would be interested in seeing how the slot would flip but then not really seeming to want to vote it.<br><br>Garmr:<br><br>-One of the first proponents of a Triv wagon (pretty sure anyway).<br>-I don't understand the whole \"Triv's lack of self-defense is scummy\" thing. One, he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> defending himself by the time Garmr posted #194. Two, why would scum <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> defend themselves?<br>-#301 is still weird, for reasons I've noted before. It's a reachy thing to suppose and I just don't see town pushing their scum buddy up to L-1 with the intention of making the wagon fall apart. Other reasons for pushing their buddy up to L-1, sure, but that? The logic is based on unrealistic assumptions, and while Garmr says later (#344) that he wasn't assuming this to be true, #301 is worded as an assumption: personally I think...\"<br>-The main thing here is just Garmr really wanting to lynch Triv, to the point of coming up with reach reasoning to do so. I feel like that ties him to BMR/AP because he kept trying to get people back to the Triv wagon while BMR was being run up and why wouldn't scum want to push that? Only other explanation I can think of in the scenario in which BMR/AP is town and Garmr is scum is where both Garmr's scumbuds were already on the BMR wagon.<br>-I could lynch Garmr.<br><br>Performer:<br><br>-Puts Triv at L-1 in #150, first time I believe. I actually vaguely recall Triv not actually being at L-1 at the time? But regardless, Perf believed that he was putting Triv at L-1 and that's what's important.<br>-Unvotes Triv in #224, at this point Triv was L-2 so I suppose the wagon might have already been showing signs of falling apart. I was defending Triv...as scum, Perf could have been looking for an out to hop off the wagon. OK so the unvote isn't necessarily towny.<br>-Hops on the BMR wagon.<br>-The reasoning posted for voting BMR makes me a little less suspicious of Perf now. Just looking over his ISO again it looks a little more like town trying to figure stuff out than scum with a plan or ulterior motive. The thing holding me back from a townread is the quickness with which his reads changed and the fact that they tended to change along with popular opinion.</div></div></div><br><br>tl;dr: Aris &amp; Perf <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_up.gif\" alt=\":up:\" title=\"Up Arrow\">, BMR/AP <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_right.gif\" alt=\":right:\" title=\"Right Arrow\">, Garmr <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_down.gif\" alt=\":down:\" title=\"Down Arrow\"><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Garmr</span>"}

Garmr's kneejerk reaction (which was to encourage more votes on trivium) looks like he really doesn't care too much in the case where he is scum and shoving the lynch on Trivium.

It occurs to me that you have been the one expressing a townread on Lapsa from the background perhaps.  Is that purely meta inspired or....am I totally mistaken about your Lapsa read?  I'm not really sure what you see here.  Your defense of Lapsa just reminds me that understanding things from his viewpoint is difficult because he isn't posting any indications of WHAT the train of thought behind the posts is.  I can only infer so much of someone's reads and intentions when its all minimalistic communication.  TL;DR: I'd love to read your dissertation on why lapsa is town here beyond \"He has used this playstyle as town before\""}

(I'd also disagree that JJD was objectively wrong at that point, but that doesn't matter since this is all analysis of people who aren't me)."}

Supplying the links to Keyser games is still the most standout indication of it, but providing information and not wielding it like a bat or otherwise trying to make a contriver point off of it is town-motivated.  The readslists and points made at various points are well-formed and combined with the effort that went into it all, I really think this is just an obviously town slot.  The defense of Trivium in particular seems fairly unlikely from scum, regardless of Triv's alignment.<br><br>I read your last bit about me and BMR.  I generally dislike meta, but if you've played with MonkeyMan before...this is basically just his MO.  Lurk a lot, push fairly superficial observations and get lots of flak for being judgmental about many things (like the hammer post).  You mentioned thinking I'm a good scum player and I will only add that I do take pride in my scumgames, perhaps more than most people.  I'm town in this game though and mentioning that I have a good scum game isn't going to get you closer to figuring that out.  The biggest feeling I absorbed from your last post is that you want to think I'm town but are having doubts and don't really want to commit to it.  Thats fine, I've been there at various points in my past.  You're gonna have to talk to me though; it feels like you are putting up a barrier preemptively to keep me at arm's length.  I'm not gonna figure out my own alignment for you, so lets talk?  I really really think you are town here and being pro-town so all the more reason to talk some things out.  Unfortunately this Day phase is mostly over, but if we are around Tomorrow I'd like to discuss some things about Performer, Lapsa, and Garmr for sure.<br><br>Jar Jar Drinks isn't quite the same level of town for me, but may as well be.  I'm seeing a lot of indications that his reads are updating organically and his suspicions all make a huge amount of sense if you look at it from his perspective.  The zulfy push that I mentioned about buddying him really stands out as a paranoia that Town is likely to exhibit but scum doesn't really gain too much from arguing.  The push on Keyser early on was very much progressing the game state and sticking his neck out.  Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7308526#p7308526\">248</a> really hit the nail on the head as I was reading through that part of the game about Gray who was previously kinda getting by.  The points on Lapsa are also pro-town points to be making.<br><br>---<br><br>Keyser is definitely someone I'm taking a bigger picture approach to reading and the more I read Keyser posts the more I think hes just town.  My gut was really torn at some of the early self-defending which felt a bit fake and I was concerned that some of the posting schtick was really a mask to distract from some scummy elements.  At this point, I'm convinced that Keyser is mostly carefree and just doing things how he wants with little regard for how his posts will come across, ironically the opposite of my prior opinion.  But frankly, just the tone of his posts would be really hard to fake.  The zeal, confidence and occasional cluelessness that gets meshed in when someone argues with him would be really tiring to do as scum and while I'm not really able to rule that out as a possibility, I think its less likely than him just being blatant town here.<br><br>Zulfy...nothing really specific about Zulfy that screams town to me; I just really like the air behind most of his posts.  Hes very analytical but also abridged which makes him easy to understand.  Low fluff to content which is refreshing at least if not towny.  I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7296346#p7296346\">80[/post and [post]122</a> in particular.  The only things making me a little concerned are that he was fairly aware of the tunnel on Trivium when called out on it.  The refusal to vote BMR felt a little white-knighty, but makes sense in the context of his push on Trivium at least.  Sooo I'm reasonably confident about Zulfy being town, but thats definitely a notch below my previous mentioned reads.<br><br>Trivium: This read got more town, the more I read.  I could pin down a couple things in particular but the self reflection after the meta of Keyser came out felt fairly genuine.  I'm largely drinking Tool's koolaid on this slot so rather than rehash that I'll just take a lazy approach and ....link <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7307463#p7307463\">216</a><br><br>Aristophanes: I really should have more to say about Aris right now but I'm getting lazier as I write this.  The post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7301248#p7301248\">100</a>? read really town to me.  For similar reasons that I thought Tool came off as town, the questioning of the meta links for Keyser aligned with some prodding I would have done around that time.  The post seemed very aware of what was going on and the careful  developing of the discussion without interjecting personal bias or leading questions looked like genuine scumhunting over fake scumhunting.  Aris on the last few pages has been more of a blur to me since it happened all at once and I read it all at once.  My main gripe with Aris is the Lapsa read which seems to be like Schrodinger's leopard.  Lapsa is town stop harassing him for the playstyle!; but lapsa is actually only null-town because he's...been protown?  Really want to discuss that further with him because I'm not sure why hes seeing Lapsa town and when it comes to interacting with people scumreading him, just makes melodramatic gestures in defense of Lapsa without really doing anything to dismantle the pressure.  But ya.  I generally like Aris's other content and I'm willing to call Aris probably town.<br><br>----<br><br>Bleh, I'm heading home so I'll be on in a couple hours to move my vote if needed.<br><br>Quick summary of everyone else<br><br>Makara/Lapsa: Kind of feel the same about both of these.  I've seen a couple things that I've liked, but Lapsa is coasting really hard on not explaining things and Makara had a post that I recall thinking looked hedgy.  Null and would really like to discuss these slots Tomorrow.<br><br>Gimlear: I don't really remember much of anything from Gimlear.  Quick skim of the ISO tells me that I should devote some time to thinking about this.  Null.<br><br>Garmr: Already talked about Garmr previously.  Thought his reaction to my entrance was off and the whole spiel about the Trivium wagon was definitely less-than-town imo.  I recall thinking that Garmr had some things that I liked so I'll likely go through some of his posts again when I have the time.  Leaning scum.<br><br>Performer: Stances have been expressed by other people for the most part.  The case on BMR and  Aristophanes rang bells and especially the Aris one looked like an attempt to open up a wagon there without sticking his neck out.  Still not totally sold on that, so null scum.<br><br>GrayFoxx: Probably scum?  Not sure why Gray managed to get by all Day with minimal amounts of scrutiny.  Unfortunately the V/La is alignment neutral.  I wouldn't really feel bad about lynching him anyways though because I think hes the scummiest person in the game and he had his chance to post content.  The question to Trivium and follow up on why he asked it looked ridiculously scum motivated and the sheep vote on to the triv wagon was pretty much scum behavior.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: GrayFox</span> for now."}

I see nothing particularly scummy about it.

Says he would go for Gray if Triv doesn't get lynched in #548. <br>-Triv: Implies gray is being scummy in #183 bc gray voted him. Continues to push him, but then says in #254 that he won't vote him for making one mistake. Pretty clear when Triv votes Gray in #583 that he's doing it because he thinks Gray is the most likely lynch.<br>-Aris: Thinks Gray looks scummy in #334, his first mention of Gray. Continues to scumread him. Comes far enough along in the game that I think it could possibly be scum latching onto a general mounting suspicion of Gray.<br>-Garmr: Thinks Gray looks somewhat town in #158.

Not that many mentions of Gray except the one above.  Kind of weird that someone would call a post genuine and not associate that with being towny at least a little bit.

The Lapsa/Garmr posts towards the end of the Day are interesting.  Garmr declaring intent to vote Gray is fine.  Lapsa jumps on him for ??? in response to him saying he'll go through with the lynch.  Lapsa needling Garmr over something mostly irrelevant doesn't really seem like the Lapsa from the rest of Day 1.  What exactly is wrong with garmr expressing intent to hammer at the end of the day?  I have some idea of why it might make sense to find Garmr's post scummy, but Lapsa ignoring the DL to go after Garmr while Garmr hammered just strikes me as weird.<br><br>@Zulfy, can you explain why you didn't believe Triv's claim at all?

In particular, the retcon from Full cop to 2-shot cop didn't seem like scum would do because scum like to appear consistent.  At least some players are erratic enough that I might not think that but Trivium's play was straightforward enough that pulling some crazy bid to justify his continued survival in the game in this manner seems unlikely.  And if he were doing that I'd sort of expect it upfront anyhow.  Seeing that tool evidently thought differently about the claim is enough to make me -shrug- and not dwell on that though."}

The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town.

Could you explain that?</div></blockquote><br>Voting and being proactive is the best way for me to get myself invested in a game.  I typically don't see a reason to be conservative with votes on D1, where gauging reactions and interacting with people is more important than being precise right away.  I could have kept reading and ultimately would have concluded that Keyser looked better as the Day went on, but I would have voted Keyser if I had just replaced in on the first few pages so I didn't see any reason to hold back on doing it then either.<br><br>I realize that Gimlear and Makara need some attention too.  Neither left a strong impression on me at the end of Day 1, so I was kind of surprised and not-at-all surprised to see Gimlear taking some heat Today, in particular from you.  So I'm working on sorting exactly where I am with that group.  Garmr's backing off of the Trivium wagon after the claim and having previously asked me to hammer looked like town.  Possibly too erratic to be scum?  His response to me bringing up the Godfather Tell seemed more disappointed than confrontational or over-defensive which I might expect scum to be if they were being accused of being blatantly scum motivated.  What is your read on Garmr right now?  I know hes getting a replacement supposedly so I'm sure that will give us more on the slot to work with.<br><br>I have a few questions but they all kind of boil down to: if not Gimlear, who would you be voting for?

This might not be a great comparison just because he was mislynched D1 in both games, so there doesn't appear to have been quite as much opportunity to sheep.

Well since Garm was suggesting that you and Lapsa were scumbuddies, his case falls apart.

Garm can still push his scumbuddy but people will put less stock into it.

Keyser I didn't really read the game he was in with you because I was looking for some specific things in his meta that didn't really apply in that game.

I wanted to focus on the early game for both of those things since that's the bulk of perf's posting in this game. He replaced in in the game he played in with you, so it wasn't a good example for my purposes.<br><br>It's interesting you say that perf's reads appeared to be more articulate and structured in his town games -- from what I saw, he looked like he put more work and explanation into his reads when he's scum (see the mystery mansion mafia game). For that reason he also appears to change votes less often as scum. Whereas in the town games I looked at, especially early in the game, he vote hopped like he does here.<br><br>I also feel like he was more eager/excited/silly in his posting when he played as town. That includes silly/strange photos and illustrations, \"lol\"s, etc. Which he's been doing here.<br><br>So basically it seems to me that perf's self-consciousness as scum manifests itself in some subtle ways like wanting to have his reads appear more ironclad and not feeling as able to post lightheartedly.

Like I think Garm is a pretty capable scum player and therefore think he could easily resist the temptation of going for every wagon that comes up and instead stick to his guns (which outwardly implies stubborn townie, but can also come from scum who don't want to do a ton of work or are having a tough time finding people they think genuinely look scummy).<br><br>So with Garm doggedly sticking to the Triv wagon to the very end, pushing against the BMR wagon and then hammering gray despite the claim, there are definitely probable explanations for both town and scum:<br><br>-Town: Really, really thought Triv looked bad and didn't know alignment of players telling him otherwise so didn't trust them. Thought BMR was town and therefore tried to get town not to mislynch. Didn't want to no lynch and figured that with triv's claim gray might be lying anyway.<br>-Scum: Thought triv looked bad and sensed that wagon could come back around to him, or couldn't find anyone else he really thought looked scummy enough to push without having to come up with a thin case. BMR was a buddy (feel like I have a reason not to believe this but I'd have to go back and look for it) or just didn't think BMR looked scummy enough to vote and knew he would have to explain himself if BMR was lynched and flipped town. Saw opportunity to hammer town PR in gray and took it, also knowing scum had a shot at a second PR that night and it was worth possibly getting lynched D2 to have two town PR investigatives gone.<br><br>Did a tiny bit of meta work with garm too because I was curious to see how stubborn he is about stuff/his approach to easy wagons. Garm was scum in Mini 1700 and resisted joining the wagon on Blocky (who ended up being the D1 lynch and was town), until the very end of D1 (from the timing it looked like a deadline lynch, much like in this game). Meanwhile Garm was pushing somebody else (fraggernaut) who wound up being town. So yeah, even if BMR/AP is town in this game, scumGarmr could have easily just resisted going for that wagon. And if BMR/AP is a scumbuddy, there's an obvious reason not to vote for it. Of note is that Garmr's approach to the blocky wagon in 1700 was not to defend it the way he defended BMR in this game, but rather to fence sit on that slot but stay off the wagon.<br><br>Also of not was that garmr voted fraggernaut early in that game and parked his vote there for a long time (he eventually unvoted and didn't vote again until hammering blocky).<br><br>I also looked at a game where garmr was town, NY 187 (pariah). In this one he also parked his vote on somebody early and stubbornly held onto it for most of D1.<br><br>So, lesson number one is that Garmr tends to latch onto a suspect early in D1 and cling stubbornly to it no matter what. That seems to be non-alignment indicative for him.<br><br>He actually held onto this one as the wagon built up and then fell apart, and he kept hanging onto it as town momentum built on prolapsed brain, who wound up being the D1 lynch and was town. Weird thing is, Garmr didn't mention prolapsed at all until after D1.<br><br>So yeah I don't really feel comfortable eliminating Garmr, and in fact might want to lynch him. woo moving backwards"}

So when JJD argues that Lapsa wasn't putting effort into defending Triv, that view is based on posts that look like every other post Lapsa has made in this game -- short and vague. And when he offers further evidence in the fact that Lapsa moved Triv from town to null, it implies that Lapsa actually thought that small action would add pressure to Triv...which doesn't seem likely to me. Lapsa still never voted Triv and didn't seem like he would have iirc.<br><br>So what <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do</span> we have in the way of reading Lapsa? We have his votes, and we have a steady stream of posts where he pushes and prods various people in one way or another -- what I believe to be his brand of scumhunting.<br><br>His votes are all over the place and clearly do not follow momentum with the exception of the BMR wagon (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">note to self: should we get a scumflip on either of those slots, that should very much be considered</span>.) I tend to think that that's more likely to come from town, but...it's not the most convincing thing ever.<br><br>Since I'm on a bit of a meta streak I'll do a little work with Lapsa's meta too. Let's see what we can find.<br><br>-Mini 1636: Lapsa was VT (pretty sure vanilla anyway). Votes were all over the place, posting style was similar to this game.<br>-Newbie 1548: Lapsa was town tracker. Vote hopped a little but kept it on Thor most of the day. Longer posts in a back-and-forth with Thor, but Thor tends to spur on that kind of thing and Lapsa's replies were still short quips, just several short quips packed into one post.<br>-Mewbie 1538: Lapsa was VT and replaced in in post #143. So he only was in the game for like four days before D1 ended, and he only had one vote.<br>-Mini 1652: Lapsa was town vig. He vote hops pretty much the same way he did in this game. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>-Mini 1666: Lapsa was VT. Vote hopped a fair amount. Lol like every time Lapsa is in a game with VDA he votes him. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>-Mini 1687: Lapsa was VT (I was in this one with him). Vote hopped a bit but parked on Thor and Math/Pers for a while. Posting style was similar to this game.<br>-NY 188: Lapsa was werewolf gunsmith (it was multiball). Vote hopped quite a bit, including one on his partner so let's remember that should we get a scumflip from Lapsa this game. The posting style is similar to this game in that it's mostly short quips and he posts a lot of silly gifs/youtube music, but...it kinda feels a little different. His sentences are more complete, more well-structured. He seems to explain things a little bit more.<br><br>Long and short of it -- Lapsa always posts like this and always vote hops. The one scum game I could find provides a minor reason to townread him IMO just because of the differences in posting style.<br><br>I'm eliminating him from my lynch pool today."}

The interactions with garmr at deadline looked bad.  At that point Garmr was voting to avoid a no-lynch  and Laspa jumping on him for expressing intent doesn't make any sense.  Especially seeing that Grey flipped town, I'm left thinking that it makes sense from scum.  Try and preemptively capitalize on how bad Garmr might look for hammering a town PR.  The whole attack looked really bad and I think the Garmr slot is looking more town the more I reflect on exactly that sequence of posts up to the hammer."}

One is that the reasons for his townreads on me (reasonable and active, basically) and his townlean on Zulfy (\"I agree with him\") are thin. This can come from scum more concerned with finding scumreads than townreads. The scum lean on Trivium comes amid pressure on Trivium and feels kind of like a fence-sitting cop-out type move latching onto other players' attitudes toward Triv. His BMR vote also comes right as pressure is beginning to mount on BMR and uses others' reasoning.<br>-Supporting Garmr's weird point in #304 could just be a matter of opinion, or it could be because the suggestion that scum pushed Triv up to L-1 could come in handy for scumMak to use later. If we get a scumflip on the slot we should look at this post again.<br>-#477 also rings as convenient for scum: \"The BMR replacement doesn't look as easy to lynch, good thing I left this back door open to get on the Triv wagon.\"<br><br>I see three completed games for mak, all three of which he was town in and all three of which are newbies:<br><br>-In 1651 he replaced in. His first reads list is very similar to this game, and his townreads are actually similarly thin in that game as well. His vote put a person at L-1 and that person wound up being town. So....not too far off from this game, actually.<br>-In 1654 he was replaced after 544 posts in the game (he made 63 posts). I believe that was the same time he replaced out of this game and for the same reasons. Anyway early on he sheeps somebody else and votes TSO, acknowledging he's sheeping. Votes crashingwaves in #117 partially because he's not posting very much, which smacks of his vote on BMR in this game.

Firstly, I find that sideways jab at Garmr to be pretty odd.  Makara mostly lurked and Garmr was actually around and making cases on Trivium and getting attention for it.  Why call out Makara over Garmr for this?  Back to my original point, why does trivium being a COP matter at all?  Performer's point seems to be that people who tunneled on a townie are suspect.  Thats a pretty shallow point to making considering tunneling is typically more of a playstyle thing than it is alignment indicative and there really is no analysis from Performer (meta or otherwise) to indicate that this particular case is scummy.  Ok, so maybe Performer is more into heurisitcs than I am and thinks that these playersa re scummy for tunneling a townie.  Why not say that then?; Once again bringing up that Trivium was a cop looks to me like an attempt to pass off a pretty shallow point as something more than it is by bringing this up.  Naturally people feel shitty about having forced a cop to claim on D1.  Performer is kind of blaming Makara for it in a way and of course people are going to be sympathetic to that because they will agree on an emotional level that losing the cop sucked.  Furthermore,if I'm expected to believe that this is all just how Performer thinks (plausible) then I'm left wondering why he didn't say anything similar about the gray wagon in the same stride.  Gray flipped PR and I tunneled Gray pretty hard yet Performer doesn't really mention that at all.  Aris got an honorable mention in the performer post for asking Garmr to hammer, but that is only really a peripherally related train of thought.<br><br>Does that answer your question?<br><br>Re why did I bring it up.  By it I assume you mean that someone told you I was a good player?  Why shouldn't I bring it up.  You are injecting an opinion into the game about me and calling it interesting without really explaining why you find it interesting at all.  And you clearly have no interest in talking about it which really makes me wonder why you'd being it up in the first place.  I can't think of any town motivated train of thought for having done so, given everything you've said about it."}

Lapsa is his main push to begin the day but by #787 he's calling for a compromise lynch on mak. Votes mak in #954 and points out again that he's looking like a good compromise lynch.<br>-JJD is like super obvious town. He would be my number one choice of NK as scum unless they have a useful result from makara. Yet JJD may yet actually be alive tomorrow if Perf was truly softing bodyguard like I thought he was.<br><br>Zulfy:<br><br>-Zulfy votes for mak in the very first VC of D2. He unvotes and then moves to Lapsa, but still. He rejoins the mak wagon as of the #1098 VC.<br>-D1: Mostly treats mak the same way as everyone else, asking him to clarify stuff from time to time/minor challenges to points made. Asks Triv to investigate makara in #562.<br>-D2: Votes mak to begin the day, unvotes without explanation in #744. Suggests scum-mak in #745. #798 could be read as Zulf trying to get me to vote mak.

Puts sky at L-1 as of the #1098 VC.<br>-D1: Perf votes mak (RVS?) in his second post, #20.<br>-D2: Perf comes out saying mak looks scummy at the beginning of D2, #696. Asks JJD to join Const wagon because mak couldn't claim (referencing my argument) in #973. Says he's still not comfortable with lynching the slot in #1038 after sky replaced in. There's also the whole asking sky about her predecessor fakeclaiming cop thing in #1036. Still not sure about this. It was obviously not too tough a test given the spoilered bit, but I guess why test your partner like this in the first place? Idk...I could see this stuff meaning perf is a partner but I just don't feel confident in it. Seems like a place scum would want to push an associative case.<br><br>Gimlear:<br><br>-Though Gim started out D2 voting for Lapsa, mak went straight for Gim.<br>-D1: Not a whole lot of interaction with mak. Some needling of the slot, and he cautions aris not to townread mak with the logic aris uses at one point.<br>-D2: Says he's scumreading mak in #767. At this point there were no votes on mak. Joins the const counterwagon in #969. Specifies later that if there's a replacement for mak he would be one of his top lynch choices. Says my meta defense of mak is weak and votes sky in #1119.<br>-Yeah Gim does not look like a partner of this slot.<br><br>AP:<br><br>-BMR doesn't appear to have mentioned mak at all.<br>-AP didn't vote D2 until the #1009 VC, then voted for mak. Unvoted for my sake I think and then put mak at L-1 again later.<br>-D1: Challenges mak's scumlean on BMR and hints at scumreading mak in #513. Says he would like to pay more attention to mak on D2.<br>-D2: Has mak at null in #758, reiterates wish to see more attention paid to mak in #780. Votes mak in #987 basically saying he's sheeping JJD, AP was the second vote on mak. Says we don't need to wait for mak to roleclaim in #1017. Unvotes to give me time to say stuff, then puts mak back at L-1 when Keyser unvotes.<br>-Overall looks pretty good for AP, but there are things that make me think possible scum partner. Like having mak at null for so long and then jumping on after JJD set up the wagon. Yes, AP was on relatively early, but it was also approaching deadline and JJD had already pointed out that mak was a common scum read for a lot of people and therefore looked like a likely compromise lynch.<br><br>Aris:<br><br>-Doesn't vote D2 until the #886 VC, where he votes for Const just after he replaces in. Keeps his vote there the rest of the day save for a quick hop over to Perf for one VC.<br>-D1: Says mak forgetting where his vote was reads as town to him in #482.<br>-D2: Puts mak at null in #857.

In #992/993, basically says he wants to lynch mak but is waiting for a replacement.<br>-These ISOs don't give me a whole lot that look explicitly like partners, but I could see that explanation fitting, given that Const was the counterwagon to mak/Sky.

I'm inclined to believe that these townreads of Makara's are all town.  The reads on tool and Zulfy at least feel like \"blah blah I need to call someone town and these guys seem fairly town\".  Just the way he townread them there feels like he knew he could go back and justify the reads easily later because they are town and he genuinely sees them that way.

Makara's performer read comes off as apologetic and preemptively defensive.  The \"I tend to scumread people [Performer] who...\" is pretty weak.  Its like a justification or inherent backpedal present in the own read.  Reads as if he feels guilty about this one, so gonna say Performer probably town for that?  The Gimlear one is totally the opposite impression.  Makara went off just to ISO Gimlear?  This read feels a bit more confident although I'm not really seeing what its based on.  Makara seems to kind of believe this one and the conclusion that Gimlear is just going along with the town especially gives me that impression.<br><br>Null reads of <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">GrayFox</span></span>, Aris, Garmr, Lapsa.

Slightly interesting that hes promising to reread the slot; the only other time he implied such initiative was with Gimlear in this post.  I'm not too concerned with Makara null-reading Aris considering Aris's presence to that point in the game, but this read comes off a little guilty; giving it way more time than it should, all things considered.  The Lapsa read sounds a bit concerned, like he is legitimately concerned with Lapsa's scumread on him.  ~Could~ be a scum/scum thing with Makara moderately annoyed that hes getting bussed.  Lack of daytalk sort of supports this, but eh.  Could easily see this being scum overdefensive in response to town.  And the inconsistency with his previous read on Lapsa...I don't know.  I'd expect scum to be more aware of how they are reading their buddies than they are townies, but its just weird.  Garmr read pretty uninteresting, still thinking town on Constantine anyhow.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7309206#p7309206\" class=\"postlink\">post 262</a>, makara wrote:</cite>Look at my incredibly scummy tactics</div></blockquote><br>Banter with Garmr.

I think Constantine was more likely to be a town counter wagon, although I have seen 2 scum wagons at the same time before, so I'm not ruling it out completely.<br><br>Also, tool, if you have information for us that could help us determine Performer's loyalty, please share.

Like saying that signaling to town that we're out of RVS was a play to look like town. Doesn't make sense to me. And saying that Keyser not understanding that Lapsa was quoting the wiki was \"disingenuous.\" It seems much more likely to me, regardless of alignment, that Keyser just didn't know what Lapsa was posting. And there's not really a scum motivation for it, but Aris treats it as such. The reasoning just strikes me as the kind of thing scum would do when they know they're going after a wagon where the reasoning is already established but they don't want to look like they're just sheeping. So they heap on anything else they can find.<br>-Nothing else has really stood out to me as being alignment indicative.<br><br>BlueMoonRising:<br><br>-Not a whole lot yet, but for some reason I get a gut townvibe from his posts so far. Just the vote on Lapsa, the curtness, the (probable) wait-and-see approach...all things I feel like I see from town in early game. Not terribly strong, I'd call it a weak townlean and want to come back later. This is the kind of slot where other factors are better for reading the slot (not going to expand on that right now because if this slot is scum I don't want to give any ideas on what I'm looking for).<br>-EDIT AFTER INITIAL ENTRY: And then he goes and posts #210, in which he is directing play. There are a lot of scummy possibilities for this post, including coaching buddies, preemptively distancing himself from a mislynch and subtly trying to project an image of ignorance. The last sentence in particular bugs me because it seems like an afterthought; \"Oh by the way I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> know whether he's town.\"<br><br>Garmr:<br><br>-I get a minor townvibe from #70 given the way Garmr describes his RVS-stage attitude in #124. It just seems like Garmr trying to get things moving a little bit but he doesn't have a lot to go on. At the same time it's a very shallow push. Which basically means that Garmr isn't trying that hard to get things moving, and that can be antithetical to some scum's early-game mentality: to try to appear super towny.<br>-That being said, I was totally fooled by scumGarmr the last time I played with him so I don't know if I'll ever feel very comfortable townreading him this game.<br>-The push on Trivium (who is my top townread atm) gives me bad feelings, but at the same time it is literally impossible that the entire wagon is driven by scum so there must be some town out there who are on the wagon and just are not seeing what I'm seeing. I kind of knew that would happen because the post that made me townread triv the most is one that appears town to me because I know that I'm town.<br>-So basically my read on Garmr is somewhere between null and null-town, with a general wariness attached.<br><br>Gimlear:<br><br>-The questioning of Keyser (which may have actually sparked the early wagon on him), denouncing of the push on Keyser and subsequent L-1'ing of Trivium could come from either alignment. But if it does come from scum, it means Gimlear is a competent and thoughtful scum player. Which is just something I want to take note of for future assessment of the slot.<br>-That being said, the arc and posting style does feel genuine to me. So not interested in chasing Gimlear right now.<br><br>Grayfoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:<br><br>-Slight scumlean mostly just for #138. Looks like scum hesitation to appear too scummy while still wanting to hop on a juicy wagon. Other than that not much to go on. This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br><br>JJD:<br><br>-JJD was the first, I believe, to jump on the Keyser thing. So while I do think it was low-hanging fruit for scum, I think you kind of have to give the benefit of the doubt to the first person to jump on the first wagon. That's just getting town out of RVS, which is something any alignment would do.<br>-The pushing on Keyser kinda strikes me as coming from town. Just seems like a natural path for town to go: sees something easy to talk about -&gt; votes to get town out of RVS -&gt; continues questioning player -&gt; responses don't make much sense, and you're already voting them, so you continue to argue.<br>-Begins assessing how other players have interacted with the wagon in #153, which supports the get-town-out-of-RVS theory for his push on Keyser.<br>-Yeah I just see a lot of questioning and trying to move the game forward. Reads like town. Not that scum can't fake it, but this early in the game it feels towny to me.<br><br>Keyser:<br><br>-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br><br><br>Lapsa:<br><br>-There are really only two things in Lapsa's ISO that I see to look at: his vote/unvote on Trivium and his vote on makara. The vote on Trivium put Triv at L-2, and then he unvoted after Gray put Triv at L-1 (and also after I suggested that we shouldn't lynch Triv). I can see scum motivation behind it, but the town explanation seems a bit more plausible to me (that Lapsa wanted to let more happen in D1/didn't feel that strongly about Triv being scum.) It also kind of seems antithetical to a scum mindset just because why would he want to work against a mislynch? (this is assuming the point of view of scumLapsa/townTriv)<br>-The makara vote supports the explanation of Lapsa wanting more things to happen in D1 as well. Makara has probably posted the least out of all the players just because of the V/LA, and while Lapsa's vote didn't come with an explanation, I read it with an implication that Lapsa is trying to get makara to do more.<br>-Not sure what to make of Lapsa voting for BMR and makara in the same post. Maybe that's like a weird form of FoS?<br><br>makara:<br><br>-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br><br>Performer:<br><br>-Early-game enthusiasm could just be the excitement of a player who hasn't played much or a scum player hoping to come across as friendly/towny/fun. Not really sure which direction to go.<br>-Parts of #73 strike me as being pretty shallow, like the chiming in on the Keyser stuff. Which pings as scummy. He does say a couple ISO posts later that he doesn't want to lynch Keyser, but that's after I start arguing for Keyser being town.<br>-Jumps on the Triv wagon later (Perf says it's L-1 but for some reason I feel like he was mistaken), which is sketchy but not more sketchy than some of the other people on the wagon IMO.<br>-So yeah a scumlean here.<br><br>Trivium:<br><br>-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br><br>Zulfy:<br><br>-Not really sure what to make of the early-game pre-flip association stuff. I guess I could see him using it as town as just a thought organizer, but then scum can use those techniques as a means to force their reads into a more genuine-looking perspective. So. Null I guess.<br>-His positioning on the Trivium wagon is prime scum real estate. The positioning is honestly the thing that made me raise an eyebrow when he made the vote. His reasoning, which goes above some other peoples' reasons for voting Triv, are actually not all that bad.<br>-Not a big fan of #191. It's like he's giving himself an out in case he wants to bail from the Trivium wagon.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueMoonRising</span><br><br>I think this is a good place to be right now.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7308813#p7308813\" class=\"postlink\">post 255</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>Forgot to respond to this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7307864#p7307864\" class=\"postlink\">post 223</a>, Trivium wrote:</cite>Tool, why are you defending people so much?</div></blockquote><br><br>Earlier in the game I did feel more confident in my townreads than my scumreads, but I have also had my vote on people for serious reasons and been developing scumreads.<br><br>Also I didn't want you or Keyser to get lynched so I was trying to get people not to do that.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7320303#p7320303\" class=\"postlink\">post 377</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7319443#p7319443\" class=\"postlink\">post 364</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>One or two of the votes on the wagon make me a little leery</div></blockquote><br><br>Thought I'd expand on this.

What performer said was:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7413553#p7413553\" class=\"postlink\">post 1391</a>, Performer wrote:</cite>the posts on this page are just too funny<br>i'm not even going to begin with Lapsa<br>i am, however, to see people's interactions regarding what just happened regarding his post</div></blockquote><br><br>So my immediate thought was \"holy shit Constantine and perf are partners and constantine knows that perf wasn't neighborized, so he said so in thread but forgot that perf had only said it in the scum qt and had yet to say so publicly in the game.\"<br><br>Obviously the way out of it for scumConst would be to say \"I just interpreted perf's #1391 that way,\" because there's no way to distinguish whether const is lying or telling the truth about that. So now I'm left to wonder whether scumConst slipped or if this is just another case of Constantine not having a very tight grip on what's going on in the game (the other examples being when he didn't realize that we already had a flipped cop after sky was lynched and the time that he thought he was lynched when he only had like one or two votes on him).<br><br>It's just that perf so clearly was not saying what constantine said he was saying.<br><br>I'd also like to hear perf's explanation for saying he wants to see people's reactions in #1391, only to sabotage the reaction test strategy in this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7415573#p7415573\" class=\"postlink\">post 1402</a>, Performer wrote:</cite>excuse me while i put other things on hold from page 56, proceed to bash my head in a brick wall<br>and ask tool the elephant-in-the-room question, which no one (WOW) has asked:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">did Lapsa really recruit you</span></span></span></div></blockquote>"}

This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br><br>Keyser:<br><br>-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br><br>...<br><br>makara:<br><br>-Don't see a whole lot to go on here.

It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7327940#p7327940\" class=\"postlink\">post 455</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>He's my strongest townread and therefore I would not feel good about voting for him at all.

If so, who do you think WAS actually shoving constantine as a scum-led counterwagon to Makara?  I think this has been talked about a bit by someone, but I really dislike when people speculate on counterwagons without pointing out who was scummy on the counterwagons.

Do you all share one neighborhood or is it separate neighborhoods?  Assuming we haven't already, I really want to mass claim today.  If Lapsa is town then I doubt there are any other PRs out there at all.  Follower and 2-shot cop are fairly powerful and ~could~ exist by themselves but I'd usually expect an average of 3 town PRs in a mini normal game.  Neighborizer does have some utility in that if it neighborizes one of the other two PRs, it can claim results for them and protect them that way.  Actually, I think Lapsa is probably town.  There is no way this claim is fake; could be a scum neighborizer but we've already seen Makra flip scum PR in the rolecop and frankly Neighborizer/2xCop/Follower vs OddRoleCop is fairly balanced.  So I'm pretty inclined to just town-bin Lapsa for this claim."}

I'm trying to fathom Constantine-scum/Laspa-town scenario and I'm at odds with how confident Constantine is in this scenario that Lapsa is lying when really there is no reason to think that.

I don't see why thats entirely unreasonable to conclude.  Perf saying that he is \"not going to start with Lapsa\" is a notably different response to having someone out shared inside information than I'd expect in most cases.  I agree that Performer's follow-up quote is a bit odd though.  If Performer was not recruited, there is no reason for him to think that you were.  The quote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7413553#p7413553\">1391</a> implies that he thinks its obvious Lapsa is BSing and that it doesn't mean anything, so him then taking interest in your response to the claim is not exactly consistent."}

I don't see any reason to doubt the claim, given everything that has happened and I can easily see it filling in the town power a little bit in the event that he is telling the truth (likely).  Probably town and will not consider lynching.  Especially since I think Makara was trying to make him look like a buddy.<br><br>Aris: I'm not seeing anything from the slot Today or Yesterday that really makes a town-case for it and he has dropped off after being wagoned.  I could see Aris plausibly being scum with almost anyone in the game.<br><br>Gimlear: His tunnel on Tool as tool points out is a bit weird.  I could see him being scum with Tool potentially and overly sensitive to posts from Tool that he sees as anti-town or otherwise inconsistent.  I could also see this being scum with Lapsa.  He has barely mentioned Lapsa at all recently except to tell him that X-shot modifiers are normal.  His vote is on Constantine which makes me at least somewhat certain that Gimlear/Constantine are not a team since he could have voted for Aristophanes if that were the case.<br><br>JarJar: looks confused and lost in the last couple of pages which does nothing to change my impression of him.  Looks like town and quacks like town.  Loosely concerned about Lapsa's vote on him, but JarJar's tunnel on Lapsa really makes no sense from scum/scum in this case.  So very probably town.<br><br>I am about to run and go to brunch with my family, so I'll finish summarizing my thoughts when I get back.  Constantine/Lapsa are more prolific and deserve a bit more thought anyhow.<br><br>I don't want to rule out Tool at this point, I think that the most likely partner for Tool is either Gimlear or Aris if he is scum.  Still other people are more likely so I won't be voting here Today."}

Lapsa and Constantine go into N2 and discuss their plans for the next day. They decide they are going to try to disrupt the town's stability as much as possible: kill off Keyser, probably the most active and helpful player in the game, and then pull a gambit and bus the hell out of each other.<br>2. They know Lapsa is in a neighborhood and that Perf is a neighborizer. They decide that Lapsa will fakeclaim neighborizer under the guise of \"protecting Performer\" and that Constantine will immediately bus, and whoever survives will ride the towncred to victory.<br>3. Lapsa takes the idea to Performer in the neighborhood thread. Perf says it's a terrible idea, but since it's part of Lapsa/Const's scum strategy Lapsa insists he's going to do it anyway.<br>4. When Lapsa actually pulls the stunt, Constantine buses immediately but fails to package it in such a way that it disguises the fact that he knew from the get-go that Lapsa wasn't actually a neighborizer. As an illustration for why this looks so bad, look at JJD and AP taking the claim at face value because as town who weren't implicated in Lapsa's fakeclaim they have no reason to think that scum would pull such a weird stunt that was always destined to fail."}

Votes him in #636. This was after I had pushed a Garmr wagon, failed to gain any support and then voted Gray before going to bed before deadline. There was no real danger of Garmr being lynched there; people weren't even sure Gray was going to get lynched at that point.<br>-In #810 he still has Garmr at null, now like a green color and in the middle of the null list. Says the Garmr read is \"slippery.\"<br>-Votes Const in #974. This is closing in on the deadline of D2 and just after I posted my POE thoughts on Garmr/Const, concluding that I didn't want to eliminate him from the lynch pool and would actively consider lynching him. Also JJD had just asked lapsa if he wanted to help lynch constantine. Lapsa proceeds to vote AP 14 posts later.<br>-Votes Const again in #1120. This is right after Gim puts Sky at L-1.<br>-Admits in #1211 that he was trying to build a counterwagon to sky.<br>-In #1386, seems certain Const is scum. Reinforces that with reasoning in #1394.<br>-Post fakeclaim, Lapsa votes const in #1407. This is where I'll stop since I don't need a refresher on the recent stuff.<br><br>Garmr/Const:<br><br>-Votes lapsa and claims he's a partner with triv in #63, expands on that in #124.<br>-Pushes a lapsa/perf team in #328. Quite strangely, Garmr suggests that Lapsa and perf's thoughts are so similar that it looks like they're in a neighborhood together. Obviously this was before N1 so Perf had not yet neighborized Lapsa, but this...merits some thought.<br>-Includes Lapsa as a list of players he'd like to lynch in #410.<br>-Continues to push the lapsa/performer thing in #466 and #637.<br>-Gets all pissy about Lapsa \"dodging questions\" beginning in #650.<br>-Begins D2 with a naked vote on Lapsa in #689.<br>-Tries to get makara to help him lynch Lapsa in #692.<br>-In #694, tries to imply that Aristophanes is also a partner with Lapsa, I think?<br>-Pretty much continues to try to lynch Lapsa until he replaces out.<br>-Constantine doesn't say anything substantial about Lapsa until his 11th post, made near deadline D2, in which he vows to push Lapsa the next day.<br>-Says in #1160 that Lapsa and Perf are \"probably scum together.\" So basically he's just picking up Garmr's torch and running with it.<br>-Votes Lapsa in #1364.<br>-Says in #1371 that he pushed a case on gim and lapsa being scum together.....? Did he mean Performer and Lapsa?<br>-In #1372, thinks he's been lynched and calls for town to lynch Lapsa next.<br>-Switches to Gim in #1373 upon finding out he wasn't lynched, says he was thinking about switching to Gim anyway.<br>-The infamous #1398, where Const is the first person to doubt Lapsa's neighborizer claim and basically says that performer said something he didn't say.<br>-And again, don't need a refresher on the most recent stuff so I'm skipping it.<br><br>So after this I just feel like Constantine needs rope so hard. Garmr posted something about Perf and Lapsa looking like they were in a neighborhood D1, and then Perf turned out to be a neighborizer and he neighborized Lapsa N1. The prior knowledge theory is further supported by Constantine's immediate assumption that Lapsa was lying about his claim. Then the fact that Constantine came into the game and quickly started pushing a Lapsa/perf team just like his predecessor also rings suspicious (theory: scumConst came in and read the scumchat thread and saw something from Garmr saying \"imma push a perf/lapsa team the whole game\" and everybody else going \"genius!\" and so Const just keeps doing it when he replaces in).<br><br>Whether Constantine would be partners with Lapsa or Performer gets a little more tricky. Garmr bringing up the neighborhood D1 implies that he knew of the neighborizer before anybody was neighborized, which points to Perf. The strong, constant, replacement-spanning fighting between the Garmr slot and Lapsa means basically that if those slots were buddies they agreed to bus each other and never let go early in the game. The consistency of that trend actually makes me believe it a little.<br><br>Either way Constantine looks suspicious af."}

Granted he didn't go after Lapsa at the time and Constantine kind of jumped from point A to point C without checking with Performer first to get the whole picture.  That in itself is weird but I don't think Constantine is the world's most team oriented player.  Meh.  Writing it out like that, I do have to agree that its suspicious.  Lapsa and Constantine are suspicious after recent posts.  One of them is looking likely after this whole ordeal though and I'm still more inclined to vote Lapsa of the 2 since I had reason to think that Garmr was town at the end of D1.  Still I do recall Performer's point about Aris coaching Garmr to hammer in a fairly awkward way which I should revisit.<br><br>@Gimlear, re scumteam size: The scumteam is pretty much guaranteed to be 3 people.  13 player games almost always have 3 man scum teams with very few exceptions.<br><br>I'm fairly certain I posted to suggest that Lapsa could be scum with Constantine before anyone else did, citing the speed of the bus and the certainty in the interpretation of Performer's post.  Even before JJD speculated on the same thing.  I may be confusing what I actually wrote down with the thoughts in my head, but Im fairly certain that Im not."}

I think someone trying to fake towncred would not be so far off base or would just ask without providing numbers; I kind of like the (slight) proactive suggestion of 4-5 there.  It looks more like he genuinely doesn't know I think.  The handling of the Constantine drama is fairly consistent and makes a lot of sense to me as well.<br><br>I'm inclined to agree that one scum in Lapsa/Constantine seems probable.  Lapsa trying to disprove/rule-out that he could be on a team with Constantine makes me inclined to think they are not on a team.  Especially given Constantine's attempt to doubledown on the Lapsa scumread and threaten to replace out should Lapsa not be lynched.  I'm not really seeing scum/scum here..its just a bit too much?  Basically Constantine's arguments have a ring to them like he does believe them.  While that doesn't make him town, it does mean that hes not likely scum with Lapsa.<br><br>Zulfy and Tool..If Zulfy is scum then the only partner I'd really buy right now is Aristophanes.  My previous paranoia about Zulfy maybe bussing Tool randomly really seems exceedingly unlikely on review.  There is just no reason to do that at all.  The one thing thats got me a little concerned about Zulfy is that he led the Keyser push and wasn't getting any support for it.  Then Keyser dies the next night.  Could kind of see him deciding that lynching Keyser was not possible and just killing him, but I can see a couple reasons for the Keyser kill and that doesn't mean a huge amount on its own.<br><br>Tool placed vote number 3 on Aristophanes and then later commented he was suspicious about how the pressure on Aristophanes dropped off.  While I agree with the vote and that suspicion, I realize that the vote came after Aris got 2 votes rather quickly and hes currently in favor of lynching one or both of Lapsa/Constantine which ironically contributes to Aris not really getting much attention.  SHRUG??  I don't think Tool is scum with Lapsa, Zulfy, or Constantine.  I'd buy Aris or mayyyybe Gimlear but I'm leaning town on Gimlear and also Tool.<br><br>Basically I could see Aris + pretty much anyone being a buddy given Aris's dropping off the radar.  No one really has any interactions there that spring to mind as interesting except Aris telling Garmr to hammer GrayFoxx which my gut is inclined to think is not likely to be an instance of coaching.<br><br>I'm trying to sort possible scum pairings in order of likelihood.  I still think that Aris could be scum with almost anyone, with Aris+Constantine being fairly unlikely.  Aris/Lapsa makes rather a lot of sense given the timing of the neighborizer thing and the Aris wagon.<br><br>Constantine/Lapsa does not seem likely to me and neither does Constantine/Aris.  If Constantine flips scum then I'll probably end up being rather concerned about Tool as I can't really think of any other likely budy.  Gimlear was on Constantine fairly early Today and for Gimlear/Constantine to be a team, then Gimlear certainly avoided going after low hanging fruit in other places Today which is a pretty hard bus to be pulling.<br><br>Lapsa..makes sense with Aristophanes and possibly Gimlear.  Gimlear is going after Constantine fairly consistently and mostly ignoring Lapsa, with only a token answering of a question to Lapsa today.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Gimlear</span>: How familiar are you with normal games?  Im a little weirded-out that you told Lapsa that 1-shot is a normal modifier but you are fairly unfamiliar with the standard scumteam size in games like this.<br><br>So I'd say<br><br>Aris/Lapsa<br>Aris/???<br>Lapsa/Gimlear<br>Constantine/Tool<br><br>are roughly the likely pairings I can see here.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lapsa</span>"}

Like if they aren\u2019t partners I\u2019m pretty sure one of them is scum. There are some alternate explanations for why scumLapsa would gambit like that that don\u2019t involve Aris (just trying to confuse and distract town, for instance, or for towncred).<br><br>Another thing that makes me think Lapsa is scum aside from the fakeclaim itself is this disagreement between him and perf about what was said in the neighborhood thread. Performer says that he told Lapsa not to fakeclaim and Lapsa insisted on doing it anyway. Lapsa says that Performer told him not to fakeclaim and Lapsa agreed not to do it, then later changed his mind.<br><br>These are not opinions, these are facts that can be proven or disproven. So why would two players, who both have access to the thread that can prove or disprove a version of events, have two different versions of the same event? My thought is that Lapsa needs town to believe his narrative in order to support his justification for fakeclaiming: he first agreed, which clears the way for him to later change his mind because \u201ctown was pulling apart.\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, that explanation doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Lapsa thought fakeclaiming would help town work together and get a better idea of where scum are? No. In theory there\u2019s no reason to think that muddying up the waters makes them clearer. In reality, the fakeclaim led to a mislynch.<br><br>(need to re-read gim's reasoning for Lapsa being town)<br><br>I\u2019m feeling like AP is town. He\u2019s claimed VT, and I went back and found some posts that fit in with that. In #554 (D1), he says \u201cIf I had a role worthy of CCing a cop, I would have done it in this post.\u201d In #1489 (D3), he says \u201cI doubt there are any other PRs out there at all.\u201d That was before AP claimed vanilla. Those posts together just read like AP looking at the game through a VT\u2019s eyes. He certainly didn\u2019t leave a back door open to fakeclaim a PR later. In fact, the whole push for a massclaim reads as something a vanilla would do. So it fits with his claim. Unless scumAP decided really early in the game that he wasn\u2019t going to claim a PR, which I feel like isn\u2019t the greatest move for scum to make. There\u2019s also the mounting number of times AP has defended people who turned out to be town and the time that he was one of the first votes on a scumwagon. Especially if one of Lapsa or Aris flips scum I think we can rule out AP.<br><br>Zulfy I have my doubts about but am leaning town. The associatives with the mak/sky slot made me feel like Zulfy was probtown but AP pointed out Zulfy\u2019s switch to absolute confidence that sky would flip scum pre-fakeclaim. That does make me hesitate a little bit. His voting record is also not the greatest, though I don\u2019t think voting record can be used reliably in this game with the number of wagons on town we\u2019ve had that so many people have participated in. I pointed out before that Zulfy has had some posts that look like towny paranoia and that still rings true. If we get a scumflip in Aris or Lapsa, associatives might help read Zulfy better. But I\u2019m leaning town on him.<br><br>No way JJD is scum, for reasons I\u2019ve already laid out.<br><br>So that leaves Gim, Lapsa and Aris. If two scum are in that pool it means we have a 67% chance of hitting scum if we were to lynch randomly. And Lapsa/Aris as a partnership makes sense.<br><br>So there\u2019s the question of who to lynch first between Lapsa and Aris. I\u2019m thinking Aris, and the reason is basically one that AP already point out: Aris could be scum with anyone. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s technically true, but for instance, what if Zulfy was pushing a case on me to distract town from lynching his partner Aris? I feel like the Lapsa partner explanation makes more sense, but the possibility of that is enough to make me want to lynch Aris first as the common partner."}

I'm reading a book right now called \"User Story Mapping\".  Its basically about how to communicate as a team effectively in order to write software.  That may seem mostly unrelated, but one of the key points in the book is that \"shared documents does not mean shared understanding\".  Basically people misunderstand each other regularly; even when reading the same material they may interpret it in different ways.  So while that may only seem peripherally related to the the Neighborhood discussion here, this is basically how I feel about it: That different narratives of what happened in the neighborhood is really not that alarming.  That said I'm still suspicious of Lapsa.  I'm especially curious about Performer allegedly changing his read on Lapsa up (or perhaps he just excluded it because he was talking TO Lapsa?).<br><br>PoE makes sense to me there.  Gimlear pushed Constantine hard yesterday and I'm a little surprised that he isn't rethinking his read on Lapsa given the Constantine flip.  He did acknowledge his Lapsa read though.  I could see Gimlear/Lapsa being plausible given what happened yesterday.  Also Performer was a confirmed PR, but one with no more use to town.  He may have been killed just for being townread by most, but his primary suspect was Lapsa and the two other people on the Lapsa wagon are now gone.  Not sure if I want to revive the Aris wagon or push for Lapsa whom Performer and Constantine were keen to lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7430625#p7430625\" class=\"postlink\">post 1662</a>, Lapsa wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: toolenduso</span></div></blockquote><br>Why?"}

But...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Possibility that Zulfy is telling the truth and AP is still town</span></span><br><br>With this much town power, it would make sense for scum to have a second investigative role. By my reckoning, the only one that would keep open the possibility for AP to be town is mafia watcher/voyeur. It works out like this:<br><br>-Zulfy is almost certainly not lying and is probably the night kill tonight. He kinda crumbed, it makes very little sense for a scumZulfy to fakeclaim right now, the setup spec he did kinda makes sense and it explains a lot of his actions.<br>-AP has claimed VT, so him performing a night action <span style=\"font-style: italic\">as town</span> can't be the reason the motion detector was tripped last night.<br>-It would be crazy as shit for town to have any more PRs (besides, we've massclaimed and nobody else has claimed a PR), so that can't be the reason the motion detector was tripped.<br>-AP claimed yesterday. So if he's town, there would be no reason for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">most</span> scum PRs to target him. Obviously he wasn't the kill choice, there would be no reason to roleblock him with other townies having yet to claim, and investigative roles would have no reason to target him...<span style=\"font-style: italic\">unless</span> they were investigative roles that get information on somebody other than the target, in other words a watcher or voyeur or something like it. In that case, it would make sense for scum to target somebody they feel would be a likely town PR target at night.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Speculation that is perhaps unnecessary</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Now, a scumwatcher's choice of target gets complicated because IMO it depends on how much info scum has. We have to assume that makara got a result before the slot was lynched, though with makara's activity level it's possible that they didn't I suppose. But the result could have been nothing because they were a rolecop (for instance, what if makara investigated Keyser N1 and that's the reason Zulfy's detector was tripped that night?).<br><br>If scum was under the impression that town had no power roles left save for Perf, whose one shot had already been used up, then a scumwatcher's target last night would probably be \"idk just choose somebody, you probably won't get a result anyway.\" But if they had reason to suspect that somebody else was a PR, for instance if gim is town and scum fell for his attempt to hint that he was a PR, then a scumwatcher would want to target whoever they suspected that that PR would want to target.<br><br>Unfortunately, at this part of the hypothetical scenario we're making so many assumptions that continuing to theorize won't be very useful. Just wanted to follow the thought to its conclusion.</div></div></div><br><br>Given the amount of power town has, I think it's a given that scum has to have <span style=\"font-style: italic\">something</span> besides an odd-night rolecop. Whether a watcher or voyeur-type role is likely is something we could debate, but I don't know how we could distinguish between the likelihood of scum having some PR with scum having one of those specific PRs.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">So to recap, the way I see it is that either AP is scum or scum has a watcher/voyeur-type role.</span><br><br>If AP is scum I am going to buy him a freaking drink or something the next time I see him because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">bravo</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Lynching order</span></span><br><br>I'd like to point out that Aris's approach to Zulfy's claim kinda looks bad regardless of AP's alignment because Aris immediately latched onto Zulfy's claim with no questioning and voted AP.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: side note</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I am aware that JarJar did the same thing, but JarJar's associatives with mak/sky and his overall play make him very unlikely scum imo.</div></div></div><br><br>So if AP is scum, Aris's immediate vote looks like bussing. If AP is town, it looks like Aris taking advantage of an easy mislynch in the face of town wanting to lynch Aris.<br><br>The second one is actually less convincing to me than the first because I would think scum might temper their enthusiasm a bit for a wagon they know is on town. But still a likely scenario imo.<br><br>Is it a better idea to lynch Aris before AP? I honestly don't know. I want to consider that some.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">AP's response to Zulfy's claim</span></span><br><br>AP's response to all of this was to assert that Zulfy is lying and vote him. This actually looks pretty bad for AP imo. First, he says that follower, cop and neighborizer is a fair amount of power for town to have, but then says later that it doesn't make sense for scum to have another PR. Those two ideas conflict with each other -- if town has a lot of power, it would make sense for the mod to balance that out by giving scum power.<br><br>Second, he doesn't consider the circumstances surrounding Zulfy's claim, like the fact that fakeclaiming scum would have to expect they would be lynched the next day when AP flipped town.<br><br>What this looks like to me is scumAP in a corner and searching for a way out. He sees the possible explanation of scum targeting him at night and tripping Zulfy's motion sensor, but for some reason doesn't point to that as the likely explanation for Zulfy's result.<br><br>Why? My theory is that AP is trying to hide his knowledge about his own team's PRs/not give any info to town on what scum might have. That explains his assertion that scum having a second PR is unlikely despite the amount of power town has.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Final thoughts</span></span><br><br>So there is a possibility that Zulfy is telling the truth and AP is still town, but I don't think we can really guess at the likelihood of that scenario without more information. AP's response makes me think it's more likely that he's just scum.<br><br>And while Aris does look bad, and has for a while, part of my read on him is based on AP. If we lynch AP and he flips town then imo Aris might actually look a little less like scum, and maybe we lynch somebody else instead.<br><br>So I do support an AP lynch. But no need to rush."}

He told us he was scumreading makara but never pursued his lynch.<br><br>He also told us he was scumreading AP and then never really did anything there either.  In fact, after Zulfy caught AP, Lapsa barely acknowledged it and then finally voted him after I already posted my intent to hammer.<br><br>But the main reason to vote for Lapsa is because I believe I'm practically confirmed town for the following reasons:<br><br>- I was a huge part of getting makara lynched.  That lynch seemed very unlikely to happen.  It pretty much stalled and I reignited the wagon.<br><br>- I've been very open w/ my reads all game.  The one bad thing that can be said about me is that I was townreading AP most of the game.  Nothing I can say there except that he had me fooled.

So when JJD argues that Lapsa wasn't putting effort into defending Triv, that view is based on posts that look like every other post Lapsa has made in this game -- short and vague. And when he offers further evidence in the fact that Lapsa moved Triv from town to null, <span class=\"noboldsig\">it implies that Lapsa actually thought that small action would add pressure to Triv...which doesn't seem likely to me</span>. Lapsa still never voted Triv and didn't seem like he would have iirc.<br><br>So what <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do</span> we have in the way of reading Lapsa? We have his votes, and we have a steady stream of posts where he pushes and prods various people in one way or another -- what I believe to be his brand of scumhunting.<br><br>His votes are all over the place and clearly do not follow momentum with the exception of the BMR wagon (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">note to self: should we get a scumflip on either of those slots, that should very much be considered</span>.) I tend to think that that's more likely to come from town, but...it's not the most convincing thing ever.<br><br>Since I'm on a bit of a meta streak I'll do a little work with Lapsa's meta too. Let's see what we can find.<br><br>-Mini 1636: Lapsa was VT (pretty sure vanilla anyway). Votes were all over the place, posting style was similar to this game.<br>-Newbie 1548: Lapsa was town tracker. Vote hopped a little but kept it on Thor most of the day. Longer posts in a back-and-forth with Thor, but Thor tends to spur on that kind of thing and Lapsa's replies were still short quips, just several short quips packed into one post.<br>-Mewbie 1538: Lapsa was VT and replaced in in post #143. So he only was in the game for like four days before D1 ended, and he only had one vote.<br>-Mini 1652: Lapsa was town vig. He vote hops pretty much the same way he did in this game. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>-Mini 1666: Lapsa was VT. Vote hopped a fair amount. Lol like every time Lapsa is in a game with VDA he votes him. Posting style is similar to this game.<br>-Mini 1687: Lapsa was VT (I was in this one with him). Vote hopped a bit but parked on Thor and Math/Pers for a while. Posting style was similar to this game.<br>-NY 188: Lapsa was werewolf gunsmith (it was multiball). Vote hopped quite a bit, including one on his partner so let's remember that should we get a scumflip from Lapsa this game. The posting style is similar to this game in that it's mostly short quips and he posts a lot of silly gifs/youtube music, but...it kinda feels a little different. His sentences are more complete, more well-structured. He seems to explain things a little bit more.<br><br>Long and short of it -- Lapsa always posts like this and always vote hops. The one scum game I could find provides a minor reason to townread him IMO just because of the differences in posting style.<br><br>I'm eliminating him from my lynch pool today.</div></blockquote><br><br>bolded part is interesting. tool is right - didn't try to actually pressure triv.<br>it's just that read became weaker<br><br>lol about VDA. i have issues with that guy. he's really sly hence i try to sort him out asap.<br>that game i learned that one shouldn't carelessly push - he turned out to be cop (and replaced out)<br><br>about mini 1687 - i didn't park on Thor. i'm actually bit embarased about how he used me.<br>at least i was right about him at the end of the game<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7373794#p7373794\" class=\"postlink\">post 986</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7372103#p7372103\" class=\"postlink\">post 965</a>, St Constantine the Hermit wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Makara</span><br><br>God it feels good to do that</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7372113#p7372113\" class=\"postlink\">post 967</a>, St Constantine the Hermit wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Makara</span><br></div></blockquote><br>Uhhhh.

Like saying that signaling to town that we're out of RVS was a play to look like town. Doesn't make sense to me. And saying that Keyser not understanding that Lapsa was quoting the wiki was \"disingenuous.\" It seems much more likely to me, regardless of alignment, that Keyser just didn't know what Lapsa was posting. And there's not really a scum motivation for it, but Aris treats it as such. The reasoning just strikes me as the kind of thing scum would do when they know they're going after a wagon where the reasoning is already established but they don't want to look like they're just sheeping. So they heap on anything else they can find.<br>-Nothing else has really stood out to me as being alignment indicative.<br><br>BlueMoonRising:<br><br>-Not a whole lot yet, but for some reason I get a gut townvibe from his posts so far. Just the vote on Lapsa, the curtness, the (probable) wait-and-see approach...all things I feel like I see from town in early game. Not terribly strong, I'd call it a weak townlean and want to come back later. This is the kind of slot where other factors are better for reading the slot (not going to expand on that right now because if this slot is scum I don't want to give any ideas on what I'm looking for).<br>-EDIT AFTER INITIAL ENTRY: And then he goes and posts #210, in which he is directing play. There are a lot of scummy possibilities for this post, including coaching buddies, preemptively distancing himself from a mislynch and subtly trying to project an image of ignorance. The last sentence in particular bugs me because it seems like an afterthought; \"Oh by the way I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> know whether he's town.\"<br><br>Garmr:<br><br>-I get a minor townvibe from #70 given the way Garmr describes his RVS-stage attitude in #124. It just seems like Garmr trying to get things moving a little bit but he doesn't have a lot to go on. At the same time it's a very shallow push. Which basically means that Garmr isn't trying that hard to get things moving, and that can be antithetical to some scum's early-game mentality: to try to appear super towny.<br>-That being said, I was totally fooled by scumGarmr the last time I played with him so I don't know if I'll ever feel very comfortable townreading him this game.<br>-The push on Trivium (who is my top townread atm) gives me bad feelings, but at the same time it is literally impossible that the entire wagon is driven by scum so there must be some town out there who are on the wagon and just are not seeing what I'm seeing. I kind of knew that would happen because the post that made me townread triv the most is one that appears town to me because I know that I'm town.<br>-So basically my read on Garmr is somewhere between null and null-town, with a general wariness attached.<br><br>Gimlear:<br><br>-The questioning of Keyser (which may have actually sparked the early wagon on him), denouncing of the push on Keyser and subsequent L-1'ing of Trivium could come from either alignment. But if it does come from scum, it means Gimlear is a competent and thoughtful scum player. Which is just something I want to take note of for future assessment of the slot.<br>-That being said, the arc and posting style does feel genuine to me. So not interested in chasing Gimlear right now.<br><br>Grayfoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:<br><br>-Slight scumlean mostly just for #138. Looks like scum hesitation to appear too scummy while still wanting to hop on a juicy wagon. Other than that not much to go on. This early in the game I don't buy into lurking arguments too much.<br><br>JJD:<br><br>-JJD was the first, I believe, to jump on the Keyser thing. So while I do think it was low-hanging fruit for scum, I think you kind of have to give the benefit of the doubt to the first person to jump on the first wagon. That's just getting town out of RVS, which is something any alignment would do.<br>-The pushing on Keyser kinda strikes me as coming from town. Just seems like a natural path for town to go: sees something easy to talk about -&gt; votes to get town out of RVS -&gt; continues questioning player -&gt; responses don't make much sense, and you're already voting them, so you continue to argue.<br>-Begins assessing how other players have interacted with the wagon in #153, which supports the get-town-out-of-RVS theory for his push on Keyser.<br>-Yeah I just see a lot of questioning and trying to move the game forward. Reads like town. Not that scum can't fake it, but this early in the game it feels towny to me.<br><br>Keyser:<br><br>-Don't buy the early-game arguments against Keyser about trying to look town. Yes, it's possible that's what he's doing. But I see no reason to believe that over the very plausible town explanation of \"but he literally just wanted to know though.\"<br>-His responses to the pressure are a little illogical, but I still don't see a reason to read them as scummy. They actually ring towny to me because they come across like he's sure of himself and not trying to project an image, if that makes any sense...like here's an example. In #43 he responds to JJD by sarcastically saying \"yes, scum have strong motivation to publicly look scummy.\" Like, the statement itself doesn't really make sense, and I feel like a more scummy approach would be to turn it around and start pushing a case on JJD or something along those lines.<br>-Generally he just comes across as a person who feels like it's obvious he's town, and the way I read that is that he thinks he should be obvtown because he knows that he's town.<br>-His switch to Performer in #196 amid continuing near-lynch status on the Trivium wagon also smacks of town to me. He didn't even back away from wanting to lynch Trivium, only suggested that we don't have to do it right now, so really as scum I think it would have been a better idea to keep pressure on Trivium without drawing attention elsewhere.<br><br><br>Lapsa:<br><br>-There are really only two things in Lapsa's ISO that I see to look at: his vote/unvote on Trivium and his vote on makara. The vote on Trivium put Triv at L-2, and then he unvoted after Gray put Triv at L-1 (and also after I suggested that we shouldn't lynch Triv). I can see scum motivation behind it, but the town explanation seems a bit more plausible to me (that Lapsa wanted to let more happen in D1/didn't feel that strongly about Triv being scum.) It also kind of seems antithetical to a scum mindset just because why would he want to work against a mislynch? (this is assuming the point of view of scumLapsa/townTriv)<br>-The makara vote supports the explanation of Lapsa wanting more things to happen in D1 as well. Makara has probably posted the least out of all the players just because of the V/LA, and while Lapsa's vote didn't come with an explanation, I read it with an implication that Lapsa is trying to get makara to do more.<br>-Not sure what to make of Lapsa voting for BMR and makara in the same post. Maybe that's like a weird form of FoS?<br><br>makara:<br><br>-Don't see a whole lot to go on here. The catch-up post is the most substantive thing and that could really go either way.<br><br>Performer:<br><br>-Early-game enthusiasm could just be the excitement of a player who hasn't played much or a scum player hoping to come across as friendly/towny/fun. Not really sure which direction to go.<br>-Parts of #73 strike me as being pretty shallow, like the chiming in on the Keyser stuff. Which pings as scummy. He does say a couple ISO posts later that he doesn't want to lynch Keyser, but that's after I start arguing for Keyser being town.<br>-Jumps on the Triv wagon later (Perf says it's L-1 but for some reason I feel like he was mistaken), which is sketchy but not more sketchy than some of the other people on the wagon IMO.<br>-So yeah a scumlean here.<br><br>Trivium:<br><br>-I did think #59 was scummy. But it was surface-level scummy. It was the kind of thing that's really easy to call scummy. But he goes back and explains his push on Keyser in #98 and it seems legit to me. So he's a new-ish player and gets a little overeager to find scum. Makes sense. The fact that he comes right out and admits it, as Zulfy put it when I asked him about these posts, means he's either cleverly manipulative scum or very honest town. Taking into account Triv's experience and posting style, it makes more sense to me that he would be very honest town.<br>-There's also his turnaround where he votes me amid orange-colored, all-caps excitement in #110/111. This looks -- again -- like excited town who think they've found a genuine scumslip (or something, I was never too clear on what his reasoning was). This doesn't seem like the kind of thing a new scum player would think to do.<br><br>Zulfy:<br><br>-Not really sure what to make of the early-game pre-flip association stuff. I guess I could see him using it as town as just a thought organizer, but then scum can use those techniques as a means to force their reads into a more genuine-looking perspective. So. Null I guess.<br>-His positioning on the Trivium wagon is prime scum real estate. The positioning is honestly the thing that made me raise an eyebrow when he made the vote. His reasoning, which goes above some other peoples' reasons for voting Triv, are actually not all that bad.<br>-Not a big fan of #191. It's like he's giving himself an out in case he wants to bail from the Trivium wagon.</div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueMoonRising</span><br><br>I think this is a good place to be right now.</div></blockquote><br><br>^ i think that's what triggered makara bus on bmr<br><br>another thing to note:<br>i jumpvoted bmr-&gt;makara BEFORE tool gave his reads while makara did so afterwards"}
