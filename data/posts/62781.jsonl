I will not count any attempts to vote that are not in one of those formats.  Unvotes are not required.<br>3)  No trick voting.  If you try to game the system/trick other players into voting/quickhammering by purposefully voting incorrectly, you will be modkilled if the game doesn't end on its own.<br>4)  A lynch is achieved when half of the living players, rounded down plus one have voted for a player.  Once that event has happened, all votes are locked and twilight ensues.<br>5)  Once you're dead, you're dead.  Please do not post anymore.  If you were replaced out for whatever reason, please do not post in thread.<br>6)  If a majority is not reached at the end of the day, a no-lynch will be achieved.  You have been warned.<br>7)  All night actions will be covered in your role pms.  If you have questions in regards to your role, do not hesitate to ask me in private and I will resolve it ASAP.<br>8)  I will attempt to keep track of the deadline as often as I can.  I will attempt to post the time in every votecount I give you.

If a player accumulates three prods during a day or fails to respond to a prod in 72 hours, I will replace that player.  Lurking is an acceptable tactic; it is up to the town to put a stop to it.  If I get the feeling that you're simply not playing or are prod-dodging to waste a slot, I reserve the right to force-replace you.<br>2)  Prods will only be handed out starting 2 days from day start.  If I feel you haven't responded to prods given earlier in a satisfactory way, I reserve the right to force replace you.<br>3)  If you need to go on V/LA for whatever reason, post in the thread in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold text</span>.  State the length of your V/LA; otherwise, it will be assumed that you will only be gone for 24 hours.  <br>4)  You may not discuss the game outside this thread with other players involved in the game unless you are in cahoots with them (IE: scumteams, masons, etc).  You may have a 'rant buddy' who is outside the game, but I wish to be informed of their identity for replacement purposes.  Don't abuse this.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">If you decide to chat outside of the game, please keep track of the transcripts.</span><br>5)  I am not responsible for your mistakes.  If you screw up a tag or something, I will not edit it for you.  If you have the ability to edit posts, please do not do so.  I will not edit your posts for you.<br>6)  Avatars, titles, signatures, and your location are out-of-game areas.<br>7)  Please do not quote out-of-thread communications.  Modkilling is something that I would prefer to avoid.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Do not tempt my wrath.</span><br>8)  Although somewhat divine, I am prone to mistakes.  If I miss anything, please PM me and I will resolve the issue as best as possible.<br>9)  I reserve the right to remove you if I feel you have crossed a behavioral line.  If I do so, rest assured that you have shit the bed in a manner most foul.<br>10)  I reserve the right to change the rules at my own discretion.  I will notify the thread if/when I do so.<br>11)  Don't make encrypted posts and don't try to pull the wool over my eyes.

I do not know what cedric meant tbh with that statement. The rest of the page one was rvs and early game.<br><br>Then we get to page two. From page one vinkah asked a very suspicious question. I want to know why he was asking whether the vote was serious and I usually do not approve of early questions like that. Zor.... of course you have no leans either way because no one has yet posted anything alignment indicative at the time. Decent wagon? If we get a wagon, we run the risk of a quickhammer. Unless we use the wagon for associatives and reactions, it will not get us anywhere. Think about lack of information that might result from a quickwagon. 34 and 36 cause me to get a slight townlean on vink for the reason that I doubt scum him would say that or even attempt it. 39 gives keynsoke town points due to me thinking that he would not say that as scum either. People are discrediting keyser questions afterwards. I think they helped that time because it helps to know who those players can use meta to figure out. Cedric is being confusing on page two. Why did your vote on hikmbecome serious keyser?<br><br>Page three is a good one to read. BBT questions woody on his thoughts on the hersch wagon. Note that cedric is same person as hersch. I agree that he needs more votes, at that stage anyways. BBT asks  woody why he did not join earlier. Woody, how did you just not notice a wagon when you were posting before that? BBT critiques woodpecker for not paying attention to the wagon that forms. Woody explains it. Keyser makes a good point by questioning the indication that a person not paying attention leaves. I wonder what made woody join the wagon so fast.. more not paying attetion from woody on the same page for the next three posts. Zoronos asks why hasch who is hersch votes me with him tellingmke to explain. Why do you encourage people to vote woody? The post 70 is a useless question. Wooody responds  with a useless filler response. Zoro asks why hasch votes me then shrugs it off as joke?<br><br>Page four is next. Hasch moves on as he sees he is not getting a response from me. Woody acts strange and then comes up with defenses for himself. BBT sheeps an observation and seems arrogant in the first post he makes on page four. Absta states his weak townreads. I do not get why hasch wants key or bbt. Both are townreads for me so far. BBT questions absta and asks for thoughts on woody 97 by woody is sketchy because he states that meta is not used for alignment verification but then states that you can read his games to read him? Also, you state that playstyle is not alignment indicative, but you say that it can be uses to determine alignment? I agree with absta inmpost 98."}

Or are you fabricating them? The next few posts are arguing going on between the two fighter BBT and woody. Again, post 114 by key is solid basic town process of thought. BBT is somewhat arrogant, lessening my town read on him. Why is he so confident in his reads? 119 is not actual defending. The next three posts are town.

This would imply that he had been reading but missed the wagon forming.<br><br>In 63, he claims again that he didn't see the wagon. Again, this implies that he had read the whole game and had simply missed the votes accumulating on Haschel.

His reasoning for ignoring the Haschel wagon very subtly changes and it changes to something that he claims he does all the time.<br><br>The wording of the posts are quite important because he is more relaxed during the earlier posting and it much more likely to make subtle mistakes. As the pressure starts mounting, his story changes to something that he claims he does all the time and I find this super convenient for his situation.<br><br>The other thing that I really don't like is his 'stay with current discussion' comment. The current discussion at that time was ongoing games...what did he expect to gain from that? Once he saw that the discussion was about ongoings why would he a) not read back to see how that topic come up or b) read back to see if there was anything he missed that he could actually comment on and change the current discussion to something useful?<br><br>Quite frankly, if someone either a) doesn't care enough to read the whole thread to gain context or b) quite regularly misses things (convenient play-style for scum, no?) then I don't particularly want them around even if they're town."}

He's attacking a lot of non-alignment indicating posts. This looks to me like the scum pile-on to BBT's train.

Anyhoo, I'm pretty sure my brain glazed over sometime in the last page or two but I do have a couple opinions to bring to the table.<br><br>First off, my number one scumread right now is Banakai.  There have been a few really weird statements, and they started with his first post:<br>[quote=Banakai]Woody: would you care to explain why you are playing so defensive? As a town usually you just have to accept that one of you are gonna die day 1 probbably, and just try and get as much information as possible even when being voted.[...]<br><br>BBT: Do you think there would be any motivation in this game for a scum to tunnel on Woody like you are now?[/quote]<br>The first sentence is oddly fatalistic; if somebody is attack you with crappy arguments (like I believe Keyser and BBT were), it is a disservice to the town to NOT be defensive.  And what is up with that second question to BBT?  It comes across almost like an attempt to bolster a scumbuddy's town cred.  Later on I feel he completely misrepresents WW's statement about \"not needing to scumhunt within the first hours of the game\" and conflates activity with scumhunting, which are obviously not the same.  He then goes on to read redFF as town, but then wavers saying that he posted \"some questionable things\".  The problem is, I don't think any of the things he cites are questionable at all; heck, banakai makes the EXACT SAME JOKE he describes as \"forced\" in post 305. This gives the feeling of somebody trying to set up a reason to later vote for a person they once publicly stated was town.  In fact, this is indeed exactly what he does in 317.  Also in post 305 he says \"The werewolf is probbably not posted enough comments to get noticed by me\".  Anybody see anything weird about that?  Like the attitude that we're only looking for one person and not a partnership?<br><br>Now he votes for Boonskiies, citing a reason that does not apply at all, since Boonskiies did not replace Woody.  However, even after admitting this, he keeps his vote there!  This would be fine, except he doesn't mention any other reasons!  Then instead of giving reasons he claims he was going to post them but \"[boon] just made a case for himself.\"  Really?  An event that happened AFTER your vote can't be your reason for making the vote in the first place; why didn't you post the case you said you already wrote anyways?  Is it because you never wrote up a case at all? (I think it's because you never wrote up a case at all.)<br><br>There's probably some more stuff but damned if I'm wading through 20 pages to find it again.  Nevertheless, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Banakai</span><br><br>As for notes on the others: I mentioned earlier that Keyser and BBT were both making a really awful case against WW and then had even more awful reactions to people pointing that out.  Keyser gives me a sense of sincerity, even though I disagree with a lot of what he says.  He did commit my personal pet peeve of answering a question that was targeted to another player, but everything else about him seems fairly genuine for now.<br><br>BBT does not give me that impression.  His first attack on Woody was disbelief of Woody's claim that he missed the Haschelwagon.  I think this was silly, but then BBT doubles down and starts strawmanning.  His reaction to redFF's reaction to Woody's claim doesn't seem right to me; there is nothing about redFF's post that comes off as \"super fake\" to me.  What DOES come across as fake, though, is his suspicion of absta.  Absta asked for elaboration on the crappy WW case, because elaboration was 100% needed.  He also sets up a false dichotomy:<blockquote><div><cite>BBT wrote:</cite>He goes against me; saying he disagrees with my reasoning and it feels forced.  This would imply he thinks I'm scum, no?\"</div></blockquote>What?  No, it doesn't imply that at all.  Why would you say it did?<br><br>By the by, I find it very hard to believe that he somehow didn't check Woody's join date until post 244.<br><br>Right.  Moving on.<br><br>Bulb is giving a ton of posts that just sort of state what happened, with not a lot of analysis.  I also didn't like him stating that \"Absta is ww or town.\"  Is there a Scummie for Least Hard-Hitting Analysis?  If so, that sentence deserves it.  I also don't like his attitude of \"We can't keep WW til Lylo; may as well get rid of him now.\"  Other than that, though, what analysis IS there doesn't raise any red flags for me.<br><br>redFF is the towniest townie that ever towned a town.  Kmd is raising good points; slight townread there.  The RC situation baffles me a little; his intro post wasn't the best ever, but I agreed with a lot of parts of it and certainly don't think it merits three votes on its own after so many things have happened in the intervening time.  Sure, he's lurking, but so was I.  So was TonyMontana.  So activity can't account for all of it.<br><br>I like Boonskiies post 327 and wish there was some followup there.  I do not like his 329 and would like an explanation.  Then again I really like his self-vote, so you're alright in my book, Boonskiies.<br><br>Absta is a minor scum read due to his statement that Keyser was town near the beginning accompanied by some hedging.  I agree with his point about BBT's attacks on Woody being forced, but I disagree with his belief that Woody is scummy for \"defending instead of finding scum\".  I also don't like his reaction to Boonskiies earlier.<br><br>I don't have anything specific to say about Zoronos but I found myself agreeing with a lot of the arguments he was posting.<br><br>That's it for now.<br><br>-----<br><br>For the record, I have a pretty strong no-playing-with-hydrae policy, so if one replaces into the game, I will replace out.  Usually this isn't a problem, but it has happened before and with Woody's exit I feel everybody deserves a heads-up."}

What was your read on Vinkah and TonyMontana at that time? Do you feel they'd scumhunted better than Woody?<br><br>Boon, when you first came up with your reads, you said something is weird about Bulb. Have you played with him before. Also, making BBT your strongest town read just until you sort him seems weird to me. It has a forced vibe to it. And you don't honestly believe that Keyser was trying to get you replaced for using the Mod's color, right?<br><br>BBT, why does this being an open setup make Woody town? And your confidence isn't my issue. It's the fact that you were voting and pushing Woody, yet you seemed to think that three scum were voting him. It should be obvious why that's an issue.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>BBT wrote:</cite>\u00a0If you agree that there are bad votes on the Woody wagon; why have you done nothing about it?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm voting Absta. He was one of the bad votes.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>BBT wrote:</cite> What you're essentially saying is that I should stop all scum hunting outside of the person I am voting which is preposterous.</div></blockquote><br><br>That's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that if the scum are ALL voting Woody, he's probably town. You seemed to believe this is the case, yet you stayed on Woody. Unvoting Woody there wouldn't show a lack of confidence like you seem to be implying. It would show basic logic. Even if you simply said \"if I'm wrong about Woody, these votes look bad\", it would show the same logic. But you were pushing the two together. I mean, maybe you thought someone was bussing but I didn't get that impression either.<br><br>Absta wanting to give Woody's replacement a \"chance to redeem the slot\" makes me question whether he had a genuine scum read.<br><br>Boon, so was your initial Keyser scum read fake then? If so, why did you pick him and what is your real read on him? 442 is baaaaaaaaad. First of all, Keyser has to be scum for associatives to work, yet you voted RedCoyote. Second, you just implied you no longer think Keyser is scum. So, essentially you are voting RedCoyote for no reason.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Absta wrote:</cite> he [Boon] didn't answer why his reads changed so suddenly</div></blockquote><br><br>Except he did. He said it's because it's so early and his Day 1 reads are never strong.<br><br>Boon, you keep listing me as a scum lean. Any reason why? And I see on your reads list, you still scum read Keyser, so can you explain a little more what you meant by \"using him to insert yourself\" into the game? On Page 19, you said you see where Haschel is coming from. How? He didn't explain any of those reads.<br><br>Zoro, you said Redcoyote and Boon are probably scum. What do you think about Boon trying to push Keyser to vote Redcoyote as soon as he replaced in? (Ignore this if by \"red\" you meant redff)<br><br>I don't like Boon's self vote. It seems like he went out of his way to push that self voting used to be a trust tell for him and then his comment about rarely being lynched when he self votes feels like he never intended to get himself lynched, so what was the point? It feels like a big AtE game to me. Why is no one talking about the fact that he just claimed after putting himself at L-3ish? When Woody claimed, people were upset that he reduced the power role pool for scum if he's town. Boon does it and no one bats an eye. It might be worth lynching Boon over equally scummy players just so we don't have a third claim today.<br><br>Redcoyote, I don't see the reach on my part. The tone didn't seem as genuinely upset as he tried to appear. Redff is also a weak scum read at worst for me. At least Boon, Absta, and BBT are scummier.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Keyser wrote:</cite> Is having a \"giant stick\" up my anus alignment-indicative?\u00a0</div></blockquote><br><br>We need more info on this stick. Just how giant is it? What kind of stick? Does it vibrate? Is it always there or do you insert it only when you come online to play mafia? How long have you had it? Can you take three at a time?

So, yeah, I think this would imply he thinks I am scum, I mean, you seem to imply this in your own post just a little further down;<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7091243#p7091243\" class=\"postlink\">post 502</a>, Haschel Cedricson wrote:</cite>I agree with his point about BBT's attacks on Woody being forced</div></blockquote><br>Which would suggest you also believe forced reasoning to come from scum.<br><br>Can you clarify your problem please?</div></blockquote><br><br>Townies force their reasoning all the time.  Townies can tunnel, and once they go down that rabbit hole there can be a tendency to shoehorn in their suspects posts any way they can to bolster their theory. When somebody is forcing an argument, the question then becomes WHY are they doing it?  Is it because they are looking for a case?  Or is it because they are trying to make up a case from whole cloth? <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7091243#p7091243\" class=\"postlink\">post 502</a>, Haschel Cedricson wrote:</cite>Also in post 305 he says \"<span class=\"noboldsig\">The werewolf </span>is probbably not posted enough comments to get noticed by me\".

Far too often on this site people play right until the very end of the day; there are numerous problems with this.

He says <blockquote><div><cite>Banakai wrote:</cite>Well I'm phone posting so I can't give specifics, but his reads seem to move and shift too quickly with no explanation. And he tries to defend himself basically by calling himself a VI and just declaring he is town. I also know that I would never self vote as town as I see no scenario where it would be helpful.</div></blockquote><br><br>Now, Banakai claims he had a case on Boon that he was going to make in 491, but then didn't.  What was the case?  He wouldn't tell us.  In fact, he told us very little; he kept stalling.  But finally we get this quote from him.  Excellent!  Except there are a few problems with it.  The last sentence? \"I would never self-vote as town as I see no scenario where it would be helpful\"?  Allegedly Banakai already had a case on Boon BEFORE Boonskiies self-voted. So that doesn't bolster his claim that he ever had a case in the first place.  The first sentence about Boonskiies' reads moving and shifting with no explanation?  Sounds reasonable at first.  But is it?  He certainly took his time pointing out examples of this happening.<br><br>And the problem is the examples aren't very good.<br><br>The first reads Boonskiies gives are mild scumreads on Absta and Keyser.  After rereading, he upgrades Keyser to town.  Did this move shift with no explanation?  No.  Boon clearly states that there is a specific quote that changed his mind.  It's not a very strong quote, but who cares?  These are initial reads; Boon had literally just replaced into the game.<br><br>The next time Boon gives reads is in post 330, where his town-scum continuum goes Banakai &gt; Keyser &gt; Absta.  This is entirely consistent with what Boon has said earlier.  Banakai tries to twist this by saying that Keyser has gone from scum to town to neutral.  When there are only three names being ranked, one by definition is going to fall into the neutral zone.  This isn't a read shifting without explanation; it's a read that had already changed being put into a larger continuum.  Keyser is then downgraded back to a scumread.  An explanation is given.  Boon clearly states that while giving pressure first made Keyser seem town, by doing it to everybody it starts to look scummy.  This is reasonable stance to take, particularly on a player that was never a particularly high townread in the first place.  Note that Banakai completely misrepresents this in post 690.<br><br>Next comes Boon's entire town-scum list.  He gives explanations for most of the non-null people.  Note that here Banakai misrepresents him; Banakai claims that \"Keyser is [Boon's] ONLY scum read now\", yet Bulb and Absta are both clearly labeled with the \"lean scum\" color.  This is completely consistent with what Boon has previously said about Absta.<br><br>The next time Boon changes a read is when he moves his RC-read from null-town to scum.  He gives reasons.  Two posts later, he says that Woody seems scum but it could be a playstyle thing.  Those are reasons.<br><br>In 360, Boon reaffirms his BBT and Banakai stances.  No shifting reads here.  In 365, he votes for RC.  Again, no shifting read here.<br><br>In 457 Boon reposts a town-scum list.  The only moves from the previous one are Woody, which he explained earlier, and RedCoyote, which he explained earlier.  Two posts later he unvotes Keyser and votes Absta.  Absta had consistently been presented as in Boon's top-two scumreads.  Unvoting Keyser does not mean he's shifting on his scumread of Keyser.  In fact, he specifically states that Keyser is only being \"switched\" with Absta.  That's not an example of a shifting read.<br><br>In 470 Boon lists me as a townread, upgrading me from null-town.  An explanation is given.  And then Boon votes for himself.<br><br>Now, after this point Boon may very well shift his read on players with no explanation.  But that doesn't matter for our purposes here; Banakai claims that the case he was going to make before Boon voted for himself centered around his reads \"seem[ing] to move and shift too quickly with no explanation.\"  Except that does not happen in the time period where he supposedly was writing this up!  This is why it was like pulling teeth to get Banakai to say any specifics; there were no specifics to get so they had to be made up! He handwaves it away with the phrase \"obvious reasons\", ignores a direct question to elaborate, speaks as generally as he can in his eventual reply that he has to be prompted to give, gives a non-answer of \"me and others have already said it\" when asked for specifics, stalls YET AGAIN when asked for specifics, and then tries again with \"Everything has already been said and I don't feel the need to go over every one of his posts.\"  I have never seen anybody work so hard to avoid answering a question.  And the only motive for that is because he's scum and doesn't have a real case.  Oh sure, NOW he can claim that Boonskiies' claiming of VT is behind Banakai's vote, but remember, that cannot be applied to the original case Banakai claims to have had.<br><br>Finally, remember this? <blockquote><div><cite>Banakai wrote:</cite>I'd hardly call my read passionate/determined when haschel basically forced me to make a case</div></blockquote> I didn't force him to make a case; I forced him to tell us the case that he claims he already had, and now he tries to twist it around like I'm the bad guy for doing so?  He was voting Boonskiies for \"obvious reasons\" but now he's lukewarm to his entire read?  Nonsense.  This guy is absolutely our lynch today."}

At any rate, if you JUST made this new one, and you discarded the old one a long time ago, then why has your vote not moved at all in the intervening time?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7105554#p7105554\" class=\"postlink\">post 734</a>, Banakai wrote:</cite>The above is the reason I discarded the case.

At any rate, in that explanation your saying that when you made the case originally you were unsure, but now you're convinced.  You also say you made the case you're passionate about right before you posted it, and therefore have discarded the original crappy one.  Yet your phrasing suggests you haven't discarded it after all, and in fact believe in it more than ever?  That doesn't make sense."}

Anyhoo, I'm pretty sure my brain glazed over sometime in the last page or two but I do have a couple opinions to bring to the table.<br><br>First off, my number one scumread right now is Banakai.  There have been a few really weird statements, and they started with his first post:<br>[quote=Banakai]Woody: would you care to explain why you are playing so defensive? As a town usually you just have to accept that one of you are gonna die day 1 probbably, and just try and get as much information as possible even when being voted.[...]<br><br>BBT: Do you think there would be any motivation in this game for a scum to tunnel on Woody like you are now?</div></blockquote><br>The first sentence is oddly fatalistic; if somebody is attack you with crappy arguments (like I believe Keyser and BBT were), it is a disservice to the town to NOT be defensive.  And what is up with that second question to BBT?  It comes across almost like an attempt to bolster a scumbuddy's town cred.  Later on I feel he completely misrepresents WW's statement about \"not needing to scumhunt within the first hours of the game\" and conflates activity with scumhunting, which are obviously not the same.  He then goes on to read redFF as town, but then wavers saying that he posted \"some questionable things\".  The problem is, I don't think any of the things he cites are questionable at all; heck, banakai makes the EXACT SAME JOKE he describes as \"forced\" in post 305. This gives the feeling of somebody trying to set up a reason to later vote for a person they once publicly stated was town.  In fact, this is indeed exactly what he does in 317.  Also in post 305 he says \"The werewolf is probbably not posted enough comments to get noticed by me\".  Anybody see anything weird about that?  Like the attitude that we're only looking for one person and not a partnership?<br><br>Now he votes for Boonskiies, citing a reason that does not apply at all, since Boonskiies did not replace Woody.  However, even after admitting this, he keeps his vote there!  This would be fine, except he doesn't mention any other reasons!  Then instead of giving reasons he claims he was going to post them but \"[boon] just made a case for himself.\"  Really?  An event that happened AFTER your vote can't be your reason for making the vote in the first place; why didn't you post the case you said you already wrote anyways?  Is it because you never wrote up a case at all? (I think it's because you never wrote up a case at all.)<br><br>There's probably some more stuff but damned if I'm wading through 20 pages to find it again.  Nevertheless, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Banakai</span><br><br>As for notes on the others: I mentioned earlier that Keyser and BBT were both making a really awful case against WW and then had even more awful reactions to people pointing that out.  Keyser gives me a sense of sincerity, even though I disagree with a lot of what he says.  He did commit my personal pet peeve of answering a question that was targeted to another player, but everything else about him seems fairly genuine for now.<br><br>BBT does not give me that impression.  His first attack on Woody was disbelief of Woody's claim that he missed the Haschelwagon.  I think this was silly, but then BBT doubles down and starts strawmanning.  His reaction to redFF's reaction to Woody's claim doesn't seem right to me; there is nothing about redFF's post that comes off as \"super fake\" to me.  What DOES come across as fake, though, is his suspicion of absta.  Absta asked for elaboration on the crappy WW case, because elaboration was 100% needed.  He also sets up a false dichotomy:<blockquote><div><cite>BBT wrote:</cite>He goes against me; saying he disagrees with my reasoning and it feels forced.  This would imply he thinks I'm scum, no?\"</div></blockquote>What?  No, it doesn't imply that at all.  Why would you say it did?<br><br>By the by, I find it very hard to believe that he somehow didn't check Woody's join date until post 244.<br><br>Right.  Moving on.<br><br>Bulb is giving a ton of posts that just sort of state what happened, with not a lot of analysis.  I also didn't like him stating that \"Absta is ww or town.\"  Is there a Scummie for Least Hard-Hitting Analysis?  If so, that sentence deserves it.  I also don't like his attitude of \"We can't keep WW til Lylo; may as well get rid of him now.\"  Other than that, though, what analysis IS there doesn't raise any red flags for me.<br><br>redFF is the towniest townie that ever towned a town.  Kmd is raising good points; slight townread there.  The RC situation baffles me a little; his intro post wasn't the best ever, but I agreed with a lot of parts of it and certainly don't think it merits three votes on its own after so many things have happened in the intervening time.  Sure, he's lurking, but so was I.  So was TonyMontana.  So activity can't account for all of it.<br><br>I like Boonskiies post 327 and wish there was some followup there.  I do not like his 329 and would like an explanation.  Then again I really like his self-vote, so you're alright in my book, Boonskiies.<br><br>Absta is a minor scum read due to his statement that Keyser was town near the beginning accompanied by some hedging.  I agree with his point about BBT's attacks on Woody being forced, but I disagree with his belief that Woody is scummy for \"defending instead of finding scum\".  I also don't like his reaction to Boonskiies earlier.<br><br>I don't have anything specific to say about Zoronos but I found myself agreeing with a lot of the arguments he was posting.<br><br>That's it for now.<br><br>-----<br><br>For the record, I have a pretty strong no-playing-with-hydrae policy, so if one replaces into the game, I will replace out.  Usually this isn't a problem, but it has happened before and with Woody's exit I feel everybody deserves a heads-up.[/quote]</div></div></div>"}

I mean, the fact that you knew the wagon sucked yet continued to vote Woody threw me off. But it was probably just that you don't verbalize things the same way I do. Like I said, I'd have been second guessing the Woody vote in your spot if I saw vote after vote after vote that completely sucked ass. It came off like you knew he was going to flip scum. Your explanation that the bad votes weren't necessarily scum clarifies that and to be honest I'm starting to doubt my initial scum read on you especially as I read your exchange with redff and you look good there and I could maybe even vote redff. However, we've had two claims today and we know we have a seer so drawing out a third claim is suboptimal when you consider Boon has a good chance of flipping scum. I really think Boon needs to be today's lynch. Absta is making pretty good points on Page 29. Boon has already shown that his experience with you will influence things that he does in this game. He listed you as a top town read because he found it easiest. I can all but guarantee that if Boon recieved a scum PM and noticed that you are in this game, his thought was \"I can't play to my scum meta\". Based on the things you two have said about his play, he must expect that if he comes of VIish, that's his best chance to get you to write him off as town. It would also explain the buddying. He's playing you and it's working."}

Tony is also phrasing it in a way to suggest that it's an annoyance, rather than a way to determine alignment (which, as noted, I think it is). He doesn't like it; he doesn't find it scummy / towny / etc, he just gets annoyed by it. That suggests to me that he's not interested in understanding Bulb's alignment."}

Had absta shown a willingness to lynch Banakai?  Why did Banakai come in all \"F\" this?"}

I was prosecuting my scum reads before I left for V/LA (they didn't include Ban). I questioned him when I felt it relevant (in the 300's). I had him as a null before I went V/LA, and by the time I came back and re-read, I had him as town. Now you're using being unavailable as part of a scum case, even though two of three posts I did make while V/LA addressed Banakai. If you're making an ex post facto that I should have in hindsight thought Ban was scum and thus questioned him (when I very clearly did not think he was scum, other than a single incongruous town read on RedFF, as I was constantly enumerating my scum reads), then it's time for fallacy referee gifs.<br><br>As to showing how they're underwhelming - You've done nothing of the kind. He was in my null column, then in my town column. If you'd like to show how my reasoning is wrong, I'm all ears, but you've done nothing of the kind. You've yelled the same thing over and over, even when disproven; 'you ignored him!' when I clearly didn't. I specifically included him while catching up. You admitted you missed the existence of 810 entirely, but reading it doesn't change your conclusion (even though it invalidates your position that I ignored him). You're also assuming that responding to requests for a read is a form of avoiding, rather than failure to responding to requests being avoiding. That's so backwards I don't even know how to argue with it. \"When asked for a read, you gave one! How dare you avoid him like that!\"<br><br>He wasn't a focal point of my opinions this game; he wasn't one of my scum reads. I gave him a focused read when I caught up, just as I did the other two leading wagons (hint: Conclusions are in 810. I thought he was town), but I never claimed he was a focus of my views this game. Pretty sure I've never denied that, contrary to your statements.<br><br>(I also didn't make 15 posts without mentioning him. I just counted since you mentioned it. There was a stretch of 12 where I didn't, but I'm pretty sure that's not a scum metric. As it turns out, I talk about my scum reads much more than my null reads, and when I have 3 scum reads in an open setup where there are 3 scum, I'm pretty okay with that.)<br><br>The meta argument is great though. \"I don't expect town to argue via logic and showing clearly how the posts don't support my conclusions!\". I showed you how you were wrong. Changing your opinion in the face of facts would have been towny.<br>That you continue to double down on a bad case is not. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: KMD</span>"}

I said it was irrelevant. I'm saying Ban hardly shows up in you ISO except in response to Haschel. This is true whether you have 5 posts or 500. You've been here enough. You've posted content. Ban wasn't a big part of that content. Ban flipped scum and was discussed enough to end up lynched. I've explained why this concerns me and your activity has nothing to do with it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoro wrote:</cite> As to showing how they're underwhelming - You've done nothing of the kind. He was in my null column, then in my town column. If you'd like to show how my reasoning is wrong, I'm all ears, but you've done nothing of the kind. You've yelled the same thing over and over, even when disproven; 'you ignored him!' when I clearly didn't. I specifically included him while catching up. You admitted you missed the existence of 810 entirely, but reading it doesn't change your conclusion (even though it invalidates your position that I ignored him). You're also assuming that responding to requests for a read is a form of avoiding, rather than failure to responding to requests being avoiding. That's so backwards I don't even know how to argue with it. \"When asked for a read, you gave one! How dare you avoid him like that!\"</div></blockquote><br><br>I showed it was underwhelming from my very first post on the subject. You had him as null as you've admitted and didn't seem concerned about giving an opinion until Haschel wanted one. And I love how I'm \"moving goal posts\" and \"yelling the same thing over and over\" at the same time.<br><br>I'm also not saying that responding to things is the same as avoiding. Town and scum should respond to everything. The fact that you are doing so is therefore a null tell. The mentions of Ban in response to Haschel are null by that logic. The mentions of Ban that are NOT in response to anyone, and there are exactly three if you count the first conversation with him as two, really don't convince me you were attempting to get a read on him, hence underwhelming. The thought that responding to people is avoiding things is ridiculous and your attributing that to my case is a blatant misrep just like your moving goal posts comments.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoro wrote:</cite> I never claimed he was a focus of my views this game. Pretty sure I've never denied that, contrary to your statements.</div></blockquote><br><br>In 1022, you told me you addressed him multiple times. To me, that implies you put at least some focus on him. And again, I've shown that saying you addressed him multiple times is a huge exaggaration of what you actually did as it relates to Ban.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoro wrote:</cite> (I also didn't make 15 posts without mentioning him. I just counted since you mentioned it. There was a stretch of 12 where I didn't, but I'm pretty sure that's not a scum metric.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not the point. You were using your V/LA as a reason for not mentioning him. I responded by saying you made plenty of posts after that 300ish or whatever it was where you asked him about reads and didn't follow up.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoro wrote:</cite>\u00a0As it turns out, I talk about my scum reads much more than my null reads, and when I have 3 scum reads in an open setup where there are 3 scum, I'm pretty okay with that.)</div></blockquote><br><br>Do you disagree with the generalization that scum tend to talk less about their scum buddies? If so, we both have a point and it's up to everyone else to determine which of these two scenarios is most likely.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoro wrote:</cite> The meta argument is great though. \"I don't expect town to argue via logic and showing clearly how the posts don't support my conclusions!\". I showed you how you were wrong. Changing your opinion in the face of facts would have been towny.That you continue to double down on a bad case is not.\u00a0VOTE: KMD</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't intend to use your meta because I'm not familiar with it. And you didn't show I was wrong. You found one of very few Ban mentions that I happened to miss and that mention didn't blow me away with a \"wow, this can't possibly come from a scumbuddy\" vibe.<br><br>Also, the OMGUS is funny after I just pointed out that you weren't specifically calling me scum yet. I expected it much sooner than this. *shrug*<br><br>So to everyone else, aside from all this....<br><br>I was waiting for BBT to say it first, but I agree that he had options other than putting himself out there by bussing if he was scum. I've been finding him more and more town as the game has progressed. Dr Who is also pretty town still. <br>But...<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dr Who wrote:</cite> The initial Ban wagon got up to 5 votes with BBT being the fifth by post 788. When voting, you made a point to start to end the game Day with 5 real days left. I think you wanted to give Ban enough time to claim he was the Seer.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is a huge stretch.<br><br>Doctor Who, you mentioned you've been BBT's scum buddy before. Have you played with town BBT before? If so, what is he doing here that matches his scum meta? I only ask because you brought up his meta. I'd like to see that this is for legitimate reasons.<br><br>Absta's BBT case is just plain wrong, but I'll wait for BBT to respond first of course."}

That goes from passively dismissing the wagon on Banakai (not my prefered lynch, but maybe!) when it's still small and scrawny to passively discarding it (not seeing overtly scummy behavior). I dispute Zoro saying he had a strong, vocal townread on Banakai. I think it was much more hushed. Instead he focuses his energies on stroking BBT's ego with a late TonyMontana push that was ill-concieved and last minute. BBT acknowledged that (despite, regrettably, going forward with it anyway), but Zoro egged him on, I think. Evidence of this: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101773#p7101773\">670</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7114158#p7114158\">850</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7116932#p7116932\">904</a>. <br><br>Right now, I'm thinking BBT is legitimately, but overly paranoid, town. Zoro is a Banakai ally that tried to steer the conversation away from Banakai. He did so feeding on BBT's paranoia and TM's loner mentality."}

I'm kind of embarrassed about this because I'm realising it's based on meta but I'm extremely comfortable with my ability to read Boon and he is town this game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7130823#p7130823\" class=\"postlink\">post 1046</a>, absta101 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@BBT</span><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7129434#p7129434\" class=\"postlink\">post 1007</a>, BlueBloodedToffee wrote:</cite>Will post later but Zoro looks a pretty good vote.</div></blockquote>Explain this please.</div></blockquote><br>Kmd has pretty much covered anything I could say.

This is not critical thinking and I'd be voting Boon if I didn't believe he doesn't look like a Ban buddy.

I'll revisit this when I've read more.<br>198: ok guess I didn't have to read much more. Someone questioned him on the redff comment and he gave nothing. I'd think he'd make up a reason for town reading a buddy. Town lean.<br>248: presses BBT to answer his earlier question.<br>253: restates his BBT question. It's getting harder to see any possibility BBT is scum as Ban focuses on this more.<br>257: starts to reverse his redff stance. Going after what he percieves to be an easy town target? Maybe testing waters?<br>272: more pressure on BBT<br>305: I feel like he's more relaxed answering Zoro than Keyser, but maybe I'm confirmation biasing here. Still, calling redff scum now means redff is probably town.<br>317: votes redff<br>472: votes Boon and calls him an idiot. Also calls Woody an idiot. Both slots are town.<br>473: Thought Boon replaced Woody. Again, both slots are town.<br>491/499: Boon case. Boon is obvtown.<br>628: can't help but wonder if there was a wagon on one of his buddies here. Said he can understand some cases but they arent screaming scum. Quick check shows only Boon and Absta had multiple votes and he mentioned Boon seperately before that comment. So maybe Absta is his buddy?<br>832: I omitted a ton of posts about Boon because I've established he's town. But here, he has Absta as town and Boon as a preferred lynch and willing to compromise to TonyMontana. Is this town points for TonyMontana?<br>838: points out that TonyMontana might be scum lurking to avoid being investigated. Bad logic, but whatever. He's going after TonyMontana. Tony is actually probably town.<br>920: more of the same.<br>964: he's dead<br>968: Keyser is probably town<br><br>Conclusion: pretty sure it's Zoro/Absta. Doctor Who, BBT, Boon, redff, and TonyMontana are town. I notice little to nothing about Bulb and RedCoyote, but they were early on the wagon so I'm not concerned. And Keyser is probably town. I mean, if I'm wrong on Zoro and Absta I don't even know where to look. Maybe RedCoyote did a good job bussing? Maybe he and TonyMontana decided one of them is going down so they may as well distance? I don't even know. I feel like it has to be Zoro and Absta. <br><br>Now I'm off to read about what Keyser and BBT thought when they ISO'd Ban. This should be interesting."}

Right before he said he was working out whether absta was the third scum or not, he'd been pushing absta to the point that absta accused him of confirmation bias. Zoro even acknowledged he may be confirmation biasing. Then he suddenly makes the comment about Boon and redff being scum and how he's still working out whether absta is or not.

Well, it went nowhere, so what did you learn, Bulba? He doesn't talk about this at all. This is more padding. He's not serious about this at all.<br>3) Why is it so hard for him to list his town/scum reads? Who are \"a few others\"? Why is he so secretive? To his credit, he called Zoro town, but then he disappeared. Why didn't get try to sell anyone on TM? Why did he more or less just accept the Zoro lynch?<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Bulbazoor</span></div></blockquote><br>This is a straight out lie.

You can get there on your own. You don't have to follow me at all. Get there yourself. Go read him yourself. I arrived to this conclusion after a pure, clean readthrough of his posts when Zoro flipped town. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>absta 1331 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Boon</span> - What in the fucking shit was that vote yesterday, Zoro was a town read for you so why did you hammer him so quickly? You didn't even wait for Tony to respond, you just lynched him as soon as you could.

I think it's fine if they claim. If they don't want to, that's fine as well, but you must admit there's benefit to having a claim come out now when we have plenty of time to analyze it as opposed to a hypothetical situation where there's 24 hours left and the person being wagoned claims Angel. If that person is scum and the real Angel happens to be V/LA... that screws the town potentially out of two town players (lynching one and another one shot). If that person is town and the Angel, we have to scramble for a last minute wagon. Neither scenario is optimal.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>absta 1333 wrote:</cite>However, zoro has since flipped town and so chances are, one of RC/Keyser are scum. Keyser is still a town read to me which leaves RC as the scum.<br><br>The way I see it, scum is in Tony, Redff and RC. The former two are stronger reads atm.</div></blockquote><br><br>That wasn't as strong of a point as it seemed at the time when Kmd made it. I also still think KS is town. It just to happens, possibly, that the scum laid off the wagon. Perhaps because they were already in the tank for townZoro? This points to Bulba as scum and you cannot deny this, absta.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bulba 1334 wrote:</cite>This is a straight out lie. I have listed my read.

Because you haven't done one iota of work since MAYBE D1. Even then to say you did work would be generous. Most of your posts were summations. I was fooled by it earlier, but I have since realized how clearly of a scum tactic it was."}

Let's table these players for tomorrow and focus instead on Bulba. Why should we focus on Bulba, you may ask. It's primarily because of the way he acted toward the Zoro wagon.

He let his vote linger uselessly on TM while Zoro was reaching a fever pitch, completely uninterested in looking at alternatives. This doesn't add up.<br><br>absta, I know you are strongly skeptical of me being town, I've got to reach out to you and get you to go with me on this one. I'm not doing this on behalf of redFF or you. I don't want either of you lynched today.<br><br>I was confident on Zoro and that turned out to be wrong, but I'm even more confident about Bulba. <br><br>At the very least, can everyone acknowledge that Bulba has felt zero pressure in this game and has very effectively been hiding in plain sight the entire game? Moreso than any other role slot that's currently alive. Including TM and DW. DW and TM both got a little pressure on D1, but Bulba has yet to have any serious wagon on him at all.<br><br>BBT, I acknowledge that we didn't see eye-to-eye on Zoro and I kind of ran roughshod over you yesterday.

He never reinforced his Banakai read. He never engaged Banakai at all (:!:) which is odd for a town player, imo. You'll never convince a player he is scum, but usually there is back and forth going on to influence other people. Bulba spent the rest of D1 trying to get people to look at BBT, TM and KS as possible alternatives to be lynched. While his vote initially was decent, it never felt like he wanted the Banakai lynch to me (whereas you look at a player like HC, he spent a lot of time trying to sell the Banakai wagon after he voted him... or look at me on Kmd on D2, another flipped townie that consistently kept coming back to Zoro. This is what townies do when they suspect someone and vote them.) This gives me all the vibes of a scum bussing a partner. <br><br>In D2, after voting TM, the only thing Bulba does is tell us how strong of a Zoro townread he has. Notice how he never attempts to stop the Zoro wagon. He never attempts to provide alternatives in TM or BBT (presumably still his major scumreads). Completely unlike D1, he's content to let his vote sit uselessly and lurk the rest of the day out. He doesn't really want the Zoro wagon to stop, he just wants to be on record as telling it to stop. Actions speak louder than words. In D1, he did everything he could to point to alternatives to Banakai. He kept his vote on him because he wanted the credit for lynching him should it happen, but he wanted other people to start up another wagon on a town player (incidentally, if Bulba is scum, BBT and TM should get townpoints), but in D2, he did no such posturing. Bulba got what he wanted with his vote on D1 but not the end result. In D2, he got what he wanted in his vote and with the end result. And you can tell by the way he acted at the ends of the respective days the difference in attitude."}

I challenge all players to go back and look at these posts. Every other post you spent trying to talk up other players as scum (BBT, TM) and never once engaging Banakai at all. Never once. You never questioned your vote. You never sought to encourage other people to look at Banakai. You just sat there trying to talk the town onto other wagons.

Kmd was kind of an odd kill because Zoro was gunning for him yesterday pretty hard. <br><br>Anyway, okay, so, there were only two people that were pushing townreads on Zoro without articulating them. Boon and Bulba. Bulba has continually shirked any sort of duties and has been really starting to get under my skin. His Zoro read was particularly lame. He thought Zoro was town, but did very little to stop that lynch. BBT, to his credit, worked very hard to put the brakes on it. I do not think scum would've been as strong as he was in his fight to stop the wagon. Boonskiies is so hard to read, but despite him ignoring this game, he has the benefit of shenanigans from earlier on when he claimed. I don't like the way he's playing, but I also don't think it's particularly pro-scum. Bulba is the only player that wasn't voting Zoro, called him town, but never really tried to get an alternative lynch going. BBT fought tooth and nail to get redFF as a candidate. I wish I could just say, \"well, I was wrong about Zoro, so I guess I'll just follow BBT's lead\", but I do not think, in my heart of hearts, that redFF is the best lynch today. He could very well be scum, but Bulba is the player I feel most comfortable lynching today. He hasn't been using his vote effectively at all (sans voting Banakai D1). He voted TM late D2 and never moved it. The vote was a crappy vote, too.

Boon, BBT, and Bulb are unknown.<br><br>The three B's show up a lot together, but given the likely Bulb catch by the seer, Boon and BBT wouldn't be scum together.  I think they just like to be on wagons.  A lot of the interaction between Boon and BBT indicates that either would finger the other if they were scum.<br><br>Day 2 - Boon quickhammers.  do you really think that after scum was lynched day 1 that no scum would be on the day 2 town lynch wagon?"}

Note Banakai hadn't voted yet - he hadn't posted before that but when he did show up he said he'd have supported it.  Either you think DW is scum, or the remaining scum is on my wagon.<br><br>Day 1 Wagon 2 - absta is town, you'd expect scum to support it, Boon, BBT, and redFF are left.  If you think scum didn't support it, you'd look at me and Keyser.  For any given five players, don't you think there would be a scum in there, especially since the wagon was on town?<br><br>Day 1 Wagon 3 - Banakai.  You can see that scum were supporting both leading wagons.  Do you think the remaining scum would support a wagon on a scumbuddy at that point?  If you do, look at BBT and Boon.<br><br>Day 1 Wagon 4  - BBT dropped off, but then came back.  I think Banakai rage self-hammered since his scumbuddies Bulb and redFF hadn't even bothered to move their votes since Wagon 3.  There is no way that all three scum voted day 1 (without daytalk) to vote one of their own out.<br><br>Day 2 - Boon quickhammers.  do you really think that after scum was lynched day 1 that no scum would be on the day 2 town lynch wagon?  This points to Keyser, redFF, and Boon.<br><br>Day 3 - If you believe scum weren't on the wagon, then suspect BBT.  Otherwise Boon, Red, Keyser, and me."}

Keyser is the only person on both those wagons. It's a minor point, but it caught my attention. Another thing that caught my attention is Keyser being reluctant to join wagons - he sits in the 'Not Voting' section way too much for my liking, especially for someone as active as he was.<br><br>OK, so starting from the beginning I focused on what happened to the Woody wagon - Keyser was first to unvote. I initially thought this unlikely to come from scum because Woody just kept getting scummier with every response, however, after looking over Keyser's post I don't really get why he unvoted? Like, he seems to suggest he unvoted because Woody is an easy lynch...not because he has done anything town. In fact, in his unvote post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7086810#p7086810\">207</a>) he outright states that Woody has reacted 'negatively/poorly' to the pressure applied on him.<br><br>I think Keyser was jumping off a wagon that he expected to go through. The timing of it is interesting as well because it's not long after Bulba joined it - two scum on an early wagon like that isn't ideal for VCA purposes.<br><br>Next, we see the arrival of two new wagons - Boon and Absta (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7093031#p7093031\">550</a>). We can see the Absta wagon was town driven - town driven wagons are like a goldmine for scum. Boon and Redff hop on board the Absta wagon. I feel like Redff's vote is solidly reasoned in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7092228#p7092228\">531</a>, Boon's however, is not.<br><br>Boon's scumread on Absta starts back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7089071#p7089071\">326</a> - it's very vague though. He 'doesn't like Absta's answers to some of the questions', he does elaborate a little further in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7089073#p7089073\">327</a> but it's weak and I don't know how Boon is getting a scum read from that post. He states in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7089359#p7089359\">338</a> that he is null/lean scum on Absta - does this read ever change? From 338 until Absta was lynched, did Boon ever reevaluate that read? In fact, I'm struggling to remember Boon reevaluating any of his reads and this is a serious red flag for me - he is repeating the exact same behaviour with Redff now.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7090412#p7090412\">459</a> and Asbta becomes his top scum read...he begins to think Keyser could be town. Note - there is no elaboration on his earlier reasoning for Absta being scum.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7090780#p7090780\">485</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7090784#p7090784\">487</a> - This is reaching. Boon is looking hard to find reasons to justify his vote, he knows his earlier reasoning isn't solid enough to push that wagon. Fuck, Boon might be scum. Is that why I'm still alive? You want bragging rights Boon? I have pretty much had you as town all game and have paid very little attention to you up until now.<br><br>Up to VC in 55p - breaking it up in the hopes people actually read what I'm saying.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br>PEdit - Red, can you not like lie down and die please?

We know Banakai is pushing the Boon wagon - ballsy move if Boon is his buddy but certainly possible. We also know Bulba is not voting - what is Banakai's other buddy doing? Surely both scum are not sitting in the 'Not Voting' section as their buddy starts getting some heat? I think the other scum is much more likely to be pushing another wagon - making sure their vote counts. This, again, points to Redff and Boon. For reasons explained earlier, Boon is much more likely to be scum here.<br><br>Moving onto <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7105049#p7105049\">728</a> - Bulba and Boon have joined the Banakai wagon. They join the wagon on the same page, there's not even 2 hours between the votes. I'm having serious trouble seeing both scum jump on their buddy like that - that would annoy the shit out of me if I was scum being bussed like that. Boon's vote is, again, seriously lacking explanation (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7103901#p7103901\">710</a>). Is this scum theatre? Are Boon and Banakai trying to distance from one another? Banakai's 'case' on Boon was shaky at best and as we can see, Boon's vote is out of the blue. In fact, I noted at the time that the change in Boon's read on Banakai concerned me.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7112628#p7112628\">840</a> is an important VC - we have 3 competing wagons and we know one was on scum and one was on town. The problem is that Absta's wagon has so many unflipped people on it - is this intentional? Is that where the last scum is hiding and he doesn't want to narrow down the lynch options? This is based on Boon not bussing though and I have to admit that I find it hard to believe both Bulba and Boon bussed their buddy like that - seems extreme. Unless Boon prioritised his own life above Banakai's, which is entirely possible.<br><br>The Absta wagon has sprung up from nowhere - this is the second time this has happened. Redff, Keyser and Doctor have joined it. Redff joined the wagon and began pushing it as a 3rd option to Banakai and Boon - starting another wagon to counter Banakai? He can't join the Boon wagon after stating it had 'scummy looking players on it' (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7107194#p7107194\">782</a>) so Absta is his next best thing if he is scum with Banakai and wants to save him. If he is scum with Banakai though, why even mention Boon wagon is bad? He could just jump on it otherwise. Yeah, I'm OK with this vote.<br><br>Keyser's reasoning for hopping on board the Absta wagon is...non existant? (805). Like, he states most of his town reads are on Banakai wagon (great reason to join it, no?) and most of his scum reads are on the Boon wagon but due to him town reading Boon he didn't want to join that wagon either. I actually don't see any reasoning for Keyser joining the Absta wagon other than he doesn't like the two leading wagons at that time...despite having enough reason to jump aboard the Banakai wagon. He states he dislikes the Banakai wagon because of possible opportunistic votes from myself and Asbta - votes that could only be opportunistic if Banakai was town - which we know he was not.<br><br>Doctor's vote on Asbta is also lacking any real explanation - I mean, what the hell was that? (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7110194#p7110194\">808</a>). For that point in the game, Doctor's vote on the Absta wagon was seriously shaky...how the hell did I miss that. I feel scum!Doctor would be much more likely to want to keep Boon alive (because of his antics) than Absta who had spells of solid posting.<br><br>Not much change into <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7115671#p7115671\">891</a> - a Tony wagon picks up and I jump ship from Banakai to Tony.<br><br>Finally, we have the Banakai lynch and a completely unflipped wagon on Absta.

His reasoning can be found in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7135509#p7135509\">1147</a>. I find this vote weak - he essentially votes Zoro for 'no evidence of rereading/rethinking his reads.' I'm not even sure how any of the things Keyser is pointing out points to Zoro being scum - it doesn't make sense to me. Like, he says Zoro didn't explain some of his reads at end of D1 and wasn't online for hammer - how is that scummy? And if it is, I find it hypocritical that you have been scum reading me since D1 and still haven't explained your read on p66. Thoughts and actions are not matching up here.<br><br>Next is redff, his vote can be found in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7147167#p7147167\">1259</a>. This is a perfect example of why you explain your reads and your votes because this vote is scummy as fuck coming from a slot that I am town reading. There is no explanation for the vote, no prior suspicion of Zoro to be found and yet he jumps on the wagon - a wagon I said it would be very easy for scum to join earlier. I really don't like this vote.<br><br>Then we have Boon's hammer - again, a shitty vote. I hate when town do dumb shit like this, it just makes the game harder to figure out. Like, Keyser's vote out of the 3 is the most explained (even if the reasoning is weak) and then we have two really bad votes (one of which we know has to have come from town) so it's pretty shitty play tbh. Funnily enough, it's the vote that is accompanied by the shitty reasoning that I find the scummiest.<br><br>I find it extremely hard to imagine that the last scum is not on that wagon. Right now, it's Keyser &gt; Boon &gt; Redff for me."}
