We have been a peaceful village for some time now.  However, last night, in my home, I heard a bone-chilling shriek.  I stared out the window of my sitting room, and saw a foul sight; by the light of the full moon, a wicked beast struck down a great man of our humble village.</span></span></span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Expendable Edward</span>, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Wildwood Grove Citizen</span></span></span>, was found dead, with his Role PM in hand.

I just want to say that I think that the best time to consider the PL for a Miller claim is either D1 or the day before LYLO (with multiple kills by night, that might not necessarily be a straightforward calculation). I prefer to consider that option later because the claim becomes easier to evaluate as time passes (if we see an investigative role flip, if Rhaegar effectively catches Werewolves, if Rhaegar has associative tells with flipped Werewolves, and so on).<br>The more useful thing about the claim is that it provided a few reactions. I found emogirl123 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7782960#p7782960\">48</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7782987#p7782987\">49</a> to demonstrate a reasonable progression consistent with her actually looking up the Miller role (I wouldn't think that she's one of the Werewolves unless Rhaegar is). The reaction from choof is more difficult for me to read--it's a reasonable thing as Town to want to lynch the Miller as a matter of policy, but at times (especially given the lack of vote there) it seems as though the reaction is more an objection is more to the fact that Rhaegar is being read as Town than an actual desire to lynch Rhaegar. That could come from Town as well, I suppose, but it's not quite congruent.<br><br>I think that I want the things not related to the Miller claim in another post."}

I've seen millers claim first post before and be true (and it's a known strategy for the role).

You didn\u2019t really give him a lot to react to with a naked vote, and I disagree with your point about the questions.

That to me reads like she knows one of the will flip town, so then she can go after the other since she doesn't believe they can both be town. And actually, you literally misquoted her there. Like, you quoted the post and then made your own quote about it. Unless you're talking about what she sad later, but that I can see as her backpedaling to clean up her mess. Like I really hate that she keeps putting half shade on RC. She keeps saying his posts are bad while is calling him VI/ML bait one minute, maybe SK the next, and then has that weird post about him and I being scum together.

This would go down a road where I am convincing you why you are scum. I read RC's case too, and it's not good or bad. It looks to me like a politically correct way of starting a wagon because what he said could be said about anyone. You then went on to comment on two posts by Masq instead of explaining why RC's case wasn't bad. The comments on the two posts by masq again just look null. Masq said earlier that he townread choof which turned into a scumread because choof has been commentating a lot but not pushing any lynches. I think there is nothing wrong with this, but you assert it is a fake thought. Next you assert that Masq's stream of consciousness posting style is scum indicative since you as a town remembers all of your posts. So again, I can't convince you that you are scum. These look to me like you are looking for reasons to justify voting for masq as an exit strategy.<br><br>Yes you did tunnel yessiree. You offered some points, then backed off and voted masq. I'm not saying self preservation is scummy. I'm saying your play is scummy and you still haven't caught up in the game. It really looks to me like you were waiting this entire time for a counterpush instead of trying to catch up and find scum."}

She explicitly said that yes and RC don't seem to be aligned. She didn't they both weren't wolves, she said they were not of the same alignment. That to me reads like she knows one of the will flip town, so then she can go after the other since she doesn't believe they can both be town. And actually, you literally misquoted her there. Like, you quoted the post and then made your own quote about it. Unless you're talking about what she sad later, but that I can see as her backpedaling to clean up her mess. Like I really hate that she keeps putting half shade on RC. She keeps saying his posts are bad while is calling him VI/ML bait one minute, maybe SK the next, and then has that weird post about him and I being scum together. The whole thing feels like she's setting something up for down the line.</div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't respond to this because I didn't want to keep harping on the point. It's a bit of bias because town just lost a game I was in because I was in a TvT that lasted 2 full day phases where it was something like this, and it's a problem with my game, so I'm trying to stop doing that. But since you prompted me, I'll respond.<br><br>\"Yessirree and RC don't seem to be aligned\" does not = they are not of the same alignment. Not in how I read it. <br>\"Aligned\" in this case read as S/S. Aligned meaning knowing they are working toward the same goal, which town don't know about others on day1. If you want to agree to disagree withe me fine, but don't assert that how you read it is \"correct.\"<br>Also, calling Edward's follow up saying that she meant \"they aren't wolf/wolf\" is not definitively a backtrack, it's very plausibly a clarification. Not sure why you can't see it as potentially being that.<br><br>The point about calling RC mislynch bait and then maybe SK a few posts later isn't great, but I read it more as uncertain town. It certainly lacks an apparent agenda in my eyes."}

I don't even get the logic there.<br><br>Yes, the logic doesn't make sense here. I pointed this out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7784550#p7784550\">70</a>. So this shows a lack of understanding that fake claiming miller is guaranteed to be scum. Seems like a meta from a different site and a logical flaw, but definitely not a scum tell. Reads like she believes she wasn't rolefishing and thought Rhaegar was rolefishing and projecting himself onto her.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7786911#p7786911\">172</a>- Votes for yes bc she says he's just trying to look active and pretend he's scumhunting, though I'd argue that up to that point that was exactly what she was doing as well. (Also would like to note, I specifically asked her if she had considered that this his style is the way some people get reactions/reads, and she ignored me. She didn't answer until yes asked it again later on.)<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7779189#p7779189\">173-</a> Seems to be looking for scum motivation where there isn't any in Masqs posts.<br><br>The vote on Masq was bad and I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7779189#p7779189\">623</a> and probably earlier why. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7779189#p7779189\">621</a> she just states that her reads are right and she has explained it. This looks to me like genuinely believing it to be scum motivation. Also there is a theme of ignoring posts from Edward that is constant from the beginning to end to the point that it is a null tell and I don't think she is deliberately doing it.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789146#p7789146\">281</a>- I still think this is setting up lynches. By saying that yessiree and RC aren't the same alignment, she has an easy transition to RC if yes flips town.<br><br>No, we don't need to read that deep. This is saying yessiree and RC aren't scum partners. This is because she stated in the same post that yessiree and RC's post don't appear to be scum theatre. That was the point, not that one of them is scum and one of them is town and she was not setting up lynches.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789149#p7789149\">282</a>- Calls RC VI/ML bait (lol) but 4 posts later in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789191#p7789191\">286</a> says he could be SK (feels like she's leaving it open for a reason to vote him later on).<br><br>Yes RC's posts can be perceived as awful. RC refused to do anything up the GR push and that had little to no substance. Especially when paired up with edward clearly missing posts and misreading the miller claim, I have no reason to doubt his VI read on RC was genuine. Playing awful can be done as SK to avoid being night killed, so the SK comment also makes sense from her position.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789269#p7789269\">302</a>- Emogirl asks Edward if she's skimming or ignoring posts, Edward just kind of waves the question off in a condescending manner. (Why didn't she ask emogirl if there was something in particular she wanted addressed?)<br><br>It's annoying but I think she isn't ignoring posts on purpose. She saw that I voted RC without any reasoning in that post, then I voted choof without any reasoning in that post, so she automatically assume that there are no reasons to which I've voted the two players. She calls my play horrible and goes on to say some posts are not worth addressing. So what I think happened was that she missed the reason why I voted for RC and choof by labeling those posts as not worth addressing, and believes all votes should be accompanied with a few sentences on why. Otherwise its RVS and bad. Again, this looks genuine.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789277#p7789277\">303</a>- Random 180 on Rhaegar that she can't explain. This post just felt off to me.<br><br>Earlier she assumed Rhaegar was fake claiming miller, and realizing that he wasn't brought him to a townread? She accused him of rolefishing earlier and accusing her of rolefishing even though she wasn't. This could be a factor.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7796498#p7796498\">414</a>- Emogirl noted something she thinks could be a scumslip, and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Edward completely ignores the question about it.</span><br><br>Reinforces what I said above about her missing the reasons for why I've voted RC and choof. Admits that she wasn't following my posts. I think it's telling that she couldn't distinguish between my choof and RC vote. This means that she was genuine when she called my vote on choof bad and it wasn't to discredit me.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7804802#p7804802\">510</a>- Naked vote on KTS after having them in her null section, right after doing a \"reaction test\" by voting GR after having him as town. She has 2 apparent scumreads, and votes a null read? And after openly saying that GR was a reaction test, I find it hard to believe that KTS was one as well.<br><br>This is out of place because she literally just said we had 5-6 days to gain majority and we need to decisively pick a lynch. I think KTS has done literally fuck all and townread two people, but this still a bit out of place. Maybe she feels that yessiree/masq wagon won't gain any traction but doesn't want to add to the Panther wagon?<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7809239#p7809239\">551</a>- FINALLY answers about her Masq read after being <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">asked about it repeatedly</span>, and it's extremely underwhelming. It's like she had to go try to find posts that could kind of look bad because we weren't going to stop hounding her about it.<br><br>To be honest I missed this post. It stretched the page so much I scrolled past it and read the next post thinking this post was all quotes. Underwhelming, yes. I actually don't think it answered any questions raised. Again asserts that masq's reaction seems faked. Now comments on how Masq flipflopped reads on choof/Panther because of replacing out. Makes me think she only pays attention to posts with votes since this wasn't the first time masq scumread choof/panther.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7809257#p7809257\">552</a>- Notes mine and RC's convo- implies we're scum coaching each other, but then kind of takes it back? Like wolves have daytalk, why would partners do that? This post felt like she was trying to leave something to go back to if she needed.<br><br>Again this play is consistent with her read on RC/yessiree not being the same alignment. She notes associative tells to help her scumhunt. Earlier she says RC and yessiree talking couldn't possibly be scum talking with scum. Here she says you talking with RC is possibly scum talking with scum but it is so blatant and there is daytalk so it's possibly a null tell. Meaning if there wasn't any day talk, she would associate you with RC.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7809811#p7809811\">570</a>- calls Masq's posts to RC fake, but her whole \"case\" on Masq seems fake.<br><br>I don't think she thinks her case on masq is fake.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7811153#p7811153\">621</a>- Says yes and Masq have the highest chances of flipping scum but still has an unexplained vote on KTS. This close to deadline, you need to be pushing your scumreads.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7811398#p7811398\">629</a>-votes Masq after RCs case. Now, this wouldn't bother me since she was scumreading masq, except it felt like she just hopped on hoping it would gain momentum. Like, there were no questions, no added comments or anything else. And since this is supposedly a big scumread of hers, why isn't she trying to use this to PUSH HER READ instead of just dropping a naked vote?<br><br>This seems like a catch-22. She felt Masq wasn't going to ever gain momentum. Then votes Masq to gain momentum.</div></div></div><br><br>tl;dr I think edward is genuine with her reads and can rationalize all of her plays."}

They may have had a feeling later and then did a reread later and filtered it through lenses that every post of mine must be scum. When I think of the time placement of it though it also is at a weird time. You have me being the current leading wagon when it was posted (or I was tied), most who just plopped a vote haven't been pressured enough to actually get reasons for it. It does look like taking advantage of situation at the time it was posted, though I am guessing if you said nothing and voted and when I flipped town, relooking at the wagon and seeing the unexplained votes would look bad for her. <br><br>I don't know, these are all just thoughts going through my head at this time.

Really couldn't get into that game at all. 1678- that one was rough if I remember correctly, because we had a lot of lurkers and a big fan of quickhammers. Was also one of my first games onsite. I'd say the one I linked is probably best for my current townplay, as I've had a few great players giving me advice and helping me take my play further.<br><br>As for my scum games, those are my only two completed onsite. 1667 I replaced in late game and had to do catch up and then defend my catch up.

Making plays based on expected value is only relevant in cases where you roll SK a significant amount of times (hundreds). Not to mention leading a wagon on mafia might flat out make the second mafia kill you, instead of seeing you as a VI/someone who just policy lynches. Also not to mention I don't think choof or anyone on this site meta cares about +EV plays or what is theoretically correct.</div></div></div><br>I read choof as scummy for disguising a policy lynch and labelled him possibly as a SK. I then read you as scummy for what looks like an informed player playing poorly on purpose.<br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Come on. I don't see anything in your whole case insinuating that I am somehow informed.

If there is a town wagon leading, or better yet, two town wagons leading (as I'm assuming based on my read on Edward) there is no incentive for scum to hop on and be scrutinized in the event of a mislynch. So him not doing so certainly isn't an explicit towntell.<br>Me not parking on a leading wagon should be a towntell.

In retrospect I also dislike the active lurk-vote he placed on RC. It was very early to accuse anyone of active lurking. Sucks he replaced out.<br>Emogirl, can you help me out and tell me where you think choof backtracked? <br>Edward: What specifically pinged you as town from choof?<br>Replacement for choof: What's your opinion on the miller-claim?</div></blockquote><br>I don't want to clog up the thread too much so I'm just going to wait a bit to see if people come in and give my posting a hard look before they make a decision to keep their vote on me or move it elsewhere. A summary of things I have a problem with:<br><br>I find UTL to be the most scummy by way of his over-explained and skewed case against Edward. It partly flies in the face of his 404 where he doesn't really push Edward as scum (he was voting emogirl at that point for harddefending Rhaegars miller claim). And I agree with Dier's previous statement that 404 looks like an attempt to look busy in which he asks a lot of questions (if you look at his ISO, you'll see he doesn't follow up on any of those questions or respond to anyone's answers - so I don't really think he cared and was just trying to look solvey). Votes Edward for not responding to questions about Masq and then develops that lengthy case-post after the fact calling nearly all of Edward's posts scummy. At the present, his vote is still there which means I don't think he's considering responses and re-evaluating, and is content to sit off wagon. [side note that his scum meta looks just like this - particularly the big posts addressing every player with questions to look busy, and casing people by calling a large chunk of their posts scummy. this is notably absent in his town games]<br><br>Killthestory is just a shit poster who has jumped around votes the whole phase and 180d his read on my slot without explanation. The sad part is, he could be town doing that. The shitposting and lack of explanation for reads makes it hard to get a read on him and his death is a net gain for the town imo regardless of his alignment. It's certainly far superior to lynching me.<br><br>Masq - main problem is that he doesn't appear to be solving the game and following progressions. His ISO consists mostly of questions and 171 and 336 pinged me. The vote on me also pinged me, but that could be a me problem. Ultimately his lack of solveyness is apparently a playstyle thing which I just checked other games on. He looked similar in mini1769 before replacing out (slot was VT and ended up lynched day1), and looked similar day1 of Open624. In this game, 664 and 669 seem like genuine town frustration. My conclusion is I don't want to lynch Masq.<br><br>With Rhaegar - not on the table today. I believe the claim until he gives me reason not to. I get a sense of town frustration when he was saying the thread was being generally anti-town and I agree on the points that: Edward's setup spec question, RC's refusal to post until he had no votes, yessirees commentary about emogirl softing a role, and emo explicitly stating that she would read rhaegar as town so hard so scum want to kill him out of POE purposes - all generally not ideal. I think he was a little too focused on making reads based on reactions to his own claim, but I get that from a perspective-standpoint. I think he's wrong on the hard Edward scumread, but I'll get a chance to see if he re-evaluates that. Has lacked involvement in discussion over the last several days which is a letdown for me.<br><br>RC - what an interesting type of player. enigmatic for sure. the early scumread on GR seemed logical (and shared my thought that 203 was really awful) but he kind of left it alone after a certain point, ultimately not concerning. The Masq read/case is logical and I don't have the same problem I had with UTL's Edward case, because I agreed with RC in large part. The things that slightly concern me are: 1) the hard townread on UTL that he refuses to elaborate on despite me asking about it several times. 2) abandoning the Masq wagon if he really felt that strongly about it (but the dislike of Dier's post that made him move votes was ok). So basically the UTL read that is in such contrast with mine, and the lack of elaboration on it, is my concern.<br><br>yessiree - been pretty vocal about him so don't really need to recap it. but I'm perturbed by the tunnel and twisting of my words. he's not going to be lynched today so no need to rehash anything there, but if he's town I hope he can take a step back and have another look at my posts, more objectively, and consider what I've said without the lens of me being scum<br><br>GR - ISO is lackluster (but that appears to just be playstyle) and I disliked 203. but votes on UTL and KTS look good from where I'm at at the moment. The IAI vote looks bad especially because it was never elaborated on. But it was apparently an initial gut read because IAI wasn't as painfully obvious town as he is used to- can't comment to the meta there but it's ~believable. with a gun to my head I'd say his slot is town<br><br>IAI, Dier, Edward, Emo (despite the deathtunnel) are all ok for me right now"}

But when you had written 404 earlier, you only identified scum motivation in 173. <br><br>So that's why I'm saying it sounds forced and made to fit a narrative. You went back and called all those posts scummy that you hadn't previously expressed an issue with or suspicion of.

It partly flies in the face of his 404 where he doesn't really push Edward as scum (he was voting emogirl at that point for harddefending Rhaegars miller claim). And I agree with Dier's previous statement that 404 looks like an attempt to look busy in which he asks a lot of questions (if you look at his ISO, you'll see he doesn't follow up on any of those questions or respond to anyone's answers - so I don't really think he cared and was just trying to look solvey). Votes Edward for not responding to questions about Masq and then develops that lengthy case-post after the fact calling nearly all of Edward's posts scummy. At the present, his vote is still there which means I don't think he's considering responses and re-evaluating, and is content to sit off wagon. [side note that his scum meta looks just like this - particularly the big posts addressing every player with questions to look busy, and casing people by calling a large chunk of their posts scummy. this is notably absent in his town games</div></blockquote><br><br>@UTL - how do you respond? you previously just responded about your meta, but I'd like a reply to this"}

She brushed this off by giving this excuse as she thought kts was doing this \"play\" to draw attention to himself, and that likely came from town. To this day, she still hasn't explained what this \"play\" is, nor why it deserved to be read as town. I went on to insist that this was an inconsistency in edward's reads, to which she disagrees. When I said it was pretty fucking obvious why you couldn't scumread both edward and I it was because, at that point when you posted your 6-page catchup, it was pretty clear how there was no way both edward and I could be scum together.
