I just want to say that I think that the best time to consider the PL for a Miller claim is either D1 or the day before LYLO (with multiple kills by night, that might not necessarily be a straightforward calculation). I prefer to consider that option later because the claim becomes easier to evaluate as time passes (if we see an investigative role flip, if Rhaegar effectively catches Werewolves, if Rhaegar has associative tells with flipped Werewolves, and so on).<br>\nThe more useful thing about the claim is that it provided a few reactions. I found emogirl123 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7782960#p7782960\">48</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7782987#p7782987\">49</a> to demonstrate a reasonable progression consistent with her actually looking up the Miller role (I wouldn't think that she's one of the Werewolves unless Rhaegar is). The reaction from choof is more difficult for me to read--it's a reasonable thing as Town to want to lynch the Miller as a matter of policy, but at times (especially given the lack of vote there) it seems as though the reaction is more an objection is more to the fact that Rhaegar is being read as Town than an actual desire to lynch Rhaegar.

Any hint of a policy lynch on me is not cool, but it is also tempered by being willing to consider my actions and other flips and such, which makes it a little less bad. What makes me want to call him town is in part what happens further on in the post. He points out two posts by emogirl (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7782960#p7782960\">48</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7782987#p7782987\">49</a>) and has a good analysis of why those posts make emogirl a town read. It shows that he is observing the thread well and making sharp observation, he's not only looking for scum but fellow town players.<br>\n<br>\nI also like posts 314-316. All in all, I see a pattern of Diefire making good analysis, asking questions and engaging in the game in a way that is productive.

It comes off as someone genuinely playing the game from a town perspective. There's a lot of posting from emogirl that I haven't been particularly fond of (as I mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7788801#p7788801\" class=\"postlink\">post 270</a>) but I don't think it is anything inherently scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Masquerade:</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Leaning town</div><br>\n<br>\nHe had the most town response to my miller claim in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7785300#p7785300\" class=\"postlink\">post 103</a>.

Because the setup is 2 wolves and 1 SK, she wants to make the point that we should be hunting for the SK instead of wolves.

I don't agree with your point that Masq made excuses for RC this is absurd.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7786926#p7786926\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7786926#p7786926\" data-post-id=\"7786926\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 173</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27649\">Edward Elric</a> wrote:</cite>This doesn't seem like a genuine response to either of these posts.

You then went on to comment on two posts by Masq instead of explaining why RC's case wasn't bad. The comments on the two posts by masq again just look null. Masq said earlier that he townread choof which turned into a scumread because choof has been commentating a lot but not pushing any lynches. I think there is nothing wrong with this, but you assert it is a fake thought. Next you assert that Masq's stream of consciousness posting style is scum indicative since you as a town remembers all of your posts. So again, I can't convince you that you are scum.

She explicitly said that yes and RC don't seem to be aligned. She didn't they both weren't wolves, she said they were not of the same alignment. That to me reads like she knows one of the will flip town, so then she can go after the other since she doesn't believe they can both be town. And actually, you literally misquoted her there. Like, you quoted the post and then made your own quote about it. Unless you're talking about what she sad later, but that I can see as her backpedaling to clean up her mess. Like I really hate that she keeps putting half shade on RC. She keeps saying his posts are bad while is calling him VI/ML bait one minute, maybe SK the next, and then has that weird post about him and I being scum together.

It's a bit of bias because town just lost a game I was in because I was in a TvT that lasted 2 full day phases where it was something like this, and it's a problem with my game, so I'm trying to stop doing that. But since you prompted me, I'll respond.<br>\n<br>\n\"Yessirree and RC don't seem to be aligned\" does not = they are not of the same alignment. Not in how I read it. <br>\n\"Aligned\" in this case read as S/S. Aligned meaning knowing they are working toward the same goal, which town don't know about others on day1. If you want to agree to disagree withe me fine, but don't assert that how you read it is \"correct.\"<br>\nAlso, calling Edward's follow up saying that she meant \"they aren't wolf/wolf\" is not definitively a backtrack, it's very plausibly a clarification. Not sure why you can't see it as potentially being that.<br>\n<br>\nThe point about calling RC mislynch bait and then maybe SK a few posts later isn't great, but I read it more as uncertain town.

I don't even get the logic there.<br>\n<br>\nYes, the logic doesn't make sense here. I pointed this out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7784550#p7784550\">70</a>. So this shows a lack of understanding that fake claiming miller is guaranteed to be scum. Seems like a meta from a different site and a logical flaw, but definitely not a scum tell. Reads like she believes she wasn't rolefishing and thought Rhaegar was rolefishing and projecting himself onto her.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7786911#p7786911\">172</a>- Votes for yes bc she says he's just trying to look active and pretend he's scumhunting, though I'd argue that up to that point that was exactly what she was doing as well. (Also would like to note, I specifically asked her if she had considered that this his style is the way some people get reactions/reads, and she ignored me. She didn't answer until yes asked it again later on.)<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7779189#p7779189\">173-</a> Seems to be looking for scum motivation where there isn't any in Masqs posts.<br>\n<br>\nThe vote on Masq was bad and I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7779189#p7779189\">623</a> and probably earlier why. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7779189#p7779189\">621</a> she just states that her reads are right and she has explained it. This looks to me like genuinely believing it to be scum motivation. Also there is a theme of ignoring posts from Edward that is constant from the beginning to end to the point that it is a null tell and I don't think she is deliberately doing it.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789146#p7789146\">281</a>- I still think this is setting up lynches. By saying that yessiree and RC aren't the same alignment, she has an easy transition to RC if yes flips town.<br>\n<br>\nNo, we don't need to read that deep. This is saying yessiree and RC aren't scum partners. This is because she stated in the same post that yessiree and RC's post don't appear to be scum theatre. That was the point, not that one of them is scum and one of them is town and she was not setting up lynches.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789149#p7789149\">282</a>- Calls RC VI/ML bait (lol) but 4 posts later in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789191#p7789191\">286</a> says he could be SK (feels like she's leaving it open for a reason to vote him later on).<br>\n<br>\nYes RC's posts can be perceived as awful. RC refused to do anything up the GR push and that had little to no substance. Especially when paired up with edward clearly missing posts and misreading the miller claim, I have no reason to doubt his VI read on RC was genuine. Playing awful can be done as SK to avoid being night killed, so the SK comment also makes sense from her position.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789269#p7789269\">302</a>- Emogirl asks Edward if she's skimming or ignoring posts, Edward just kind of waves the question off in a condescending manner. (Why didn't she ask emogirl if there was something in particular she wanted addressed?)<br>\n<br>\nIt's annoying but I think she isn't ignoring posts on purpose. She saw that I voted RC without any reasoning in that post, then I voted choof without any reasoning in that post, so she automatically assume that there are no reasons to which I've voted the two players. She calls my play horrible and goes on to say some posts are not worth addressing. So what I think happened was that she missed the reason why I voted for RC and choof by labeling those posts as not worth addressing, and believes all votes should be accompanied with a few sentences on why. Otherwise its RVS and bad. Again, this looks genuine.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7789277#p7789277\">303</a>- Random 180 on Rhaegar that she can't explain. This post just felt off to me.<br>\n<br>\nEarlier she assumed Rhaegar was fake claiming miller, and realizing that he wasn't brought him to a townread? She accused him of rolefishing earlier and accusing her of rolefishing even though she wasn't. This could be a factor.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7796498#p7796498\">414</a>- Emogirl noted something she thinks could be a scumslip, and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Edward completely ignores the question about it.</div><br>\n<br>\nReinforces what I said above about her missing the reasons for why I've voted RC and choof. Admits that she wasn't following my posts. I think it's telling that she couldn't distinguish between my choof and RC vote. This means that she was genuine when she called my vote on choof bad and it wasn't to discredit me.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7804802#p7804802\">510</a>- Naked vote on KTS after having them in her null section, right after doing a \"reaction test\" by voting GR after having him as town. She has 2 apparent scumreads, and votes a null read? And after openly saying that GR was a reaction test, I find it hard to believe that KTS was one as well.<br>\n<br>\nThis is out of place because she literally just said we had 5-6 days to gain majority and we need to decisively pick a lynch. I think KTS has done literally fuck all and townread two people, but this still a bit out of place. Maybe she feels that yessiree/masq wagon won't gain any traction but doesn't want to add to the Panther wagon?<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7809239#p7809239\">551</a>- FINALLY answers about her Masq read after being <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">asked about it repeatedly</div>, and it's extremely underwhelming. It's like she had to go try to find posts that could kind of look bad because we weren't going to stop hounding her about it.<br>\n<br>\nTo be honest I missed this post. It stretched the page so much I scrolled past it and read the next post thinking this post was all quotes. Underwhelming, yes. I actually don't think it answered any questions raised. Again asserts that masq's reaction seems faked. Now comments on how Masq flipflopped reads on choof/Panther because of replacing out. Makes me think she only pays attention to posts with votes since this wasn't the first time masq scumread choof/panther.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7809257#p7809257\">552</a>- Notes mine and RC's convo- implies we're scum coaching each other, but then kind of takes it back? Like wolves have daytalk, why would partners do that? This post felt like she was trying to leave something to go back to if she needed.<br>\n<br>\nAgain this play is consistent with her read on RC/yessiree not being the same alignment. She notes associative tells to help her scumhunt. Earlier she says RC and yessiree talking couldn't possibly be scum talking with scum. Here she says you talking with RC is possibly scum talking with scum but it is so blatant and there is daytalk so it's possibly a null tell. Meaning if there wasn't any day talk, she would associate you with RC.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7809811#p7809811\">570</a>- calls Masq's posts to RC fake, but her whole \"case\" on Masq seems fake.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think she thinks her case on masq is fake.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7811153#p7811153\">621</a>- Says yes and Masq have the highest chances of flipping scum but still has an unexplained vote on KTS.

Now, this wouldn't bother me since she was scumreading masq, except it felt like she just hopped on hoping it would gain momentum. Like, there were no questions, no added comments or anything else. And since this is supposedly a big scumread of hers, why isn't she trying to use this to PUSH HER READ instead of just dropping a naked vote?<br>\n<br>\nThis seems like a catch-22. She felt Masq wasn't going to ever gain momentum. Then votes Masq to gain momentum.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\ntl;dr I think edward is genuine with her reads and can rationalize all of her plays.", "time": "Wed Apr 06, 2016 7:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65851&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "65851"}

What happened after this was a vote on GR, then a vote on yessiree, and a comment about how all the other wagons suck. You mention that these notes are from your work computer during the weekend. This was posted on Tuesday. So you waited from Friday to Tuesday only to stop reading at post 300 just to push yessiree? Again this shows me that you aren't scumhunting.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">GR looked bad precisely for what I mentioned above. He did not appear to be solving or scumhunting and was largely just an ancillary player to the game. The two particular posts I called out were because I found them to be not solvey. Asking 'who has a townread on UTL is polling rather than giving his own opinion. 203 does read fake. The \"since I got a town role PM\" at the end rang hollow and struggly to me.<br>\nMy comment of \"rough wagons\" was because the lead wagons were me and Edward, who I had just expressed I now had a townread on after reading more of the game. Pretty straightforward there.<br>\nI pushed yessiree for things that I found to be scummy. Been over this point a lot but I think he was miscontruing Edward's comment about RC and yessiree being \"not aligned\" and he was accusing Edward of setting up lynches when I did not see it that way at all.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding my activity- I had another game start that I was focusing my attention on. I knew there was plenty of time to get into this game.

A summary of things I have a problem with:<br>\n<br>\nI find UTL to be the most scummy by way of his over-explained and skewed case against Edward. It partly flies in the face of his 404 where he doesn't really push Edward as scum (he was voting emogirl at that point for harddefending Rhaegars miller claim). And I agree with Dier's previous statement that 404 looks like an attempt to look busy in which he asks a lot of questions (if you look at his ISO, you'll see he doesn't follow up on any of those questions or respond to anyone's answers - so I don't really think he cared and was just trying to look solvey). Votes Edward for not responding to questions about Masq and then develops that lengthy case-post after the fact calling nearly all of Edward's posts scummy. At the present, his vote is still there which means I don't think he's considering responses and re-evaluating, and is content to sit off wagon. [side note that his scum meta looks just like this - particularly the big posts addressing every player with questions to look busy, and casing people by calling a large chunk of their posts scummy. this is notably absent in his town games]<br>\n<br>\nKillthestory is just a shit poster who has jumped around votes the whole phase and 180d his read on my slot without explanation. The sad part is, he could be town doing that. The shitposting and lack of explanation for reads makes it hard to get a read on him and his death is a net gain for the town imo regardless of his alignment. It's certainly far superior to lynching me.<br>\n<br>\nMasq - main problem is that he doesn't appear to be solving the game and following progressions. His ISO consists mostly of questions and 171 and 336 pinged me. The vote on me also pinged me, but that could be a me problem. Ultimately his lack of solveyness is apparently a playstyle thing which I just checked other games on. He looked similar in mini1769 before replacing out (slot was VT and ended up lynched day1), and looked similar day1 of Open624. In this game, 664 and 669 seem like genuine town frustration. My conclusion is I don't want to lynch Masq.<br>\n<br>\nWith Rhaegar - not on the table today. I believe the claim until he gives me reason not to. I get a sense of town frustration when he was saying the thread was being generally anti-town and I agree on the points that: Edward's setup spec question, RC's refusal to post until he had no votes, yessirees commentary about emogirl softing a role, and emo explicitly stating that she would read rhaegar as town so hard so scum want to kill him out of POE purposes - all generally not ideal. I think he was a little too focused on making reads based on reactions to his own claim, but I get that from a perspective-standpoint. I think he's wrong on the hard Edward scumread, but I'll get a chance to see if he re-evaluates that. Has lacked involvement in discussion over the last several days which is a letdown for me.<br>\n<br>\nRC - what an interesting type of player. enigmatic for sure. the early scumread on GR seemed logical (and shared my thought that 203 was really awful) but he kind of left it alone after a certain point, ultimately not concerning. The Masq read/case is logical and I don't have the same problem I had with UTL's Edward case, because I agreed with RC in large part. The things that slightly concern me are: 1) the hard townread on UTL that he refuses to elaborate on despite me asking about it several times. 2) abandoning the Masq wagon if he really felt that strongly about it (but the dislike of Dier's post that made him move votes was ok). So basically the UTL read that is in such contrast with mine, and the lack of elaboration on it, is my concern.<br>\n<br>\nyessiree - been pretty vocal about him so don't really need to recap it. but I'm perturbed by the tunnel and twisting of my words. he's not going to be lynched today so no need to rehash anything there, but if he's town I hope he can take a step back and have another look at my posts, more objectively, and consider what I've said without the lens of me being scum<br>\n<br>\nGR - ISO is lackluster (but that appears to just be playstyle) and I disliked 203. but votes on UTL and KTS look good from where I'm at at the moment. The IAI vote looks bad especially because it was never elaborated on. But it was apparently an initial gut read because IAI wasn't as painfully obvious town as he is used to- can't comment to the meta there but it's ~believable. with a gun to my head I'd say his slot is town<br>\n<br>\nIAI, Dier, Edward, Emo (despite the deathtunnel) are all ok for me right now", "time": "Fri Apr 08, 2016 3:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65851&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "65851"}
