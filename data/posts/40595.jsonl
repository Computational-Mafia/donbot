You live in a small American town and are along for the ride as the country navigates its way through the culture of the decade.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, your town has a problem all its own &#8211; the mafia. Recently, a bunch of leather jacket-wearin&#8217; thugs have moved in and started hustlin&#8217; people at basketball and mugging innocent old ladies at night. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously hurt.<br>\nSo what would any sensible, civic-minded citizen do in these hard times? Bring out the rope, of course! You&#8217;re going to find out who these jerks are and string &#8216;em up before they have the chance to kill somebody.<br>\n<br>\nAnd you&#8217;ll do it all while listening to the likes of Sugarhill Gang, Ratt and Michael Jackson.<br>\n<br>\nPlayer List:<br>\n1. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DOMO</div><br>\n2. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elyse*</div><br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Egg*</div><br>\n4. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">farside22</div><br>\n5. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rhinox</div><br>\n6. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">havingfitz</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Klick*</div> <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Kcdaspot</div></div><br>\n7. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kushm4sta*</div><br>\n8. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">skitzomaniak</div><br>\n9. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">pisskop</div><br>\n10. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SiX</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">GuyInFreezer</div></div> <br>\n11. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jake from State Farm</div><br>\n12. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bjc</div><br>\n13. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">evilpacman18</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">* = one prod</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">2.

Follow the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Forum%20Rules%20and%20Guidelines\" class=\"postlink\">Forum Rules and Guidelines</a>. If you&#8217;re unsure whether something you&#8217;re going to do will break a rule, ask me before you do it.<br>\n2. The only places outside of this thread you are permitted to talk about this game are in mod-provided QuickTopics. Otherwise, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">do not talk about this game outside of the thread while the game is ongoing, even if you are dead.</div><br>\n3. Don&#8217;t quote private mod communication &#8211; this includes, but is not limited to, role PMs, night actions and anything posted in a QuickTopic. You can paraphrase these things, but don&#8217;t quote them.<br>\n4. Play to your win condition (play to win.)<br>\n5. If someone is modkilled, their alignment will change to &#8220;neutral survivor&#8221; and there will be no chance of them winning the game, even if their original faction wins.<br>\n6. I reserve the right to change the rules at any time, including while the game is ongoing, although there will be a warning in-thread if this happens.<br>\n7. Be excellent to each other. Personal remarks and insults are not welcome. There is no problem with criticizing how others play in this game, but as soon as it goes beyond that line there will be one warning before I force-replace you.<br>\n8. Party on, dudes.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Activity rules</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. If a player does not post in the game thread for more than 48 hours, they will be prodded. After this prod, they are given a 24-hour grace period to make a post before I start searching for their replacement.<br>\n2. If a player receives three or more prods, I reserve the right to search for their replacement at my discretion.<br>\n3. Please post V/LA (Vacation/Limited Access) notices in-thread at least 24 hours in advance of them starting.<br>\n4. Game days will be at most 2 weeks long, unless a replacement is required within the last 48 hours of a game day.<br>\n5. Game nights will last 48 hours.<br>\n6. Please keep an eye on your messages for PMs from the mod.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Voting rules</div></div></div><br>\n1. When making votes, use the vote or bold tags. Votes not made using either of these will not be recorded.<br>\n2. When voting, please put your vote at the beginning of a new line. While there is no penalty for not doing so, you put yourself at peril of the mod missing your vote when you don&#8217;t.<br>\n3. Unvoting before voting again is not mandatory.<br>\n4. If one player receives a simple majority of the votes, they are that day&#8217;s lynch and any further voting/unvoting won&#8217;t count.<br>\n5. After a lynch has been made, all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post until I lock the thread. This is the &#8220;twilight&#8221; phase.<br>\n6. If a majority of votes is not reached by deadline, there will be no lynch for that day.<br>\n7. Anybody can vote not to lynch by saying <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>.<br>\n8. Dead players can make one &#8220;bah&#8221; post after their death. This may not contain any information relevant to the game. Once the mod has declared the game over, anybody can start posting in the thread again.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Setup rules</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n1.

I'm gonna do a page by page kind of thing. No comments on Page 1 though. Page 1 was kinda dumb and irrelevant.<br>\n<br>\nPage 2:<br>\nTwo things stand out. Pisskop's callout of evilpacman for something he explained before pisskop even posted stands out. While it's a weak point, that probably would have been the first voteworthy thing I noticed because it looks like he's stretching for a reason to vote evilpacman. Stretching tends to happen on Page 2 though. What it does say though is that these two don't make a ton of sense as buddies because pisskop wasn't paying much attention to evilpacman. It also seems like town would pay attention to the player they think is scum though, so scum voting town or null making a vote they don't give a shit about makes sense here.<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing that stands out is evilpacman saying bjc would be scummy if not for meta because he posted \"distracting\" stuff. I assume you mean Post 14 \"But would you read again?\". Why not call out GuyinFreezer who actually did it first. And there are probably more examples from other players after that too. Why call out just bjc only to excuse it due to meta?<br>\n<br>\nPage 3:<br>\nskitzo's 72 tweaked my gut. Not sure why. Buddying maybe? Could just be the 80's theme though. I dunno.

Wow...<br>\n<br>\npisskop's kush vote makes me wanna lick a cat until I cough up a hairball. And I'm allergic to cats.<br>\n<br>\nPage 5:<br>\nFarside is coming off...I don't even know how to explain it. I almost wanna say... not as experienced as I know she is. She's seeing things in kush's play that aren't even scummy. She's acting like bad town doesn't exist (see post 111). And I don't get why she's asking for Jake's reasoning on the skitzo vote when Kush literally asked the same thing the post just before. I don't know what to make of all of this because it looks like scum who can't fake good town play, but I feel like I remember Farside being good as scum too although it has been a while. The weird thing is, Rhinox's reasons for townreading Farside give me this same vibe about Rhinox.<br>\n<br>\nPage 6:<br>\nSkitzo's reaction to Kush is a logical reaction that I'd expect from town. Just remember, null points being made out to be scum points doesn't make them town points unless the attacker(s) is(are) scum. I'm looking at Farside and/or pisskop.<br>\n<br>\nI like Elyse for town for now. Rhinox too. 132 and 137 give me a change of heart.<br>\n<br>\nFarside's Skitz push is probably even worse than the kush one. First, she unvotes Kush for the same reasons Skitz said Kush isn't scummy (and a couple of other players have since repeated it). Next, she votes the first player to say it for, uh, that very post. Really?<br>\n<br>\nPage 7:<br>\nPisskop, why is there scum in the Rhinox/farside/skitz/bjc discussion?<br>\n<br>\nJake, what is different about Skitz in the other game? And I assume he was town in that game?<br>\n<br>\nPage 8:<br>\nRhinox, I don't read Skitzo's questions as anything scum motivated. I think he's just trying to improve his play by doing exactly what people here, and Mastin, have told him to do which is to ask questions rather than just give opinions. It's coming off awkward because it's not his natural play. And Skitz, don't worry. It'll become more natural as you learn what the right questions are to ask. And there's nothing wrong with just giving opinions sometimes.<br>\n<br>\nKush, I should bite my tongue on this, but I just can't.

Have you ever driven above the speed limit egg? <br>\n<br>\nI dunno if you noticed, but weed is becoming more and more legally accepted. Sorry to go off topic, but I can't leave this alone. The reason weed is becoming more legally accepted is because people are starting to realise that keeping it illegal is basically fascist. It has nothing to do with health. I am legally allowed to drink paint, so long as the intent is not to kill myself. When I smoke a spliff, the tobacco is doing me more harm. Anyone educated on this topic will tell you that. <br>\n<br>\nI agree it's nothing to brag about, but even then I'm guilty of this myself.

If jake is scum, then what he's done is townread farside (who could be scum or town, it doesn't matter), yet refuse to \"scumread\" anyone who is voting for his \"townread\". Why would scum do this? In the hope someone towns him for it? That's a stretch. It's not like all four people on the farside wagon is his scumbuddies. He's basically saying that this wagon feels town motivated, even though he disagrees with it. THIS IS NOT SCUM.

Maybe its just a theory disagreement. Couldn't scum in jakes position just be trying to get some cred for being superficially against a mislynch (hypothetically, qualifiers, blah blah blah) while not exactly doing anything to stop it and hoping it goes? Maybe his scum partners are leading the wagon so \"not seeing a problem with anyone on it\" is just not drawing attention to his partners shitty cases? Conversely, the implication is that if a townie disagreed with the farside wagon, they wouldn't/shouldn't suspect the people on the wagon.

Farside has been all kinds of snarky in this game at points, and I think it may largely have to do with the conversations she's been having with pisskop, yourself, and domo - attitude flying both ways.  That being said, I'll confess to not noticing a difference other than attitude between the two posts in your point #3.

Your meta case comes across to me as someone trying to convince the rest of town, not someone who is trying to figure stuff out.  I'm suggesting that the context of your post comes from a scum mindset, not town, which is a basic psychological evaluation of your post.

There's no established meta for how scum would act when voting who to give a gun to like there is when voting who to lynch. There is no point of reference for how to perform VCA on the gun-vote, so anyone trying to do so would at best be guessing what scum would do based on, well, nothing. Scum can use this to their advantage. At worst, its giving scum influence over where the gun goes, and they would then know who is getting the gun at night and can act to counter accordingly. Giving scum information and influence like this is never a good thing. There's a reason it is universally discouraged for towns to direct PR's. It is better to let the PR's act on their own.

Highly critical of most cases, and he's attacked weak reasoning pretty consistently. At the same time he's basically done nothing EXCEPT pick stuff apart. Very little offense coming from kush except for a push on bjc (I guess you could call this a push), and now spearheading the wagon on me. I'd read that as scummy (just interfering with town and trying to stop a solid wagon from forming), but his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5753659#p5753659\" class=\"postlink\">meta checkup on farside</a> is balancing that out. I don't put much stock in meta - as apparently most people here do - but points 2 and 3 at least were good, valid comparisons.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rhinox</div> - frankly, don't really know when way I swing on this one. I suppose null? He's asked some questions, and is voting me for the questions I <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5742132#p5742132\" class=\"postlink\">asked him previously</a>. Honestly, looking back, it was a pretty shitty time for questions 1 and 3 - I think I felt like a lot more time had passed at the time, but in hindsight: he's right *shrug* nothing I can say about it now. Even with that conceded, I don't think the rest of the post warranted ignoring or voting, but I don't see doing it as scummy.  Nothing more to say here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">pisskop</div> - not exactly verbose. The constant back and forth between him and farside (basically arguing the same 3 points) means that he didn't have a lot of work to do outside of that discussion, which makes it that much harder to develop a read. The tone between the two of them makes it feel like a legitimate clash, so I don't think these two could be scum together. I think farside is scum, so I'm gonna say pk is leaning town.<br>\n<br>\nNoted though, that we never received a response to Egg as was promised <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5746679#p5746679\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elyse</div> - originally liked Elyse for scum, but looking through her posts again I don't see it. I don't get a sense of scum motivation - frustration at points, definitely, but not scumminess (kind of like kush was towards the beginning). The recent vote on me looks like she was just jumping on a wagon that had some momentum - she didn't have a problem with my lack of original content before now. This also raised an eyebrow though:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5757396#p5757396\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5757396#p5757396\" data-post-id=\"5757396\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 641</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20873\">Elyse</a> wrote:</cite>\nIf skitz is town I can definitely see SiX as scum.</div></blockquote>\nWhat does my alignment have to do with this slot's at all? <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">farside</div> -\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5740258#p5740258\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5740258#p5740258\" data-post-id=\"5740258\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 111</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite>\nNever seen town smeer another player.<br>\nNever seen town not explain themselves when asked questions before.</div></blockquote>\nI know, I know... \"Not this again..\" But despite all the bickering about this, the fact is that she is using absolutes here.

Farside asked him why he thought she was town, but hadn't offered any opinions about him either other than that he had a funny reason for townreading her. To me this just looks like adding some artificial fluff to her reasoning.

You can't have a case that's subjective, but it's okay to read people based on gut? That doesn't add up - those two viewpoints are mutually exclusive. I think post 211 reflects how she <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually</div> thinks, and that post 251 is her trying to find a way to discredit pisskop now that they were at eachother's throats.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5746233#p5746233\" class=\"postlink\">Post 250</a> strikes me as odd as well. I see a list of post links, but they don't seem to be contributing to any overall point. Granted, I don't really understand that last sentence at the bottom, so maybe I just missed it...<br>\n<br>\nThe very beginning of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\" class=\"postlink\">post 321</a> looks like an attempt at dodging. This conversation started with epm's comments in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5743010#p5743010\" class=\"postlink\">201</a>, and here she is directly quoting <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5747498#p5747498\" class=\"postlink\">273</a>. Epm calls her out, saying that her claiming that her kush read was a \"gut read\" is just a way to backpedal from a bad argument. She then goes on to quote something she said earlier:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\" data-post-id=\"5750204\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 321</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite>\nYeah I didn't say gut exactly but I did say this:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5741468#p5741468\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5741468#p5741468\" data-post-id=\"5741468\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 145</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite>If I said I felt like 126 was trying to hard would that make sense?</div></blockquote>\n\nThat is me talking about feeling/gut. Impression like I said before.\n</div></blockquote>\nNotice the explicit reference to an entirely different conversation? Post 145 that she's referencing was so far behind at this point it doesn't even make sense as a slip - it looks like a deliberate attempt to, in essence, change what she's said.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750572#p5750572\" class=\"postlink\">Post 335</a> is a big one, so I won't quote it all here, but just about all of it is one giant ball of crap. The first quote from DOMO in there basically explains his reasons for a farside scum read - they aren't strong, but he's not pushing them as strong. Just a simple \"huh...that was weird, why would someone do that?\" Farside's (over)reaction is to say that he hasn't explained what is genuine about pisskop's concerns. How would one even explain that? At this point she's just trying convince people that the people with a case on her are somehow wronging her. In reality, her reaction to such a light scum read is completely disproportionate to the strength of the read brought against her.<br>\n<br>\nNot done with 335 yet. Her second quote from domo (quoting <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5750231#p5750231\" class=\"postlink\">post 323</a>) is 50% domo saying \"Hey, um...you misquoted me...completely.\" Honestly I'm surprised that domo didn't push this further than he did, because it's a blatant lie and a quote from someone else entirely. Looking back to where she used it in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\" class=\"postlink\">post 321</a> she is using this misquote to discredit domo. Domo calls her out on it, and her reaction is to completely ignore it and proceed to scum read him, which at this point just feels so much like omgus that it hurts.<br>\n<br>\nSerious question for a second though: Is it actually possible that this misquote could have happened accidentally? I cannot think of a circumstance where a quote would show the right link and name, but the wrong content. In all honesty though, after her misuse of irrelevant quotes discussed earlier, I'm less inclined to believe it's an accident even if it is possible...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd that's all I've got for tonight ... I am sick and feeling like shit so I'm hitting the hay.That's only going about 50% of the way through farside's ISO though, and obviously there are plenty of people that I didn't get to.  I can probably follow up with more tomorrow night<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: farside22</span>", "time": "Thu Mar 20, 2014 6:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=40595&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "40595"}

Probably.<br>\n<br>\nA couple under-the-radar scumreads of mine: EPM and bjc. <br>\n<br>\nI remember some pages back some players I feel good about saying they think EPM seems town and I don't really see why. I think his initial case on farside was bad and called him out, and since then he just kinda faded into the background and let others (pkop and DOMO) do the dirty work rallying support for the farside wagon. I think all 3 of Domo, Farside, and pkop are probably town, so it looks like EPM is in the comfortable scum position of supporting a mislynch while not being blamed for it after the lynch.<br>\n<br>\nbjc I guess was getting a couple votes earlier. I just feel like he's been not really serious at all since the game started. I feel like a couple of the things he's called others out for apply even moreso to him:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5741174#p5741174\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5741174#p5741174\" data-post-id=\"5741174\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 138</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23438\">bjc</a> wrote:</cite>Trying to seem as an easy-going townie when you're really scum.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5747014#p5747014\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5747014#p5747014\" data-post-id=\"5747014\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 267</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23438\">bjc</a> wrote:</cite>At the risk of being the kettle here, while reading through the whole thread I did seem to notice reluctance from Skitz to go into \"srs mode.\" As his talks went on I became less and less impressed.</div></blockquote>\nI think Egg and kush were onto something back around posts 280-320 but it all just kinda went away unresolved.

It looks like he's looking for reasons to justify a vote, not trying to determine alignments. Like, in both these sections, the basic structure is, \"here's some things you did, why did you do these things\". I think there's something missing. There needs to be more \"here's why I think the things you did were scummy\" coming from skitz. <br>\n<br>\nI don't feel as good about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5758173#p5758173\">652</a> as kush did. He just gives some waffley overexplanations on 4 maybe townish leaning reads, and then a wall on Farside. While its possible he could be town and reading farside as scum, I think at this point Farside is easy to justify a case on. And a lot of it is just more of the \"here's a lot of stuff you did\" without the \"here is why I think the things you did were scummy\" explanations. I mean, it could just be playstyle. I don't see it as horribly scummy, I just don't see it as town like kush did, don't really see that he's made a good case on farside, and don't really see anything in there that makes me want to move my vote. Its a post that easily could have come from town or scum.<br>\n<br>\nI'd be lying if I told you I thought when I voted skitz that I wouldn't change my vote at some point during the day and find a better lynch choice, but he hasn't looked town, and nobody else has looked obviously scum to me.<br>\n<br>\n----------------<br>\n<br>\nNot impressed by SiX's entrance to the game and was never impressed with GiF either, basically for the same reason as kush in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757386#p5757386\">640</a> and elyse in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757396#p5757396\">641</a>.

But the details of this one bother me. I really should have broken this point down more, so I'll do it here:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5750572#p5750572\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5750572#p5750572\" data-post-id=\"5750572\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 335</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite>\nYou don't explain what is genuine about pisskops concern. No where do you show why it is geninue or what you think about it is genunie. That is a bland word that is meaniless.</div></blockquote>\nI don't think that stating you feel someone's concerns are genuine really warrants any deeper of an explanation. \"genuine\" in this case is not at all meaningless as you're saying, but rather it implies that he thinks they are points that were worth being raised, and may be worthy of further discussion. You may disagree - and that's fine - but why should he NOT raise them, even if they are only vague suspicions at this point. He says himself in the <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5746648#p5746648\" class=\"postlink\">original post</a> that they are gut reads (and therefore, by definition, vague).<br>\n<br>\nThen you quote his 323, in which he tries to delve into (a bit) more detail and spell it out (again, a bit) more explicitly. I don't understand what the point of the first 75% of post 335 was about if he had already explained himself a second time. It makes it seems like the whole first section is just being argumentative and trying to sabotage people's opinions of him. Why was this necessary after such an admittedly light scum read?  You were already hip-deep in your argument with pisskop at the time, and it looks like you were starting to panic from the attention it was drawing.<br>\n<br>\nThen you say that he was just providing more vague reasoning. Frankly, I think he spelled things out pretty well there:<br>\n\"I suspect you're scum because...\"<br>\n\"... That is contrary to how I read that exchange.\"<br>\n\"But your scumreads, they don't appear to me to be particularly well thought about, this looks more like random finger pointing...\"<br>\n<br>\nPretty direct stuff, from what I can see.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\" data-post-id=\"5759407\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 672</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite>\nI let go of my case on Kush when people discussed things with me about how it is normal and pisskop held onto theory for no reason he is explaining at all. How is that the same thing in your book?</div></blockquote>\nI don't think those two situations are the same at all. What I was trying to say was off was that in one instance you excuse yourself with basically \"oh that was just a gut read, not based on facts\". Then in the second you try to discredit pisskop by saying that he can't have a case that's subjective. A gut read IS subjective. It's 100% subjective. That's ALL it is. So I don't understand how you can maintain these two viewpoints that are so clearly contrary to one another (unless you are trying to suggest that making gut reads is not, in fact, scum hunting). In reality, as I said before, I don't think you ACTUALLY hold both of these view points. I DO however think you were trying to discredit pisskop's case as subjective in order to make it look less credible to everyone else. You weren't trying to convince him of anything, you were trying to convince US that this case lacked merit, and therefore came from scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\" data-post-id=\"5759407\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 672</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite>\nwell you missed a link where I did talk about EPM's case against me.

What I was trying to say was off was that in one instance you excuse yourself with basically \"oh that was just a gut read, not based on facts\". Then in the second you try to discredit pisskop by saying that he can't have a case that's subjective. A gut read IS subjective. It's 100% subjective. That's ALL it is. So I don't understand how you can maintain these two viewpoints that are so clearly contrary to one another (unless you are trying to suggest that making gut reads is not, in fact, scum hunting). In reality, as I said before, I don't think you ACTUALLY hold both of these view points. I DO however think you were trying to discredit pisskop's case as subjective in order to make it look less credible to everyone else. You weren't trying to convince him of anything, you were trying to convince US that this case lacked merit, and therefore came from scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nFirst did you read the meta from Pisskop I put in this game? Second question Look at the links I put above and tell me what his case is that is not subjective.<br>\nTell me did you think Pisskop's case was strong, genuine, and then tell me why. As I pointed out 3 other people found pisskop's case to be utter fucking crap besides me. So how does that make my view wrong? Would you like me to ask everyone here who thought post 205 was a strong case and genunie and as the game went on does anyone here really know Pisskop's point any more?", "time": "Sat Mar 22, 2014 11:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=40595&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "40595"}

There seems to be this thing where I say on d1 that I think x is town, and people seem to assume this means I'm gonna townread x all game.

It might not be the best reaction test you're ever going to see, but me being town will show that I'm not making these things up in an attempt to look town, which would be the only reason I'd do it as scum. People who have played with me before will know that as town I'm a confusing mess of vague accusations, reaction tests without even knowing what reaction I'm looking for, WIFOM and the occasional moment of sound logical analysis. I basically type what I think and worry about how much sense it makes when I read it back.

Like this:<br>\n<br>\n-mislynch today<br>\n-DOMO or Farside die tonight. Elyse claims scum left her alive because they're trying to set her up or something. She \"confirms\" another player with her result but that doesn't matter<br>\n-mislynch tomorrow<br>\n-no kill the next night.<br>\n<br>\nThen we head into a 4p mylo with 2 confirmed towns and a 50/50 between elyse and 1 other player. Its still a tough spot to be in, but its better than being lynched today, and she has some control over which conftowns are with her in mylo and who the non-confirmed player would be to try to mislynch. It makes perfect sense to me as a fake claim in scumelyse's position, puts her in the best position to pull out a win.<br>\n<br>\nI was thinking about (before SiX's claim) if it would be worth not lynching her today to get another innocent in case she is town, or if scum were dumb enough to kill her. But it wouldn't work if scum is competent. Elsye would never be NKed and it would still come down to a 1v1 between elyse and someone else, possibly with the scum being able to manipulate elyse's results to make it look like she was lying with no-kills or RB. So there is really no point in leaving elyse alive just in case she's telling the truth if I think its more likely she's lying.

I'm not sure thats appropriate to do or if I should put much weight into it at all, but I can't unread something and pretend it doesn't influence my view of the game.<br>\n<br>\nOf course the game is on auto from your POV elyse but from everyone else's there are still 3 possible scum and only 2 available lynches left.<br>\n<br>\n{elyse, fitz, or kush} can still be scum. IMO, it makes the most sense to lynch either fitz or kush than to lynch elyse today. Leaving elyse alive should guarentee that both farside and I would be alive tomorrow in the event of a mislynch to decide between elyse and whichever of fitz or kush is not lynched in 3-1 mylo tomorrow. Lynching elyse today means that if she's telling the truth, a confirmed town could be killed tonight and tomorrow would be 2-1. Of course I'd rather just lynch scum today but after yesterday's shenanigans I'm not sure about elyse anymore so I'd be fine with just eliminating an uncertain and picking between 2 players tomorrow, worst case. It's like a free lynch almost.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, there is nothing fitz can say for me right now that I would be able to read alignment on. There's only a couple people he can make a case on, and would do so whether he's town or scum. So for me, the decision today is based entirely on whether I believe kush to be more likely town or scum, not just more or less scummy than fitz. Fitz is entirely null, there's nothing to compare there. Its a tougher decision this way, because its easy to interpret town things and scum things wrongly in everyone - its easier to compare is A scummier than B vs is A objectively scum.<br>\n<br>\nI'd almost rather lynch fitz today because at least there would be stuff to analyze tomorrow between kush and elyse if fitz isn't scum. If we lynch kush today and he is town, then tomorrow we're in the same difficult position of just looking at elyse in a vacuum and determining whether she's town or scum because there still wouldn't be anything in fitz to compare her play to. I really don't think we can afford to bring fitz to a lylo/mylo situation so I would advocate a policy lynch on him based on this reasoning.", "time": "Thu Apr 03, 2014 5:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=40595&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "40595"}

Thats why I said if we lynch you or kush today and hit town, then 2 conftowns (me and farside) would have to decide between elyse or whoever wasn't lynched. I'd be fully expecting there to be no kill and for elyse to claim to have blocked the other remaining player, because its the straight play whether elyse is town or scum. If you're not lynched today, you'd be in the crosshair tomorrow no matter what happens. Lynching you or kush is essentially a free lynch. Right now the likely game state is 2 conf-towns and 3 unknowns with 1 scum, and lycnhing you or kush worst case turns the gamestate to 2conf-towns 2 unknowns with 1 scum. Or we just lynch scum anyways. But lynching elyse likely costs a conftown via nk so its trying to lynch scum while also considering the utility of the lynch. <br>\n<br>\nI mean the only other thing that could happen if elyse is scum if she trys some gambit like no killing or killing one of me or farside while claiming to jk the other of me or farside and use that to claim a RB must be in play to eliminate the conftown label on one of us and open up another mylo lynch option. but considering the mod basically accidentally confirmed that a JK and RB wouldn't both be in the game that would just be a scum claim from elyse IMO. Same with something like jk me while killing farside because she wasn't sure about me or some excuse and then claiming that fitz/kush is scum. That would also be unacceptable to me and confirm elyse scum. Basically if elyse is what she says she is than we can lynch fitz/kush and still have 4 alive tomorrow if we mislynch, so if anything else happens it would likely mean elyse is scum. If the expected happens, it does not mean elyse is necessarily town.
