Follow the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Forum%20Rules%20and%20Guidelines\" class=\"postlink\">Forum Rules and Guidelines</a>. If you\u2019re unsure whether something you\u2019re going to do will break a rule, ask me before you do it.<br>2. The only places outside of this thread you are permitted to talk about this game are in mod-provided QuickTopics. Otherwise, <span class=\"noboldsig\">do not talk about this game outside of the thread while the game is ongoing, even if you are dead.</span><br>3. Don\u2019t quote private mod communication \u2013 this includes, but is not limited to, role PMs, night actions and anything posted in a QuickTopic. You can paraphrase these things, but don\u2019t quote them.<br>4. Play to your win condition (play to win.)<br>5. If someone is modkilled, their alignment will change to \u201cneutral survivor\u201d and there will be no chance of them winning the game, even if their original faction wins.<br>6. I reserve the right to change the rules at any time, including while the game is ongoing, although there will be a warning in-thread if this happens.<br>7. Be excellent to each other. Personal remarks and insults are not welcome. There is no problem with criticizing how others play in this game, but as soon as it goes beyond that line there will be one warning before I force-replace you.<br>8. Party on, dudes.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Activity rules</span></span></span><br><br>1. If a player does not post in the game thread for more than 48 hours, they will be prodded. After this prod, they are given a 24-hour grace period to make a post before I start searching for their replacement.<br>2. If a player receives three or more prods, I reserve the right to search for their replacement at my discretion.<br>3. Please post V/LA (Vacation/Limited Access) notices in-thread at least 24 hours in advance of them starting.<br>4. Game days will be at most 2 weeks long, unless a replacement is required within the last 48 hours of a game day.<br>5. Game nights will last 48 hours.<br>6. Please keep an eye on your messages for PMs from the mod.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Voting rules</span></span></span><br>1. When making votes, use the vote or bold tags. Votes not made using either of these will not be recorded.<br>2. When voting, please put your vote at the beginning of a new line. While there is no penalty for not doing so, you put yourself at peril of the mod missing your vote when you don\u2019t.<br>3. Unvoting before voting again is not mandatory.<br>4. If one player receives a simple majority of the votes, they are that day\u2019s lynch and any further voting/unvoting won\u2019t count.<br>5. After a lynch has been made, all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post until I lock the thread. This is the \u201ctwilight\u201d phase.<br>6. If a majority of votes is not reached by deadline, there will be no lynch for that day.<br>7. Anybody can vote not to lynch by saying <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>.<br>8. Dead players can make one \u201cbah\u201d post after their death. This may not contain any information relevant to the game. Once the mod has declared the game over, anybody can start posting in the thread again.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Setup rules</span></span></span><br><br>1. This game has a day start.<br>2. This is a <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal%20Game\" class=\"postlink\">normal game</a> and follows the guidelines on the wiki page.<br>3. There is at least one Vanilla Townie.<br><br>VT Role PM:</span></span><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">You are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>. You can participate in town discussion during the day, and you have no night action.<br><br>You get a vote each day for who you would like to lynch. You can move this vote to another player at any time during each day, or you can choose not to vote. You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated.</fieldset>"}

I guess I should elaborate actually, that first sentence is scummy because she's right off the bat basing a scum read on his interpretation of a post, it's instantly farther from objective than town should try to be, and \"that seems a bit extreme\" is a phrase that diffuses itself (because 'extreme' is a very strong word and 'seem' and 'a bit' are designed to suck the strength out of the rest of a sentence) and lacks any sort of conviction, I'd argue that there's a contradiction there too. Not to mention the point that kush immediately picked up on (and I'm townreading him for this) that extreme reactions are only scummy according to context and the extreme reaction in question can not be painted to be alignment-related. Especially since to me at least it (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5738689#p5738689\">49</a>)seemed more snarky than defensive.<br><br>Then towards the end of page 4, she's just pushing a really weak argument, refusing to explain how it's related to the possibility of kush being scum, then the generalities in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740258#p5740258\">111</a> are bull and make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740145#p5740145\">93</a> hypocritical in hindsight.<br>Basically the whole thing is forced, and she ended up contradicting herself before finally letting up because she saw the case wasn't supportable.<br><br>bjc still being in non-serious mode is getting a bit scummy to me, first 3 pages was fine but now there's stuff happening<br><br>Elyse, bad attitude is not a scumread."}

I guess I should elaborate actually, that first sentence is scummy because she's right off the bat basing a scum read on his interpretation of a post, it's instantly farther from objective than town should try to be, and \"that seems a bit extreme\" is a phrase that diffuses itself (because 'extreme' is a very strong word and 'seem' and 'a bit' are designed to suck the strength out of the rest of a sentence) and lacks any sort of conviction, I'd argue that there's a contradiction there too. Not to mention the point that kush immediately picked up on (and I'm townreading him for this) that extreme reactions are only scummy according to context and the extreme reaction in question can not be painted to be alignment-related. Especially since to me at least it (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5738689#p5738689\">49</a>)seemed more snarky than defensive.<br><br>Then towards the end of page 4, she's just pushing a really weak argument, refusing to explain how it's related to the possibility of kush being scum, then the generalities in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740258#p5740258\">111</a> are bull and make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740145#p5740145\">93</a> hypocritical in hindsight.<br>Basically the whole thing is forced, and she ended up contradicting herself before finally letting up because she saw the case wasn't supportable.<br><br>bjc still being in non-serious mode is getting a bit scummy to me, first 3 pages was fine but now there's stuff happening<br><br>Elyse, bad attitude is not a scumread.</div></blockquote><br><br>First off my read on Kush is gut/opinion.

I'm fucked for my RL issues but I now have plenty of time for this. I'm gonna do a page by page kind of thing. No comments on Page 1 though. Page 1 was kinda dumb and irrelevant.<br><br>Page 2:<br>Two things stand out. Pisskop's callout of evilpacman for something he explained before pisskop even posted stands out. While it's a weak point, that probably would have been the first voteworthy thing I noticed because it looks like he's stretching for a reason to vote evilpacman. Stretching tends to happen on Page 2 though. What it does say though is that these two don't make a ton of sense as buddies because pisskop wasn't paying much attention to evilpacman. It also seems like town would pay attention to the player they think is scum though, so scum voting town or null making a vote they don't give a shit about makes sense here.<br><br>The other thing that stands out is evilpacman saying bjc would be scummy if not for meta because he posted \"distracting\" stuff. I assume you mean Post 14 \"But would you read again?\". Why not call out GuyinFreezer who actually did it first. And there are probably more examples from other players after that too. Why call out just bjc only to excuse it due to meta?<br><br>Page 3:<br>skitzo's 72 tweaked my gut. Not sure why. Buddying maybe? Could just be the 80's theme though. I dunno. Through 3 pages, I still don't have any major reads.<br><br>Page 4:<br>Don't really like GuyinFreezer's \"Why so serious\". Someone needs to start getting serious soon. I don't care who.<br><br><strike>Farside, is post 83 serious? And 86?</strike> &lt;-further reading shows that yes it is. Wow...<br><br>pisskop's kush vote makes me wanna lick a cat until I cough up a hairball. And I'm allergic to cats.<br><br>Page 5:<br>Farside is coming off...I don't even know how to explain it. I almost wanna say... not as experienced as I know she is. She's seeing things in kush's play that aren't even scummy. She's acting like bad town doesn't exist (see post 111). And I don't get why she's asking for Jake's reasoning on the skitzo vote when Kush literally asked the same thing the post just before. I don't know what to make of all of this because it looks like scum who can't fake good town play, but I feel like I remember Farside being good as scum too although it has been a while. The weird thing is, Rhinox's reasons for townreading Farside give me this same vibe about Rhinox.<br><br>Page 6:<br>Skitzo's reaction to Kush is a logical reaction that I'd expect from town. Just remember, null points being made out to be scum points doesn't make them town points unless the attacker(s) is(are) scum. I'm looking at Farside and/or pisskop.<br><br>I like Elyse for town for now. Rhinox too. 132 and 137 give me a change of heart.<br><br>Farside's Skitz push is probably even worse than the kush one. First, she unvotes Kush for the same reasons Skitz said Kush isn't scummy (and a couple of other players have since repeated it). Next, she votes the first player to say it for, uh, that very post. Really?<br><br>Page 7:<br>Pisskop, why is there scum in the Rhinox/farside/skitz/bjc discussion?<br><br>Jake, what is different about Skitz in the other game? And I assume he was town in that game?<br><br>Page 8:<br>Rhinox, I don't read Skitzo's questions as anything scum motivated. I think he's just trying to improve his play by doing exactly what people here, and Mastin, have told him to do which is to ask questions rather than just give opinions. It's coming off awkward because it's not his natural play. And Skitz, don't worry. It'll become more natural as you learn what the right questions are to ask. And there's nothing wrong with just giving opinions sometimes.<br><br>Kush, I should bite my tongue on this, but I just can't. Why the fuck would you brag about being a \"weed smoker\" aka criminal and then say someone is discriminating based on it? Are you fucking serious?

The reason weed is becoming more legally accepted is because people are starting to realise that keeping it illegal is basically fascist. It has nothing to do with health. I am legally allowed to drink paint, so long as the intent is not to kill myself. When I smoke a spliff, the tobacco is doing me more harm. Anyone educated on this topic will tell you that. <br><br>I agree it's nothing to brag about, but even then I'm guilty of this myself.

My gut feel is you're trying to sell farside as town. Forgive me for thinking that when town meta dives someone, it's an attempt to learn their alignment. Your meta case comes across to me as someone trying to convince the rest of town, not someone who is trying to figure stuff out.  I'm suggesting that the context of your post comes from a scum mindset, not town, which is a basic psychological evaluation of your post. I have a great deal of faith in pyschology when it comes to mafia, so yeah I consider this case to be quite legitimate indeed. I could be wrong, I'm not up my own arse, but I'm happy with my position."}

There's no established meta for how scum would act when voting who to give a gun to like there is when voting who to lynch. There is no point of reference for how to perform VCA on the gun-vote, so anyone trying to do so would at best be guessing what scum would do based on, well, nothing. Scum can use this to their advantage. At worst, its giving scum influence over where the gun goes, and they would then know who is getting the gun at night and can act to counter accordingly. Giving scum information and influence like this is never a good thing. There's a reason it is universally discouraged for towns to direct PR's. It is better to let the PR's act on their own. The choice you decide to make tells the paranoid out there a lot about your alignment as well."}

If you were gun inventor, would you claim d1? Do you see the town motivation in doing so? I get that I *could* be scum with a 1x shot ability, but that would have to be some ability for me to suicide like that with four votes or whatever. It should at least be obvious that I was planning on claiming today, so for me to be scum this was planned. How can I know there's no vig? Why would I try to draw a counterclaim from a vig? The only scum motivation in such a claim is to live until d2 to use some awesome power, but I'm curious to know what powers you expect scum to have that is this important, if you're having a hard time believing there can be a gun inventor. 1x strongman? I could see that if there was some huge town claim that needed to be dealt with, but my claim is the first claim of the game. idk, throw more suggestions at me. I can assure you I'm not scum with a 1x kill everyone but me power.<br><br>I like that you're thinking along these lines though, this looks more like town than you did earlier when you were taking shots at me."}

Highly critical of most cases, and he's attacked weak reasoning pretty consistently. At the same time he's basically done nothing EXCEPT pick stuff apart. Very little offense coming from kush except for a push on bjc (I guess you could call this a push), and now spearheading the wagon on me. I'd read that as scummy (just interfering with town and trying to stop a solid wagon from forming), but his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5753659#p5753659\" class=\"postlink\">meta checkup on farside</a> is balancing that out. I don't put much stock in meta - as apparently most people here do - but points 2 and 3 at least were good, valid comparisons.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rhinox</span> - frankly, don't really know when way I swing on this one. I suppose null? He's asked some questions, and is voting me for the questions I <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5742132#p5742132\" class=\"postlink\">asked him previously</a>. Honestly, looking back, it was a pretty shitty time for questions 1 and 3 - I think I felt like a lot more time had passed at the time, but in hindsight: he's right *shrug* nothing I can say about it now. Even with that conceded, I don't think the rest of the post warranted ignoring or voting, but I don't see doing it as scummy.  Nothing more to say here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">pisskop</span> - not exactly verbose. The constant back and forth between him and farside (basically arguing the same 3 points) means that he didn't have a lot of work to do outside of that discussion, which makes it that much harder to develop a read. The tone between the two of them makes it feel like a legitimate clash, so I don't think these two could be scum together. I think farside is scum, so I'm gonna say pk is leaning town.<br><br>Noted though, that we never received a response to Egg as was promised <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5746679#p5746679\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span> - originally liked Elyse for scum, but looking through her posts again I don't see it. I don't get a sense of scum motivation - frustration at points, definitely, but not scumminess (kind of like kush was towards the beginning). The recent vote on me looks like she was just jumping on a wagon that had some momentum - she didn't have a problem with my lack of original content before now. This also raised an eyebrow though:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5757396#p5757396\" class=\"postlink\">post 641</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>If skitz is town I can definitely see SiX as scum.</div></blockquote><br>What does my alignment have to do with this slot's at all? <br><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">farside</span> -<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5740258#p5740258\" class=\"postlink\">post 111</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>Never seen town smeer another player.<br>Never seen town not explain themselves when asked questions before.</div></blockquote><br>I know, I know... \"Not this again..\" But despite all the bickering about this, the fact is that she is using absolutes here. She may even be telling the truth - maybe she never HAS seen it - but the way it's presented makes it feel like she's trying to convince people that this is actually a decent reason to think kush is scum.<br><br>kush himself pointed out that to read an overreaction as scummy you need to look at context, and considering the context was completely irrelevant to anything to do with mafia, reading that as scummy is more than a stretch: it's ridiculous.<br><br>Then she switches her vote to me as a result of my <br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5740659#p5740659\" class=\"postlink\">post #126</a>. Her concerns about it being \"cold\" were echoed by Jake (and maybe others? I don't remember), but her explanation is this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5741462#p5741462\" class=\"postlink\">post 144</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5741404#p5741404\" class=\"postlink\">post 143</a>, bjc wrote:</cite>Why the vote change, farside?</div></blockquote><br>Skitz 126 come off cold. No opinion on rhinox just me and Kush. It feels off. <br>Kush could be just a jerk and the more he post the more I read jerk not scummy.<br>I think rhinox point about Kush was valid and he didn't take that idea as I expect scum would.</div></blockquote><br>It's worth pointing out that the discussion about Rhinox was still mainly about the emoticons at this point. Farside asked him why he thought she was town, but hadn't offered any opinions about him either other than that he had a funny reason for townreading her. To me this just looks like adding some artificial fluff to her reasoning. She then proceeds to agree with me -_-<br><br>Then there's stuff like this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5743288#p5743288\" class=\"postlink\">post 211</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">First off my read on Kush is gut/opinion.

You can't have a case that's subjective, but it's okay to read people based on gut? That doesn't add up - those two viewpoints are mutually exclusive. I think post 211 reflects how she <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> thinks, and that post 251 is her trying to find a way to discredit pisskop now that they were at eachother's throats.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5746233#p5746233\" class=\"postlink\">Post 250</a> strikes me as odd as well. I see a list of post links, but they don't seem to be contributing to any overall point. Granted, I don't really understand that last sentence at the bottom, so maybe I just missed it...<br><br>The very beginning of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\" class=\"postlink\">post 321</a> looks like an attempt at dodging. This conversation started with epm's comments in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5743010#p5743010\" class=\"postlink\">201</a>, and here she is directly quoting <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5747498#p5747498\" class=\"postlink\">273</a>. Epm calls her out, saying that her claiming that her kush read was a \"gut read\" is just a way to backpedal from a bad argument. She then goes on to quote something she said earlier:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\" class=\"postlink\">post 321</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>Yeah I didn't say gut exactly but I did say this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5741468#p5741468\" class=\"postlink\">post 145</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>If I said I felt like 126 was trying to hard would that make sense?</div></blockquote><br><br>That is me talking about feeling/gut. Impression like I said before.<br></div></blockquote><br>Notice the explicit reference to an entirely different conversation? Post 145 that she's referencing was so far behind at this point it doesn't even make sense as a slip - it looks like a deliberate attempt to, in essence, change what she's said.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750572#p5750572\" class=\"postlink\">Post 335</a> is a big one, so I won't quote it all here, but just about all of it is one giant ball of crap. The first quote from DOMO in there basically explains his reasons for a farside scum read - they aren't strong, but he's not pushing them as strong. Just a simple \"huh...that was weird, why would someone do that?\" Farside's (over)reaction is to say that he hasn't explained what is genuine about pisskop's concerns. How would one even explain that? At this point she's just trying convince people that the people with a case on her are somehow wronging her. In reality, her reaction to such a light scum read is completely disproportionate to the strength of the read brought against her.<br><br>Not done with 335 yet. Her second quote from domo (quoting <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5750231#p5750231\" class=\"postlink\">post 323</a>) is 50% domo saying \"Hey, um...you misquoted me...completely.\" Honestly I'm surprised that domo didn't push this further than he did, because it's a blatant lie and a quote from someone else entirely. Looking back to where she used it in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750204#p5750204\" class=\"postlink\">post 321</a> she is using this misquote to discredit domo. Domo calls her out on it, and her reaction is to completely ignore it and proceed to scum read him, which at this point just feels so much like omgus that it hurts.<br><br>Serious question for a second though: Is it actually possible that this misquote could have happened accidentally? I cannot think of a circumstance where a quote would show the right link and name, but the wrong content. In all honesty though, after her misuse of irrelevant quotes discussed earlier, I'm less inclined to believe it's an accident even if it is possible...<br><br><br>And that's all I've got for tonight ... I am sick and feeling like shit so I'm hitting the hay.That's only going about 50% of the way through farside's ISO though, and obviously there are plenty of people that I didn't get to.  I can probably follow up with more tomorrow night<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: farside22</span>"}

While its possible he could be town and reading farside as scum, I think at this point Farside is easy to justify a case on. And a lot of it is just more of the \"here's a lot of stuff you did\" without the \"here is why I think the things you did were scummy\" explanations. I mean, it could just be playstyle. I don't see it as horribly scummy, I just don't see it as town like kush did, don't really see that he's made a good case on farside, and don't really see anything in there that makes me want to move my vote. Its a post that easily could have come from town or scum.<br><br>I'd be lying if I told you I thought when I voted skitz that I wouldn't change my vote at some point during the day and find a better lynch choice, but he hasn't looked town, and nobody else has looked obviously scum to me.<br><br>----------------<br><br>Not impressed by SiX's entrance to the game and was never impressed with GiF either, basically for the same reason as kush in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757386#p5757386\">640</a> and elyse in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757396#p5757396\">641</a>. As for his poinst against me: Yes, I had a townread on Farside. Yes, I \"defended\" farside by refuting cases posted by others that I thought were bad. I don't want my townreads to get lynched, and if I see a bad case on my town reads I will usually say so. If you don't believe that is something that town would do, then lynch me. Why haven't you voted me yet if you want me lynched?<br><br>----------------<br><br>So, here's my \"would be ok lynching\" list:<br><br>skitz<br>EPM<br>bjc<br>egg<br>SiX<br><br>Everyone else I feel ok with and wouldn't want to lynch today."}

This conversation started with epm's comments in 201, and here she is directly quoting 273. Epm calls her out, saying that her claiming that her kush read was a \"gut read\" is just a way to backpedal from a bad argument. She then goes on to quote something she said earlier:<br></div></blockquote><br>Why did you not meantion <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5743288#p5743288\" class=\"postlink\">post 211</a> when you mention this conversation with EPM where I did infact go over his case in that link?<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>skitz wrote:</cite>Post 335 is a big one, so I won't quote it all here, but just about all of it is one giant ball of crap. The first quote from DOMO in there basically explains his reasons for a farside scum read - they aren't strong, but he's not pushing them as strong. Just a simple \"huh...that was weird, why would someone do that?\" Farside's (over)reaction is to say that he hasn't explained what is genuine about pisskop's concerns. How would one even explain that? At this point she's just trying convince people that the people with a case on her are somehow wronging her. In reality, her reaction to such a light scum read is completely disproportionate to the strength of the read brought against her.<br><br></div></blockquote><br>Why is asking for more information from a player to explain themselves weird or an over reaction? <br>Your in other games linked have asked people to explain themselves more when they are not clear.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5672379#p5672379\" class=\"postlink\">question players yourself</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5615958#p5615958\" class=\"postlink\">clarify reads from people</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5607444#p5607444\" class=\"postlink\">ask for more specifics from a player as to why the read</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>skitz wrote:</cite>How can those two bolded parts come from the same person in the same game? You can't have a case that's subjective, but it's okay to read people based on gut? That doesn't add up - those two viewpoints are mutually exclusive. I think post 211 reflects how she actually thinks, and that post 251 is her trying to find a way to discredit pisskop now that they were at eachother's throats.<br></div></blockquote><br>I let go of my case on Kush when people discussed things with me about how it is normal and pisskop held onto theory for no reason he is explaining at all. How is that the same thing in your book?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>skitz wrote:</cite>Serious question for a second though: Is it actually possible that this misquote could have happened accidentally?

Did you miss that on purpose? <br>As for the link I posted I had the wrong one. No I don't know how that happened.

I think you are intentionally misquoting yourself in 321 in an attempt to back off from your previous scum read. 211 was not relevant to this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\" class=\"postlink\">post 672</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>Why is asking for more information from a player to explain themselves weird or an over reaction? <br>Your in other games linked have asked people to explain themselves more when they are not clear.<br></div></blockquote><br>I wouldn't go so far as to say asking for more information is inherently scummy - quite the contrary. But the details of this one bother me. I really should have broken this point down more, so I'll do it here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5750572#p5750572\" class=\"postlink\">post 335</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>You don't explain what is genuine about pisskops concern. No where do you show why it is geninue or what you think about it is genunie. That is a bland word that is meaniless.</div></blockquote><br>I don't think that stating you feel someone's concerns are genuine really warrants any deeper of an explanation. \"genuine\" in this case is not at all meaningless as you're saying, but rather it implies that he thinks they are points that were worth being raised, and may be worthy of further discussion. You may disagree - and that's fine - but why should he NOT raise them, even if they are only vague suspicions at this point. He says himself in the <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5746648#p5746648\" class=\"postlink\">original post</a> that they are gut reads (and therefore, by definition, vague).<br><br>Then you quote his 323, in which he tries to delve into (a bit) more detail and spell it out (again, a bit) more explicitly. I don't understand what the point of the first 75% of post 335 was about if he had already explained himself a second time. It makes it seems like the whole first section is just being argumentative and trying to sabotage people's opinions of him. Why was this necessary after such an admittedly light scum read?  You were already hip-deep in your argument with pisskop at the time, and it looks like you were starting to panic from the attention it was drawing.<br><br>Then you say that he was just providing more vague reasoning. Frankly, I think he spelled things out pretty well there:<br>\"I suspect you're scum because...\"<br>\"... That is contrary to how I read that exchange.\"<br>\"But your scumreads, they don't appear to me to be particularly well thought about, this looks more like random finger pointing...\"<br><br>Pretty direct stuff, from what I can see.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\" class=\"postlink\">post 672</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>I let go of my case on Kush when people discussed things with me about how it is normal and pisskop held onto theory for no reason he is explaining at all. How is that the same thing in your book?</div></blockquote><br>I don't think those two situations are the same at all. What I was trying to say was off was that in one instance you excuse yourself with basically \"oh that was just a gut read, not based on facts\". Then in the second you try to discredit pisskop by saying that he can't have a case that's subjective. A gut read IS subjective. It's 100% subjective. That's ALL it is. So I don't understand how you can maintain these two viewpoints that are so clearly contrary to one another (unless you are trying to suggest that making gut reads is not, in fact, scum hunting). In reality, as I said before, I don't think you ACTUALLY hold both of these view points. I DO however think you were trying to discredit pisskop's case as subjective in order to make it look less credible to everyone else. You weren't trying to convince him of anything, you were trying to convince US that this case lacked merit, and therefore came from scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5759407#p5759407\" class=\"postlink\">post 672</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite>well you missed a link where I did talk about EPM's case against me.

Which looking back that's right. Pac was focusing on my gut comment I was thinking about what I said about Skitz instead of my opinion which was this:<br>[quote=\"In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5740046#p5740046\" class=\"postlink\">post 86</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5739934#p5739934\" class=\"postlink\">post 84</a>, kushm4sta wrote:</cite>so why does that make me scum?</div></blockquote><br><br>Over reaction is scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>That is an opinion and not a strong proven fact.

The first quote from DOMO in there basically explains his reasons for a farside scum read - they aren't strong, but he's not pushing them as strong. Just a simple \"huh...that was weird, why would someone do that?\" Farside's (over)reaction is to say that he hasn't explained what is genuine about pisskop's concerns. How would one even explain that? At this point she's just trying convince people that the people with a case on her are somehow wronging her. In reality, her reaction to such a light scum read is completely disproportionate to the strength of the read brought against her.</div></blockquote><br><br>I find i funny when people cherry pick comments from a whole post and focus on one thing about a full post. <br>In post 331 Not only do I ask him what is genuine about the post. I asked him specifically things like this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside wrote:</cite>Why would I think someone who built a bullshit case is town? How is he scum hunting by using hypotheory and something he calls a lie that he states can't be disproven a town action or comment? You don't explain how the vote isn't consistent with what you read or what you saw.<br>Again vague reasoning all in the above.</div></blockquote><br><br>More details that he never answered. He was also the 4th person on that wagon. Did you think about that when you say he is not pushing a case. Does it make sense to you to vote someone for weak reasons and then not explain in more detail when said reason's are weak? <br><br>Your going to sit there and tell me this reason<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5746146#p5746146\" class=\"postlink\">post 247</a>, DOMO wrote:</cite>farside's pisskop vote, I'm not liking that based on the interactions and as such I'm concerned about farside. pisskop feels town to me.</div></blockquote><br><br>Tells you why about anything? Saying that pisskop is sharing \"Genunie Concern\" based on Pisskop's.<br>What concerns? <br>Tell me what looks like it is concern <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5743056#p5743056\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5743291#p5743291\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744343#p5744343\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744395#p5744395\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5744468#p5744468\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br>Nothing is explained in any great detail without a theory behind it.

That is not a case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>skitz wrote:</cite>I don't think those two situations are the same at all. What I was trying to say was off was that in one instance you excuse yourself with basically \"oh that was just a gut read, not based on facts\". Then in the second you try to discredit pisskop by saying that he can't have a case that's subjective. A gut read IS subjective. It's 100% subjective. That's ALL it is. So I don't understand how you can maintain these two viewpoints that are so clearly contrary to one another (unless you are trying to suggest that making gut reads is not, in fact, scum hunting). In reality, as I said before, I don't think you ACTUALLY hold both of these view points. I DO however think you were trying to discredit pisskop's case as subjective in order to make it look less credible to everyone else. You weren't trying to convince him of anything, you were trying to convince US that this case lacked merit, and therefore came from scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>First did you read the meta from Pisskop I put in this game? Second question Look at the links I put above and tell me what his case is that is not subjective.<br>Tell me did you think Pisskop's case was strong, genuine, and then tell me why. As I pointed out 3 other people found pisskop's case to be utter fucking crap besides me. So how does that make my view wrong? Would you like me to ask everyone here who thought post 205 was a strong case and genunie and as the game went on does anyone here really know Pisskop's point any more?"}

There seems to be this thing where I say on d1 that I think x is town, and people seem to assume this means I'm gonna townread x all game.

It might not be the best reaction test you're ever going to see, but me being town will show that I'm not making these things up in an attempt to look town, which would be the only reason I'd do it as scum. People who have played with me before will know that as town I'm a confusing mess of vague accusations, reaction tests without even knowing what reaction I'm looking for, WIFOM and the occasional moment of sound logical analysis. I basically type what I think and worry about how much sense it makes when I read it back.

That's where I'm stuck.</div></blockquote><br>Why not? it was looking like she was going to be lynched today. Her 2 scum partners are already dead. It buys her time to get to a 50/50 lylo. Like this:<br><br>-mislynch today<br>-DOMO or Farside die tonight. Elyse claims scum left her alive because they're trying to set her up or something. She \"confirms\" another player with her result but that doesn't matter<br>-mislynch tomorrow<br>-no kill the next night.<br><br>Then we head into a 4p mylo with 2 confirmed towns and a 50/50 between elyse and 1 other player. Its still a tough spot to be in, but its better than being lynched today, and she has some control over which conftowns are with her in mylo and who the non-confirmed player would be to try to mislynch. It makes perfect sense to me as a fake claim in scumelyse's position, puts her in the best position to pull out a win.<br><br>I was thinking about (before SiX's claim) if it would be worth not lynching her today to get another innocent in case she is town, or if scum were dumb enough to kill her. But it wouldn't work if scum is competent. Elsye would never be NKed and it would still come down to a 1v1 between elyse and someone else, possibly with the scum being able to manipulate elyse's results to make it look like she was lying with no-kills or RB. So there is really no point in leaving elyse alive just in case she's telling the truth if I think its more likely she's lying. Even before SiX's claim there were other reasons why I felt elyse's claim was false and with SiX's claim it makes it nearly certain."}

I'm not sure thats appropriate to do or if I should put much weight into it at all, but I can't unread something and pretend it doesn't influence my view of the game.<br><br>Of course the game is on auto from your POV elyse but from everyone else's there are still 3 possible scum and only 2 available lynches left.<br><br>{elyse, fitz, or kush} can still be scum. IMO, it makes the most sense to lynch either fitz or kush than to lynch elyse today. Leaving elyse alive should guarentee that both farside and I would be alive tomorrow in the event of a mislynch to decide between elyse and whichever of fitz or kush is not lynched in 3-1 mylo tomorrow. Lynching elyse today means that if she's telling the truth, a confirmed town could be killed tonight and tomorrow would be 2-1. Of course I'd rather just lynch scum today but after yesterday's shenanigans I'm not sure about elyse anymore so I'd be fine with just eliminating an uncertain and picking between 2 players tomorrow, worst case. It's like a free lynch almost.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is nothing fitz can say for me right now that I would be able to read alignment on. There's only a couple people he can make a case on, and would do so whether he's town or scum. So for me, the decision today is based entirely on whether I believe kush to be more likely town or scum, not just more or less scummy than fitz. Fitz is entirely null, there's nothing to compare there. Its a tougher decision this way, because its easy to interpret town things and scum things wrongly in everyone - its easier to compare is A scummier than B vs is A objectively scum.<br><br>I'd almost rather lynch fitz today because at least there would be stuff to analyze tomorrow between kush and elyse if fitz isn't scum. If we lynch kush today and he is town, then tomorrow we're in the same difficult position of just looking at elyse in a vacuum and determining whether she's town or scum because there still wouldn't be anything in fitz to compare her play to. I really don't think we can afford to bring fitz to a lylo/mylo situation so I would advocate a policy lynch on him based on this reasoning."}

Thats why I said if we lynch you or kush today and hit town, then 2 conftowns (me and farside) would have to decide between elyse or whoever wasn't lynched. I'd be fully expecting there to be no kill and for elyse to claim to have blocked the other remaining player, because its the straight play whether elyse is town or scum. If you're not lynched today, you'd be in the crosshair tomorrow no matter what happens. Lynching you or kush is essentially a free lynch. Right now the likely game state is 2 conf-towns and 3 unknowns with 1 scum, and lycnhing you or kush worst case turns the gamestate to 2conf-towns 2 unknowns with 1 scum. Or we just lynch scum anyways. But lynching elyse likely costs a conftown via nk so its trying to lynch scum while also considering the utility of the lynch. <br><br>I mean the only other thing that could happen if elyse is scum if she trys some gambit like no killing or killing one of me or farside while claiming to jk the other of me or farside and use that to claim a RB must be in play to eliminate the conftown label on one of us and open up another mylo lynch option. but considering the mod basically accidentally confirmed that a JK and RB wouldn't both be in the game that would just be a scum claim from elyse IMO. Same with something like jk me while killing farside because she wasn't sure about me or some excuse and then claiming that fitz/kush is scum. That would also be unacceptable to me and confirm elyse scum. Basically if elyse is what she says she is than we can lynch fitz/kush and still have 4 alive tomorrow if we mislynch, so if anything else happens it would likely mean elyse is scum. If the expected happens, it does not mean elyse is necessarily town. Follow?"}

I was generally pretty happy with my reads throughout the game. I just need to work on being less awkward early in games I guess. I feel like scum weren't really caught by being really overly scummy, just that town was really fucking good and being really obvious town IMO. The D2 cop guilty was a lucky break for us really, game could have gone down a lot different if there wasn't a guilty. Scum roles seem pretty strong but I guess thats the meta now when giving towns a cop+protective role.<br><br>I don't really have a problem with the gun inventor role for a normal or the way DOMO used it. I thought it was a fun role actually and DOMO really generated a lot of discussion and info claiming when he did.<br><br>Mod was really great as well. The flavor was corny and awesome, regular votecounts at the top of the page, ran a tight ship with prods and replacements (when needed), prompt responses to questions. Strong consideration for a smooth operator nom IMO."}
