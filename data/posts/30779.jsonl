My joining the Formerfish wagon was obviously purely for early pressure to try and get an off reaction.  Now whilst we got a bit of a reaction, I didn't think it was indicative of scum, so when Elyse tried to pull me into her page long argument with Desperado I had to set it straight as to what I was thinking.<br>\n<br>\nSo I started looking elsewhere. ASP's response to my question to him looked pretty scummy so I voted him.  His followup in #61 made me consider the first post in a different way; I'd asked him a question so he gave me his thought process, which was pretty messy, brain onto paper type kind of thing.  #61 is logical and consistent and changes the read for me.   <br>\n<br>\nThat's my thought process regarding my votes thus far.  Note that you and Desperado don't factor into it anywhere.  If someone's comments sway me to changing my vote then I'll acknowledge it as a factor; your comments are only serving to make me waste time defending when I could be looking for scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo I'm back to not-quite-square-one.  I do find Elyse and Desperado's spat on page 2 interesting and I'm not liking mnemonicdevice's paltry contributions thus far.

His 121 and 123 seem to just be repetitive to pry at pdmedic to get him active, and im unsure what to make of it beyond nagging for answers. I also notice BvD mentioning him ignoring a question from BvD. I still think being able to discuss people's reads and having a chance to get another perspective on a person's behavior would be beneficial to the town, and refusing to share reads isn't being productive, hence my suspicions about Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nElyse is also giving off scum vibes, but I'm unsure there; UberKang is giving off mixed vibes, but if I had to guess, I'd say town.

His 121 and 123 seem to just be repetitive to pry at pdmedic to get him active, and im unsure what to make of it beyond nagging for answers. I also notice BvD mentioning him ignoring a question from BvD.

You guys blew up my scumdar with how many of you are acting scummy that I am wondering if the MOD didn't mess up and assign you all as scum. I'm going to narrow this down to my two favorite offenders. <br>\n<br>\nFormerfish: This is the guy who started out with all the RVS votes, which was mass stupidity on the towns part, but the way he reacted to it is showing that those people had some luck on their side because they outed a scum already. He is eventually let off the hook but as of right now, jumps on the building wagon of ASP/Me sensing his opportunity to get out of day 1 alive.<br>\n<br>\npdmedic: I know this guy is new but everything he says is making my eye twitch that he doesn't have a single vote on him. Is everyone just giving him a bye day 1 because of the new card? If we are doing that fine, but can we seriously look at this guy day 2? He even dropped the \"new player\" card twice to excuse himself and is lurking while the attention is on ASP/me. His 178 seals it for me.<br>\n<br>\nTown Peoples: Jesus... I don't.... I mean I... god are there town people in this game?

His 121 and 123 seem to just be repetitive to pry at pdmedic to get him active, and im unsure what to make of it beyond nagging for answers. I also notice BvD mentioning him ignoring a question from BvD. I still think being able to discuss people's reads and having a chance to get another perspective on a person's behavior would be beneficial to the town, and refusing to share reads isn't being productive, hence my suspicions about Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nElyse is also giving off scum vibes, but I'm unsure there; UberKang is giving off mixed vibes, but if I had to guess, I'd say town. Mnemonic Device is reading very unproductive and suspicious as well.

I suppose one could do so as town to to try to protect his or her interests later in the game and protect himself from being framed for a NK through his scum-reads being targeted.

I apologize for not fully informing you of my entire thought process.<br>\n<br>\nAnd as for waffling, all I was saying is that I didn't see the topic announcing the game so I was unaware of what was posted there.

The funny thing is, is a town doctor would have to be <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">EXTREMELY</div> dumb to give away their role. Now if there was scum who saw this, they would only have to be slightly stupid to claim doctor. So I would have presented this then and asked the rest of town to lynch them. However my plan backfired and ended up with me getting a bunch of votes, which is expected. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that I would like to point out is that Kid A, while it looked like I was rolefishing, decided to vote Don, and not me.

Mainly because it hinges on me being \"competent\" and not meeting her expectations when a) we've only played two games together, one of which I was scum (and highly competent!) and the other in which I was town (not nearly as competent!)  And then she takes this premise (Desperado is generally competent, he is not playing competently, ergo he is scum) and it somehow makes sense in her head even though it really shouldn't given her experience with me.  Particularly, she thinks I blatantly defended my scumpal ASP (rather than just pursuing an independent read) and then followed that up by going overboard with distancing when his lynch was imminent.<br>\n<br>\nRecap: Elyse has first hand experience of my \"competency\" as scum, yet here she believes I am scum because I am playing \"incompetently.\"  It's whack, bunkum, BS, whatever you want to call it--the case blows and she isn't going to vote it because it isn't genuine.<br>\n<br>\n@Muffin: I don't see you doing a whole lot to help my wagon gain any of that traction.
