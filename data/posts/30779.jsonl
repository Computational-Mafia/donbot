My joining the Formerfish wagon was obviously purely for early pressure to try and get an off reaction.  Now whilst we got a bit of a reaction, I didn't think it was indicative of scum, so when Elyse tried to pull me into her page long argument with Desperado I had to set it straight as to what I was thinking.<br><br>So I started looking elsewhere. ASP's response to my question to him looked pretty scummy so I voted him.  His followup in #61 made me consider the first post in a different way; I'd asked him a question so he gave me his thought process, which was pretty messy, brain onto paper type kind of thing.  #61 is logical and consistent and changes the read for me.   <br><br>That's my thought process regarding my votes thus far.  Note that you and Desperado don't factor into it anywhere.  If someone's comments sway me to changing my vote then I'll acknowledge it as a factor; your comments are only serving to make me waste time defending when I could be looking for scum.<br><br>So I'm back to not-quite-square-one.  I do find Elyse and Desperado's spat on page 2 interesting and I'm not liking mnemonicdevice's paltry contributions thus far.  Agreed with Gee Gee we need to get cracking a bit, I'll scour the thread and see what positive contribution I can make tomorrow."}

I also notice BvD mentioning him ignoring a question from BvD.

I find empirical evidence much more effective than what people post. i.e. scummy players can post townie things and townie players can post scummy things, but when a player actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span> something scummy, that should overrule what they are posting. if there was more time, we could feel it out a bit more, but if we need to agree on a lynch I am fine by following the actual evidence of actions here.<br><br>p-edit: elyse, if that doesn't answer your question just let me know. I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> BvD's alignment. just because I would be surprised if they flip scum, does not make them innocent. if I can tonight or tomorrow I can go back and draw up why they might be scum. it is mainly(for me) based on the end of day actions around the scum wagon. otherwise they were a town read of mine. around deadline is not a time to be obstinate when my reads aren't super concrete anyway."}

I suppose one could do so as town to to try to protect his or her interests later in the game and protect himself from being framed for a NK through his scum-reads being targeted.

I apologize for not fully informing you of my entire thought process.<br><br>And as for waffling, all I was saying is that I didn't see the topic announcing the game so I was unaware of what was posted there. I figured that cult wouldn't be involved because it's a bit more specialized of a role and would probably be mentioned in this thread.

And then she takes this premise (Desperado is generally competent, he is not playing competently, ergo he is scum) and it somehow makes sense in her head even though it really shouldn't given her experience with me.  Particularly, she thinks I blatantly defended my scumpal ASP (rather than just pursuing an independent read) and then followed that up by going overboard with distancing when his lynch was imminent.<br><br>Recap: Elyse has first hand experience of my \"competency\" as scum, yet here she believes I am scum because I am playing \"incompetently.\"  It's whack, bunkum, BS, whatever you want to call it--the case blows and she isn't going to vote it because it isn't genuine.<br><br>@Muffin: I don't see you doing a whole lot to help my wagon gain any of that traction.

D1 you had him as a very strong town read (the first listed among your two strongest town reads) and with little to no explanation you suddenly were \"most unsure\" about him of all the players and decided to ISO him first when doing ISOs (i'm not even sure if you did any other ISOs). nothing happened between D1 and D2 that should have changed your read on slandaar that drastically, and if anything your town read on him should have been strengthened after lucky's flip.<br><br>another thing i didn't like is your read progression on kid A. even just today you go from thinking his posts look genuine and not being able to see him as scum, to thinking he's null and worth a vote. why would you even vote a null read whose posts you think are \"genuine\"? why is someone whose posts you think are genuine even null?<br><br>there's also minor things here and there i didn't like. for example, the rolefishing stuff (docs + \"there aren't any masons in this game, are there...?\") and i agree with peabody's point about your initial post today - it did look like a variant of congratulating the doc. <br><br>@dj,<br><br>i'm gonna be straight up with you. even if i were scum and i <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> think saki was a traitor, and even if i <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> think recruiting a traitor was a worthwhile use of a NK (hint: i don't), i cannot think of a scenario where i would willingly shoot saki in an attempt to recruit him. that wasn't me misunderstanding anything, that was me thinking a saki recruit is ludicrous."}

D1 you had him as a very strong town read (the first listed among your two strongest town reads) and with little to no explanation you suddenly were \"most unsure\" about him of all the players and decided to ISO him first when doing ISOs (i'm not even sure if you did any other ISOs). nothing happened between D1 and D2 that should have changed your read on slandaar that drastically, and if anything your town read on him should have been strengthened after lucky's flip.<br><br>another thing i didn't like is your read progression on kid A. even just today you go from thinking his posts look genuine and not being able to see him as scum, to thinking he's null and worth a vote. why would you even vote a null read whose posts you think are \"genuine\"? why is someone whose posts you think are genuine even null?<br><br>there's also minor things here and there i didn't like. for example, the rolefishing stuff (docs + \"there aren't any masons in this game, are there...?\") and i agree with peabody's point about your initial post today - it did look like a variant of congratulating the doc. <br><br>@dj,<br><br>i'm gonna be straight up with you. even if i were scum and i <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> think saki was a traitor, and even if i <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> think recruiting a traitor was a worthwhile use of a NK (hint: i don't), i cannot think of a scenario where i would willingly shoot saki in an attempt to recruit him. that wasn't me misunderstanding anything, that was me thinking a saki recruit is ludicrous.</div></blockquote><br><br>Thanks for your thoughts.However:<br>1. As for slandaar, I had re-read his ISO because I had felt like it, just because he had the most posts (and I think the most content), and while I did, I became unsure of his townieness. Then I decided to do a PBP analysis to finalize my thoughts on him.<br>2.The thing is, Kid A is the only one that had more than one vote (at that time), and one of the two wagons that town was willing to lynch (me being the other one, which I wouldn't want dead for obvious reasons). Because of that, my vote on Kid A<br>3. I am sorry if I said that the doctor did a good job. I don't understand how that is scummy."}

I was getting pissed at the slow speed of that last day. it seemed to me if we just lynched down the line of my suspects then we would have won easily. if the kidA wagon had taken off, his claim would have stopped his lynch and mnem would have gone. so no harm done. I saw your point, but like I said, I never assume scum is sub par. town win is a town win, next time we can maybe try and put our philosophies aside because I think we both did good work."}
