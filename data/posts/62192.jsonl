You have performed exactly as a post-card townie (gods help us if you are Mafia-alignment.). Your playing very similar to a player in my last game, Glitch, who not only was VT, but also provided posts with lots of detail and criticism of all players, rather than focussing on one player (what I call tunnel-visioning, which I can do a lot of the time, something I&#8217;m trying to rectify).

Investigative posts, which provide lots of detail, as well as not following a general bandwagon, label you more town then null.<br>\n<br>\n@Glork. I&#8217;m not sure what to think about you. On one hand, some of your posts are rather good, but you also immediately jump to scum-team conclusion on D1. This suggests that you are anxious to end the day on a vote, as the town should only start systematically scanning for scum-tells, not pairing town players together on D1. IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n@Green Canyon. Your town-ish, but your meta can sometimes be scummy (i.e. the joining of wagons e.t.c.) And to answer your question: No, it was RVS. No, I was simply providing reasons for why Duck may be scummy, for the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n@KayP <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6952988#p6952988\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6952988#p6952988\" data-post-id=\"6952988\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 47</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26002\">KayP</a> wrote:</cite>Oh, sure, the goal is to find mafia.

Maybe I&#8217;m missing the context of this post (viewing these in ISO BTW) but  what you are essentially saying is that we shouldn&#8217;t vote for people because they are likely to be town? The point of the game is to vote and find the Mafia, before they lynch all town members. This statement directly contradicts the purpose of Mafia! You are pushing for us to vote random people, which is directly in the Mafia&#8217;s favour!<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955964#p6955964\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6955964#p6955964\" data-post-id=\"6955964\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 134</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26002\">KayP</a> wrote:</cite>What is wrong with people on this site and making reasonless votes?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThere is something called RVS.<br>\n<br>\nI think that KayP is currently the most scummy player. However, I do not think he is Mafia. He&#8217;s the best vote for us IMO, but with Ducks at L-1. I&#8217;m unsure whether I&#8217;ll swap over on D1.<br>\n<br>\n@Kitty. Whilst you haven&#8217;t contributed much yet, you have provided a valid reason for your inactivity, so I have to place you in null for now (hate doing that <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">)<br>\n<br>\n@LalalaDucks, still confused why you are at L-1. Her play-style doesn&#8217;t dictate her alignment guys. A skilled player can change their meta, if that is what is labelling them as scum-tell. This early on though I can&#8217;t place you as town or scum ATM (I hate D1, the worst stage for sure).<br>\n<br>\n@Marquis BEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Obviously Scum</div><br>\n<br>\n@TellTaleHeart. Ooh yes, I like your play style. Like Bella, you are question and scrutinising everybody, and not joining bandwagons for the sake of it like some other players. You are correct about my previous post, it was a rant more than anything, not a reason for voting Ducks. You are definitely the second highest town-read for the town.<br>\n<br>\n@Bulge Why the lack of posts? This early on, inactiveness must always regarded as suspicious, unless it is justified. Here, you either are simply one of those players who does not care about the game, or wants to remain in the shadows, and simply complying with what the town wants. Scum-tell right here. But not Mafia read as again, it&#8217;s only D1.<br>\n<br>\n@Untold Tripod. Eh, again, you&#8217;re one of those players I can&#8217;t properly scrutinise until later phases. Unfortunately putting you in null for now <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR<br>\nIt&#8217;s hard to determine whether a player is town or scum or PR on D1 (unless they make a really bad slip-up). Unfortunately this means that a lot of players are in the null category for me (which I hate doing <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">). The best vote ATM is for KayP, and the two most townish players would be Bellaphant and Telltaleheart.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: KayP</span>", "time": "Wed Jun 17, 2015 10:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

(Like, I could see if an individual said \"I have a hard time reading X specific person until later in the game,\" but universally saying \"don't expect much until D2\" is just an excause to not try to contribute.)<br>\n<br>\nI then said the rest of the post wasn't that terrible, by which I meant was actually pretty decent. Even though he had just claimed to not be able to provide much analysis, he tried to lay down something for everyone, which is plus points in my book.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, there was one thing that didn't make sense to me. Part of what made me suspicious of Bella was the general lack of content/insight in her posts. Yet Shadoxx claims that she's playing very similarly to a player who provided lots of detail and criticism, which was the exact OPPOSITE impression I had. So I asked for clarification because it looked like he was just arbitrarily defending Bella, and I want to know why.<br>\n<br>\nThat right there is me providing my immediate reaction/thoughts, and seeking to learn more about another player.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNow let's take a look at what BiBob does in response.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6963740#p6963740\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6963740#p6963740\" data-post-id=\"6963740\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 293</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1333\">Glork</a> wrote:</cite>BiBob has amazingly said almost nothing in his posts.

I mean, it's nice that glork went along with it, but to me it just reads like asking for elaboration on a curious read</div></blockquote><br>\nSo, let's break this down.<br>\n<br>\nWe know that BiBob had a pre-existing suspicion of me for ~reasons~ that remain unexplained. So he starts responding to my response to TTH, which came after his initial post that he suspected me, meaning that he's not actually providing context or explanation of any of that so-called gut read. He's just going with what was recently talked about.<br>\n<br>\nMea culpa on the hypothetical, I can see how that wouldn't carry over because all I did was start that line of thougth with \"if you're going to say X, I'll respond with Y.\" Obivously TTH <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">said</div> X, so I can see how my response could be taken the way BiBob took it. Even then....<br>\nBiBob asks if I claim that Shadoxx <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">looked at the vote count</div> and made his argument. No, I don't claim that, I never did, and I never will. I don't profess to know what Shadoxx was thinking. I never implied that I thought he did this with full knowledge/context of the vote count, and I have no idea why you're including this in your argument. It reeks of wordsmithing to try to reinforce his own argument.<br>\nHe also asks if, in his reading of the vote count, he saw \"himself at L-3, his buddy lala on L-1, and his other buddy with two votes.\" Like I said, I thought I made it very clear that I felt Lala was town, given that I hated the wagon and I hated that Bella/Shadoxx (two of my suspects) were on that wagon. Yet somehow BiBob manages to argue that I was claiming some kind of idiotic clusterfuck of scumbussing, which I DON'T think happened, and I NEVER claimed was the case.<br>\nTHEEEEEEEN BiBob asserts that I claimed Shadoxx's thought process was \"My #1 priority is making Bella look town.\" I absolutely NEVER claimed that either. Just because I noticed that argument doesn't mean I thought it was his #1 priority. Assuming he's scum near lynch, his #1 priority is probably not-getting-lynched, and while I specifically called out the Bella defense, it was but one point in an entire player-by-player analysis he made. And yet SOMEHOW BiBob managed to turn \"Glork noticed this argumetn and asked about it\" into \"Glork is claiming that this is the MAIN THING SHADOXX CARED ABOUT\" which is complete and utter horse shit.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBiBob's argument is hand-crafted on either a scum motivation to try to dump suspicion onto me by leaping to outrageous and incorrect conclusions, or he's so caught up in his own confirmation bias he's making connections in his head that don't exist.<br>\n<br>\nSo while I asked Shadoxx questions in an attempt to learn more about him so I could figure out his alignment, BiBob's post is designed and worded in a way to make me look as bad as possible, even if it means<br>\n1) Making assumptions about what I \"claimed\" to know Shadoxx was thinking<br>\n2) Making an argument based on the erroneous statement that I thought the scumgroup was Shadoxx/Bella/Lala<br>\n3) Making a false argument that I claimed Shadoxx's primary purpose in his player-by-player analysis was clearing Bella, rather than clearing himself<br>\n<br>\nAnd to be frank, I don't see this coming from town.

All of your posts have been in-depth and contributive to the town. You have performed exactly as a post-card townie (gods help us if you are Mafia-alignment.). Your playing very similar to a player in my last game, Glitch, who not only was VT, but also provided posts with lots of detail and criticism of all players, rather than focussing on one player (what I call tunnel-visioning, which I can do a lot of the time, something I&#8217;m trying to rectify). You also have acted skeptical at some points, and questions peoples votes (if not in RVS).</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is a fair assessment of Bella up to this post 294, but I disagree slightly. Bella had started pretty towny for me. She pushed in the right places early with a good line of questioning of KayP to get us out of RVS, and pushed KayP for a reachy/vague post 41 (and Bella backs up her reasons in post 72), as well as the fact that GC pushed KayP into voting me. Bella makes a push on me about being on the early ducky wagon while I was finding TTH's L-2 suspicious, which is even more towny of her to realize she was misunderstanding my interpretation of my misunderstanding of TTH's triple vote joke. She then votes KayP, albeit after prodding from Glork. But it wasn't without precedence, as UT seemed to imply in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6959874#p6959874\" class=\"postlink\">231</a>.<br>\n<br>\nBut where Bella starts to worry me is she then moves her vote on to ducky for lack of content, but otherwise goes unexplained. This felt opportunistic, and at that point ducky had started to actually provide content (see Ducky content in 90, 105, 107, 141 (which was sheeped KayP reasoning though)). Yes, ducky's content wasn't fantastic, but Bella didn't really follow up on it, and it felt opportunistic to get ducky to L-2 with deadline approaching.<br>\n<br>\nAfter post 294, Bella starts to get even worse. She changes her vote to Shadoxx for calling her town. I guess she thinks Shadoxx is cozying up to her as scum, but it feels so reactionary (I might think differently from Bella, but I start to notice buddying after a bit of a pattern of it) and again opportunistic, this time putting Shadoxx at L-3 for a single reason. She's been a wagon hopper rather than a wagon starter at every point after her KayP vote. In 340, Bella claims Shadoxx throws suspicion at her, but I don't see it above (\"God help us if you are mafia\" isn't exactly throwing suspicion, it's more a statement of belief in his mind). Bella, what other reasons do you have for voting Shadoxx besides them calling you towny?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR --</div> Bella is moving into my scum pile after an early towny start, for unoriginal and opportunistic hopping on the ducky and shadoxx wagons with weak arguments.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Bob I say your playing town-to-null at this point. It is hard to place a player into either player (except if  they have very striking play). You are not as much of a town read as Bella, because her posts have more detail IMO. However, you haven&#8217;t actively followed a bandwagon AFAIK.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is fine too from Shadoxx. I agree, BiBob didn't have a ton of material by the time of Shadoxx's post, with the main highlights being:<br>\n- saying \"the wordy people are fine\"<br>\n- BobLob is formulaic<br>\n- Shadoxx case is interesting but he wants to lynch the experienced (actually, this could be a scum mindset now that I think of it)<br>\n- A little back and forth with TTH which didn't exactly move the gamestate forward<br>\n<br>\nSince 294, BiBob has made an awkward push on Glork.<br>\n- It started out as \"gut\" in 305, yet calling glork reasonable in the same post.<br>\n- In 309, it's still gut and he's starting to disagree with his Glork read already<br>\n- Asks UT for his read on Glork in 313, then votes Glork in 329, essentially for disagreeing with Glork about Shadoxx's motivation for calling Bella towny. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">But never states how Glork's disagreement with BiBob actually makes Glork scummy.</div> I'm still trying to figure out why BiBob thinks Glork is scummy, other than disagreeing with the Shadoxx motivation.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR --</div> BiBob started out kinda null with one red flag (lynch the veterans!), then made a really awkward push on Glork.

A lot of your posts have also been incredibly short, providing not much detail. IGMEOY</div></blockquote><br>\nI can see Shadoxx's point of view about BobLob joining bandwagons and all. I mean, BobLob *hasn't* done a whole lot, but I actually think what BobLob has done been fine. He's clearly calling out attention to his bandwagon votes, which I don't see scum really doing. His cases on myself and subsequently on Bella were both towny.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Glork. I&#8217;m not sure what to think about you. On one hand, some of your posts are rather good, but you also immediately jump to scum-team conclusion on D1. This suggests that you are anxious to end the day on a vote, as the town should only start systematically scanning for scum-tells, not pairing town players together on D1. IGMEOY.</div></blockquote><br>\nI disagree with Shadoxx's stance on Glork, but it's pretty nit-picky on my end. I think Glork actually makes a great case on KayP in 95, and 101. Post 130 was meant to get Bella to actually do something with her vote (and it worked!), and the rest of his posts were just kinda statements, but he sets up his later push on BiBob in 293. Yes, Glork throws out a scum-team pair, but it didn't appear \"anxious\" IMO. It was more tongue-in-cheek from Glork.<br>\n<br>\nSince 294, I actually disagree with Glork on the Shadoxx/Bella thing (like BiBob does), but I'm not using that as a reason to say Glork is scummy. In fact, Glork is interested in Shadoxx's mindest on how he formed the Bella opinion (see 331), which is the right approach. Glork's 334 is a very good retort to BiBob, especially the 3 points at the bottom of that post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR --</div> This is scumhunting Glork, with a good push on KayP, Bella, and especially on BiBob.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@KayP <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6952988#p6952988\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6952988#p6952988\" data-post-id=\"6952988\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 47</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26002\">KayP</a> wrote:</cite>Oh, sure, the goal is to find mafia.

He rightly calls out that KayP is approaching mafia from the opposite mindset of how it should be approached. He even says KayP is the most scummy player.

She questioned me well on my Ducky vote, even up to the point of disproving my assumption of Ducky's lack of content. That felt towny KayP. But I can't help but agree with Shadoxx that the mindset of \"assume everyone is town\" instead of \"try to find scum\" is weird and backward. That's a mafia mindset, IMO. I still need to sort KayP.<br>\n<br>\nSince 294, KayP goes on the aggressive against Shadoxx's points against her in 339. I can't say I agree with KayP, and I cannot tell if her push is town motivated to find scum in Shadoxx, or overly defensive scum. She's also trying to make sense of UT, which is fine, but she should push this harder if town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR -- I have no idea on KayP</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Kitty.

I got confused with your most recent unvote of her and your comment about being premature. <br>\n<br>\nI think Glork's case on BiBob in 334 is mixed. <br>\n<br>\nThe VC point is superfluous - the point is BiBob is asking Glork if Glork thinks Shadox acted in a certain manner in light of the game state. Shadox would know that game state by looking at the VC. The fact that Glork didn't mention Shadox looking at the VC is irrelevant because it's implied by way of the fact that Glork attributes purpose to Shadox's actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe Glork's theory of ducks/Shadox scumbuddies comment is also blah. I have no reason to think this was somehow a malicious scum lie coming from BiBob rather than a simple mistake, especially because of how easily it can be shown false and how little value it provides BiBob. <br>\n<br>\nThe third point - BiBob mischaracterizing Glork's Shadox theory so as to say that Glrok thinks Shadox's primary goal was to defend Bella - holds water and is pretty solid as far as points go. With Glork's problem was Shadox this reframed, BiBob's has a superb point. But one that doesn't actually hold up to reality, because BiBob is criticizing a case Glork didn't really make. <br>\n<br>\nBiBob's defense that is was \"hyperbole\" hits me the wrong way. Like, sure, you can be hyperbolic in this game, but that doesn't really justify warping someone else's case to where it becomes seriously flawed. This is also a weak excuse because, as a defense, I have no way to discern whether it is true (and context does not push me in that direction).", "time": "Fri Jun 19, 2015 1:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

Glork already pointed out posts 130/131 where he calls out Bella, and Bella responds with a vote on KayP. Then she does the same thing just now when I call her out (she responds with a vote on Shadoxx). But the parts that bothered me the most about Bella were the points I made yesterday, and then how the end of D1 went down. First are the points I made yesterday:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Frog on Bella D1</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6966824#p6966824\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6966824#p6966824\" data-post-id=\"6966824\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 356</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite>But where Bella starts to worry me is she then moves her vote on to ducky for lack of content, but otherwise goes unexplained. This felt opportunistic, and at that point ducky had started to actually provide content (see Ducky content in 90, 105, 107, 141 (which was sheeped KayP reasoning though)). Yes, ducky's content wasn't fantastic, but Bella didn't really follow up on it, and it felt opportunistic to get ducky to L-2 with deadline approaching.<br>\n<br>\nAfter post 294, Bella starts to get even worse. She changes her vote to Shadoxx for calling her town. I guess she thinks Shadoxx is cozying up to her as scum, but it feels so reactionary (I might think differently from Bella, but I start to notice buddying after a bit of a pattern of it) and again opportunistic, this time putting Shadoxx at L-3 for a single reason. She's been a wagon hopper rather than a wagon starter at every point after her KayP vote. In 340, Bella claims Shadoxx throws suspicion at her, but I don't see it above (\"God help us if you are mafia\" isn't exactly throwing suspicion, it's more a statement of belief in his mind). Bella, what other reasons do you have for voting Shadoxx besides them calling you towny?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR --</div> Bella is moving into my scum pile after an early towny start, for unoriginal and opportunistic hopping on the ducky and shadoxx wagons with weak arguments.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of follow the crowd, let's look at how Bella ends D1.

This is a \"trying to fit in as a townsperson\" mentality.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThen later that same post Bella says...<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Would prefer a claim, tho.</div></blockquote><br>\nPrefer a claim??? With 1 hour left on D1??? What's the point in wanting a claim there? I mean, first, BiBob was on V/LA...so he wasn't going to claim. Next, the second biggest wagon had TWO votes (which ironically was the Shadoxx wagon which Bella and KayP were on). If BiBob does happen to be there and claims a PR, there isn't enough time to gather enough people to lynch someone else (and if somehow there was, it's a last minute panic lynch). Instead, what's likely to happen is a no-lynch and a PR is outed, meaning scum knows where to place the night kill. Asking for a claim in that situation only fits a scum mentality.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFinally, right before the KayP hammer, Bella asks this...<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6969658#p6969658\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6969658#p6969658\" data-post-id=\"6969658\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 411</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25328\">Bellaphant</a> wrote:</cite>Frog, I can hammer now if you want?</div></blockquote><br>\nThis totally reads as \"hey I'm scum just checking to make sure it's OK for me to hammer so I don't get the attention on D2 after I hammer this townie\".<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI actually am suspicious of both Bella and KayP for the end of D1. They both ask for a claim with an hour left, both were on the Shadoxx wagon, after having earlier been suspicious of each other (Bella voted KayP in 131, KayP had mentioned in her 192 she was happy with the two wagons going on at the time, which ironically happened to be......Bella and Shadoxx). Something weird is going on in those three, but Bella's play strikes me as the most suspicious, because it's not coming from a town mindset.", "time": "Mon Jun 22, 2015 3:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

I was ready to push the hell out of glork up to the past couple pages in which a few posts gave me pause on that scum read.  I've had frogged as a town read since early game and that hasn't gone away, but his read and reasoning on Bella is faulty.  Actually all of yours are and I'm rather disappointed by how shallowly some of you are looking at things.  Anyway, I'll talk more about that tomorrow when I'm not in bed on my iPad, and while I'm not Bella, I think there are things obvious in her personality/experience level that you guys are just dinging her for that are not leading you down a correct path here.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, for any scum that are trying to push my slot, you should put on your best dancing shoes.

Her being a replacement already makes some things not comparable, but I was interested in the vote thing.  People are using the vote thing as a reason to scum read her, and I wish I would have seen you refute that point.  There's a point in that game when she replaces in that she called metal sonic obvious scum but doesn't vote him.  Later someone asks why not and she says that she doesn't like voting while drunk and votes in that post, which is similar to her behavior here.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I didn't spend a lot of time on that ISO but was just looking for a baseline for what to think you would expect to her.  IT did, however, confirm my suspicions about Bella's playstyle, which I'll talk about after I get some breakfast and get to a computer.  It would have been nice to see you bring up the point about voting, but it doesn't matter too much I guess.  I still think you're town, just wrong here.", "time": "Tue Jun 23, 2015 3:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

She reads like a cautious newb townie who is still learning how to play this game and navigate everything.  I don't always vote when I suspect someone and I've been playing for years.  Lots of people don't always vote.  I remember when I first started playing the game, I'd forget to vote even more than I forget to now, but mostly I was afraid to vote because I always worried that I could be wrong and I wanted to get it right.  I'm seeing a similar type of behavior here (though I don't understand the laladucks vote - I look forward to a misapplication of the amished tell here.)<br>\n<br>\nThe accommodating thing is fiiiiiiiinish except here too you're just not looking at her mindset.  She's a newb in a game with strong personalities who've, in some cases, been playing longer/sound more confident.  Following what they do or trying to be accommodating in that instance is just another newb tell.<br>\n<br>\nSometimes newb's play gets thrown off when they're suspected for no reason.  I'm reading her game as taking a hit of confidence when she started getting suspected and a wagon grew on her.  I've had this type of thing happen to me when I was newer, in which I start off feeling pretty good, I'm asking questions and trying to figure out the game, but then someone comes in and thinks I look like obvscum for it and then the wagon starts to grow.  People react in different ways.  I tend to meltdown, she stepped back.  Sometimes it's hard to recover from that and that's what I'm seeing here.<br>\n<br>\nAs to the other stuff, I can't really answer for or explain but I think you're trying to make her out to be scum instead of actually read her.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, to anyone scum reading bellaphant, your read is wrong, your case is wrong.  Help me find the real scum.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, I'll get to the other parts of the game.  I'll probably be a little off and on today as I have work to do, but I will be around all day.

KayP's angle on frogger sucked and the continued questioning of it sucked.  I had an early KayP/laladucks scum team in mind from that because that laser focus on frogger for his reasons early game didn't ring true to me.  That said a shallow accusation that early in the game is also weak, but people do that all the time.  Early game things are going to be nebulous and weak, people are going to push things they themselves are doing and hypocrisy is pretty rampant in any game.<br>\n<br>\nSo when Glork came in with his vote on KayP and reasoning, I was right there with him.

The \"bust some scums tomorrow\" is a type of false bravado thing that is trying to sound like he'll have this game all figured out.  These are the types of things that when you wonder what is wrong with someone and they say gut, they're referring to.  This just doesn't make sense.  I think it's been a while since Glork would be counted on to find all the scum in a game early, and the tone just feels so wrong, from my admittedly limited experience.  So, it just feels like he's trying to sound lighthearted while at the same time serious that he will catch scum.  This is just a thing that goes to mindset.  He's not really analyzing the game in a way that feels organic, and his post where he declares he's probably right about everything is laughable when he has my slot as scum in there.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I don't expect anyone to really find this compelling but it's one of those little tonal/cues that tend to stick out to me.

I mean he picks it back up a few posts later, but his last game-related post is the one where he votes Bella and asks if she's scum with KayP, so how did he forget KayP right there and how did it get replaced with Shadox whom he hasn't mentioned yet?  I have been playing around with a potential scum team of Glork and KayP as that would explain the jumping in to go after Kayp - which would also help to endear him to frogger whose back he'd probably be expected to have anyway - and then find a weak reason to jump off of her and leave her as an \"okay\" lynch but have others as stronger.  I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this because a) lol associative without a flip and b) I haven't decided what I think about KayP, but I want it noted here in case either of them do flip.<br>\n<br>\nSome of the other things brought up on day one from TTH were pretty sound.  His reads didn't really add up/were too easy.  Most of my problem is the lack of real analysis.  I don't think that Shadoxx asking for time for day two is terrible and I'm surprised he kinda harped on that.  I don't like at all the way that he responds to the cases on him.  For TTH he tries to discredit her and the case by scare quoting \"case\" and then says it's lazy, inaccurate and bad.  I didn't think it was bad at all and considering the shit ass vote he has on my slot, I just don't think he believes anything he says this game.<br>\n<br>\nHe's coming across more condescending than he is coming across trying to figure out the game.  The case with bibob was especially terrible.  There were some missteps in Bibob's case, sure, some mistakes, but the way that Glork presented them was that Bob was this master of word twisting and there were some things in his case that I was surprised that people didn't point out that they weren't the way that Glork pushed it as.  I don't want to make a big point of this because obviously I'm coming in here with confirmation bias so it colors how I read it, but it's another case in point where it feels like Glork isn't actually trying to figure out the game but is pushing a narrative and slamming anyone that suspects him.<br>\n<br>\nQuite frankly this is exactly the reason I have no expectations of being able to turn around this lynch on me as I expect Glork to double down with his shitty sticky scum read on my slot and help drive this lynch through.  But tomorrow, if he's still alive like I expect him to be, please for the love of all that is good and holy actually look at the way he's been reading the game.  He hasn't really analyzed in a way that he should be, he's not rethinking things, he's just phoning it in.<br>\n<br>\nWhere I start waffling on Glork is his day two play:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6973800#p6973800\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6973800#p6973800\" data-post-id=\"6973800\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 431</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1333\">Glork</a> wrote:</cite>Bella, this is the second time you have immediately responded to a vote/criticism of your play by placing your vote to alleviate pressure on you.

My problem is that I haven't seen a bunch of reevaluating and looking back it's certainly clear that he had a core of scum reads that he jumped off of to push a case on bob, which does have scum motivation, if you think you can shut down your opposition because you have more of the backing/are less of an awkward player, then absolutely this is something scum can do.<br>\n<br>\nI think what I like about the omgus thing is it feels like a little humility here and some of the condescension that was bothering me isn't as present during this day phase.  And no condescension isn't a scum tell, but the way he's gone about it does feel that way.  The confidence/tone feels all wrong.<br>\n<br>\nI absolutely love the last line of the last post.  It's within what he could say as scum, and it could be exactly how he feels regardless, which makes this less compelling than it would be otherwise.<br>\n<br>\nI guess my main problem is that he just doesn't feel like he's actually trying to figure out the game.  He looks like he's trying to figure out the game, but it's all superficial.  He's not reevaluating and he's gone rather surface with stuff.  Basically, he feels like he's trying to construct a narrative rather than evaluate the flow of the game.  It's a real bummer too because I was hoping he was town.  I loved both of the early games I played with Glork and really respected the way he looks at the game, and here it's just a disappointment.  But I think that disappointment is because he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to go for a swim, and not vote OH NO!, and think about this and the rest of the game.

{"number": 527, "id": "6978887", "user": "KayP", "user_id": "26002", "content": "Tammy posted a lot of words! And some of them were words that made sense and felt okay, and then some of them were words that felt purely driven by her desire to get Glork lynched... and that desire feels motivated for purely defensive reasons. I'm reading through it now, and basically everything Tammy said seemed to come from a place of \"Glork attacked me and therefore he is scum\".<br>\n<br>\nI'm trying to put my finger on the specifics of what feels 'off' about it but I'm finding it difficult. Just sort of writing all stream-of-consciousness style here then I'll clean it up into something more structured later... Glork's push on me never felt really serious, as I mentioned above. His suspicion of me was also pretty early in the game, like page 5? It's weird that Tammy seemingly doesn't like early game serious reads (as evidenced by Tammy's point about my early questioning of Frogger) but is willing to jump all over Glork having a fluid read that early. I just went back and looked and remembered that Glork voted for me early because he felt like I was jumping on a weak link (Frogger)... we had some dialogue about it in which we both explained ourselves... then he hopped on to other things. That felt pretty natural to me. In general, Glork's play feels like a movie reel where we're only getting the core/juicy parts of the scene and not the boring lead-in/exposition. It's like snapshots of a full read, which is weird. He doesn't explain every detail but I feel like I can usually deduce why he arrived where he did even if it requires some sleuthing? It's annoying, maybe, but it hasn't stood out as disingenuous to me. My early argument with him rubbed me the wrong way but not in a particularly mafia-like way.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think voting for Bella after <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955633#p6955633\" class=\"postlink\">130</a> is bad. I got frustrated with that post too, and while I didn't vote Bella for it, I'm also way more curmudgeon-y with my votes than the rest of the people here. I generally only vote when I'm sure enough that I'd be okay with a lynch. I've noticed several people in this game flinging votes around at people as sort of \"warning shots\" or something. Tammy is really trying to paint a picture here where Glork is voting for Bella because of a \"joke post\" (don't worry, bee happy) but that isn't the case at all. Just like Tammy wants us to see that there's some clear subtext to Bella's projected path towards laying down a vote on me, there's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actual</div> clearly defined evidence for why people were frustrated with Bella at that point, and if you're viewing the votes this game as firestarters rather than proclamations of sure lynches, anyone with half a brain can see why Glork decided to vote Bella at this point! Bella had been useless, useless, useless, useless... then popped in to be even MORE useless than normal, and with the heat between myself and Glork dying down, he decided to put his vote elsewhere to appear more useful. At least, that's what I saw in this whole exchange, and Glork can speak for himself, but there's just something still nibbling away at me about Tammy's post that rubs me the wrong way.<br>\n<br>\nTammy also seemed to address her whole post towards the rest of the game and not towards Glork. It didn't seem like she wanted Glork to actually respond so she could suss out his alignment... again, this comes back to the whole \"motivated purely by defensiveness\" thing I mentioned earlier. Her post specifically asks the rest of the game to engage her on these points. \"Does this make sense to anyone?\" in relation to Glork's attack on Bella for the \"joke post\". \"If he was still scum reading KayP...\" is referencing Glork in the third person, instead addressing the rest of the game. I also find it weird that Tammy is busting Glork's chops over the \"attacking the joke post!\" episode, but when Glork is jokey by saying he'll come back to \"bust some scums\", Tammy drives that home as \"bullshit\" \"bravado\" and claims that as yet another reason Glork is mafia.<br>\n<br>\nTo be honest, I have no idea what to think about Glork, and he had been mostly under the radar for me because I liked that he was mostly agreeing with my reads. But I see NO WAY that Tammy's overly defensive, self-contradicting reasons on Glork are coming from town... and the style in which she went about it makes no sense if Glork is her mafia partner (he had no momentum on him at all). <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tammy</span><br>\n<br>\nAnd now that I've overshot my lunch break by 15 minutes...  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\"> Gotta run!", "time": "Tue Jun 23, 2015 6:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

You were essentially getting after him for playing mafia and in the process didn't let him get a read on lala organically from that.  Most people don't think they've caught scum for sure in the first few posts of the game and are trying to get a read.  And because it's the nature of the game that early posting isn't going to be strong, hypocrisy is going to be actually a common thing.  As the game progresses hypocrisy still isn't a scum tell.<br>\n<br>\nBy needling him the way that you did, you gave lala no reason to actually start producing content because the person who was pushing her to try to get a read on her was being attacked and questioned by you for playing the game.  You didn't let it play out.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't say that you hadn't prodded anywhere else.  I said a whole lot of it, and it is objectively true that you have not prodded everyone else in the game in the same manner you prodded frogger in the first few pages of the game, which makes my early observation of what type of player you are not as strong.<br>\n<br>\nNow I'm going swimming!</div></blockquote><br>\nMy pushing/questioning was overblown? No, my pushing/questioning was proportional to Frogger's stated conviction and reasons for voting lalaladucks after a page and a half of gameplay! If you want to talk about overblown, perhaps it should be in Frogger's direction. I don't know what's standard and what's not for early game, but me picking apart his terribly concocted and empty reasons for SERIOUS voting someone (note: not a joke vote or random vote) is not the problem, here. Read our exchange. Hypocrisy was part of it, maybe. But I don't mean hypocrisy in the sense of contradicting yourself... I understand as the game goes on, you may wind up contradicting yourself as reads change and evolve. But on PAGE TWO of a game, to be cherry picking reasons to get all righteous and serious when you yourself are guilty of those reasons? How is THAT less egregious than me needling every detail?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFrogger's quetsions and stances were fine.  He didn't seem self-righteous or cherry picking to me.

I have a problem with the way you went about attacking frogger's attempts to get a read early game.  Frogger was trying to get a read and you went nitpick and in the processes discredited not only his attempt and interrupted it, but you also gave lala an ability to not respond to the attack, which was why I originally thought you could be partnered with lala.  He was asking some pretty standard stuff.  (I would have had a problem with frogger if that was all he did about lala.)<br>\n<br>\nGlork doesn't have a fluid read that early if the read you're talking about is on bella.  She had been posting and prodding things in the first pages of the game.  Frogger made an activity post and a pun on bee, she made a joke and continued the bee pun.  Saying that she was unhelpful is negating the entire pages that came before that and jumping on something silly.  IE she made a joke.<br>\n<br>\nHe still wanted to lynch you and said you went quiet after the heat came off of you.  That is in no way, shape or form him holding your hands and singing kumbaya.

I got frustrated with that post too, and while I didn't vote Bella for it, I'm also way more curmudgeon-y with my votes than the rest of the people here. I generally only vote when I'm sure enough that I'd be okay with a lynch. I've noticed several people in this game flinging votes around at people as sort of \"warning shots\" or something. Tammy is really trying to paint a picture here where Glork is voting for Bella because of a \"joke post\" (don't worry, bee happy) but that isn't the case at all.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy did you get frustrated that she made a joke about work and did a bee pun?

I wasn't really sure until I got to this point, but I know now and there shouldn't be any confusion because it's clearly in black and white under his own writing.  (I know he adds on to the case later, but this was the original basis for his vote.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>kayp wrote:</cite><br>\n Just like Tammy wants us to see that there's some clear subtext to Bella's projected path towards laying down a vote on me, there's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actual</div> clearly defined evidence for why people were frustrated with Bella at that point, and if you're viewing the votes this game as firestarters rather than proclamations of sure lynches, anyone with half a brain can see why Glork decided to vote Bella at this point! Bella had been useless, useless, useless, useless... then popped in to be even MORE useless than normal, and with the heat between myself and Glork dying down, he decided to put his vote elsewhere to appear more useful. At least, that's what I saw in this whole exchange, and Glork can speak for himself, but there's just something still nibbling away at me about Tammy's post that rubs me the wrong way.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nErm.  Show me the uselessness?  As well as the evidence for why people were frustrated with bella at that point in the game?  Bella didn't have a vote on her before Glork voted her for her \"useless one liner\" and I don't see a whole lot of suspicion on her at that point.<br>\n<br>\nThese three posts show her telegraphing a vote on you.  Her voting you was no surprise.<br>\n<br>\nYou should go back and read the exchange because I don't get how you think that Glork started glowing at you and you've got things out of order.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>kayp wrote:</cite><br>\nTammy also seemed to address her whole post towards the rest of the game and not towards Glork. It didn't seem like she wanted Glork to actually respond so she could suss out his alignment... again, this comes back to the whole \"motivated purely by defensiveness\" thing I mentioned earlier. Her post specifically asks the rest of the game to engage her on these points. \"Does this make sense to anyone?\" in relation to Glork's attack on Bella for the \"joke post\". \"If he was still scum reading KayP...\" is referencing Glork in the third person, instead addressing the rest of the game.  I also find it weird that Tammy is busting Glork's chops over the \"attacking the joke post!\" episode, but when Glork is jokey by saying he'll come back to \"bust some scums\", Tammy drives that home as \"bullshit\" \"bravado\" and claims that as yet another reason Glork is mafia.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nCouple points.  I'm a replacement talking about things that have already passed.  It isn't scummy in the slightest to not address Glork himself.  I'm not writing Glork a love letter; I'm trying to convince town that there is something wrong with his play.  I'm pretty sure it leads to him being scum, I'm not going to convince him.<br>\n<br>\nYou are totally missing the point of the joke posts.  It goes to mindset and I said I didn't expect people to find it compelling.  I obviously don't have any problems with jokes.  But if you look at context, Bella's joke makes perfect sense as a response to frogger's post and a continuation of the joke.<br>\n<br>\nGlork says that \"he'll catch the scums\"; it's a type of post Ive seen come from scum several times.

I want him to realize he's wrong here because i think he's really trying to figure out the game.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think Glork's attack on my slot looks genuine and I think he's scum for it.

{"number": 559, "id": "6979680", "user": "KayP", "user_id": "26002", "content": "I'm just going to respond to Tammy in one post rather than quoting everything because that seems unreasonable.<br>\n<br>\nGlork never attacked you, Tammy, but he attacked your predecessor. The idea of a replacement is weird to me because in my regular games that I play with my group, if someone just doesn't show up or AFKs, we just modkill them. I think it was pretty clear I was referencing Glork attacking you as in your predecessor, and if that wasn't clear, then I apologized, but I thought that was pretty obvious.<br>\n<br>\nI'm saying his early attack on me felt as \"serious\" as my early attack on Frogger which felt as \"serious\" as Frogger's early attack on ducks. I sincerely don't understand how you're drawing an arbitrary line between what Frogger did to ducks versus the rest of it. It's VERY suspicious to me that you're so willing to give Frogger a pass for his stuff, but want to chastize me for my attack on Frogger and hold Glork's feet to the fire for his attacks on me, when all of it happened at about the same time. Pray tell, what exactly is so different about the timing? And don't give me this b/s about how my attack on Frogger was somehow inhibiting his attempt to read ducks... are you saying Frogger was only voting ducks to get a reaction/read? Because at NO POINT did Frog say that... in fact, he maintained the seriousness of his attack on ducks and has yet to say anything of the sort! Why is Frogger allowed to operate in a vacuum, free from persecution for his attacks? Why is his play just \"attempting to get a read\" and my play is \"interrupting what Frogger's doing\"? You still don't answer this. You don't answer what the difference is between the two methods or what makes my play different from Frogger's. What happens, exactly, when this happens? I notice something I thing is funky about Frogger's attacks on ducks... and you're saying I have to shut up because it interferes with Frogger's ability to read lalaladucks? What on Earth? How do you even know he's being sincere that early?<br>\n<br>\nBella had been incredibly useless and unhelpful basically the entire game. She gave some vague opinions, sure... but <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953384#p6953384\" class=\"postlink\">GC had to ask for more specific reasons</a>, and after some weak attacks against me she basically just backed down and sat there while I fought against Frogger and Glork. Bella had also just unvoted GC and not put the vote anywhere else or suggested anything else. You stating that Bella's buildup to vote me was legit is just plain wrong. I prodded Bella for more reasoning, she gave it, I responded, then Bella just ignored it and said \"thanks\" and didn't comment on it at all. With no more pressuring, that would seem to indicate being done with that line of questioning, so the vote on me after being prompted by Glork DID look panicky. I got frustrated when I saw the bee pun, because Bella had been saying I was scum, and I thought it was resolved, and other than pushing on someone I know to be town (spoiler alert: it's me!) I had nothing else for Bella, other than vague shit, and it made me frustrated when she could show up to make a dumb bee joke but not respond to me in any meaningful way.<br>\n<br>\nI did not read GLork's 431 and thus didn't see his claim that he voted Bella for the one-liner. I can't speak for Glork's true reasons... I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can</div> speak that, at least for me, I saw both me v Glork and me v Bella dying down a bit, where both had seemingly backed off a bit on their attacks on me, and then Bella had done nothing else except backed down off another read on GC and unvoted. It felt really fake, and I thought maybe Glork was as frustrated as I and had picked up on some of the same vibes that I did. <br>\n<br>\nAnd, sorry, I don't really care about your posts showing other people doing something you're accusing Glork of doing. Each person is different and I don't think there's some big secret universal way to play the game and catch people. The evidence doesn't convince me, and I have a very hard time understanding why a jokey post about catching scum is different from any other jokey post in the game. I'm just not buying it. I haven't dug deeper into Glork <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because he's been seemingly on board with my reads</div> and thus nothing has caught my eye about him. I explained this, please learn to read my posts! Sorry if that seems bitchy, but explaining myself again is really annoying.<br>\n<br>\nWhy do you think I'm hurt? Are you serious? I'm not \"hurt\" over you criticizing me -- I know I'm smart, and I know I'm decent at this game. I'm calling you out for having a double standard. It's not perfectly clear at all why you're singling me out over everyone else when I can point to specific comparisons, and you've yet to do anything to assuage those concerns. You're now resorting to some weird tactic of harping on me being \"butt hurt\". Please, lady -- get over yourself. Stop dodging and explain yourself without the sarcastic, degrading, bitchy comments, please! This is a game about arguing, and your tactic of softly calling me names or making me seem pedantic isn't doing you any favors. And your overwrought dramatic moments are ridiculous as well -- stop lamenting your death before it even happens, that's such a basic manipulation tactic.<br>\n<br>\nYou just can't be made happy. If I'm not needling every person, you're saying I'm inconsistent and not playing to your expectations... when I catch a scent I want to follow and go in depth with your posts, you say I'm needling for the sake of needling.

Also, I'm only interested in really lynching someone who I think has a really good chance at flipping scum because there's an innocent child out there and if they can stay hidden for as long as possible then maybe this town has a fighting chance.

It's why I said that you only \"look\" like you're trying to figure out the game.  I remember reading once that scum!glork is more protown than most other town players.  I wouldn't expect someone of your experience and talent to bumble about dropping scum tells left and right.  But what I do expect from town you is a bit deeper of analysis of the game.

{"number": 609, "id": "6980823", "user": "KayP", "user_id": "26002", "content": "Okay. I went back and thought about it. I still feel like Tammy's posts are rubbing me the wrong way and wouldn't mind seeing her lynched, but I'm having a really hard time determining whether that's logical or purely emotional. One thing I will say is that I really disliked Glork's response to Tammy's stuff... it may have been a lot to respond to, but he basically just attempts to brush off the entire thing without so much as a single nod in Tammy's direction. I've seen so much of that attitude this game that it's fairly old by this point, but that's basically the only thing against Glork that I can be 100% on board with, I think. Tammy's points just don't do much for me overall.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also really, really still wanting a Shaddox lynch. It's frustrating to me that my top suspect has replaced out after the pressure I put on him, and now his replacement just won't be able to answer my questions. It feels like the mafia equivalent of blue balls, and it's highly suspect to me that the replace out happened while under pressure. I won't be backing down from this, and I feel like there's blood in the water.<br>\n<br>\nI think it's time for me to see where I am with each player:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tammy/Bellaphant</div>: Still not a big fan of Bellaphant's early push against me, which then just caved in and gave way to a \"cease-fire\", followed by a jump onto me when prodded. I think Tammy's play is making it harder for me to really understand what I think about this player(s), because I already had resentment towards Bellaphant for reading me like that, and Tammy's personality and war of words with me has just made me more upset about that fact. I don't like Tammy's case against Glork, because it feels purely motivated from a mindset of attacking her attackers for the sake of discrediting them, and that feels like a scum tactic. I can't help but wonder if I'm bringing too much personal bias into this read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bob Loblaw</div>: Honestly, a player I haven't given much attention to, similar to Glork. Bob has been agreeing with my reads for the most part and thinks I'm town, which means he hasn't caught my eye or caused me to dig into his posts. I find it interesting that he has claimed he's an alternate account, though I don't think I can really use that in any way. I think I lean town on this guy for now just because his thoughts seem to align with mine, or at least... I can understand his thoughts, and I'm town, so he probably isn't able to emulate exact thought patterns of a townie that easily. (Also: I love Arrested Development! &lt;3)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fro99er</div>: I liked my early battle with him. It felt raw and fresh and fun. I think he was passionate. I backed down a bit from him after that exchange because it felt like he was justified. I'd be happy putting him in the town pile for now, and everything I've seen from him since then feels like an actual attempt to better understand the game and the players in it to make the right choice, rather than any kind of manipulation tactic.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Glork</div>: As I said earlier, he has flown under my radar because he was basically the only person agreeing with me on Shaddox D1. I guess that's a weakness of mine is ignoring people who like me or treat me as town. I don't find most of Tammy's points particularly compelling, but I do dislike his response to her points. I still think there are better options for a lynch, and I probably won't wind up supporting a Glork lynch barring some kind of serious revisiting of the points against Tammy from someone other than Tammy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Green Crayons</div>: He followed me onto Frogger early on... and nobody made a peep about it. He supported Glork's vote on Bella after the one-liner as reasonable... and yet Tammy is completely focused on Glork. He joined me on Shaddox... but never gave a reason for his support. He spent a lot of Day 1 engaging in arguments with TTH and doing weird fake claiming stuff with Untrod Tripod. Now that I'm thinking about it, there's a lot here to dislike so far, but this is the first time I've sat down and really thought about it sequentially like that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SleepyKrew/Kitty Galore</div>: Kitty did basically nothing, and SleepyKrew has done nothing so far as well. This is the most useless slot in the game because there's nothing to really go on here other than just neutral, grey, goopy content. Not impressed and definitely not liking how his stance so far seems to be \"going to wait for the lynch today to happen then I'll start contributing\". It basically allows him to stand off to the side and watch something happen without having any responsibility for anything today.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lalaladucks</div>: Oh ducks... I just don't know what to think about ducks. My town read on ducks at the start of the game was decently strong, but I think a lot of that was due to me viewing Frogger's attacks on her at the time as weird or phony. I think since then, I've had more issues with stances/plays she's made (as I explained to Tammy above), and I find the quick breakdown of the ducks wagon yesterday highly suspect. All D2 content/posts from her have been <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">awful</div> and with how the wagon seemingly just stopped yesterday, I'd be okay with a lynch here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Shadoxx8/RedCoyote</div>: The first two posts Shaddox made in this game were <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> sketchy. The 'attack' against me is really suspicious as well -- not only were the points made weak or downright falsehoods, but Shaddox tries to brush it all away by going \"I think KayP is scummiest, but isn't mafia\"... which I guess I can understand thinking \"the play is scummy but the player is town\", but then Shaddox votes me anyway. It makes absolutely no sense and, to me, looks like Shaddox engaged me then wanted to back down from it but couldn't find an elegant way to do so.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The Bulge</div>: He did nothing Day 1. He had light questioning of me early on, which I responded to and he never followed up on... then he just claimed he hates Day 1 and stopped contributing. Today, he has done nothing as well. He has probably the least amount of content in the game, possibly less than Kitty/SleepyKrew. I guess I'll just say that with so little to dig into, there's nothing we can go on, and that this game is \"short deadlines\" which means it's very easy for mafia to just hide in the inactivity and let town kill each other. This seems like a pretty valid strategy in such a fast-paced game. I'd like to see Bulge eat some tasty, tasty rope <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Untrod Tripod</div>: What even is this? I just looked at how many posts he has -- 43!! I was shocked by that number, because almost none of them feel useful, and I assumed he would have maybe 10 posts at most based on my fuzzy recollection of the game. Everyone seems to be just ignoring his weird stances and string of jokey comments and posts. I was okay with it earlier, to an extent, but at this stage in the game I'd expect someone with 43 posts to have more actual \"oomph!\" behind their posts.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nAll this thought exercise has done is show me I have way more potential mafia reads than I'd like to have, and it has me convinced that it's very likely mafia would hide behind inactivity or tactically be useless because the game's days go so quickly. I think, now, especially (which has changed since I started writing this post 45 minutes ago), that the stuff with me and Tammy and the stuff with Tammy and Glork is more likely to be all town simply because we're all \"visible\" for lack of a better word, and that we may be better off digging through this pile of inactives (Shaddox! Shaddox! Shaddox!) to weed out the mafia there.", "time": "Wed Jun 24, 2015 1:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

Across three sites, the only time I was mislynched was three years ago in Lyle in a game I replaced into.  I've never been mislynched a game I started out in.  I rarely ever even have wagon grow on me.  I have wanted to get mislynch end because expectations are overwhelming sometimes.)<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I hate the thought of being mislynched, but here it's really freeing.  I've tried to figure out why and I think I realized it.  I have an expiration date and everyone knows it; THEREFORE no one is trying to manipulate me because why bother?  All I have to do is do my work, get my shit done, and hope that I see some good impact come out of it in the dead thread.<br>\n<br>\nIt's oddly relaxing.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway that was an epiphany.

Truth be told, I haven't really read the last few pages in depth because I'm not overly enthusiastic about signing onto either of these wagons. <br>\n<br>\nI'd like to propose that the players on either of these wagons listen to my case, consider it, debate with me, and see if it's a wagon that five of you (+ moi) can come to a mutual understanding on. <br>\n<br>\nUT starts this game off with a particularly weak lalala vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953978#p6953978\">114</a>). GC notices it (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955390#p6955390\">122</a>). I didn't really consider it until GC brought it up, but UT made lalala's comment seem much more damning than it really was. Okay, so shortly thereafter, UT flips the script and sheeps onto the Bella wagon in (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956910#p6956910\">143</a>). He's the third vote on the wagon, and he just got through defending his lalala vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956505#p6956505\">135</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956520#p6956520\">139</a>). This jump is awkward in that I don't know what UT was trying to accomplish with his lalala vote. He never asked her a question or waited for any particular response that I can tell. That would be one thing to abandon it without those things, but then he abandons it because \"anytime Glork and TTH are voting someone, you've gotta join them\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957024#p6957024\">145</a>). I'm not satisfied with this. This is not independent UT. This sounds as though UT is not honestly scumhunting. It gets worse.<br>\n<br>\nA short while later, UT makes the comment that he wants to \"lynch the ducks!\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6959731#p6959731\">224</a>), less than a day after moving his vote to Bella. TTH calls him on it, and he says that he forgot he moved to Bella (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6959809#p6959809\">228</a>). There's something very unsettling about this. This gave me bad, bad vibes. You're not supposed to forget stuff like this as town. I don't. I know whom I am targeting and I don't forget about it. It's not even like Bella and lalala are all that similar either.<br>\n<br>\nUT makes this bumbling misrepresentation of GC, claiming that GC is trying to townread lalala for being nice (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6963201#p6963201\">261</a>). GC lets it slide, but I don't think it's honest. Now we have UT just grabbing at random comments to sound like he's scumhunting, but this is just dense. Anyone that took the time to read over the discussion would know GC's intention. It doesn't sit right with me. <br>\n<br>\nUT's defense of KayP strikes me as all levels of wrong when the man has had little to say about KayP (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6964302#p6964302\">319</a>). Frankly, his reads are an enigma to begin with, but this was a critical time to come to bat for KayP as Glork and GC were debating on whether to bring KayP on the table (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6964275#p6964275\">316</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6964282#p6964282\">317</a> ... *HINT HINT*, Tammy/Glork, this part is something I'd like y'all espeically to consider as I think we may all three have mutual agreement RE: KayP). UT slyly puts it out there that KayP ought not be pursued in favor or someone else (this person would eventually become BB, of course). UT ultimately agrees with a BB wagon with no qualms whatsoever (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6965854#p6965854\">337</a>). I guess he doesn't have a secret townread on BB like he does on KayP. <br>\n<br>\nOkay, so that's me shooting both barrels. There would be more, but UT is good at keeping his card close to his vest as scum. I just finished observing him as scum in another mini game where he played very similarly (Papers, Please Mafia for those meta fans). <br>\n<br>\nIf a UT wagon cannot happen, then, well, let me just give y'all a scumscale:<br>\n<br>\n[<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town</div>]------GC-----Glork-BobLob--Fro99er-[<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&#8729;</div>]-Tammy---SK--Bulge-KayP-lalala---UT----[<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum</div>]<br>\n<br>\nlalala would probably be my next choice. If I absolutely can't get either of these wagons to catch fire, I will begrudgingly choose Bulge over either Glork or Tammy. It would be a sad lurker lynch, but my only experience with Bulge was when he was lurking scum on a team with me.", "time": "Wed Jun 24, 2015 7:16 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

I mean, I know that's probably not the answer you want to hear, but I'm going to be selfish and try and usurp a leadership role in a town that is in somewhat of a deadlock. That said, I know this role is not looked upon with much favor from the majority of y'all (with good reason, mind you), so it may be a fruitless endeavor. Nevertheless, if I see an opportunity to get my top scumread lynch as town in any situation, I am going to go for that. Period. Simple answer, but it's the truth.<br>\n<br>\nIf UT were to flip town, frankly, I'd then selfishly pursue lalala the next day. UT's alignment doesn't have much bearing on my Tammy/Glork reads, though I can see spots where UT has attempted to buddy Glork and spots where UT has attempted to distance from Tammy, these are also based wholly on confirmation bias and could very well be just normal interactions should UT flip town. <br>\n<br>\nI do want to address what you two have brought up RE: Tammy/Glork not being settled going into tomorrow should be lynch someone else and they both survive. These fierce X vs Y arguments have a way of puttering themselves out. I've been around the block enough times to know that you can get tired of yelling at the same person unless it's like some lylo situation. Additionally, I think we all ought to reiterate the idea (both mentally in our own heads as well as publicly out here in the thread) that 1) Tammy and Glork are probably not scum together and 2) at best there's only one scum between them, meaning there's more likely than not two other scum out there that are being ignored. <br>\n<br>\nNow, it's my opinion that at this point I would pick neither of them for scum, but even if you weren't to subscribe to that radical an idea, you would probably take comfort in knowing there are two other scum out there. I strongly believe UT to be one of them. Should he flip scum, we may be able to better find associate tells between either Tammy or Glork (or anyone else, for that matter).<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>GC 666 wrote:</cite>UT's play this game is pretty normal in terms of how UT plays, but RC's case is probably the best parsing of UT's playstyle into some sort of alignment case that I've seen.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMeta is meta.

This isn't a burden of proficiency thing, although there is something to be said about it but not this early in the game and especially with so many inactives.  This is an analysis thing.  <br>\n<br>\nNow I don't have a lot of experience with glork at all, but in the two games I do have direct experience with he looked at the game so much differently than this, and this isn't a meta thing either, but again an analysis thing.  In one game - team mafia 2012, glork was able to cut through all the tunneling of another strong town voice to correctly identify my partner as scum when everyone was calling him town for silly reasons, and in the second - mafia behind the maiden - when half the game was coming after me day one after spyrex didn't like my opening, he was able to identify by behavioral tells that I was in fact town.<br>\n<br>\nHe was able to identify these things against the rest of the town because he was analyzing the game and looking deeply at it.  He was surface skimming, he wasn't putting in the appearance of doing the work, he was doing the work, getting it right mattered to him.  That is not what is happening here.<br>\n<br>\nRemember the condescension I told you I saw in his behavior day one?  Yeah, still here.  Now he might not like or respect me as a person or as a player, but his immediate response to my entrance was that he wasn't going to read what I've said.  I think what I've out out is some pretty good stuff, and he can't in good town conscience just call me obvious scum without reading what I've said.  He's dong it to be dismissive because he knows if he does read what I've said, he'd have to reconsider that scum read.  But he's not town and he knows that with this town he can get away with it because of the reads on my predecessor and what he can get away with with this town.  <br>\n<br>\nLikewise was his statement that it wasn't omgus because he was already on my predecessor followed up by sweetheart, which was more condescension meant to bait me and discredit my point.  It absolutely is omgus even if he was already on me and he knows that.  And he would know my point.<br>\n<br>\nThe responses that he made to my case were likewise awful.  First he responded to my argument that he didn't feel like he was trying to figure out the game but looking like he was trying to figure out the game.  He knew exactly what I meant by that.  I didn't say he do anything, he's surface skimming.  Now I'd like you all to look at the type of response id expect from someone as experienced and talented at this game that glork is.  (I'm not comparing players here, nor do I expect him to do the same thing, but this goes to mindset so bear with me)<br>\n<br>\nIn the recent team mafia game when I got suspicious of ces for a similar reason, this was his response to me.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6793920#p6793920\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: White Flag Mafia [TM2015] (Game Over)</a><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cogito Ergo Sum wrote:</cite>Tammy, you're probably that there is some intensity missing from my play compared to what I used to have. That's part of why I stopped playing. Looking at this game, I know I'm taking all sorts of shortcuts - I'm not questioning my own reads enough; I'm intentionally not considering Regfanscum until he's survived one Night he shouldn't; I haven't looked at BBT's scum meta because everyone calls him town despite my gut niggles; I'm not thinking enough about Ank's claim of being bad at scum (even as I type this, I don't particularly want to do it); I got carried away with the Aeronautread because everything seemed to line up so nicely.<br>\n<br>\nI used to think my play deteriorated because I had such a long town streak at the end of it but I realize now that the essential problem was probably that I started to rate my own reads highly enough that I didn't feel motivated to scrutinize them. Rekindling the spark is not going to be as easy as just playing another White Flag set-up but at least I'm definitely enjoying the company.<br>\n<br>\nI still think I'm right about Cheery Dog though.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI see no similar type of trying to understand me or my suspicion from glork.  Now some of this is mitigated by the fact that ces was town reading me at the time, ces and I have more experience playing together here and offsite, and therefore has a better understanding of me, but I still do think there's something to his reaction.  <br>\n<br>\nI, again, wouldn't exoect the same reaction from glork, but what I would expect from a town player actually trying to. Figure out the game is stepping back and seeing if maybe I had a point or inquire to try to figur me out.  Instead, he lists all the stuff he has done - that surface level stuff that still doesn't indicate he's trying to figure out the game but just looking like he is.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to point you to his reaction to my suspicion on him.  I'd have probably seen his point if he said I was scum who was trying to look town by attacking a strong innocent player because it would make me look town for it, but instead he pulls the \"I'm the easiest person to fling mud on\" which is incredibly inaccurate.  Pretty much anyone else would be easier to fling mud at than him.<br>\n<br>\nNow I get having a bad game, being rusty, or just being wrong, but I don't think his game has degraded to the point of that he's not evaluating the gam, and if he is just having a bad game and feels off then I exoect someone like him to acknowledge that because at the foundation of it all he'd still want to win the game.<br>\n<br>\nI get that most of you are town reading him for some reason, and I'll probably still be the lynch today or tomorrow, and that's fine, but when I'm gone please don't forget what I've said.  I'm rarely ever this certain about a scum read, and I don't think I've ever come this close to a 1v1 before, which should tell you something.<br>\n<br>\nHe's not looking at the game the way he should be if he's town.", "time": "Thu Jun 25, 2015 5:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

I&#8217;m not sure what to think about you. On one hand, some of your posts are rather good, but you also immediately jump to scum-team conclusion on D1. This suggests that you are anxious to end the day on a vote, as the town should only start systematically scanning for scum-tells, not pairing town players together on D1. IGMEOY.</div></blockquote><br>\nI disagree with Shadoxx's stance on Glork, but it's pretty nit-picky on my end. I think Glork actually makes a great case on KayP in 95, and 101. Post 130 was meant to get Bella to actually do something with her vote (and it worked!), and the rest of his posts were just kinda statements, but he sets up his later push on BiBob in 293. Yes, Glork throws out a scum-team pair, but it didn't appear \"anxious\" IMO. It was more tongue-in-cheek from Glork.<br>\n<br>\nSince 294, I actually disagree with Glork on the Shadoxx/Bella thing (like BiBob does), but I'm not using that as a reason to say Glork is scummy. In fact, Glork is interested in Shadoxx's mindest on how he formed the Bella opinion (see 331), which is the right approach. Glork's 334 is a very good retort to BiBob, especially the 3 points at the bottom of that post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR --</div> This is scumhunting Glork, with a good push on KayP, Bella, and especially on BiBob.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n----------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nD2 is where I started to have issue with Glork, and it made me review some things he said D1. Starting with what I disliked D2:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Glork D2</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">- Post 423 he starts the day off voting Kitty Galore. Voting kitty in and of itself is fine, but when you consider D1 (post 325) he \"Guarantee[d] two scum among {Bella, Shadoxx, KayP}\", it seems weird to pursue another avenue? It's understandable, I guess, but it's like he's found two scum and keeps trying to find a third scum, instead of pushing his trio of suspects where he guarantees two scum. GC pursued this avenue.<br>\n<br>\n- Then 431 he chastises Bella for her responding to my vote on her with her vote on Shadoxx. This is again fine in and of itself, but I'm noticing bigger picture that he's indirectly supporting my stance on Bella. This will become a theme (Glork's cozying up to me).<br>\n<br>\n- 467, the deal about the TTH night kill caught my attention. \"PR hunting\" is a pretty meh reason. Why specifically TTH if PR hunting? Also, in this same post, with Kitty about to replace out, instead of keeping pressure on that slot (which is now SleepyKrew who hasn't done anything), he switches his vote to.....the Bella wagon I started on D2!</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">(in regards to the NK speculation inside the spoiler above, I think UT made a good point in 469.....<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">OR</div>.....in response to RC's wallpost, maybe scum!UT is trying to frame Glork...dun dun dun WIFOM)</div><br>\n<br>\nThis takes me up to post my 541 where I said I was suspicious of Glork because of his D2 play and in retrospect some D1 stuff. D1 retrospect stuff next.<br>\n<br>\n----------------------------<br>\n<br>\nThe main thing that concerns me looking back on Glork's D1 play is how he's cozying up to me. EVERY SINGLE TIME he mentions me, it's to either defend me or call me town. I didn't think it at the time, but it makes sense that scum!Glork would try to cozy up to me so I don't suspect him. <br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Glork on Frog D1</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">- 95 is the defense of my f2f play, which is true, but him defending me from KayP noted<br>\n- 101 continues that defense<br>\n- 295 is just throwing me in the town pile, with no explanation<br>\n- 325 is more frog in the town pile, but then he says \"read the game for my explanation\" when I've never actually seen an explanation (other than my f2f play, I guess?)<br>\n- 336 he confirms that f2f is the sole reason I am town</div></div></div><br>\nThat's the extent of him mentioning me on D1. It gives me nervous feels when the only time someone mentions me is to cozy up to me.<br>\n<br>\n-------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nGlork's play D2 since post 541 has been mixed<br>\n- Glork's 572 and especially 577 are really good, actually<br>\n- 638 is an interesting observation about BobLob, but I think nullish in terms of alignment (both of BobLob and of Glork)...if he didn't mean it as nullish and instead is trying to throw suspicion on BobLob, I'm just at a loss for words, because Bob has been one of his townreads.<br>\n<br>\n-------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nAnyway...my case on Glork isn't as strong as my case on Bella/Tammy.<br>\n<br>\nI'm getting the weird feeling Tammy is actually doing even more of what Glork appears to be doing to me (cozying up to me). Tammy even points out in 520 that Glork is cozying (while she's been cozying up to me herself)! She would have even MORE reason to cozy up to me and frame someone else on her wagon (Glork is the obvious choice as GC is pretty obvtown) since she knows I made a solid case on Bella (which Tammy herself calls cogent in 551).<br>\n<br>\nHere's how Tammy has cozied up to me...<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Tammy on Frog</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">- 483 she has me townread in her catchup all the way from early game<br>\n- 499, \"I'm still town, but wrong\" about her slot.<br>\n- 506 I'm the only person on her wagon with a semblance of a strong town read she has<br>\n- 514 she commends me as a strong newbie<br>\n- 520 she says KayP's angle on me sucked, and attacks Glork for the Glork endearing me deal I mentioned above<br>\n- 525, 538 continues to defend me<br>\n- Not related to me, but in 549 she starts defending Glork from KayP....WEIRD!<br>\n- 551 is saying I've made the only cogent case on her slot<br>\n- 580 I'm still town<br>\n- same with 586 and 592</div></div></div><br>\nAs I said, Tammy has <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">more</div> motivation to cozy up to me. I had put a solid case on her slot so now she needs me to be the most town player of all time so I can start to see her side of things. So, my case on Tammy amounts to:<br>\n- My case on Bella which I don't need to rehash at this point<br>\n- Tammy's weird analysis of Bella's meta<br>\n- repeatedly defending her predecessor to clean up a mess prior to doing any scumhunting herself<br>\n- she puts a case on Glork, but actually defends him in 549 for a bit<br>\n- she calls herself town 80 billion times (I mean...how many times do you need to repeat you are town? A quick ctrl+f of her ISO with \"I'm town\" turns up 3 instances, and there are several others without the \"I'm\" in front of it)<br>\n- lots of cozying up to me (since I made a good case on Bella) as motivation to throw suspicion on someone else on the Bella/Tammy wagon (Glork being the easier target, since GC is pretty universally townread)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tammy</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPedit: I see tammy posted a big wall with some meta stuff.

She would have even MORE reason to cozy up to me and frame someone else on her wagon (Glork is the obvious choice as GC is pretty obvtown) since she knows I made a solid case on Bella (which Tammy herself calls cogent in 551).<br>\n<br>\nHere's how Tammy has cozied up to me...<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Tammy on Frog</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">- 483 she has me townread in her catchup all the way from early game<br>\n- 499, \"I'm still town, but wrong\" about her slot.<br>\n- 506 I'm the only person on her wagon with a semblance of a strong town read she has<br>\n- 514 she commends me as a strong newbie<br>\n- 520 she says KayP's angle on me sucked, and attacks Glork for the Glork endearing me deal I mentioned above<br>\n- 525, 538 continues to defend me<br>\n- Not related to me, but in 549 she starts defending Glork from KayP....WEIRD!<br>\n- 551 is saying I've made the only cogent case on her slot<br>\n- 580 I'm still town<br>\n- same with 586 and 592</div></div></div><br>\nAs I said, Tammy has <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">more</div> motivation to cozy up to me.

So, my case on Tammy amounts to:<br>\n- My case on Bella which I don't need to rehash at this point<br>\n- Tammy's weird analysis of Bella's meta<br>\n- repeatedly defending her predecessor to clean up a mess prior to doing any scumhunting herself<br>\n- she puts a case on Glork, but actually defends him in 549 for a bit<br>\n- she calls herself town 80 billion times (I mean...how many times do you need to repeat you are town? A quick ctrl+f of her ISO with \"I'm town\" turns up 3 instances, and there are several others without the \"I'm\" in front of it)<br>\n- lots of cozying up to me (since I made a good case on Bella) as motivation to throw suspicion on someone else on the Bella/Tammy wagon (Glork being the easier target, since GC is pretty universally townread)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tammy</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPedit: I see tammy posted a big wall with some meta stuff. Tammy, I'll obviously look at Glork if you flip town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOkay, a couple more things now that I'm at a computer.  I have a bunch of stuff to do today, so this will be intermittent but I will get to giving my thoughts on the others today.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not cozying up to you.  I'm town reading you.  There's a difference.  I do get the paranoia aspect, but you're really not thinking through the plausible reality of the situation.<br>\n<br>\nYou're claiming that I'm cozying up to you whiie pointing out that Glork is cozying up to you.  I have no reason whatsoever to cozy up to you.  You're a new player, and while you have a voice, you're not the strongest voice here, nor would I expect you to be.  New people get paranoid that someone is \"buddying\" or \"cozying\" up to them, so that's a double you wouldn't be the person I would buddy if I really were the type to buddy as scum.<br>\n<br>\nIn order for you to believe some of the things you are believing you have to believe I'm pretty damn audacious as scum to buddy you while pointing out that someone else is buddying you.  I have exactly one audacious scum game.  Capcom.  And that was only because I was in a hydra with mollie and on a scum team with nacho/wisdom, broseidon, eusurio/iPie, and shos.  Like we were a stacked scum team and knew we could do whatever we wanted and be bold as shit and we did.  But that's an isolated incident.<br>\n<br>\nYou would also have to rectify the fact that a scum!Tammy came into a game with a town!frogger playing with his brother town!Glork and think that I would have some way to get you on my side over Glork.  I can't imagine how in the seven hells I would think a scum me could break up that pair.  Town me knows your going to vote me over your brother, there was a super slim chance that you'd actually recognize scum in your brother Glork instead of me, and yet I went after it anyway.  I'm not stupid as scum, this is something I'd have known would never work in a million years as scum, and yet you think I did it anyway.  (I'm not saying you'd just hand your brother the game or not play to your win con but it's pretty much human nature that you'd prefer to think your family or people you really like are not the ones lying to you.  It's one of the things I was referring to in my opening post about my blind spot lately in games because I keep playing with friends.)<br>\n<br>\nThis is not a mindset I could plausibly have.  <br>\n<br>\nI said you made a cogent case on bella, not that it was right.  One of the things that cases do is help to give the mindset of the case maker.  Yours was well thought out, it enforced the town read that I had been building on you.  It was wrong, and is filled with things that are not scum tells, in many instances are personality tells, and if the experienced people in this game were actually reading this game a bit deeper, I wouldn't be the only one telling you some of these things, and Glork definitely would be if he were town.  He's not.<br>\n<br>\nI replaced in Monday night, read the game Monday night when I should have gone to bed.  I spent all of Tuesday playing this game and I think it's really short-sighted unfair of you to actually state that I repeatedly defended my slot before scum hunting when Monday night I gave my top reads before I did anything else.  Yes, I addressed yours and others incorrect points on Bella because they were wrong, I'd address any points made on a case on me that were incorrect, but I then immediately had my case on Glork and worked on iso's of everyone else while interacting with Kayp.  This was all in the span of 24 hours, and you're acting like I spent days defending my predecessor before scum hunting when in fact it was very fluid.<br>\n<br>\nI don't expect this to change your mind or to get you to vote Glork because your mind's made up.  But, when I flip town, I want you to keep these things in mind, and I want you to remember every single point I've addressed because it will help you analyze future games and recognize the things that you are thinking are scummy are not in future games as well in this future one.<br>\n<br>\nI guess all of this is moot if I'm wrong about you.  But as far as I know you don't have a scum game, and I'm banking on this not being what your first scum game looks like.<br>\n<br>\npedit:  Holy crap.

The fact that I dropped the KayP line later in Day 1, asked Shadoxx questions to try to understand his perspective / line of thought (and later asked separate questions to try to figure him out further, even though he hadn't posted even ONCE since my initial inquiry), and even stepped back and asked Bella why she kept following others' leads (instead of just demanding heads or whatever) shows that clearly I am trying to figure shit out.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt looks like Tammy took a long look at the pressure on her, picked out the player with the most potential material to drag through the mud, and went all in.

I don't have time to read that whole game or do anything more than skim your iso, but you actually do look like you're scum hunting more than surface (hindsight bias aside) and the reactions that you have to people's suspicion on you and their cases is way more natural and less condescending discrediting than you've done here.  You seem like there you're trying to understand people's suspicion of you and correct some of their expectations they might have of you.  There's none of that here.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, in your rush to discredit my case on you as OMGUS, you're basically saying that I'm not allowed to scum hunt my wagon.  Do you believe that every person that was on my wagon on Tuesday is town?  Every time someone looks for the scum on their wagon do you discredit that as OMGUS?  Because in order to think a case I would make on someone on my wagon boils down to OMGUS then you have to think I'm scum plus two of ETL (who you've called town?), lalala (who you've called town?), bulge (who you've not really mentioned), kittykrew (who sure you tried to get stuff out of) and RedCoyote (who you're calling town now) is scum.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, here's part of my problem.  You don't have to be a try hard like you used to, but you still should be able to see when reads are made for bad reasoning.  For instance, part of frogger's case on Bella is that she asked for a claim.  You said nothing about that.  He literally states that her asking for a claim an hour before deadline only fits a scum mentality.  You fucking know that's not true.  I would expect if you see a case with faulty reasoning, that you point that out, but you're not.  But you also should never have voted Bella for the reason you did in the first place.

I want to call him town for his comments to the Bulge when he posted his v/la until after deadline.  I want to call him town for correctly identifying and posing to the group why I would go after Glork upon replacing in.  I mean Glork can say he's mislynch bait now or not as good as he used to be, but I wouldn't know that.  *My* experience with Glork is 2012 Glork and no way would a scum me want to get that Glork on my bad side.  Even if I knew or thought his play had deteriorated, he's still the strongest in this player list.  I still need to read through his entry post and his case on UT, and just for good measure I want to quickly refer to our past two games together and see if there's anything there that can help me as the last time we were both town, I wrote the super duperist biggest wrong case on him and it took Nacho to pull me out of that tunnel.", "time": "Thu Jun 25, 2015 4:13 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

{"number": 808, "id": "6986001", "user": "Glork", "user_id": "1333", "content": "So unfortunately something has come up, and I will also need to request replacement. That said, I did want to leave you guys with a few thoughts, rather than just disappearing without saying anything. Also, this has been keeping me up all night and I just need to get some stuff off my chest before I go so I can get a proper four hours of sleep.<br>\n<br>\nIt's funny Tammy should bring up Oldy Mafia 2, because I was actually going to bring that up myself.<br>\n<br>\nThis is mostly to address GC, who seemed to rapidly change his stance on me from D1 to D2. It may also serve to address Tammy's point against me that she's not seeing the same behaviors from me between that game and this one.<br>\n<br>\nIn Oldy 2, I defended LmL on D1, because I felt there was a bad push against him, and he wound up being lynched as scum anyway. I was then lynched D2 by an all town wagon, and a large bulk of that wagon happened because of my defense of LmL on D1. Essentially, I was lynched by eleven protown players for being wrong about one scumbag on the first day of a large game.<br>\n<br>\nThese types of expectations are ludicrous. They are one of the things that made the game largely unfun for me, and it's one of the reasons I hardly play mafia anymore. So to see someone like Tammy come into a game and say that I'm not living up to her expectations of me (when we have played all of, what, one game together, and we were both parts of hydrae to boot?) is something that immediately took me back to that game, where I spent most of my time trying to defend myself in a futile struggle against the inevitable. That's pretty much what I feel here, too. GC changed his tune based on the hindsight of me being wrong about BiBob, and not fitting with his expectation of how I would start D2. GC, if you are town and wind up mislynching me for that here, then shame on you. You will have shown that you have learned nothing from your obscenely high expectations of me a year ago, and that would be very unfortunate.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, to address Tammy's meta point: I feel like I already touched on something similar, but please do me a favor and take a long look at the player list from that game. Compare it to the initial player list of this game. Oldy 2 was basically a reunion game featuring many of the most prominent veteran players who were still around in 2014. I have played countless games with those players and had extensive meta to form a baseline from which I could engage with them. I had virtually NONE of that here. So yeah, there is going to be a noticeable difference in style of play because as a player with a decade of forum mafia experience, I know that I have to approach a mini game full of newer players that I'm not familiar with differently than I would a large game full of experienced and generally competent people. I was trying to point this out earlier when I was addressing why I hadn't just plunged deep into the psyches of everyone here -- because I was completely unfamiliar with nearly everyone who had signed up for this game, and I didn't have that baseline meta that I could rely on in Oldy 2.<br>\n<br>\nThe other game I wanted to highlight for meta purposes is my last scum game, which was actually over two years ago but I think it does a pretty good job of illustrating the difference between town-Glork and scum-Glork. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=26051\" class=\"postlink\">Pokemon UPick</a>, if you look at my/MBF's post game comments, you can see that I calculated DAYS in advance how I was going to work towards and ultimately win in endgame. And all of my notable scum performances (California Trilogy 2 comes to mind) are like that. In order to make that a success, I need to be in absolute control of myself at all times. Things like getting caught up in the BiBob mislynch, or tunneling Tammy essentially 1v1 upon her replacement into the game, or even my staunch and adamant set-defense against most anyone who has even expressed doubts about me aren't really indicators of GlorkScum because those types of things distract me from my long term goal. The degree of self-defense has a distinct parallel to Oldy 2, where I also found myself on the back foot D2, and spent most of that day trying to talk my way out of a mislynch. Town Glork is often a very ego-centric Glork, whereas scum Glork is very externally focused on executing a plan, and that's no different here.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway I wanted to post this more for the sake of my eventual replacement than anything else, because when I step back and look at the forest instead of the trees, I feel kind of bad for putting someone into this situation where I've stumbled my way into a potential D2 mislynch after having a sub-par D1.<br>\n<br>\nI also just wanted to post my thoughts on my current approach to playing (I don't give a flying fuck about being one of the best town players anymore, and just wish to have fun playing games with cool people), and how managing others' expectations of my gameplay has been difficult for me, because while it has nothing to do with why I need to replace out (that comes from RL/external issues), no matter what happens I will be happy to corroborate this in a post-game or out-of-game setting. Several years ago I was easily one of the best mafia catchers around. I had to put an exorbitant amount of effort into doing that, and while I believe I still could if I had the time to catch up on site meta, build relationships with the current player base, and re-hone my craft, I think I still could. But at least right now, I don't care to put that kind of effort into mafia games. I just want to have fun playing them.<br>\n<br>\nBest of luck and sorry for adding another replacement to the pile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod: Please replace me</div>", "time": "Thu Jun 25, 2015 7:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

You needed to cozy up to me to win me over to support your Glork case because you know we are brothers and you had to overcome that barrier. You went after Glork because he was the tougher player to get rid of, so it would be good for scum!Tammy to get rid of the tough players and leave the \"weaker\" players (read: me). You backed off on Glork when he replaced out because you didn't know who would replace in, not because you suddenly townread him on one replace out post after practically death tunneling that slot.<br>\n<br>\nMetal...why are you townreading Bella/Tammy slot? Read Bella's ISO...she kept voting then not following up on her reads, and all she wanted to do was fit in. Also, are you townreading ETL? If so what do you think of RC's case on UT (now ETL) in 654?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is so completely backwards and is rather insulting.  You can do backbends all you want to find reasons to scum read me but it doesn't make one word of what you're saying true.  This just tells me that you're not actually reading anything I've written, and you're not actually interested in finding out my true alignment.  I've literally poured my heart into this game since I've replaced in, and I did it knowing I was the lynch of the day.  Yes, I hoped I'd be able to get you to see I was town because you seemed to be really trying to earnestly figure out the game, but I was more concerned about making sure that my scum read got lynched after me.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you are town here and you actually believe this, when this game is done or after I flip, I want you to go back and read my case and read my thoughts about my expectations, because that's what a genuine case looks like.  That's what genuinely trying to determine the mindset of someone and figure out this game looks like.<br>\n<br>\nYes, I can decide that upon one post my entire read was likely wrong.  I asked people to talk to me about my read, and nobody did.  I'd hoped that if Glork was town, he'd respond to the post I made where I talked about my expectations.  I hoped if he was town, he'd recognize that came from town and we'd find common ground somewhere, but he didn't.  So you can suck it with your death tunneling; I am always up for recognizing when I'm wrong.<br>\n<br>\nI'm just going to laugh that you actually think that I'd go from \"death-tunneling\" Glork to deciding he's innocent because I didn't know who would replace in.  I'd like for you or anyone to tell me who I'd be afraid to \"death-tunnel\" as scum more than I'd be afraid to Glork.  If I'm going to be ballsy enough as scum to tunnel on Glork, the sky is the fucking limit for me.  (I get he thinks he's mislynch bait.

You needed to cozy up to me to win me over to support your Glork case because you know we are brothers and you had to overcome that barrier.

You can do backbends all you want to find reasons to scum read me but it doesn't make one word of what you're saying true.  This just tells me that you're not actually reading anything I've written, and you're not actually interested in finding out my true alignment.  I've literally poured my heart into this game since I've replaced in, and I did it knowing I was the lynch of the day.  Yes, I hoped I'd be able to get you to see I was town because you seemed to be really trying to earnestly figure out the game, but I was more concerned about making sure that my scum read got lynched after me.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you are town here and you actually believe this, when this game is done or after I flip, I want you to go back and read my case and read my thoughts about my expectations, because that's what a genuine case looks like.  That's what genuinely trying to determine the mindset of someone and figure out this game looks like.<br>\n<br>\nYes, I can decide that upon one post my entire read was likely wrong.  I asked people to talk to me about my read, and nobody did.  I'd hoped that if Glork was town, he'd respond to the post I made where I talked about my expectations.  I hoped if he was town, he'd recognize that came from town and we'd find common ground somewhere, but he didn't.  So you can suck it with your death tunneling; I am always up for recognizing when I'm wrong.<br>\n<br>\nI'm just going to laugh that you actually think that I'd go from \"death-tunneling\" Glork to deciding he's innocent because I didn't know who would replace in.  I'd like for you or anyone to tell me who I'd be afraid to \"death-tunnel\" as scum more than I'd be afraid to Glork.  If I'm going to be ballsy enough as scum to tunnel on Glork, the sky is the fucking limit for me.  (I get he thinks he's mislynch bait.  I get he thinks he's not a strong player anymore, but I haven't played with him since 2012, except in that hydra when he was third party and I don't count that, so my view of him wasn't that.)</div></blockquote><br>\nTammy, I don't see why you think it's insulting.

I would normally give GC shit for wanting a nl here, but I'm pretty understanding of it in this case. If the numbers worked out better (even players), I'd be more for it.<br>\n<br>\nI understand the SK lynch in that he hasn't contributed much and has suspicion now, so he won't be a nk, but we get dick for information from it. It's gut, but looking through his posts, I don't get a feel of scum avoiding info, it reads as town confusion.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I don't really have another suspect to push forward.

But nobody else seemed to have a problem with the wagon, so I was sort of putting it out there for someone more veteran than me to comment on... and seemingly, it was nothing, and this kind of things happens often, just not in the games I read.

The \"defending\" NM did was simply point out the most likely role setup scenario.  NM-scum could have fought against it, but it's really a calculated risk.  If enough people (like myself) bought into SK being town based on likely role setup, then it makes NM look really bad.  In contrast, if enough people took it at face value - whether they thought it to be the correct role setup, and especially if they did not (such as ETL) - then NM looks really darn good!  He's not fighting tooth and nail for folks to go after the competing bandwagon!  Must be town!<br>\n<br>\nBut, all it is is NM just agreeing with what I believe is the actual role setup.  That isn't a big defense of another player.  It's simply acknowledging the situation that we are most likely working with, and so it isn't some Big Thing that NM did.", "time": "Mon Jun 29, 2015 1:23 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=1475", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

If they die, that type of ability may no longer be used.<br>\n<br>\nThis effect applies to all players with the enabled ability.

However, for as long as I live, scum have daytalk.<br>\n<br>\nI'll further note:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Enabler Wiki Article wrote:</cite>Some more creative uses have included Town Enablers for Mafia power roles and Mafia Enablers for Town power roles. Both of these (the latter to a greater extent) reduce the positive feedback Mafia naturally generates for a faction that starts to win by taking away their power roles. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou can read my ISO and see that I was trying to attract the NK.

{"number": 1582, "id": "7004684", "user": "KayP", "user_id": "26002", "content": "Hmm. Let me break this down in my head now that we have all of the things out on the table.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DEAD</div><br>\nBicephalous Bob, Town Odd-Night Role Cop<br>\nTellTaleHeart, Town Backup Innocent Child<br>\nRedCoyote, Vanilla Townie<br>\nEspeciallyTheLies, Vanilla Townie<br>\nNot_Mafia, Vanilla Townie<br>\nBBmolla, Vanilla Townie<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">LIVING</div><br>\nChaosOmega: Town Even-Night Rolecop<br>\nFrogger: ???????<br>\nMetal Sonic: ??????<br>\nGreen Crayons: Town Encryptor Enabler<br>\nKayP: Vanilla Townie<br>\nSleepyKrew: Town Backup Innocent Child<br>\nlalaladucks: Vanilla Townie<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo... basically, if I'm understanding this correctly, Green Crayons is saying that he has a role that lets the mafia have an Encryptor, and an Encryptor lets them talk during the day. I guess that's alright, though I don't really see how that's a good thing for the mafia? I guess it's better than not talking during the day at all, but it just doesn't seem that powerful to me.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I looked at <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Role_Cop\" class=\"postlink\">the wiki for rolecop</a>, and something interesting caught my eye:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>A Role Cop that returns only their target's full role name and not alignment is considered Normal on mafiascum.net. A <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mafia Goon or a Serial Killer with no other abilities should give the same result as a Vanilla Townie</div>. In the case of an X-Shot role, the Role Cop should be told how many shots the role started with. not how many shots used/remaining. Trying to investigate an Ascetic role should return \"No Result\", the same as if the Role Cop had been blocked.</div></blockquote><br>\nHere, it states that role cops do not return full results on people. So, if Green Crayons really did believe ChaosOmega's claim, it says nothing about lalaladucks being town, it just means that she's a vanilla mafia or vanilla town or vanilla Serial Killer (&lt;--- obviously not likely). Green Crayons has been around here <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">thirteen years</div> and didn't know that? I think it's more likely that he was chomping at the bit to clear a buddy of his and pin it back on me since he's already seen some people tossing my name around recently.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not even sure that I believe ChaosOmega's claim. I was reading back through his ISO posts and I found this gem:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6988838#p6988838\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6988838#p6988838\" data-post-id=\"6988838\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1077</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7127\">ChaosOmega</a> wrote:</cite>So I was reading through this before, and then I got confused, and then I started drinking, and now I'm just fucking staring at the screen.<br>\n<br>\nI looked at Sks iso, it's shitty, but I don't think it's scum-shitty. I would normally give GC shit for wanting a nl here, but I'm pretty understanding of it in this case. If the numbers worked out better (even players), I'd be more for it.<br>\n<br>\nI understand the SK lynch in that he hasn't contributed much and has suspicion now, so he won't be a nk, but we get dick for information from it. It's gut, but looking through his posts, I don't get a feel of scum avoiding info, it reads as town confusion.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I don't really have another suspect to push forward. N_M isn't blowing up my skirt (you wanna talk shitty iso's ETL, look at The Bulge's). N_M, your role is citizen and not vanilla townie? is having 2 flavors of vanilla allowed in normals? But N_M's posting is decent I think. 1073 is weird. You read up to 17, say the SK slot is devoid of content, but he hasn't posted yet. I guess you're basing it off Kitty Galore, who wasn't a prolific poster at all, but it reads like you're just a hobo jumping on the SK train.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Not_mafia</span><br>\n<br>\nI think I'd rather lynch here. I won't mourn Sk's lynch if it comes to that, and I'll switch to it to prevent a nl, but I think N_M has a better chance of flipping scum. This is mainly gut, and I imagine some people won't be a fan, but it's whatev.</div></blockquote><br>\nCO doesn't have a suspect to put forward here, and he says NotMafia's posting is decent, and then just votes him at the end of the post. There's a whole lot of cognitive dissonance going on within a single post here... CO contradicts himself a couple of times, and he also only considers SK or NM for lynches and doesn't even bother mentioning anyone else. He couldn't even make his vote look justified -- he just saw two wagons in NM and SK and lazily threw his vote on the pile. This rubbed me the wrong way.<br>\n<br>\nI'm disinclined to believe the claim. Pending no Innocent Child claims at this stage from Frogger or Metal Sonic, I'm also inclined to believe SleepyKrew's claim and want him taken off the table completely. I've never designed or run games before so I don't know what balance looks like, but I know for me, ChaosOmega's opportunistic jump onto NotMafia and the gross words behind it make me want to lynch him, and the symmetry of that claim against the dead Odd-Night Rolecop makes it too easy of a falseclaim for him to come up with... or maybe it's even his actual role, but a mafia version of it. I could see that, actually -- but right now, I think my preference lies with ChaosOmega. I'm not sure what CO being scum would mean for potential partners.<br>\n<br>\nPOST REVIEW EDIT -- Holy butts, that's a lot of posts.", "time": "Thu Jul 02, 2015 2:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=1575", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}

I was ready to push the hell out of glork up to the past couple pages in which a few posts gave me pause on that scum read.  I've had frogged as a town read since early game and that hasn't gone away, but his read and reasoning on Bella is faulty.  Actually all of yours are and I'm rather disappointed by how shallowly some of you are looking at things.  Anyway, I'll talk more about that tomorrow when I'm not in bed on my iPad, and while I'm not Bella, I think there are things obvious in her personality/experience level that you guys are just dinging her for that are not leading you down a correct path here.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, for any scum that are trying to push my slot, you should put on your best dancing shoes.  I'm definitely town, and I'm not as easy to push over as a newbie who's clearly trying to figure out the game.

It undermined our strategy and put us at a competitive disadvantage that, by the mod's own rule set, should never have been possible.<br>\n<br>\nI said in my replacement post that my replacing out was due to an external situation beyond my control, but I probably should have made it more clear/prominent and for that I apologize. I was in fact losing sleep over the game, and could not continue enjoying playing it. I take no credit for this win and don't consider it a completed/won game by any means.

Everything about not tryharding and just wanting to play for fun is completely true (I even said that during pregame in the scum PT), and is exactly how I feel in all of my games regardless of alignment.

Relying on the early inactivity, we were basically using me to create a lot of smoke and mirrors and then get me lynched around Day 3, with Frogger and KayP being able to utilize associative tells to clear their own names after I flipped scum. I've never played a game where I strategically tried to get myself lynched and I was excited to see how it would play out. I was pleased with being just sloppy enough to garner attention while not quite getting lynched, but then everything got blown out of the water with the extension deadline and its impact on our ability/willingness to continue.", "time": "Sun Jul 05, 2015 2:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62192&start=1875", "forum": "53", "thread": "62192"}
