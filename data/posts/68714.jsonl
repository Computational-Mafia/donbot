So based on my experience, newbscum tends to be very interesting in their appearance. This can manifest itself in different ways, but what Xnadroj is doing fits none of them.<br>Here are a few examples of newbscum that I've seen:<br><br>Something_Smart in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=64206\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1663</a>:<br>I basically tried to control the game here as much as I could. I set down, based on weak reasons, who I would and wouldn't be willing to lynch, and I experienced a ton of snap read changes without having good progressions.<br><br>Dewy in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=64538\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1670</a>:<br>Dewy played up her newb status by asking a lot of questions and also, like me, laid down a lot of reads with long but superficial analysis. Look also at Garrett in this game, who made some awkward posts and then defended himself at the expense of all else.<br><br>AlpacaAlpaca in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=66416\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1792</a>:<br>Granted, I wasn't in this game. But I followed along and I once again see the trend of putting down a lot of reads and giving a lot of explanation but the explanation isn't very deep and they seem more interested in explaining what they think than in interpreting what people are saying.<br><br>What I've described is a standard newbscum situation: they know how to fake reads and how to back them up with evidence, but they're giving too much and not taking in enough. This is very different from what Dongempire described. When Xnadroj posts, he doesn't seem to have any goal in mind besides working out this huge puzzle. Experienced scum might play that way, but specifically among the two archetypes \"newbscum\" and \"newbtown\", he fits the \"newbtown\" one much better. <br><br>(I could attempt to describe newbtown, but it's a lot more nebulous and is closely connected with the concept of obvtown, a concept for which a definition would be self-contradictory. However I can still give some of the best examples I've experienced: Ilikebugs in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=65890\" class=\"postlink\">New York 194</a>, JaeReed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=66380\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1706</a>, and Maverick1102 in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=66739\" class=\"postlink\">Micro 615</a>.)"}

So based on my experience, newbscum tends to be very interesting in their appearance. This can manifest itself in different ways, but what Xnadroj is doing fits none of them.<br>Here are a few examples of newbscum that I've seen:<br><br>Something_Smart in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=64206\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1663</a>:<br>I basically tried to control the game here as much as I could.

Look also at Garrett in this game, who made some awkward posts and then defended himself at the expense of all else.<br><br>AlpacaAlpaca in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=66416\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1792</a>:<br>Granted, I wasn't in this game. But I followed along and I once again see the trend of putting down a lot of reads and giving a lot of explanation but the explanation isn't very deep and they seem more interested in explaining what they think than in interpreting what people are saying.<br><br>What I've described is a standard newbscum situation: they know how to fake reads and how to back them up with evidence, but they're giving too much and not taking in enough. This is very different from what Dongempire described. When Xnadroj posts, he doesn't seem to have any goal in mind besides working out this huge puzzle. Experienced scum might play that way, but specifically among the two archetypes \"newbscum\" and \"newbtown\", he fits the \"newbtown\" one much better. <br><br>(I could attempt to describe newbtown, but it's a lot more nebulous and is closely connected with the concept of obvtown, a concept for which a definition would be self-contradictory.

It's pretty obvious that Infinity is trying to actually sort me.  Reads come off as genuine even if I don't agree w/ several of them. And there's just a ton of actual scumhunting in his ISO.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">i townread him too. though i definetely cringe a bit whenever i see the \"actually trying to sort me out\". World doesnt revolve around you mate</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dunnstral</span> - Town.  Only thing I really don't like is his attacks on Zach.  Other than that, reads seem to match mine alot.  The whole \"scum have an encryptor\" thing reads very town to me.  In my experience, scum just doesn't like to post WIFOM-ish stuff like that. (K after reading Zachs ISO, I now don't really mind Dunns attack there)<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Okay, so if youve read zachs iso why keep the first part in? Okay who cares. Scum have an encryptor thing was mostly shitposting and nai if anything. and thats the point of the wifom dont you think smarty<br></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">iraonavp</span> - townlean.  Wish he'd post more content but I like what he has posted. I think his points against transcend are spot on.  His reads are pretty similiar to mine.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">your reads arent fucking godsend you know. and this is a shit explanation, i like the content hes posted, completely useless and doesnt give readers any info.</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MathBlade</span> - slight townlean.  I really hated maths early game as his reads just seemed so bad.  But there's just something about his posts that make me believe that he is truly trying to figure the game out.  He just needs to drop his Dunn scumread.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">your reads arent<br>who cares <br>who cares<br>moving on cause i agree with your read to an extent</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zachstralkita</span> - null, slight townlean.  I was totally townreading zach before I ISO dived him but there's really not much scumhunting and he hasn't been very clear about his reads.  The slight townread is basically playstyle.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">so... meta? okay</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">AlpacaAlpaca/Manuel</span> - Null.  Not really enough content for a good read but I think I'm starting to lean town.  Very much like the pressure on Gamma.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">he has posted more than enough and its actually helping town unlike a certain individual</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Transcend</span> - null, slight scumlean. I get the impression that Transcend wants to townread me but he truly believes that I will never townread him so he keeps me as a backburner scumread.  This way when I eventually (in his mind) go after him, he can just go ahead and call me scum instead of trying to convince someone that will already have his mind made up.  But other than than that I like most of his townreads and scumreads and he does seem to be trying to sort people (in between his troll posts @ least).<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">lmfao<br>nice conspiracy theory<br></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Creature</span> - scumlean. Not much to add.  I see the same reasons for scumreading creature that everyone else has.  His posts just have a guarded feel to em.  Like he never wants to say more than he has to.  Not my top lynch for today since there's scummier people. But I dont hate the wagon.  (Actually S_S's most recent posts IS making me kinda hate the wagon)<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">that oughta explain</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">XnadrojX</span> - scumlean. Like I said earlier, his posts occasionally come off as faking noobness.  I feel like his town read of me came out of nowhere.  He could be trying to just lurk his way through the game<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">okay sure</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gamma Emerald</span> - Scum.  Man for the quantity of posts in his iso, gamma doesn't say anything.  Seriously, do a quick skim and look @ how much fluff is there.  It's just nonsense w/ an occasional sheep vote w/o any reasoning.  I dont really understand the progression of the creature read going from lynchbait to scum.  Also I mentioned how I didn't like the misrep of zach which he wrote off as \"I was totally misrepping on purpose\".<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">yeah okay</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dongempire</span> - Scum. pointed out earlier how he said my reads weren't good.  Then he asked me for a reads list after I wanted him to point out the reads he didn't like.  He STILL has yet to answer what reads of my he thinks were bad.  His entire ISO is pretty content-less.  All of his reads are just so empty.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">im astounded<br>seriously astounded<br>in case you still cant understand, i was sarcastically saying all of your reads were dogshit. but of course. but of fucking course.<br>depends on your perspective really. the perspective of someone who still calls me out for asking his reads list nonchalauntly.<br>and ive given ecplanations on any and all of my reads. so if you think they are empty, i dont give a crap. ive done my part.</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Something_Smart</span> - Scum. Has barely posted ANY scumreads this game except for the ones @ the start of the game that he immediately said weren't real reads.  Like so many of his comments are just pointing stuff out and then not commiting to an actual position.  And his most recent opportunistic vote on creature just came out of nowhere.</div></blockquote><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">that is ignoring most of the better things he pointed out<br>its like saying an end model sports car is dogshit because it cant fly and do aerobics.</span></div></div></div>"}

I'm saying that scum!gamma wouldn't continuously do things that other people would likely perceive as scummy, if they have no specific benefit to him. \"Scumtells\", in my opinion, are relative and depend on the situation, but not everyone sees them that way. Therefore it's likely that someone would've called out gamma for votehopping, even though in this case it's unlikely that votehopping would help scum!gamma.<br><br>With the misrep reaction test, that's fair, but I don't think scum!gamma would've expected town!zach to answer wrong. Though you're right that there is a possibility scum!gamma used that to try to get an excuse to push zach more, I think it's more likely that town!gamma was just trying something random in the hopes it lead somewhere."}

I don't see the scum motivation for him just consistently spewing out terrible arguments when most people here have played with him before. Like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8415803#p8415803\">365</a> is the type of argument I see from town a lot, but if jar was self-conscious about it like scum usually are I don't think he'd think it looks good.<br>I looked at math in mini 1800 again, and I became less confident in my townread there. Though they seemed to be a little bit more tryhard here, their posting style which I remember being similar to how they play as town also seems to be similar to how they play as scum. I don't think scum would just come out and say they're conftown though, so that's what it is.<br>nadr is still hard to see as scum for me even though he hasn't posted much. I can feel the genuine towny awkwardness from him, and the random reaction vote on dunnstral just to give one example is something I rarely see from scum. Random weird shit is almost always town imo.<br><br>It's hard to imagine manuel getting shot last night unless scumteam is 2 of {nadr, s_s, gamma}, or if scumteam wanted to frame gamma I suppose. The possibility of someone being framed here complicates things but n1 kills are rarely WIFOM.<br><br>I think transcend should be our lynch. He had quite a strong entrance as scum in dunn's mini, so the reason I townread him earlier is weaker I guess. I think his play today could easily be scum given up. Though I ignored the idea that transcend was scumtrolling at the beginning of today because of who it was coming from, I actually think that's a reasonable possibility. But most of all, I can't accept that 2-3 of my townreads from d1 were wrong.<br><br>If I'm wrong, I promise I will vote jarjar, mathblade, and nadr until they're dead.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: transcend</span>"}

I'm an absorber variant, which I assume is the greylisted role for this game. I get to target a player each night, and if that player was targeted by an ability, I get a 1-shot version of it. I'm not going to claim yet whether or not I'm x-shot. So far I've been trying to target players likely to be night killed so I can get vig shots. I targeted s_s n1 and got nothing, and I got a 1-shot vig for targeting zach last night.<br><br>It's weird though that gamma didn't see anyone else targeting zach. Means scum must have a ninja. I suppose it's not unusual when there's a full watcher in the game though, plus my role which can potentially get more.<br><br>Speaking of which, I'm thinking, since watcher is such a powerful role, that me and gamma can coordinate to get me watcher shots for future nights, if I have more than 2 shots and if you guys believe my claim."}

It's \"lack of anything real\". I know what it's like to fake reads as scum; usually you can just say stuff that looks good and looks like something that you might conceivably use to read someone but upon further inspection it just falls apart.<br><br>There are also important things that you're ignoring in your argument that JarJar as scum wouldn't be playing and voting the way he is. Scum's goal is to gain mislynches. How they gain them, it doesn't matter-- it's not like they HAVE to push mislynches for them to happen. In fact, for precisely the reason you are describing, scum would often prefer to be off a wagon, unless they're needed for it to go through. Clearly JarJar wasn't needed for either the Creature lynch or the Transcend lynch; so why would he have to be on it if he were scum?<br><br>(Also, he himself invalidated this argument in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8458654#p8458654\">1648</a>. After he tried to claim towncred for it and was rebuked.)<br><br>And by the way, you said that if he were scum he'd have to start pushing mislynches eventually. Well guess who he's pushing today?<br><br>If you want to have a discussion with me (though from your V/LA it seems you might not be able to; when you get a chance I guess) about JarJar's play, rather than the fact that the other players decided to lynch town without his help being needed, I'll be happy to have it with you. But the fact is that you can't consistently form good reads based solely or even primarily on votes; that's been tried time and time again and burned time and time again."}

I seriously thought I was your top scumread. Role fishing me is stupid as I have been pretty obvious I am VT with my setup spec.

My main reason I scum read Manuel is because 4 town PRs unless all scum PRs are full PRs is unbalanced as fuck and a non full scum PR has flipped. I fucking wish I was a PR then I could CC Manuel. However since I am a VT it is only a scumread. If a 5th PR claim comes up we lynch in Manuel and that after no lynching today. I do not believe 4 is balanced. 5 pushes insanity levels."}

That is three of six players. Just because people don't scumread him doesn't mean he isn't scum. Hell I went some games without a single vote on me as scum. That didn't change my alignment. It just means it isn't a popular opinion and in MyLO you don't compromise. I absolutely agree that my read isn't popular which confounds me how that could be thought of as balanced which people are just going along with.<br><br>Case B) Manuel is town and I am wrong.

The easy lynch would be a town loss more than likely. In MyLO you ALWAYS no lynch with the exception of a cop guilty.<br><br>2) ignoring them is blatantly false. I asked everyone for their reads more so than claims because they'd all have to be straight VTs as Manuel is a claimed BP. Anything else would force a 1v1 and everyone townreads Manuel so scum wouldn't claim PR. I think you said mass claim to look as if you are hunting. I have asked for people's top reads because then I can analyze what happens overnight with them. I am preparing for a no lynch because we should not be lynching today. You can keep scum claiming by voting and whiteknighting Jar but I am quite happy not playing into your shenanigans.<br><br>3) Asked and answered. Manuel+Titus or Manuel+Dong. <br>I am discussing but Manuel claiming BP is a scum claim that until someone can provide me a setup that works with 4 Town PRs that are more powerful I see no reason to budge in MyLO.<br><br>3B) It is the events as well as the Why. It is simple. Manuel tried to save Infinity. Even after the guilty. Yet you call him innocent. The evidence is there you just refuse to consider him scum because you don't want to bus as you hate bussing. Or you are just stubborn and don't setup spec.

We're in b and c.<br><br>2) There's nothing stopping you from analyzing the reads now. SS's read transgression is terrible and JarJar highlighted it. You aren't doing anything with the information because you're holding town hostage while ignoring the context of the game. This is the third straight finished game where you have done this. I lynched you in the game with RB. In Wake's game you were called to derp to scum. Here, you persist and think your own view must be correct.<br><br>3) A)Strongman, Ninja, Roleblocker, pick 2 of 3.

Right now, we're mostly in the same place regarding the scumteam. Neither of us are voting Manuel. We both think it's SS and Dong.

They say what they want. \"Need\" is no lynch in MyLO always. No matter how smart you think you are reads can be wrong and so you always no lynch in MyLO. If obvious happens great.
