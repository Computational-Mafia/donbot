They'd had trouble with those scumbag mafiasos before, but recently it seemed that their job was getting that little bit harder. Evidence disappearing. Witnesses changing their story. Criminals walking free on school-boy technicalities. Well, something had to be done. And soon. When the enemy fights dirty, you gotta get down there in the mud with them. No more arrests. Just cold, rough, irreversible justice...</span><br><br>---<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 111%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MR C. VILLIAN, MURDERED N -29</span></span></span></span><br><br><br>Detective I. M. Acopp lit the cigarette with a Zippo lighter he pulled from his inside suit pocket. He put it on the table and inhaled slowly. The tip burned bright orange as he eyed the kid sitting opposite him. The Detective leaned in and blew the smoke out into his face. His eyes were cold. The kid coughed and instinctively went to waft the smoke out of his face. He couldn\u2019t; his hands were cuffed to the table, and all he accomplished was to hurt his wrist.<br>The Detective stood back up and walked over to the other side of the table, where he took off his suit jacket and hung it over the back of his chair. His partner, G. Nerikop, a hard hitting Polish police officer, nodded and dropped a folder on the table. He spoke, his voice as gritty as this description. <br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cSo, Mr...E. Herring. Where were you last night?\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cWhere was I? I was, uh, with, my buddy. Yeah.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cYour buddy, eh? Hear this Ian? With a buddy. Well. This buddy have a name?\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cCourse. His name\u2019s Andy. Andy Crumbalot.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cCrumbalot? The baker?\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cOh. He was with the baker, Ian. Guess we can let him go.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>The kid\u2019s face lit up \u2013 he was going to go free. Detective Acopp walked over to the table and extinguished his cigarette in an ashtray lying next to the folder. He flipped the cover open.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cFunny, Gene. Because county records show Mr. Crumbalot was in hospital last night. With a broken finger.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Herring\u2019s face drained of colour. \u201cWhat?!\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to us, Mr. Herring.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cNo! I swear it!\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cThe records don\u2019t lie, but people do.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake, I mean, I was with him, last night!\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Detective Acopp turned and looked at his reflection in the mirror that ran the width of the room. He jerked his head backwards, gesturing towards the pale kid trembling in the chair behind him.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cLock this piece of shit up.\u201d<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 111%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MR. EDWARD HERRING, WRONGFULLY DETAINED N -25</span></span></span></span><br><br>---<br><br>Just over three weeks later, Acopp stormed into the police station, heading straight to his partners desk. He flung a newspaper at him, opened to an inside page showing a full colour picture of young Edward Herring on the steps of the courthouse building.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cHey. You remember that kid we collared a few weeks ago for murder? He was in court yesterday. Would you believe it? His alibi checked out. That baker, the one we couldn\u2019t find, the one he said he was with \u2013 he never broke his finger. The county hospital have no records of a Mr. Crumbalot visiting them the night of the murder. We were duped.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cWhat? But the records-\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cThe records were falsified, gentlemen.\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>The voice was gravel; its owner had clearly spent years drinking whiskey out of empty cigarette boxes after smoking the whole lot in one sitting. It was so gritty that even his tongue must have had its own stubble.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cExcuse me, but who are you?\u201d<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>\u201cThey call me A. V. I\u2019m just a man with a maverick disregard for the rulebook and a tragic backstory that would be revealed in a flashback episode if this were a TV show. And I\u2019ve been following these scumbags for a long, long time. Forget everythin\u2019 you thought you knew. There\u2019s no longer time to go through the courts. Are you listenin\u2019? We\u2019re throwin\u2019 procedure out the window here. No more handcuffs. If we don\u2019t do somethin\u2019 soon, Little Italy is going to the wolves \u2013 and they ain\u2019t friendly critters either. You ever killed a man with rabies, boy? You ain\u2019t never looked death in the eye \u2018til it\u2019s drippin\u2019 from the teeth of an enraged rabies victim, I\u2019ll tell you that much. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Unless you listen to me and listen real good. Over the years I\u2019ve narrowed the scumbags down to somewhere amongst this list of people. But our badge ain\u2019t no good any more, you hear? We gotta let natural justice take its course. Announce to the people of Little Italy that we\u2019re looking for the killers, and then \u201caccidentally\u201d leak the document. I can guarantee you that the people on that list will take matters into their own hands to prove they\u2019re innocent \u2013 I mean, living here, what more do you expect? We\u2019ve done our part, gentleman. Now alls we can do is wait and watch as this town finds and kills the scumbags for us \u2013 or destroys itself trying.\u201d<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 111%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">POLICE DOCUMENT, LEAKED N0</span></span></span></span>"}

All game-related communication between players STAY in the thread <span style=\"font-style: italic\">unless specifically stated in the Role PMs</span>. This is a modkillable offense.<br>6. Falsifying the mod is a modkillable offense. I am the sole judge of whether I have been falsified or not.<br>7. Small or invisible text as a secret communication is disallowed. Cryptography is also disallowed.<br>8. Loopholes are bad and pretty dick-ish. Modkills ensue.<br>9. Modkills revert the player's role into a Neutral Survivor; they then die a painful death, therefore losing themselves the game and embarrassing their family.</ul><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">On Voting, Activity and Deadlines</span></span><br><br><ul>1. Please aim to post at least once a day. (The more the merrier!)<br>2. V/LAs are to be announced in thread and bolded.<br>3. Players who don't post in 48 hours will be prodded. Players have 24 hours to respond to a prod or they will be replaced. Players may request prods on a specific player via a bolded message in thread. <br>4. A 'three strikes and you're out' rule on prods and replacement is enforced. That is, three prods and you're force replaced.<br>5. This game has two week deadlines at the beginning of each game day. Keep in mind that your mod is a busy (and handsome) man so I may be a little flexible on this. There will be deadline countdowns to help enforce this.<br>6. Votes/Unvotes may be done either by bolding your Votes or using Vote tags. If you don't use tags, Colons (:) make my life a lot easier. Usernames may be shortened but it has to be easily discernible. Example: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Vas</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: AV</span><br>7. Unvotes are nice but not required.<br>8. Lynches need a majority to go through. (That's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">half the number of living players</span> +1).

If you are actually a townie then you shouldn't be waiting for us to tell you to do something. Also, if it isn't that big of a deal, then why did you say this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Science and Magic wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>Well, aside from Lady Lambdadelta, you haven't expressed suspicion of anybody.

You thought something was off, but still made <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3262558#p3262558\" class=\"postlink\">your bah post</a> and you made it before bothering to check and see if you were actually dead? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Also, why would you roleclaim if you had doubts about actually being lynched?

Thanks for the free info!)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Diamond wrote:</cite>However, since that wagon has not gone anywhere and the LLD wagon is, Unvote, Vote: LadyLambdaDelta.</div></blockquote> You can't get worse than this.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>For those of you claiming that I voted LLD without reason, I had expressed my suspicions with reasoning previously.</div></blockquote> 1: I'll need to double-check, but I don't remember people voting Diamond for voting LLD without reason. (See also: AGM being scum for thinking people think he's scum for lurking.) 2: More importantly, I looked. Other than <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Indeed.

It was only after my reread that I became suspicious of you (reasoning to come). <br>As for your complaints about my suspicion of Wicked, it's simply false claiming that the suspicion is convenient. Wicked's spot on my scumlist is the manifestation of previously expressed suspicions that came about before any thoughts of our alignment relations came to the forefront.<br> I find your argument that your claim \"will be self-evident over time\" to be suspect. If anything my claim will become self evident overtime (since I'll get killed overnight) while the legitimacy of your claim will remain indiscernible.<br>Your argument that I've pushed easy wagons the entire game is just simply untrue. I did not push for SaM, and I did not push for Slaxx. Indeed I thought they were town and accordingly I did not wagon them for the \"easy lynch\" as you claim. <br><br>Mastin's last few posts seem to reek of desperate scum seeking to push a mislynch that was seemingly within grasp moments ago. If Mastin2 sincerely thought that my claim was an obvious fakeclaim, why did he simply not argue that my claim was fake and explain? Instead he gave reasons as to why he thought the claim was fake and then frantically threw together a case arguing that I had not done anything pro-town. Not only did this case have many ungrounded and clearly false accusations, but gave the impression that he never really had a legitimate case against me. Looking back, he never really made any coherent arguments against me, merely content to cite to my posts and shallowly state that they're scummy. However, when it came down to it, he never really was able to reference me accurately and explicitly give reasons as when Gorilla asked for them. Ultimately, his most recent case doesn't resemble previous suspicions he's expressed about me and there's an incongruity in the way they have been delivered. Yet Mastin2 has been pushing me the entire game even basing his scumlist largely on players' relation to me. Now that it's clear that I'm town, his scum list has crumbled yet he fails to actually attempt to genuinely scumhunt instead chooses to tunnel. To me, it's the perfect set up for scumhunting the next day. Because when I'm mislynched or killed and flip town, it's easy for him to clear out his scumlist and prey on the next easy target. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Mastin2</span><br><br>More to come tomorrow when I will be a little less exhausted."}

You were scum for plenty of reasons. I presented new ones in my rapid-fire posting.

These are all things I've mentioned before. <br><br>Your wall-paragraph additionally adds the charge of \"artificial, forced, contrived post\" to the argument, and I can add another incidence of hypocrisy to the charge since that's exactly what you're accusing me of doing. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Now that it's clear that I'm town</div></blockquote> If this is what you consider clear, then I'd hate to see what a foggy night looks to you.<br><br>Additionally, what happened to your Gorilla suspicion? You seem to be using Gorilla to attack me, while not addressing Gorilla, who is third on your scumlist.<br><br>I'll answer: because you didn't think of any reasons Gorilla is scum; you just know he is and didn't think about reasons to call him scum. It's once more displaying a scum mind-set. He thought of reasons for me, because he needed to BS some reason to suspect me. (By the way, this is about as blatant as OMGUS can get. <br>More than that, his entire case is built on things I said AFTER he put me on his scum-list. If his suspicion was legitimate, he would have used virtually zero of my recent arguments--it'd all be stuff I said before or at the time he put my name on his scum list.)<br><br>Whereas with Gorilla, he hadn't prepared any. Subconsciously, he already knows Gorilla's scum, so he finds it harder to explain why he's scum, because he has less legitimate town reason to know. He can point out plenty of things which make Gorilla scum, but only because he has that inside knowledge that Gorilla's scum. He can point out nothing of Gorilla which comes from a legitimate mind-set, because he knows none of his suspicion comes from a legitimate mind."}

This post also is extremely artificial. It also leaves open the back door, leaves open a way to get out if need be. Look at all the words used to leave himself open for backpedalling if necessary--\"wouldn't say\", \"still think\", \"one of\", \"seemed to be\". You get the idea. It's also hypocritical, as Diamond is overly-worried about the suspicion on him. Additionally, it contains buddying to Charter, and once more reaffirms a read which he quite frankly never explained that well.<br><br><br><br>Shall I go on? I'm basically just getting warmed up."}

To make a point.</div></blockquote><br>2. You're right. \"Yeah it is\" isn't a valid point... that's why I explained my opinion. I think you must have missed this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>How can you scumhunt without stating your suspicions? If you are actually a townie then you shouldn't be waiting for us to tell you to do something. Also, if it isn't that big of a deal, then why did you say this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Science and Magic wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>Well, aside from Lady Lambdadelta, you haven't expressed suspicion of anybody.

Its like asking why is the sky blue when you're looking at an ocean and already know the answer.</div></blockquote><br>5. Misread the \"undermining me\" part. Even though I now understand it, that point seems like a weak stretch. What do you mean when you say I'm establishing myself and why is that suspicious? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>6. I disagree. You are surmising that if I didn't believe it possible = science is scum. How is that a fair conclusion? And I wouldn't because I'm town. Why did I bother answering your questions at all if I wasn't trying to be helpful? I even bothered correcting myself so I could be as accurate as possible.</div></blockquote><br>6. a.) Have you ever seen somebody get lynched based on something they said on page 1 in a mafiascum game and do you think it happens often?  b.) I'm glad you took the time to provide correct answers to my questions, but that is irrelevant. My point is that I didn't explain the reason for asking the question in case you were scum planning to lie. There was no way I could possibly know how you'd respond so I don't understand your argument here. I have another question for you; was there any harm in waiting for your answer before explaining the reason for my question?    <br> <br><blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>7. This doesn't make sense. I answered your questions after you voted for me. Let me say this again for those who did catch it. Wicked's reason for voting for me is established after he votes for me, read #22, #28, #29, #71. He admits to this himself in #162.</div></blockquote><br>7. I had a point against you before seeing your response to my questions and I've explained why I didn't give the reason immediately (see my response to 6). Your response to my questions just strengthened my point. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>8. <br><br>#37 is inherently shedding suspicion on Slaxx. You'd have to be really dense not to realize that.<br>#67 again I am questioning Slaxx, making him clarify his position. Shit isn't complicated.<br>#70 I cast suspicion on Diamond, forcing him to come to terms with what Hind said. He answers in #148 and I find that satisfactory.<br><br>Again, you'd have to be really dense not to understand these posts. The other more logical possibility is that Wicked is feigning ignorance to make a terrible case against because he doesn't have any real material to do it with.</div></blockquote><br>8. Post #37 - Maybe you were, but you never said you suspected Slaxx in this post (or IIRC, never in any of your posts prior to me calling you out for it). If you were actually implying suspicion, then your post was IIoA, like I said before. <br>Post #67 - ...IIoA<br>Post #<span class=\"noboldsig\">8</span>0 - ...IIoA<br>All IIoA. It is really easy to bring up a point against somebody or ask questions but that doesn't force you to take a stance. You could easily say \"I never suspected them but wanted to clarify this point\" or something along those lines."}

Plus I'm in two other games I have to put some effort into. Hoppster says my input isn't required then proceeds to ask me my input.

I dont to accept Hindu being scum, I dont think my ego can handle it. I am willing to re-examine him though. Has AGM ever got a guilty result? No. (At least I cant remember him having one...)<br><br>I honestly think SGR is scum. He's tunneled me unreasonably all game, much like charter and even has a few posts linked with him.

Killing AGM was a REALLY bad move in light of your sudden belief changes because it openly exposes your gambit to EVERYONE except Hoppster. Let me explain what I am pretty sure is going on. <br><br>So, for the record, you all do remember that it's possible for two mafia to be left, right? I've been thinking it was Vifam since yesterday. Now, I'm VERY sure it's Vifam and Slaxx. Because Slaxx is NOT this retarded. The recent events blow this gambit out of the water. <br><br>AGM was killed. We ALL thought there was a godfather, right? What IF there IS a godfather AND a roleblocker? YES, I'M GOING HERE. Even if there ISN'T, there's a SMALL chance gorilla exaggerated his target and said it would be on what he then thought was confirmed town(Why do this? mafia wouldn't roleblock him if they had a roleblocker and he may've thought they had one). But Hoppster isn't scum from being jailkept BEFORE gorilla outed himself and from doing basically nothing that was scummy throughout the game SGR isn't either from the thinking about the three people jumping onto Diamond's wagon AND from his push yesterday on SaM from previous suspicion, regardless of whether he was wrong. <br><br>Now, there are three choices and it's getting down to the point where there IS NO \"confirmed\" town. And BOTH Vifam AND Slaxx just want to QUICKLYNCH? AT POSSIBLE LYLO? NOPE, NOT BUYING THAT SHIT. <br><br>\"BUT SLAXX IS <span class=\"noboldsig\">100%</span> CONFIRMED TOWN AND WILL JUST LIVE\" LOLOLOL NO. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT IN THAT IS IF HE'S YOUR SCUMBUDDY. OTHERWISE, HE WOULD DIE TONIGHT. BUT WAIT, HOPPSTER WOULD GO FIRST. WHY WASN'T HOPPSTER KILLED TONIGHT? NOW, WE GO ONTO THE NIGHTKILL.<br><br>WHY DID THE SCUM NOT KILL HOPPSTER OR VIFAM AND INSTEAD KILLED AGM? There are 3 options. 1.) To frame me.(I thought this would be it and the godfather would go in guns flaming today at me so I told everyone to wait.) Now that I'm suspicious of 2 mafia and this never happened, I'm not voting until I see the 2 people I think to be town in here posting thoughts with me. 2.) To pull off this gambit AND to keep their roleblocker from possibly being investigated. 3.) Lolrandom kill because godfather isn't reading that we have confirmed town. 1 and 3 did not happen. The godfather HAS to be reading the game because EVERYONE in the game has expressed knowledge of our confirmed town.<br><br>So, let me explain. This nightkill has outed us our mafia. It HAS to be Vifam and Slaxx otherwise those two actually ARE this retarded(no, especially given Slaxx's behavior up to this day). It WAS a very nice try from you two, though. If someone who wasn't thinking came in and hammered, this would be game over. Why is it them? There is ZERO reason to kill AGM unless there are TWO mafia who are BOTH hoping to survive. And you know what? I'll go 1v2 in this. <span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">If I'm wrong and Vifam flips town today, lynch me tomorrow.</span> As town, both Vifam and Slaxx would NOT quickwagon FULLY knowing there was scum out there who would happily hammer. They would hold back. But only 3 people held back on voting: Me, SGR, and Hoppster. Slaxx and Vifam planned this. Even I am not so sure of Slaxx to the point where I'd go \"WELL, GAME'S IN THE BAG, FOLKS, LET'S LYNCH THESE TWO AND GO ON OUR MERRY WAY\" after the way we ruined our scumlynching streak. <br><br>This is largely directed at Hoppster because he now has the game deciding vote. Since Slaxx and Vifam have both quickvoted with little to no reasoning except \"WE GOT THIS, NO PROBLEM\" at possible LYLO, the scumteam has to be either ME/SGR or Vifam/Slaxx. Obviously, SGR and I both can tell they're lying. But you know what's better? They have to change their reasoning from \"OH, ONE SCUM LEFT\" to \"ITS GOTTA BE SGR/HINDU. 2 SCUM LEFT\" now to accomodate their chances at winning and, in doing this, flailing to survive since I've now offered my own life up tomorrow."}

Too OP for a miller game.<br><br>Option 1 is definitely what I'm leaning on. As much as I would like to lynch Vifam for dropping so many scummy posts earlier in the game because they make me itch just reading them, it has to be Hoppster. I went over motives for clearing town like Vifam did for SGR when noone was likely to catch it and it didn't add up. Plus Vifam has some towntells in some posts. Hoppster has this nullish vibe I've been getting from someone who looks like they're playing VERY carefully. Remember the D4 SaM wagon?

This basically painted a huge target on the LLD slot, so that went well for them, I think.<br>Y'all got very trigger happy with the back-to-back scum lynches, and poor Wicked didn't manage to post at all D2 or D3. Neither did Hoppster, your confirmed town. It worked out fine in the end though, and I suppose you can tell a lot from how people react to the lolwagons.<br>SGR did well to last that long, though from his most recent post it sounds as though the Hindu x AGM masterplan was entirely accidental. If Hindu/AGM had been lynched on D4 instead of SaM, SGR might have had a decent chance of pulling through to the end. As it stood, PoE really kicked his ass.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Controversies!</span><br>I realise that I shouldn't have allowed the Riddick replacement, since I'd banned them in the sign-up thread. I apologise if this had a huge impact on the game, but I was caught at a very...shall we say, merry...time.<br>The big bomb though was the code that AGM used. I don't really see any other way that I could have handled that - the scum team didn't actually decode it, despite the tools being there, whereas Hindu <span class=\"noboldsig\">did</span> - though I think he probably would have, given his involvement in DEFCON 3.0 anyway. If it makes a difference, the Riddick Hydra did NOT attempt to decode the message.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Set up!</span><br>I take on board that this may have been too cop-themed for the normal queue. It did start out with a bunch more cop-fitting PRs (Framers, GFs, Backup Cops) but they all got balanced out to make it less swingy. I think that's a good thing, actually - it was nice seeing the vanillas at the end working without PRs, and in fact, looking at how the PRs dropped suspicion on people.<br>I almost wish that Hindu had been right in his crazier theories, since they were definitely thinking outside of the box in terms of set-up, which I liked.<br>The JK's ability to clear people was NOT something I had actively considered when making the setup, since I didn't count on scum flying solo by N2. It definitely added a different dynamic to the game and could have been TOO powerful in combination with  the cop clears. It was initially meant to be a way to neuter the effectiveness of town PRs since it was the only protective role, but obv. couldn't be used to save PRs.<br>The EN Vig was made EN on purpose so it only got its shot if it made it to N2. Initially there was a counterpart Odd-Night SK, but the stacks of anti-town kills on the first night was weighted out of the game. Its a shame Riddick never shot, though it would have actually cost town a mislynch.<br>The Miller was meant to hinder town, but it basically gave them a clear from the get-go. Millers as an anti-town force is not as effective as I'd hoped it would be! Maybe if they were not told they were millers, it would have been a lot more scum-sided.<br>As for the GF - or lack thereof - obviously if SGR had rolled GF in his situation he would have been able to leave AGM alive and prey on GF fears. BUT, what I think is especially interesting, is the fact that there was not GF, but people assumed there was. Had AGM investigated SGR, then obviously it would have been different, but here, I think the lack of GF really helped scum in instilling a sense of paranoia. My thinking is, if Diamond had rolled GF and flipped it on D1, then every investigate of AGM's would have been cleared. As it stood, you couldn't trust any of them. That was something I really hadn't expected!<br><br>Well, I hope you all enjoyed the game! I really enjoyed modding it, and finding my signature vote count format :p I don't think I'll be naming each of the VCs in the future - far too hard to come up with cool one-liners on the spot! Giving you all names and little personalities was pretty fun too! Finding replacements wasn't as hard as I'd thought, but I nevertheless want to extend a HUGE thank you to all those who replaced in.<br><br>~AV"}
