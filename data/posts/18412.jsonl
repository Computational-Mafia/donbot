They'd had trouble with those scumbag mafiasos before, but recently it seemed that their job was getting that little bit harder. Evidence disappearing. Witnesses changing their story. Criminals walking free on school-boy technicalities. Well, something had to be done. And soon. When the enemy fights dirty, you gotta get down there in the mud with them. No more arrests. Just cold, rough, irreversible justice...</div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 111%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">MR C. VILLIAN, MURDERED N -29</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nDetective I. M. Acopp lit the cigarette with a Zippo lighter he pulled from his inside suit pocket. He put it on the table and inhaled slowly. The tip burned bright orange as he eyed the kid sitting opposite him. The Detective leaned in and blew the smoke out into his face. His eyes were cold. The kid coughed and instinctively went to waft the smoke out of his face. He couldn&#8217;t; his hands were cuffed to the table, and all he accomplished was to hurt his wrist.<br>\nThe Detective stood back up and walked over to the other side of the table, where he took off his suit jacket and hung it over the back of his chair. His partner, G. Nerikop, a hard hitting Polish police officer, nodded and dropped a folder on the table. He spoke, his voice as gritty as this description. <br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;So, Mr...E. Herring. Where were you last night?&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Where was I? I was, uh, with, my buddy. Yeah.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Your buddy, eh? Hear this Ian? With a buddy. Well. This buddy have a name?&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Course. His name&#8217;s Andy. Andy Crumbalot.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Crumbalot? The baker?&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Yeah, yeah.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Oh. He was with the baker, Ian. Guess we can let him go.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>The kid&#8217;s face lit up &#8211; he was going to go free. Detective Acopp walked over to the table and extinguished his cigarette in an ashtray lying next to the folder. He flipped the cover open.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Funny, Gene. Because county records show Mr. Crumbalot was in hospital last night. With a broken finger.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Herring&#8217;s face drained of colour. &#8220;What?!&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re lying to us, Mr. Herring.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;No! I swear it!&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;The records don&#8217;t lie, but people do.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a mistake, I mean, I was with him, last night!&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Detective Acopp turned and looked at his reflection in the mirror that ran the width of the room. He jerked his head backwards, gesturing towards the pale kid trembling in the chair behind him.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Lock this piece of shit up.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 111%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">MR. EDWARD HERRING, WRONGFULLY DETAINED N -25</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nJust over three weeks later, Acopp stormed into the police station, heading straight to his partners desk. He flung a newspaper at him, opened to an inside page showing a full colour picture of young Edward Herring on the steps of the courthouse building.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Hey. You remember that kid we collared a few weeks ago for murder? He was in court yesterday. Would you believe it? His alibi checked out. That baker, the one we couldn&#8217;t find, the one he said he was with &#8211; he never broke his finger. The county hospital have no records of a Mr. Crumbalot visiting them the night of the murder. We were duped.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;What? But the records-&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;The records were falsified, gentlemen.&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>The voice was gravel; its owner had clearly spent years drinking whiskey out of empty cigarette boxes after smoking the whole lot in one sitting. It was so gritty that even his tongue must have had its own stubble.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;Excuse me, but who are you?&#8221;<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>&#8220;They call me A. V. I&#8217;m just a man with a maverick disregard for the rulebook and a tragic backstory that would be revealed in a flashback episode if this were a TV show. And I&#8217;ve been following these scumbags for a long, long time. Forget everythin&#8217; you thought you knew. There&#8217;s no longer time to go through the courts. Are you listenin&#8217;? We&#8217;re throwin&#8217; procedure out the window here. No more handcuffs. If we don&#8217;t do somethin&#8217; soon, Little Italy is going to the wolves &#8211; and they ain&#8217;t friendly critters either. You ever killed a man with rabies, boy? You ain&#8217;t never looked death in the eye &#8216;til it&#8217;s drippin&#8217; from the teeth of an enraged rabies victim, I&#8217;ll tell you that much. And that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. Unless you listen to me and listen real good. Over the years I&#8217;ve narrowed the scumbags down to somewhere amongst this list of people. But our badge ain&#8217;t no good any more, you hear? We gotta let natural justice take its course. Announce to the people of Little Italy that we&#8217;re looking for the killers, and then &#8220;accidentally&#8221; leak the document. I can guarantee you that the people on that list will take matters into their own hands to prove they&#8217;re innocent &#8211; I mean, living here, what more do you expect? We&#8217;ve done our part, gentleman. Now alls we can do is wait and watch as this town finds and kills the scumbags for us &#8211; or destroys itself trying.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 111%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">POLICE DOCUMENT, LEAKED N0</div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Jul 18, 2011 9:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18412&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "18412"}

Small or invisible text as a secret communication is disallowed. Cryptography is also disallowed.<br>\n8. Loopholes are bad and pretty dick-ish. Modkills ensue.<br>\n9.

A 'three strikes and you're out' rule on prods and replacement is enforced. That is, three prods and you're force replaced.<br>\n5. This game has two week deadlines at the beginning of each game day. Keep in mind that your mod is a busy (and handsome) man so I may be a little flexible on this. There will be deadline countdowns to help enforce this.<br>\n6. Votes/Unvotes may be done either by bolding your Votes or using Vote tags. If you don't use tags, Colons (:) make my life a lot easier. Usernames may be shortened but it has to be easily discernible.

Also, if it isn't that big of a deal, then why did you say this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Science and Magic wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>Well, aside from Lady Lambdadelta, you haven't expressed suspicion of anybody.

You could, but if you use some real-world common sense I'd say its unlikely. Matter of opinion I guess. I was a little suspicious like I said, but it wasn't the full-blown kind. It was the kind that lurks in the back of mind and you ignore because its the heat of the moment and you're pissed. Not everyone plays town perfectly and not everyone reacts to situations the same way. I was genuinely upset at the prospect of being ninja'd, especially before I claimed. Thats how it went down. <br>\n<br>\n5. Whats the point of asking this question? You know why. Its like asking why is the sky blue when you're looking at an ocean and already know the answer.<br>\n6. I disagree. You are surmising that if I didn't believe it possible = science is scum. How is that a fair conclusion? And I wouldn't because I'm town. Why did I bother answering your questions at all if I wasn't trying to be helpful? I even bothered correcting myself so I could be as accurate as possible. <br>\n7. This doesn't make sense. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I answered your questions after you voted for me.</div> Let me say this again for those who did catch it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wicked's reason for voting for me is established after he votes for me, read #22, #28, #29, #71.

You'd have to be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> dense not to realize that.<br>\n#67 again I am questioning Slaxx, making him clarify his position. Shit isn't complicated.<br>\n#70 I cast suspicion on Diamond, forcing him to come to terms with what Hind said. He answers in #148 and I find that satisfactory.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, you'd have to be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really dense</div> not to understand these posts. The other more logical possibility is that Wicked is feigning ignorance to make a terrible case against because he doesn't have any real material to do it with.</fieldset>", "time": "Thu Jul 21, 2011 3:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18412&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "18412"}

Even-night is both stronger and weaker, in that it's not limited in shots, but can shoot less often, therefore meaning that every shot the vig makes is that much more important to the setup--meaning that a doctor potentially countering it is a bad idea.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, doctor's the most stereotypical fakeclaim out there, and Diamond's view on LLD seems incredibly stretched.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, having a vig, cop, miller, and doctor in the same setup would either mean an INCREDIBLY strong scumteam (we're talking Roleblocker plus Godfather as the kind of strength needed to counter that), or one of the claims is a lie. LLD's is believable and provable. Mine will be self-evident over time.

Looking back, he never really made any coherent arguments against me, merely content to cite to my posts and shallowly state that they're scummy. However, when it came down to it, he never really was able to reference me accurately and explicitly give reasons as when Gorilla asked for them. Ultimately, his most recent case doesn't resemble previous suspicions he's expressed about me and there's an incongruity in the way they have been delivered. Yet Mastin2 has been pushing me the entire game even basing his scumlist largely on players' relation to me. Now that it's clear that I'm town, his scum list has crumbled yet he fails to actually attempt to genuinely scumhunt instead chooses to tunnel.

It's once more displaying a scum mind-set. He thought of reasons for me, because he needed to BS some reason to suspect me. (By the way, this is about as blatant as OMGUS can get. <br>\nMore than that, his entire case is built on things I said AFTER he put me on his scum-list.

{"number": 463, "id": "3283071", "user": "Wickedestjr", "user_id": "10668", "content": "Response to SaM is below. The only reason I'm quoting everything is because SaM's post was 10 pages ago:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>2. \"Yeah it is\" isn't a valid point. Why did I say that? To make a point.</div></blockquote><br>\n2. You're right. \"Yeah it is\" isn't a valid point... that's why I explained my opinion. I think you must have missed this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>How can you scumhunt without stating your suspicions? If you are actually a townie then you shouldn't be waiting for us to tell you to do something. Also, if it isn't that big of a deal, then why did you say this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Science and Magic wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>Well, aside from Lady Lambdadelta, you haven't expressed suspicion of anybody. So it is four pages into the game and you don't actually have any suspicions. You're scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nI dont think I'm the only one who \"hasn't expressed suspicion\".</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>3. Sure, that was your point if you want. Cool beans.</div></blockquote><br>\n3. No defense at all? Why did you think a Slaxx lynch based on the first page was a possibility?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>5. Whats the point of asking this question? You know why. Its like asking why is the sky blue when you're looking at an ocean and already know the answer.</div></blockquote><br>\n5. Misread the \"undermining me\" part. Even though I now understand it, that point seems like a weak stretch. What do you mean when you say I'm establishing myself and why is that suspicious? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>6. I disagree. You are surmising that if I didn't believe it possible = science is scum. How is that a fair conclusion? And I wouldn't because I'm town. Why did I bother answering your questions at all if I wasn't trying to be helpful? I even bothered correcting myself so I could be as accurate as possible.</div></blockquote><br>\n6. a.) Have you ever seen somebody get lynched based on something they said on page 1 in a mafiascum game and do you think it happens often?  b.) I'm glad you took the time to provide correct answers to my questions, but that is irrelevant. My point is that I didn't explain the reason for asking the question in case you were scum planning to lie. There was no way I could possibly know how you'd respond so I don't understand your argument here. I have another question for you; was there any harm in waiting for your answer before explaining the reason for my question?    <br>\n <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>7. This doesn't make sense. I answered your questions after you voted for me. Let me say this again for those who did catch it. Wicked's reason for voting for me is established after he votes for me, read #22, #28, #29, #71. He admits to this himself in #162.</div></blockquote><br>\n7. I had a point against you before seeing your response to my questions and I've explained why I didn't give the reason immediately (see my response to 6). Your response to my questions just strengthened my point. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SaM wrote:</cite>8. <br>\n<br>\n#37 is inherently shedding suspicion on Slaxx. You'd have to be really dense not to realize that.<br>\n#67 again I am questioning Slaxx, making him clarify his position. Shit isn't complicated.<br>\n#70 I cast suspicion on Diamond, forcing him to come to terms with what Hind said. He answers in #148 and I find that satisfactory.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, you'd have to be really dense not to understand these posts. The other more logical possibility is that Wicked is feigning ignorance to make a terrible case against because he doesn't have any real material to do it with.</div></blockquote><br>\n8. Post #37 - Maybe you were, but you never said you suspected Slaxx in this post (or IIRC, never in any of your posts prior to me calling you out for it). If you were actually implying suspicion, then your post was IIoA, like I said before. <br>\nPost #67 - ...IIoA<br>\nPost #<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">8</div>0 - ...IIoA<br>\nAll IIoA. It is really easy to bring up a point against somebody or ask questions but that doesn't force you to take a stance.

{"number": 938, "id": "3335293", "user": "Hinduragi", "user_id": "13935", "content": "All of your \"LOL GOTTA BE THESE TWO\" is bullshit. Killing AGM was a REALLY bad move in light of your sudden belief changes because it openly exposes your gambit to EVERYONE except Hoppster. Let me explain what I am pretty sure is going on. <br>\n<br>\nSo, for the record, you all do remember that it's possible for two mafia to be left, right? I've been thinking it was Vifam since yesterday. Now, I'm VERY sure it's Vifam and Slaxx. Because Slaxx is NOT this retarded. The recent events blow this gambit out of the water. <br>\n<br>\nAGM was killed. We ALL thought there was a godfather, right? What IF there IS a godfather AND a roleblocker? YES, I'M GOING HERE. Even if there ISN'T, there's a SMALL chance gorilla exaggerated his target and said it would be on what he then thought was confirmed town(Why do this? mafia wouldn't roleblock him if they had a roleblocker and he may've thought they had one). But Hoppster isn't scum from being jailkept BEFORE gorilla outed himself and from doing basically nothing that was scummy throughout the game SGR isn't either from the thinking about the three people jumping onto Diamond's wagon AND from his push yesterday on SaM from previous suspicion, regardless of whether he was wrong. <br>\n<br>\nNow, there are three choices and it's getting down to the point where there IS NO \"confirmed\" town. And BOTH Vifam AND Slaxx just want to QUICKLYNCH? AT POSSIBLE LYLO? NOPE, NOT BUYING THAT SHIT. <br>\n<br>\n\"BUT SLAXX IS <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">100%</div> CONFIRMED TOWN AND WILL JUST LIVE\" LOLOLOL NO. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT IN THAT IS IF HE'S YOUR SCUMBUDDY. OTHERWISE, HE WOULD DIE TONIGHT. BUT WAIT, HOPPSTER WOULD GO FIRST. WHY WASN'T HOPPSTER KILLED TONIGHT? NOW, WE GO ONTO THE NIGHTKILL.<br>\n<br>\nWHY DID THE SCUM NOT KILL HOPPSTER OR VIFAM AND INSTEAD KILLED AGM? There are 3 options. 1.) To frame me.(I thought this would be it and the godfather would go in guns flaming today at me so I told everyone to wait.) Now that I'm suspicious of 2 mafia and this never happened, I'm not voting until I see the 2 people I think to be town in here posting thoughts with me. 2.) To pull off this gambit AND to keep their roleblocker from possibly being investigated. 3.) Lolrandom kill because godfather isn't reading that we have confirmed town. 1 and 3 did not happen. The godfather HAS to be reading the game because EVERYONE in the game has expressed knowledge of our confirmed town.<br>\n<br>\nSo, let me explain. This nightkill has outed us our mafia. It HAS to be Vifam and Slaxx otherwise those two actually ARE this retarded(no, especially given Slaxx's behavior up to this day). It WAS a very nice try from you two, though. If someone who wasn't thinking came in and hammered, this would be game over. Why is it them? There is ZERO reason to kill AGM unless there are TWO mafia who are BOTH hoping to survive. And you know what? I'll go 1v2 in this. <div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">If I'm wrong and Vifam flips town today, lynch me tomorrow.</div> As town, both Vifam and Slaxx would NOT quickwagon FULLY knowing there was scum out there who would happily hammer. They would hold back. But only 3 people held back on voting: Me, SGR, and Hoppster. Slaxx and Vifam planned this. Even I am not so sure of Slaxx to the point where I'd go \"WELL, GAME'S IN THE BAG, FOLKS, LET'S LYNCH THESE TWO AND GO ON OUR MERRY WAY\" after the way we ruined our scumlynching streak. <br>\n<br>\nThis is largely directed at Hoppster because he now has the game deciding vote. Since Slaxx and Vifam have both quickvoted with little to no reasoning except \"WE GOT THIS, NO PROBLEM\" at possible LYLO, the scumteam has to be either ME/SGR or Vifam/Slaxx. Obviously, SGR and I both can tell they're lying. But you know what's better? They have to change their reasoning from \"OH, ONE SCUM LEFT\" to \"ITS GOTTA BE SGR/HINDU. 2 SCUM LEFT\" now to accomodate their chances at winning and, in doing this, flailing to survive since I've now offered my own life up tomorrow.", "time": "Thu Aug 11, 2011 2:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18412&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "18412"}

Plus he was jailed night 1 too.

You say: fuck yeah, I love Cheetos, Cheetos are fucking awesome. She says \"Alright I'm going to a new store this time\" and shuts the door.<br>\n<br>\nYou will get Cheetos when she gets back. It was implied, by the fact she ended the conversation and left, that the understanding was you were getting your fucking Cheetos.<br>\n<br>\nAnd its the same thing here. If anyone but Gorilla hammered, I then yes, I would be a little hesitant. But Vifam gave Gorilla permission than Gorilla hammered. Even if he didn't directly acknowledge it during his hammer i am still confident Vifam was jailed.<br>\n<br>\nthe key is GORILLA ended the conversation. Plus, Vifam's play hasn't exactly reeked scum.

As dumb as that was, it IS a towntell and I've done it as town before except noone in the game caught it.

Hoppster has dropped plenty of scumtells that I've been forced to ignore and not point out due to the \"cleared\" town status.<br>\n<br>\nNow there are only THREE possibilities I'm going to even think about:<br>\n-Hoppster is scum.

Sent it in N3 but wasn't RB'd by gorilla.<br>\n-Hoppster and Vifam are partners. Vifam would have to be the Roleblocker and the last 2 scum would both have to be granted investigation immunity. Too OP for a miller game.<br>\n<br>\nOption 1 is definitely what I'm leaning on. As much as I would like to lynch Vifam for dropping so many scummy posts earlier in the game because they make me itch just reading them, it has to be Hoppster. I went over motives for clearing town like Vifam did for SGR when noone was likely to catch it and it didn't add up. Plus Vifam has some towntells in some posts. Hoppster has this nullish vibe I've been getting from someone who looks like they're playing VERY carefully. Remember the D4 SaM wagon?

Unfortunately, since he was part Liverpudlian, people found it hard to understand him. He asked the town to wait whilst a translator was flown in from the Culture Capital - but it seemed his flight had been delayed.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Meanwhile, Bulgarian wrestling sensation Victor van Famm had to be rushed to hospital after a nasty accident involving a ballerina, a tube of extra-fresh toothpaste and a bowling ball. He was out of commission for the foreseeable future, and so it was up to the rag-tag bunch of lovable rogues to finish in his place.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Perhaps it was jealousy at his footballing skills that made the rest of the town turn on poor Steven Gerrard-Ayzee.

Steven L. Acksi, outraged that another person would share his forename, tied the final knot, utilising years of practice built up in his chino factory to ensure death would be swift at hand.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>As Gerrard-Ayzee fell to the floor, a gun slipped out of his pocket.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Henric Posta wandered closer. Everyone could feel the former priest's pure heart and clear soul as he inspected the weapon. Somehow, the holy man was an expert on firearms - he declared that it was the very same weapon that had killed countless times before.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>It seemed the town would be safe.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>It seemed that the terror...was over.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 145%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">SGRaaize</div></div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 145%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Mafia Goon</div></div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 145%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">, Lynched D5</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hinduragi</div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Survived to Endgame!</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hoppster</div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Survived to Endgame!</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slaxx</div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Survived to Endgame!</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vifam</div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Survived to Endgame!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 145%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">The game ends in a town victory!</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">Congratulations to the following players on the side of the</div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TOWN</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">: <br>\nRiddick, mastin2, Wickedestjr, gorilla, Science and Magic, AlmasterGM, Hinduragi, Hoppster, Slaxx and Vifam!<br>\n<br>\nAnd commiserations to the following players on the side of the </div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MAFIA</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">: <br>\nDiamondillium, charter and SGRaaize!<br>\n<br>\nBut most importantly,</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 145%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Thank you all for playing!</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">Well, that's all folks!<br>\nRole PMs, Night Actions, Dead QT, Mod Thoughts, Feelings and Bowel Movements, all coming up shortly!<br>\n<br>\nPlease feel free to discuss the game at will.

This basically painted a huge target on the LLD slot, so that went well for them, I think.<br>\nY'all got very trigger happy with the back-to-back scum lynches, and poor Wicked didn't manage to post at all D2 or D3. Neither did Hoppster, your confirmed town. It worked out fine in the end though, and I suppose you can tell a lot from how people react to the lolwagons.<br>\nSGR did well to last that long, though from his most recent post it sounds as though the Hindu x AGM masterplan was entirely accidental. If Hindu/AGM had been lynched on D4 instead of SaM, SGR might have had a decent chance of pulling through to the end. As it stood, PoE really kicked his ass.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Controversies!</div><br>\nI realise that I shouldn't have allowed the Riddick replacement, since I'd banned them in the sign-up thread. I apologise if this had a huge impact on the game, but I was caught at a very...shall we say, merry...time.<br>\nThe big bomb though was the code that AGM used. I don't really see any other way that I could have handled that - the scum team didn't actually decode it, despite the tools being there, whereas Hindu <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">did</div> - though I think he probably would have, given his involvement in DEFCON 3.0 anyway. If it makes a difference, the Riddick Hydra did NOT attempt to decode the message.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Set up!</div><br>\nI take on board that this may have been too cop-themed for the normal queue. It did start out with a bunch more cop-fitting PRs (Framers, GFs, Backup Cops) but they all got balanced out to make it less swingy. I think that's a good thing, actually - it was nice seeing the vanillas at the end working without PRs, and in fact, looking at how the PRs dropped suspicion on people.<br>\nI almost wish that Hindu had been right in his crazier theories, since they were definitely thinking outside of the box in terms of set-up, which I liked.<br>\nThe JK's ability to clear people was NOT something I had actively considered when making the setup, since I didn't count on scum flying solo by N2. It definitely added a different dynamic to the game and could have been TOO powerful in combination with  the cop clears. It was initially meant to be a way to neuter the effectiveness of town PRs since it was the only protective role, but obv. couldn't be used to save PRs.<br>\nThe EN Vig was made EN on purpose so it only got its shot if it made it to N2. Initially there was a counterpart Odd-Night SK, but the stacks of anti-town kills on the first night was weighted out of the game. Its a shame Riddick never shot, though it would have actually cost town a mislynch.<br>\nThe Miller was meant to hinder town, but it basically gave them a clear from the get-go. Millers as an anti-town force is not as effective as I'd hoped it would be! Maybe if they were not told they were millers, it would have been a lot more scum-sided.<br>\nAs for the GF - or lack thereof - obviously if SGR had rolled GF in his situation he would have been able to leave AGM alive and prey on GF fears. BUT, what I think is especially interesting, is the fact that there was not GF, but people assumed there was. Had AGM investigated SGR, then obviously it would have been different, but here, I think the lack of GF really helped scum in instilling a sense of paranoia. My thinking is, if Diamond had rolled GF and flipped it on D1, then every investigate of AGM's would have been cleared. As it stood, you couldn't trust any of them. That was something I really hadn't expected!<br>\n<br>\nWell, I hope you all enjoyed the game! I really enjoyed modding it, and finding my signature vote count format :p I don't think I'll be naming each of the VCs in the future - far too hard to come up with cool one-liners on the spot! Giving you all names and little personalities was pretty fun too! Finding replacements wasn't as hard as I'd thought, but I nevertheless want to extend a HUGE thank you to all those who replaced in.<br>\n<br>\n~AV", "time": "Wed Aug 17, 2011 1:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18412&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "18412"}
