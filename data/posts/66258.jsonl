Bass so high it reverbates in your bones and allows you to forget the panicked thumping of your heart. Bass so high the ground itself dances to it, running around the dance floor, greeting everyone with a friendly slam. Everyone enters a collective trance, it's great.<br>\n<br>\nI give the guy his pisco sour, that's all this one ever drinks, is pisco sours. After some time bartending I took it upon myself to not only spot the regulars, but build a profile for each of them. Maybe I'd have been better off doing crossword puzzles.<br>\n<br>\nThe playlist segues over to cumbia, pisco sour man gets up and leaves. Watching him exit I spot <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">them</div> entering. <br>\nUh-oh.<br>\n<br>\nThough the physical sensation is similar to the bass feeling, a frantic heartbeat is much more isolating. <br>\n<br>\nThe auditory fog immediately ceases, cleared up by fear-enhanced vision and hearing. My eyes capture every slight gesticulation, my ears invent their voices from a small glimpse of their lips. I know well enough why they're here. A cousin's husband's cumbia band, a very mediocre one. Mediocre enough that when the owner is asked to promote them a polite \"no\" is not enough.

I think after giving it more thought I feel like this is probably a town read (although that's also influenced by stuff from later in the thread, I guess, but whatever)<br>\n<br>\n46: I don't like having a vote with the implication that there's meaning behind it without going into that reasoning at all; that said, Tyler's post #50 is substantial enough that I'm fine with the lowish level of detail here.<br>\n<br>\n55: this post says some worthwhile things, but I'm not sure how to feel about Keyser overall yet. also, nice gifs.<br>\n<br>\n59: this post is really incoherent, but that's my cat's fault for waking me up at 4:30 am.<br>\n<br>\n62: this is a good post and I trust Tyler so far.<br>\n<br>\n66: I don't particularly agree with you regarding your original vote, but I like the reasoning you give for it here.<br>\n<br>\n70: this is the first post from Zachstralkita that I think actually says anything significant; the rest of his posts before this one have a really low signal:noise ratio.<br>\n<br>\n77: why the unvote?<br>\n<br>\n81: I think I answered your question here substantially enough earlier in this post, so I'm just acknowledging your line of questioning here.<br>\n<br>\n87: you're one to talk; I'd say Dunnstral is one of the better players in this regard.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTyler is the player I'm getting the strongest town vibes from.

Arc on jaack is natural enough, but it does come amid some pressure for his jaack read, and some people expressing suspicion of Keyser. Want to bookmark that for later.<br>\n-Not a whole lot to work with so far. Could be attributed to the stagnancy of the game or to being afraid of looking bad. Second point lends evidence to that.<br>\n<br>\nira:<br>\n<br>\n-Ostensibly, ira treated the game like it was RVS until <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7868293#p7868293\" class=\"postlink\">#198</a>, because when people gave him flak for his Keyser vote his defense was that he was trying to build a wagon to get out of RVS. Fair enough. But in that same post he votes Bins, right after Dunn begins pushing for a Bins wagon. It's the same MO as when he voted for Keyser, basically, but at this point he's putting reasoning behind it. So it kind of all comes together to look like ira was floating along trying to look active, then got criticized for it and came up with an excuse (I'm trying to get out of RVS) but also tried to escape the criticism by going to the next viable wagon he could find (Bins). It's worth noting that ira says he didn't know Dunn was voting Bins (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869977#p7869977\" class=\"postlink\">#256</a>).<br>\n-He switches back to Keyser in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869986#p7869986\" class=\"postlink\">#257</a>. He has reasoning, and I do follow it logically, but it should be noted that it happens amid pressure for his Bins vote, and in the process of switching to Keyser he distances himself from the Bins vote.<br>\n-<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869994#p7869994\" class=\"postlink\">#259</a> just doesn't make sense, because mafia is a game where you can't trust people and therefore can't take what they say at face value. The lack of information forces you to try to read into why people are saying the things they're saying. So basically this comes across like a weak defense.<br>\n<br>\nxyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-I have trouble with posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7865422#p7865422\" class=\"postlink\">#89</a>. When I go back and do rereads, I make a point of condensing them into a more useful format -- that is, breaking them down player-by-player or wagon-by-wagon, only highlighting the most significant things, etc. This is a lot of posts and it's just done chronologically, and therefore my first thought is that it's just xyzzy looking for busywork to appear town. The problem is that it kinda fits the narrative about xyzzy coming back to the site after a long hiatus -- in other words, they could just be rusty. I guess I just want to note that so I can start to look for patterns.<br>\n-As I noted before, the vote on zach in that post is kind of \"safe.\"<br>\n-On second glance, I'm not sure why the question xyzzy asked me in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7867428#p7867428\" class=\"postlink\">#158</a> mattered...in other words, I don't know what xyzzy expected to get out of it in the way of scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\njaack:<br>\n<br>\n-As I noted before, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7862722#p7862722\" class=\"postlink\">#13</a> makes sense in a very surface-level way. Robert's post violated a very common buzzword-y kind of logic about what town's motivation is. So it's the kind of post I would expect scum to hop on, and jaack did.<br>\n-He switches to ira in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7864527#p7864527\" class=\"postlink\">#66</a>, and it does come after Keyser votes jaack for voting robert. That being said, I guess I would think scum would try harder to get something going on robert? Whereas jaack doesn't really try all that hard.<br>\n-I'm noticing a pattern of something that kind of approaches OMGUS territory without diving into it headfirst. His vote on ira came after ira's cheeky \"criticism\" of jaack. And then in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7866694#p7866694\" class=\"postlink\">#127</a> he starts being suspicious of me based on me voting jaack. The reasoning he attaches to it in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7868603#p7868603\" class=\"postlink\">#221</a> is a little reach-y, which he admits.<br>\n<br>\nIra looks worse than I thought and jaack looks better than I thought.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: iraonavp</span><br>\n<br>\nWould like to do Bins, Zach and Tyler next.", "time": "Mon Apr 25, 2016 4:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

It's like he's trying to get a reaction out of dunn or something. What's unclear is what exactly he expects to get out of dunn, or anybody else, with his vote. He hasn't switched off of dunn yet, and he's basically just been focusing on him.<br>\n-My theory is that this approach to the game is more likely to come from town, simply because it shows that the person doesn't really care how they look. I've seen exceptions to that (where the player in question was actually scum), but just on percentages I'd give the edge to town. That being said, it'll definitely be useful to keep track of patterns in Zach's pushing/votes/etc. throughout the game.<br>\n<br>\nTyler:<br>\n<br>\n-I don't see a whole lot worth commenting on in Tyler's ISO. It's all pretty standard stuff, asking people for questions, collecting information, etc. The only thing to note is that although Tyler has been questioning people and it looks like he's attempting to drive the game forward, the game remains somewhat stagnant. Idk if that reflects more on Tyler or other people, but it's there.<br>\n-So I'm just going to revert back to my original reasoning on townleaning on Tyler -- that it makes sense to me that there was a cascade of townreads on him because he's town.", "time": "Tue Apr 26, 2016 10:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Fair enough. But in that same post he votes Bins, right after Dunn begins pushing for a Bins wagon. It's the same MO as when he voted for Keyser, basically, but at this point he's putting reasoning behind it. So it kind of all comes together to look like ira was floating along trying to look active, then got criticized for it and came up with an excuse (I'm trying to get out of RVS) but also tried to escape the criticism by going to the next viable wagon he could find (Bins). It's worth noting that ira says he didn't know Dunn was voting Bins (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869977#p7869977\" class=\"postlink\">#256</a>).<br>\n-He switches back to Keyser in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869986#p7869986\" class=\"postlink\">#257</a>.

Still have the bad feels from his first post (I know, I know, let's not rehash this again). Seems kind of sheepy in the few posts he does have. Don't really like how he has 4 scum reads and only 1 town read in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7873773#p7873773\">331</a>.

Says he doesn't have enough content to judge me fully (?), but feels everyone on my wagon is scummy. Reads to me like someone who knows I'm town and wants to leave as many option open in terms of a future lynch on me. (Keyser saw a similar thing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7872646#p7872646\">311</a>) If he doesn't participate on hypothetical future wagon, then he can point back here and say 'told you so' while also not committing to a full town read on me. Also don't like how he doesn't give reads on ira, dunn, or keyser in that post. He did give a read on ira earlier so I can kind of understand leaving that one out, but leaving out dunn and keyser is weird, as neither are exactly inactive, and h_a had even interacted with dunn significantly before that. If one of {h_a, dunn, keyser} flips scum its probably worth going back and checking out the other two based on this post alone, even though I'm townreading the other two players here pretty hard.<br>\n<br>\nira - Still think this reeks of scum.

I think his small number of contributions is bad, so overall, I feel a little negative about h_a, but not super negative. and basically my vote on Zachstralkita is because he's specifically avoided making contributions to the game time and time again without any justifiable reason, and the few contributions he does make all end up using deeply flawed logic.

I think his small number of contributions is bad, so overall, I feel a little negative about h_a, but not super negative. and basically my vote on Zachstralkita is because he's specifically avoided making contributions to the game time and time again without any justifiable reason, and the few contributions he does make all end up using deeply flawed logic.

Says he doesn't have enough content to judge me fully (?), but feels everyone on my wagon is scummy. Reads to me like someone who knows I'm town and wants to leave as many option open in terms of a future lynch on me. (Keyser saw a similar thing in 311) If he doesn't participate on hypothetical future wagon, then he can point back here and say 'told you so' while also not committing to a full town read on me. Also don't like how he doesn't give reads on ira, dunn, or keyser in that post. He did give a read on ira earlier so I can kind of understand leaving that one out, but leaving out dunn and keyser is weird, as neither are exactly inactive, and h_a had even interacted with dunn significantly before that. If one of {h_a, dunn, keyser} flips scum its probably worth going back and checking out the other two based on this post alone, even though I'm townreading the other two players here pretty hard.</div></blockquote><br>\nLooking over this.<br>\n<br>\nFirst - His reads and your reads aren't that different. I mean sure there are some people he has scummy and you have as town and vice versa but it looks like a bunch of people you both sort of agree on. I am not sure why him having different reads than you makes him suspicious. Clearly not everyone is going to share your viewpoint so scum reading him for that is just plain stupid. here is what I put together comparing reads between the 2. The bolded names are where the reads are the same or pretty close to each other which makes me wonder if Jaack actually compared ha's reads to his own.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tyler - Town (Jaack &amp; HA)</div><br>\nKeyser - Town (jack) scum (ha)<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tyler - both town<br>\nDunn - both town<br>\nxyzzy - both town</div><br>\nzach - Town (Jack) Scum (HA)<br>\ntool - town (jack) slightly suspicious (ha)<br>\nBins - Decently town (jack) - leaning scum (ha)<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JFSF - both townish</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Floof - Don't really give a read but I sense scummy vibes from Jack, leaning scum (ha)</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Robert - neither really give a strong read but both seem mildly suspicious</div><br>\nira - scum (jack) town (ira)</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSecond - I am not sure what about his post makes you think he knows you are town, but he did say he has you in his town pile so i don't see why you have such an issue with him looking at the people voting you for scum. Seems like you should be doing the same thing yourself (no idea if you actually did or not) <br>\n<br>\nThird - yes Kaiser made the same mistake as you did and it actually looks like you just stole Keyser's thought about him knowing you are town. There is absolutely nothing wrong with somebody thinking a player is town and questioning people on that wagon. Keyser calls it conf. bias but so what, people do it all the time and there isn't really anything suspicious about it. How either of you come to the conclusion that he somehow KNOWS you are town is beyond me.<br>\n<br>\nFourth - <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7874908#p7874908\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7874908#p7874908\" data-post-id=\"7874908\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 357</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26257\">Jaack</a> wrote:</cite>Also don't like how he doesn't give reads on ira, dunn, or keyser in that post.</div></blockquote><br>\nwhy didn't you ask him for them? Anyways as you mention he does give a read on ira previously (town). he also gave a read on Dunn (town), and also for keyser (while he doesn't actually come out and say town or scum, he basically adds on to Dunn's read of Keyser from post 82 where dunn says he thinks keyser is mafia. I believe he also thinks keyser is mafia because he provides reasons for why dunn has come to that conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nSo in a nutshell - You and ha have very similar reads, I see nothing that makes it seem like he KNOWS you are town but has you as a town read, and he does basically give a read on everyone.", "time": "Thu Apr 28, 2016 6:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Macho is primarily used to balance a powerful role in a game with a doctor (e.g. a Cop+Doc is really powerful, while a Macho Cop+Doc is reasonable). There isn't really any reason for a Macho VT to exist in general. In order for such a role to come into play, both a doc and a nk would have to target what is essentially a VT. In order for that role to make any amount of sense, there would have to be multiple protects.

There isn't really any reason for a Macho VT to exist in general. In order for such a role to come into play, both a doc and a nk would have to target what is essentially a VT.

{"number": 711, "id": "7900929", "user": "Jaack", "user_id": "26257", "content": "Why Robert2424 is a scum and all of you need to vote for him: A Brief Essay<br>\n<br>\nRobert2424 is a scum and should be lynched, preferably on Day 2. He has done many scummy things so far in this game. First of all, he has a insanely scummy claim. He softclaims his role <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7885283#p7885283\">563</a>, calling it a weak townie. He later repeatedly refers to himself as such, despite such a role neither making sense nor matching the description he gives as to what his role does. It is not until a number of players point out his mistake that he 'checks his PM' and confirms that he is actually macho. He does this in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887674#p7887674\">603</a> after affirming that his PM said weak in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887288#p7887288\">596</a>. However, even if we were to explain away this as an honest mistake, his claim is still terrible. The Macho modifier, while theoretically conceivable on an otherwise vanilla role, is virtually always seen on something with a night action, generally a powerful one, so as to balance it. While this role claim may have been believable when there were two claimed protective roles, with heuristically_alone flipping scum, it eliminates that possibility. A sole bodyguard is already a weak protective role and does not really need to be weakened further with the addition of a random VT that can not be protected. Overall his claim makes no sense.<br>\n<br>\nSome of you may be wondering \"Why would Robert make such a bad claim?\" This is a reasonable response, but there is an equally reasonable answer. Robert was attempting to save his scumbuddy, heuristically_alone, who at the point of his claim, was the inevitable lynch target. He attempts to use his role to 'explain' how there could be two protective roles in the game. While this attempt clearly failed to save HA, it did result in more than one person considering the possibility that both he and iraonavp were telling the truth. While this gambit may seem like a bad idea, it does not make it impossible. Furthermore, his claim no more sense than the hypothetical gambit. When something makes this little sense, the best option is probably to lynch it and get an explanation.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are still not convinced of Robert's guilt, I offer further evidence of it. In Day 1, when I, along with other players, pointed out the issues with his claim, he attempted to shift blame to our benevolent mod, as seen in posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7885283#p7885283\">563</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887288#p7887288\">596</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887674#p7887674\">603</a>. In addition, when I attempted to start a wagon on him, instead of responding to my accusations he attempted to discredit me, both by not-very-subtly pointing out that I could be scum (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887288#p7887288\">596</a>) and by later deriding my clearly superior grammar <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7893063#p7893063\">671</a>. (For more on this, see the spoiler below.) Robert has clearly avoided my accusations, instead choosing to post meaningless trifles. I am not the only player that Robert does this with, as he makes a similar micro-accusation towards Tyler in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7885283#p7885283\">563</a>.<br>\n<br>\nWhile you can surely see Robert's guilt at this point, for the sake of posterity, I will continue with my analysis of his extreme scumminess. His first two posts in this game (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7862717#p7862717\">12</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7866824#p7866824\">134</a>) are both fluffy votes discussions of his history with Jake from State Farm, with Robert going as far to say that he is suspicious of Jake due to their previous history. While the first such post may be explained away as being RVS, the second one essentially repeats his previous statement, despite the fact that there had been significant discussion of the first post as being possibly scummy. While fluff in the early game is somewhat acceptable, the fact that Robert has very little content to begin with makes the high percentage of fluff notable.<br>\n<br>\nContinuing, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7873773#p7873773\">331</a> Robert offers some brief reads on players in the game. He states that he has scumreads on four players: Ira, Zach, HA, and Jake. With the exception of Jake, these were the most widely held scumreads at the time. His read on HA is particularly notable as he only 'barely nudges' his way onto his scum list. Now it may seem understandable to view widely scumread players as scummy -- they wouldn't be widely scumread if they were not. But we must also take a look at his townreads, or should I say read. Robert specifically says that Dunn is the only player he is townreading and that everyone else is null. This is an extremely scummy list of reads.<br>\n<br>\nAside from these scummy things, the only other thing Robert did Day One was apologize for his inactivity. He did not attempt to scumhunt in any way and did not offer defense towards his actions other than 'you might be scum'. Robert2424 is scum and should be lynched today.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, let's consider the actions of the playerbase as a whole at the end of Day 1 as they relate to robert. A brief summary: Scum-HA was wagoned and he claimed doctor prematurely. Players quickly unvoted but then town-ira counterclaimed him resulting in basically everyone re-voting HA. Wagon stalled briefly while people talked, but pretty much everyone agreed HA was scum. I gave intent to hammer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7884513#p7884513\">556</a>. Then Robert comes in with his lolclaim and we all wait around to figure stuff out before we lynch HA.<br>\n<br>\nThat's when I made a push to lynch Robert instead and wait to lynch HA D2. Now you would think that if Robert were in fact town, scum would jump on the opportunity to lynch him instead. Not even now-confirmed scum HA voted Robert. But literally only one person, Tyler, voted for Robert after I did. This scenario makes a lot more sense if Robert is scum.<br>\n<br>\nRobert2424 is scum and we should lynch him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: A Brief Grammar Lesson</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Robert2424 made a disparaging remark regarding my skills at writing in the English language. He could not be more incorrect in this accusation, particularly considering his own poor grammar. Let's take a look at that accusation. Exhibit A:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Jack. If your going to mention me in your posts. Please use proper grammar.</div></blockquote>\nThis is truly a statement without any sense of self-awareness. The first thing that jumps out is the incorrect use of 'your'. The correct word there would have been the contraction 'you're' or, alternatively, the full form, 'you are'. Continuing, this brief thought contains a clearly evident sentence fragment. The clause \"If you're going to mention me in your posts\" is a dependent clause, as it begins with the word 'if' which is a rather common subordinating conjunction. Any clause that begins with a subordinating conjunction must be accompanied with an independent clause, and can be separated from such clause with a comma. Robert's statement does have a candidate independent clause, specifically \"Please use proper grammar\", but he separates this from the aforementioned dependent clause with a period, not a comma. While I might have been willing to believe this was a mere typo and not a grammatical violation, when one considers that the independent clause began with a capital letter, it becomes apparent that this was no minor typing peccadillo.<br>\n<br>\nWhile I could continue with my critique of Robert's grammar, which has been consistently inadequate, for the sake of time, I will leave it at that</div></div></div>", "time": "Fri May 06, 2016 6:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

There's no way scum wouldn't have discussed HA's claim prior to him claiming, so the other scum on the team would have had some kind of plan. IMO, there were only two objectives scum could've had there: assuming HA would die and voting him immediately, or trying to use HA's claim to dismantle his wagon.<br>\n<br>\nSo if we get a scumflip on a player who bussed HA after he claimed doc, it would be logical to assume that the other scum player also bussed HA. And if we get a scumflip on a player who seemed like they were waiting to see how other people reacted, or who actively tried to dismantle the HA wagon, we would do well to look for another player that acted similarly.<br>\n<br>\nSpecifically, if Robert is scum, this suggests that the scum were trying to save HA with his doc claim, because why would Robert step in and claim macho townie if not to save HA? If that were the case, and we would only know for sure if we got a scumflip on Robert, then we would do well to hunt for the last scum within the pool of people who tried to argue that HA was town after the doc claim.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">On the Robert claim</div>, I'm less inclined to lynch him than I was toward the end of D1. Part of this has to do with rereading the last part of #596. I finally understand what he was saying. We were thinking about game balance in different ways, I think. I was thinking about how a mod would try to have roles <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">interact with each other</div>, while Robert was talking about weighing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">negatives against positives within the town</div>. While I think we disagree about how bad a macho townie is for town, I get the basic logic at least.<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, I also realized that it's weird to see fakeclaiming, gambiting scum not only coming up with the super weird fakeclaim of macho townie, but then having that explanation (from #596) for why they think a macho townie would be in the game. The structure of what he's writing doesn't really fit in with the kind of mindset that a scum partner would have to have in order to think that fakeclaiming under those circumstances was a good idea.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: The HA wagon</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Final lynch: Keyser, Floof, tool, Jake, Tyler, Jaack, Dunn<br>\n-Keyser: One of the first players to suspect HA, starting in #222. Votes HA in #297 after HA makes a case on Keyser. At this point, for them to be partners it would pretty much have to be a designed bus. That's possible, but I lean town on it just because I find it less likely than the explanation that they just aren't partners and because there wasn't really a reason to bus at that point -- neither was in any real danger of being lynched. Knowing that HA is scum actually makes it look like he was trying to take advantage of some of the early suspicion on Keyser (HA's #268 actually was him trying to put logic behind a post where Dunnstral said he suspected Keyser but didn't have any reasoning for it). Once HA claims, Keyser immediately doubts it, though it is worth pointing out that he didn't comment until after ira had counterclaimed. So if Keyser were scum, scum were definitely following the \"scum expected HA to die\" tactic.<br>\n-Floof: First mention of HA is a vote for him in #187, saying HA needed to post more. Later he doesn't answer my question about why he wanted HA to post more than any other player in the game. Points for Floof making one of the earlier non-RVS votes of HA in the game (first?), but the reasoning is weird enough it does make me wonder if it could be bussing. In #367, Floof says the original vote was just to prod activity out of HA, but now he's scumreading HA (at this point floof isn't voting anybody, and he doesn't explain the scumread on HA). Floof explains in #373 that he felt like HA was following wagons, and Floof votes HA. The timing of this is interesting because it's before HA's doc claim and floof said he was either going to vote ira or HA. Ira was the leading wagon (4 votes), but the HA wagon had just gained steam with two votes on HA on the same page (putting the HA wagon at 3 votes). So as a scumpartner, Floof went for a bus even when there was a viable alternative wagon in ira. Water down the townpoints on that for the fact that the HA wagon was the trend at the time and that floof's vote still only put HA at L-3 (not all that dangerous). <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Edit from later: Floof actually basically did the same thing that jaack did in choosing HA over ira, but he did it after jaack and dunnstral on the same page. Actually a little suspicious.</div> Floof's #486 and #631 are asking why people are moving off of HA (this is after HA's doc claim), so if floof is a partner to HA then he's in the \"scum expected HA to die\" camp.<br>\n-Jake: As far as I can tell, Jake's first real interaction with HA comes in #277 and it's a theory debate (up til this point Jake's been doing a lot of that because of disagreements over readslists and such). In #298 he says HA has made some good points and criticizes a vote on him. This strikes me as pretty brazen for scum, especially given that Jake had no real need to do it, and so I lean town on it. Another defense of HA in #337. Jake is also the first to really push HA's inconsistencies, which he does in #410. In fact that's what pushed me to look at HA further. Again, no need for scumpartnerJake to do this, especially since he was already townreading HA, and it led to HA's lynch. So I don't see Jake as a scumpartner. That being said, just to do due diligence, Jake's reaction to HA's claim was to unvote immediately, and then revote HA immediately once ira counterclaimed, then unvote and say that there have been games where both BGs and docs existed. So if Jake is alive in LyLo or something (which I don't expect him to be if he's town) then I think we could put him in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.<br>\n-Tyler: First interaction with HA is #301 and it's nothing very telling. It's kind of interesting, actually, that Tyler basically ignores HA until HA's claim. Tyler actually did not post for the two days leading up to the claim, and then he posted about 20 posts after HA claimed doc. He doesn't really weigh in until after ira's counterclaim, and it's in kinda vague language (\"doc and bodyguard both existing in a mini is kinda meh\"). In #505 he sets up floof as a possible lynch of HA flips scum. He does some theorizing on the competing claims (#523), but doesn't really take a stance until #540 when he says he's fine with an HA lynch. He hops onto the Robert wagon in #628 after initially pushing against it, and clarifies later that he would still support an HA lynch. A lot of this just kinda raises my hackles as scum avoidance of the subject and trying subtly not to lynch HA. The fact that he disappeared for two days and then came back right as HA claimed would lend support to the \"wait-and-see\" scumbuddy approach. If Tyler is scum, he's in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.<br>\n-Jaack: His very first post is a vote on HA in #5, and while this is very probably RVS, it does follow a Dunn vote. Maybe not super telling on its own but good to note I think. He puts HA as second-most-likely scum in a readslist in #357 and most of his reasons make sense. He actually votes HA over ira in the next post, and he explains it later by saying that his vote on ira wasn't doing anything. I lean non-partner on this. Very interesting reaction to HA's doc claim in #480, he is indeed the first person to point out that doc is a standard scumclaim and at the same time concedes that it'd be better to leave it be just in case HA is actually the doc. He later gives intent to hammer HA after ira's counterclaim, and then once Robert claims he pushes a kind of pragmatist's approach that favors lynching Robert before HA. I lean town on jaack based on the earlier interactions with HA (probably the biggest piece being him voting HA over ira), but if he is scum then he was in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.<br>\n-Dunnt: Don't really consider Dunn's vote of HA in #4 to be anything. In #129 he leaves HA off a readslist (one of 3 people he leaves off the list). He notes that HA isn't saying much in #162, but votes for Bins instead. Dunn defends HA against floof in #193. Dunn's response to HA in #285 is the kind of catty I don't really expect from scum partners (he calls HA dumb). He votes HA in #365, right after jaack but before floof. He unvotes HA immediately after the doc claim in #483, with the kicker that it \"Looks like we're all believing him\" -- very similar to jaack's reaction. He's back to HA after ira's counterclaim, and then in #519 suggests that maybe the daytalk is a way of compensating for town having two protective roles. He revotes HA in #553, unvotes HA after Robert's claim and says in #630 that all three could be town. He actually kinda wobbles back and forth on this a bit, saying he still thinks HA is scummy and ira is towny but maybe Robert is telling the truth and they're all town. He says he keeps thinking HA might be town, but then declares intent to hammer and does hammer HA (after zach declares intent to hammer, but earlier than dunn). Up until the HA claim, Dunn looked pretty much not like a partner. But the weirdness around the doc claim opens up the door again imo. Needless to say, if Dunn is a partner then he's in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Robert's claim</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Robert's claim was in #563.

There's no way scum wouldn't have discussed HA's claim prior to him claiming, so the other scum on the team would have had some kind of plan. IMO, there were only two objectives scum could've had there: assuming HA would die and voting him immediately, or trying to use HA's claim to dismantle his wagon.<br>\n<br>\nSo if we get a scumflip on a player who bussed HA after he claimed doc, it would be logical to assume that the other scum player also bussed HA. And if we get a scumflip on a player who seemed like they were waiting to see how other people reacted, or who actively tried to dismantle the HA wagon, we would do well to look for another player that acted similarly.<br>\n<br>\nSpecifically, if Robert is scum, this suggests that the scum were trying to save HA with his doc claim, because why would Robert step in and claim macho townie if not to save HA? If that were the case, and we would only know for sure if we got a scumflip on Robert, then we would do well to hunt for the last scum within the pool of people who tried to argue that HA was town after the doc claim.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">On the Robert claim</div>, I'm less inclined to lynch him than I was toward the end of D1. Part of this has to do with rereading the last part of #596. I finally understand what he was saying. We were thinking about game balance in different ways, I think. I was thinking about how a mod would try to have roles <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">interact with each other</div>, while Robert was talking about weighing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">negatives against positives within the town</div>. While I think we disagree about how bad a macho townie is for town, I get the basic logic at least.<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, I also realized that it's weird to see fakeclaiming, gambiting scum not only coming up with the super weird fakeclaim of macho townie, but then having that explanation (from #596) for why they think a macho townie would be in the game. The structure of what he's writing doesn't really fit in with the kind of mindset that a scum partner would have to have in order to think that fakeclaiming under those circumstances was a good idea.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: The HA wagon</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Final lynch: Keyser, Floof, tool, Jake, Tyler, Jaack, Dunn<br>\n-Keyser: One of the first players to suspect HA, starting in #222. Votes HA in #297 after HA makes a case on Keyser. At this point, for them to be partners it would pretty much have to be a designed bus. That's possible, but I lean town on it just because I find it less likely than the explanation that they just aren't partners and because there wasn't really a reason to bus at that point -- neither was in any real danger of being lynched. Knowing that HA is scum actually makes it look like he was trying to take advantage of some of the early suspicion on Keyser (HA's #268 actually was him trying to put logic behind a post where Dunnstral said he suspected Keyser but didn't have any reasoning for it). Once HA claims, Keyser immediately doubts it, though it is worth pointing out that he didn't comment until after ira had counterclaimed. So if Keyser were scum, scum were definitely following the \"scum expected HA to die\" tactic.<br>\n-Floof: First mention of HA is a vote for him in #187, saying HA needed to post more. Later he doesn't answer my question about why he wanted HA to post more than any other player in the game. Points for Floof making one of the earlier non-RVS votes of HA in the game (first?), but the reasoning is weird enough it does make me wonder if it could be bussing. In #367, Floof says the original vote was just to prod activity out of HA, but now he's scumreading HA (at this point floof isn't voting anybody, and he doesn't explain the scumread on HA). Floof explains in #373 that he felt like HA was following wagons, and Floof votes HA.

I see him more then anybody in the game. I feel he's trying to keep a lvl head on some issues, and I think 60% he's town. I say in % as, while he posts allot, spamming dosn't instantly mean townie. but I've seen some really good posts from him, and some questionable. But I'm comfortable for now with him. <br>\n<br>\nJake from State Farm: Ups and downs, your posts are ussally with good Content. I feel you could go either way, but at this point, slighly more likely to be town. You've also been able to make me laugh. <br>\n<br>\nZach: I honestly question him when I read his posts, I feel also some of his posts are complete spam for the sake of posting, instead of adding something useful to the conversation. I could see him flipping either way. <br>\n<br>\nZakk: for being new, i find his posts.....anoying, mainly spam, and unhelpful. I feel he's going to cause allot of confusion, and do it on purpose. Obvously, I don't like how he's been posting up to this point, and I feel, if I was going to describe his behavior, Childlike maybe? That isn't a word I like when describing somebody in mafia. <br>\n<br>\nJaack: Well, besides him thinking no way in hell I'm townie? If was going to put those posts aside, (as they are just filled with absolute hate), I don't find him a major contributor, and feel he could go either way. He's annoying if we are going to include his hate posts. <br>\n<br>\nTyler: I honestly get mixed feelings allot with his posts, witch for the most part are short but to the point. I would describe him as stern, short poster, who I question some of his wording as if maybe he's trying to insult some people sometimes. ( Just Saying ). <br>\n<br>\ntool: don't see him very often, but is contributing. My read is uncertain but could go either way. <br>\n<br>\nBins: I have off and on Feelings, I don't have anything solid, but I'm leaning more likely to be scum currently. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7900716#p7900716\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7900716#p7900716\" data-post-id=\"7900716\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 704</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22459\">zakk</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7900586#p7900586\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7900586#p7900586\" data-post-id=\"7900586\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 698</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7030\">xyzzy</a> wrote:</cite>it was moderately confusing before having a Zach and a Jaack and a Jake; now we have a Zakk, too.</div></blockquote>\nI'm Zaack from State Farm, get it right pls thx</div></blockquote>\n\nPosts like this are unhelpful and unnecessary. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7900929#p7900929\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7900929#p7900929\" data-post-id=\"7900929\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 712</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26257\">Jaack</a> wrote:</cite>Why Robert2424 is a scum and all of you need to vote for him: A Brief Essay<br>\n<br>\nRobert2424 is a scum and should be lynched, preferably on Day 2. He has done many scummy things so far in this game. First of all, he has a insanely scummy claim. He softclaims his role <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7885283#p7885283\">563</a>, calling it a weak townie. He later repeatedly refers to himself as such, despite such a role neither making sense nor matching the description he gives as to what his role does. It is not until a number of players point out his mistake that he 'checks his PM' and confirms that he is actually macho. He does this in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887674#p7887674\">603</a> after affirming that his PM said weak in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887288#p7887288\">596</a>. However, even if we were to explain away this as an honest mistake, his claim is still terrible. The Macho modifier, while theoretically conceivable on an otherwise vanilla role, is virtually always seen on something with a night action, generally a powerful one, so as to balance it. While this role claim may have been believable when there were two claimed protective roles, with heuristically_alone flipping scum, it eliminates that possibility. A sole bodyguard is already a weak protective role and does not really need to be weakened further with the addition of a random VT that can not be protected. Overall his claim makes no sense.<br>\n<br>\nSome of you may be wondering \"Why would Robert make such a bad claim?\" This is a reasonable response, but there is an equally reasonable answer. Robert was attempting to save his scumbuddy, heuristically_alone, who at the point of his claim, was the inevitable lynch target. He attempts to use his role to 'explain' how there could be two protective roles in the game. While this attempt clearly failed to save HA, it did result in more than one person considering the possibility that both he and iraonavp were telling the truth. While this gambit may seem like a bad idea, it does not make it impossible. Furthermore, his claim no more sense than the hypothetical gambit. When something makes this little sense, the best option is probably to lynch it and get an explanation.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are still not convinced of Robert's guilt, I offer further evidence of it. In Day 1, when I, along with other players, pointed out the issues with his claim, he attempted to shift blame to our benevolent mod, as seen in posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7885283#p7885283\">563</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887288#p7887288\">596</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887674#p7887674\">603</a>. In addition, when I attempted to start a wagon on him, instead of responding to my accusations he attempted to discredit me, both by not-very-subtly pointing out that I could be scum (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7887288#p7887288\">596</a>) and by later deriding my clearly superior grammar <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7893063#p7893063\">671</a>. (For more on this, see the spoiler below.) Robert has clearly avoided my accusations, instead choosing to post meaningless trifles. I am not the only player that Robert does this with, as he makes a similar micro-accusation towards Tyler in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7885283#p7885283\">563</a>.<br>\n<br>\nWhile you can surely see Robert's guilt at this point, for the sake of posterity, I will continue with my analysis of his extreme scumminess. His first two posts in this game (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7862717#p7862717\">12</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7866824#p7866824\">134</a>) are both fluffy votes discussions of his history with Jake from State Farm, with Robert going as far to say that he is suspicious of Jake due to their previous history. While the first such post may be explained away as being RVS, the second one essentially repeats his previous statement, despite the fact that there had been significant discussion of the first post as being possibly scummy. While fluff in the early game is somewhat acceptable, the fact that Robert has very little content to begin with makes the high percentage of fluff notable.<br>\n<br>\nContinuing, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7873773#p7873773\">331</a> Robert offers some brief reads on players in the game. He states that he has scumreads on four players: Ira, Zach, HA, and Jake. With the exception of Jake, these were the most widely held scumreads at the time. His read on HA is particularly notable as he only 'barely nudges' his way onto his scum list. Now it may seem understandable to view widely scumread players as scummy -- they wouldn't be widely scumread if they were not. But we must also take a look at his townreads, or should I say read. Robert specifically says that Dunn is the only player he is townreading and that everyone else is null. This is an extremely scummy list of reads.<br>\n<br>\nAside from these scummy things, the only other thing Robert did Day One was apologize for his inactivity. He did not attempt to scumhunt in any way and did not offer defense towards his actions other than 'you might be scum'. Robert2424 is scum and should be lynched today.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, let's consider the actions of the playerbase as a whole at the end of Day 1 as they relate to robert. A brief summary: Scum-HA was wagoned and he claimed doctor prematurely. Players quickly unvoted but then town-ira counterclaimed him resulting in basically everyone re-voting HA. Wagon stalled briefly while people talked, but pretty much everyone agreed HA was scum. I gave intent to hammer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7884513#p7884513\">556</a>. Then Robert comes in with his lolclaim and we all wait around to figure stuff out before we lynch HA.<br>\n<br>\nThat's when I made a push to lynch Robert instead and wait to lynch HA D2. Now you would think that if Robert were in fact town, scum would jump on the opportunity to lynch him instead. Not even now-confirmed scum HA voted Robert. But literally only one person, Tyler, voted for Robert after I did. This scenario makes a lot more sense if Robert is scum.<br>\n<br>\nRobert2424 is scum and we should lynch him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: A Brief Grammar Lesson</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Robert2424 made a disparaging remark regarding my skills at writing in the English language. He could not be more incorrect in this accusation, particularly considering his own poor grammar. Let's take a look at that accusation. Exhibit A:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Jack. If your going to mention me in your posts. Please use proper grammar.</div></blockquote>\nThis is truly a statement without any sense of self-awareness. The first thing that jumps out is the incorrect use of 'your'. The correct word there would have been the contraction 'you're' or, alternatively, the full form, 'you are'. Continuing, this brief thought contains a clearly evident sentence fragment. The clause \"If you're going to mention me in your posts\" is a dependent clause, as it begins with the word 'if' which is a rather common subordinating conjunction. Any clause that begins with a subordinating conjunction must be accompanied with an independent clause, and can be separated from such clause with a comma. Robert's statement does have a candidate independent clause, specifically \"Please use proper grammar\", but he separates this from the aforementioned dependent clause with a period, not a comma. While I might have been willing to believe this was a mere typo and not a grammatical violation, when one considers that the independent clause began with a capital letter, it becomes apparent that this was no minor typing peccadillo.<br>\n<br>\nWhile I could continue with my critique of Robert's grammar, which has been consistently inadequate, for the sake of time, I will leave it at that</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\nI honestly, shouldn't respond to this, but I wouldn't following your reason to lynch anybody. Its like your only objective suddenly is to lynch me any way possible. and you laugh when I turned up scum. <br>\n<br>\nbtw, I posted my last post thinking the day litterally started.

{"number": 827, "id": "7904822", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "HA's interactions with...<br>\n<br>\nDunnstral:<br>\n<br>\n-#268 is HA providing reasons to Dunn for why Keyser might be scum. It seems a little more coordinated than I would expect from two partners...possible, but I lean town.<br>\n-The second half of the post is....a little harder to tell. HA is clearly buddying up to Dunn. My first thought rereading this is that HA was trying to drop associatives with Dunn so that if he flipped we would come back and think townDunn was HA's partner. And then it veered immediately into WIFOM territory from there when I realized it could also be HA trying to look too buddy-buddy with his partner for people to ever think they were scumpartners. I'd tend to believe the former (that HA was buddying up to townDunn) over the latter, just based on the different levels of insidiousness and foresight necessarily involved in each scenario.<br>\n<br>\nRobert:<br>\n<br>\n-Says Robert's been inactive and he doesn't have a read on him in #281, but leaves open a door to possibly scumread Robert later. This one could go either way in terms of looking partner-y.<br>\n-Suddenly has Robert as a top-two scumread in #392.<br>\n-Ah right, and then Jake points out the weirdness about HA's flipflop on Robert, which is that before #392, HA was talking about Robert like he was town and using that to justify another read (on jaack I believe).<br>\n-And then in #434 HA talks about mixing up Robert and Zach re: which person he'd asked if they were scum. He says he mixed up games, but bottom line is HA invented reasons to scumread Robert. That suggests HA is not partners with Robert imo. The whole arc looks a lot more like HA being opportunistic scum than it looks like bussing scum.<br>\n<br>\nBins:<br>\n<br>\n-HA's take in #281 on Bins' #38 is pretty weird. It's like he's saying that regardless of whether Bins looks towny or scummy, she will be scum. Lean not partner on this.<br>\n<br>\nZachstralkita:<br>\n<br>\n-#265 seems pretty ballsy for a partner-on-partner interaction. I think I'd actually have to give kudos to HA on this one if he's partners with Zach because this just does not seem like a partnery interaction at all.<br>\n-HA's reasoning for keeping his vote on Zach in #281 feels forced.<br>\n-Yeah he just clearly is trying to come up with reasons to keep his vote on Zach. Feels like HA was treating Zach as a safe haven for his suspicions. Def does not look like partners to me.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser:<br>\n<br>\n-Again, #268 doesn't seem like HA talking about a scum partner to me. A player brings up that they can't justify a scumread on HA's partner and HA volunteers reasoning for why his partner is scum?<br>\n-In #394 HA puts Keyser in his top three for scum for a dumb reason. Reminds me a little of how it looked like he was reaching for reasons to scumread Zach actually.<br>\n<br>\nxyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-Only three mentions of xyzzy in HA's ISO, and two of them are when he's using xyzzy to explain his townread on Dunn.<br>\n-The third is in his readslist in #281, and it's an underdeveloped townread on xyzzy.<br>\n-This is maybe partner material.<br>\n<br>\nfloof:<br>\n<br>\n-And an underdeveloped scumread on floof in that same readslist (#281).<br>\n-Literally no other comments on floof throughout the game.<br>\n-Also maybe partner material.<br>\n<br>\nTyler:<br>\n<br>\n-Only real mention of Tyler is in the #281 readslist, and it's a townread...despite the fact that he first points out that he doesn't understand why tyler posted his first post. The townread is for having similar thoughts about the game.<br>\n-Also maybe partner material.<br>\n<br>\nJaack:<br>\n<br>\n-By far the weirdest thing here is HA at first treating Jaack like he's town by looking for scum going after Jaack (#281), then later reversing (#329) and talking about how scum would be more likely to go after Robert's vote (like Jaack did). That's basically the bulk of his interactions with Jaack actually. It seems almost like HA slipped that he wasn't Jaack's partner by first treating Jaack like he was town. Part of that theory has to do with how HA responds to Jake in #422, by repeating what he said in #329 even though it didn't make sense. It's like he was trying to cover up a mistake he'd made, the mistake being that he had forgotten to leave room for the possibility that Jaack was scum.<br>\n<br>\nJake:<br>\n<br>\n-Gives a somewhat confusing reason for townreading Jake in #281.

While I think we disagree about how bad a macho townie is for town, I get the basic logic at least.<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, I also realized that it's weird to see fakeclaiming, gambiting scum not only coming up with the super weird fakeclaim of macho townie, but then having that explanation (from #596) for why they think a macho townie would be in the game. The structure of what he's writing doesn't really fit in with the kind of mindset that a scum partner would have to have in order to think that fakeclaiming under those circumstances was a good idea.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: The HA wagon</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Final lynch: Keyser, Floof, tool, Jake, Tyler, Jaack, Dunn<br>\n-Keyser: One of the first players to suspect HA, starting in #222. Votes HA in #297 after HA makes a case on Keyser. At this point, for them to be partners it would pretty much have to be a designed bus. That's possible, but I lean town on it just because I find it less likely than the explanation that they just aren't partners and because there wasn't really a reason to bus at that point -- neither was in any real danger of being lynched. Knowing that HA is scum actually makes it look like he was trying to take advantage of some of the early suspicion on Keyser (HA's #268 actually was him trying to put logic behind a post where Dunnstral said he suspected Keyser but didn't have any reasoning for it). Once HA claims, Keyser immediately doubts it, though it is worth pointing out that he didn't comment until after ira had counterclaimed. So if Keyser were scum, scum were definitely following the \"scum expected HA to die\" tactic.<br>\n-Floof: First mention of HA is a vote for him in #187, saying HA needed to post more. Later he doesn't answer my question about why he wanted HA to post more than any other player in the game. Points for Floof making one of the earlier non-RVS votes of HA in the game (first?), but the reasoning is weird enough it does make me wonder if it could be bussing. In #367, Floof says the original vote was just to prod activity out of HA, but now he's scumreading HA (at this point floof isn't voting anybody, and he doesn't explain the scumread on HA). Floof explains in #373 that he felt like HA was following wagons, and Floof votes HA. The timing of this is interesting because it's before HA's doc claim and floof said he was either going to vote ira or HA. Ira was the leading wagon (4 votes), but the HA wagon had just gained steam with two votes on HA on the same page (putting the HA wagon at 3 votes). So as a scumpartner, Floof went for a bus even when there was a viable alternative wagon in ira. Water down the townpoints on that for the fact that the HA wagon was the trend at the time and that floof's vote still only put HA at L-3 (not all that dangerous). <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Edit from later: Floof actually basically did the same thing that jaack did in choosing HA over ira, but he did it after jaack and dunnstral on the same page. Actually a little suspicious.</div> Floof's #486 and #631 are asking why people are moving off of HA (this is after HA's doc claim), so if floof is a partner to HA then he's in the \"scum expected HA to die\" camp.<br>\n-Jake: As far as I can tell, Jake's first real interaction with HA comes in #277 and it's a theory debate (up til this point Jake's been doing a lot of that because of disagreements over readslists and such). In #298 he says HA has made some good points and criticizes a vote on him. This strikes me as pretty brazen for scum, especially given that Jake had no real need to do it, and so I lean town on it. Another defense of HA in #337. Jake is also the first to really push HA's inconsistencies, which he does in #410. In fact that's what pushed me to look at HA further. Again, no need for scumpartnerJake to do this, especially since he was already townreading HA, and it led to HA's lynch. So I don't see Jake as a scumpartner. That being said, just to do due diligence, Jake's reaction to HA's claim was to unvote immediately, and then revote HA immediately once ira counterclaimed, then unvote and say that there have been games where both BGs and docs existed. So if Jake is alive in LyLo or something (which I don't expect him to be if he's town) then I think we could put him in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.<br>\n-Tyler: First interaction with HA is #301 and it's nothing very telling. It's kind of interesting, actually, that Tyler basically ignores HA until HA's claim. Tyler actually did not post for the two days leading up to the claim, and then he posted about 20 posts after HA claimed doc. He doesn't really weigh in until after ira's counterclaim, and it's in kinda vague language (\"doc and bodyguard both existing in a mini is kinda meh\"). In #505 he sets up floof as a possible lynch of HA flips scum. He does some theorizing on the competing claims (#523), but doesn't really take a stance until #540 when he says he's fine with an HA lynch. He hops onto the Robert wagon in #628 after initially pushing against it, and clarifies later that he would still support an HA lynch. A lot of this just kinda raises my hackles as scum avoidance of the subject and trying subtly not to lynch HA. The fact that he disappeared for two days and then came back right as HA claimed would lend support to the \"wait-and-see\" scumbuddy approach. If Tyler is scum, he's in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.<br>\n-Jaack: His very first post is a vote on HA in #5, and while this is very probably RVS, it does follow a Dunn vote. Maybe not super telling on its own but good to note I think. He puts HA as second-most-likely scum in a readslist in #357 and most of his reasons make sense. He actually votes HA over ira in the next post, and he explains it later by saying that his vote on ira wasn't doing anything. I lean non-partner on this. Very interesting reaction to HA's doc claim in #480, he is indeed the first person to point out that doc is a standard scumclaim and at the same time concedes that it'd be better to leave it be just in case HA is actually the doc. He later gives intent to hammer HA after ira's counterclaim, and then once Robert claims he pushes a kind of pragmatist's approach that favors lynching Robert before HA. I lean town on jaack based on the earlier interactions with HA (probably the biggest piece being him voting HA over ira), but if he is scum then he was in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.<br>\n-Dunnt: Don't really consider Dunn's vote of HA in #4 to be anything. In #129 he leaves HA off a readslist (one of 3 people he leaves off the list). He notes that HA isn't saying much in #162, but votes for Bins instead. Dunn defends HA against floof in #193. Dunn's response to HA in #285 is the kind of catty I don't really expect from scum partners (he calls HA dumb). He votes HA in #365, right after jaack but before floof. He unvotes HA immediately after the doc claim in #483, with the kicker that it \"Looks like we're all believing him\" -- very similar to jaack's reaction. He's back to HA after ira's counterclaim, and then in #519 suggests that maybe the daytalk is a way of compensating for town having two protective roles. He revotes HA in #553, unvotes HA after Robert's claim and says in #630 that all three could be town. He actually kinda wobbles back and forth on this a bit, saying he still thinks HA is scummy and ira is towny but maybe Robert is telling the truth and they're all town. He says he keeps thinking HA might be town, but then declares intent to hammer and does hammer HA (after zach declares intent to hammer, but earlier than dunn). Up until the HA claim, Dunn looked pretty much not like a partner. But the weirdness around the doc claim opens up the door again imo. Needless to say, if Dunn is a partner then he's in the \"scum were trying to save HA\" camp.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Robert's claim</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Robert's claim was in #563.

HA is clearly buddying up to Dunn. My first thought rereading this is that HA was trying to drop associatives with Dunn so that if he flipped we would come back and think townDunn was HA's partner. And then it veered immediately into WIFOM territory from there when I realized it could also be HA trying to look too buddy-buddy with his partner for people to ever think they were scumpartners. I'd tend to believe the former (that HA was buddying up to townDunn) over the latter, just based on the different levels of insidiousness and foresight necessarily involved in each scenario.<br>\n<br>\nRobert:<br>\n<br>\n-Says Robert's been inactive and he doesn't have a read on him in #281, but leaves open a door to possibly scumread Robert later. This one could go either way in terms of looking partner-y.<br>\n-Suddenly has Robert as a top-two scumread in #392.<br>\n-Ah right, and then Jake points out the weirdness about HA's flipflop on Robert, which is that before #392, HA was talking about Robert like he was town and using that to justify another read (on jaack I believe).<br>\n-And then in #434 HA talks about mixing up Robert and Zach re: which person he'd asked if they were scum. He says he mixed up games, but bottom line is HA invented reasons to scumread Robert. That suggests HA is not partners with Robert imo. The whole arc looks a lot more like HA being opportunistic scum than it looks like bussing scum.<br>\n<br>\nBins:<br>\n<br>\n-HA's take in #281 on Bins' #38 is pretty weird. It's like he's saying that regardless of whether Bins looks towny or scummy, she will be scum.

I think I'd actually have to give kudos to HA on this one if he's partners with Zach because this just does not seem like a partnery interaction at all.<br>\n-HA's reasoning for keeping his vote on Zach in #281 feels forced.<br>\n-Yeah he just clearly is trying to come up with reasons to keep his vote on Zach. Feels like HA was treating Zach as a safe haven for his suspicions. Def does not look like partners to me.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser:<br>\n<br>\n-Again, #268 doesn't seem like HA talking about a scum partner to me. A player brings up that they can't justify a scumread on HA's partner and HA volunteers reasoning for why his partner is scum?<br>\n-In #394 HA puts Keyser in his top three for scum for a dumb reason. Reminds me a little of how it looked like he was reaching for reasons to scumread Zach actually.<br>\n<br>\nxyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-Only three mentions of xyzzy in HA's ISO, and two of them are when he's using xyzzy to explain his townread on Dunn.<br>\n-The third is in his readslist in #281, and it's an underdeveloped townread on xyzzy.<br>\n-This is maybe partner material.<br>\n<br>\nfloof:<br>\n<br>\n-And an underdeveloped scumread on floof in that same readslist (#281).<br>\n-Literally no other comments on floof throughout the game.<br>\n-Also maybe partner material.<br>\n<br>\nTyler:<br>\n<br>\n-Only real mention of Tyler is in the #281 readslist, and it's a townread...despite the fact that he first points out that he doesn't understand why tyler posted his first post. The townread is for having similar thoughts about the game.<br>\n-Also maybe partner material.<br>\n<br>\nJaack:<br>\n<br>\n-By far the weirdest thing here is HA at first treating Jaack like he's town by looking for scum going after Jaack (#281), then later reversing (#329) and talking about how scum would be more likely to go after Robert's vote (like Jaack did). That's basically the bulk of his interactions with Jaack actually. It seems almost like HA slipped that he wasn't Jaack's partner by first treating Jaack like he was town. Part of that theory has to do with how HA responds to Jake in #422, by repeating what he said in #329 even though it didn't make sense. It's like he was trying to cover up a mistake he'd made, the mistake being that he had forgotten to leave room for the possibility that Jaack was scum.<br>\n<br>\nJake:<br>\n<br>\n-Gives a somewhat confusing reason for townreading Jake in #281. Other than that, not really a whole lot of any thoughts on Jake.

{"number": 1214, "id": "7918206", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "Aight. So. A while ago Tyler asked me what order my scumreads were in, and all I said was that he was third behind xyzzy and zakk.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason I did this was because my vote on xyzzy was purely for the purpose of starting a counterwagon, and I didn't want that to influence people's interactions with the wagon. It occurred to me that D2 had been pretty focused on zakk, and I liked the idea of setting up a choice for scum to make between voting xyzzy and voting zakk. Depending on flips, the choices people made could be useful later on.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I did not expect a sort of mini-wagon on Dunn to get going amid all of it...<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, while I was giving people time to interact with the wagons I decided to go through the ISOs of my top three scumreads, ignoring the interactions with HA (which I've already covered) so I can focus on other parts of their play. Here's that:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: xyzzy</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-The three posts from #34-#42 are potentially scummy, and people noted it at the time. Xyzzy goes after Dunn in a kind of provocative way, only to keep their vote on Jaack and not really come to a conclusion on Dunn. Xyzzy's explanation in #59 is that the game is still early and they're going to wait to see what Dunn does later in the day. Just seems like it could be scum searching for a good first wagon to build momentum on without wanting to be too central in the push.<br>\n-I didn't notice this before, but in #89 (xyzzy's first post-by-post analysis), they talk about at least two of their own posts...a little bizarre, since I would think the point of a post-by-post analysis would be to scumhunt. Adding in a post from themself just seems like filler.<br>\n-I noted before that xyzzy's vote on zachstral in #89 was an \"easy\" vote to make. In #158, xyzzy responds to my point by saying that it's partially just a vote to get Zachstral to talk. The problem with that is that Zachstral had actually been posting quite a bit relative to other players at that point, while floof had only posted once and HA hadn't posted at all.<br>\n-The approach to Jake in #174 also bugs me a bit. Jake had naked voted Zachstral, and xyzzy responded by asking Jake about his reasons -- normally might come across as town to me, but xyzzy specified that they were fine with votes on Zachstral. Seems like trying to come across as suspicious while simultaneously trying to keep Jake's vote on Zachstral.<br>\n-#286 only adds to that weirdness, because xyzzy says Jake is scum and then says they're going to keep their vote on Zachstral. No mention of the fact that Jake was voting Zachstral, nor the implications for Zachstral's alignment if Jake -- who was voting Zachstral -- was scum.<br>\n-Xyzzy agrees with a point from HA that I thought did not make a whole lot of sense in #393.<br>\n-The turnaround on HA #447, #561 and #566 does seem kind of...opportunistic, for lack of a better word. It's just that xyzzy didn't pay a ton of attention to HA up until that point, and actually had kept their vote on Zachstral for most of the game. Then when HA gets close to being lynched, Xyzzy reassesses and gets on board with an HA lynch.<br>\n-Should be noted that xyzzy comes out against a Robert lynch in #652. If nothing else this tells us that if Xyzzy is scum, scum expected HA to die from the doc claim.<br>\n-In #852, xyzzy defends the all-D1 Zachstral vote by saying it seemed more productive than a Jake vote. This doesn't really make a ton of sense to me; I don't remember much of any pressure on Zachstral yesterday.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOverall xyzzy looks worse than I thought. The interactions with HA (from both perspectives) are not good, the posting and voting arcs are a little confusing and possibly event contradictory, and there's a general air of trying not to open themselves up too much.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Floof/zakk</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-In #366, Floof unvotes Jaack (she actually got this wrong; she was voting HA at the time and not Jaack) and doesn't revote.<br>\n-In #367, she says she is still scumreading HA but doesn't vote. Floof says in #369 that she's waiting to vote, but doesn't say what she's waiting for. Floof votes HA in #373. This was on the same page -- and within a span of about six hours -- as Jaack and Dunn both voted HA. Less than two hours pass between the time Floof says she is going to wait to vote and the time that she votes, and the only posts during that time were insignificant posts from Jake and Dunn. Floof's vote on HA comes as she's explaining her HA scumread to Dunn. This is all pretty weird. What was floof waiting for, and what about it justified her waiting? Why did she then decide not to wait? I am actually wondering if there might have been something going on in scum's daychat that Floof was waiting for, perhaps asking HA about the possibility of bussing or something like that. A more grounded explanation would be that Floof was simply looking around for voting options and decided that HA looked the scummiest (which could explain the behavior regardless of Floof's alignment honestly).<br>\n-There's not much else worth commenting on in this ISO that I didn't already cover when I was looking for interactions with HA.<br>\n-As zakk, ignoring the posts he made before getting the role pm. In #1013, zakk's catchup post, he sees halfway through that Zulfy announced scum have day talk and he says that maybe scum were coordinating about him posting before he had a role PM. Lean town on this just because it strikes me as a thought process that could be a little hard to reach as scum. As in, \"Zulfy says scum have day talk\" -&gt; \"Oh, as town I wouldn't have known that scum had day talk before I saw that post\" -&gt; \"As town, I would think that scum would use day talk to coordinate and attack me on my role PM mishap.\"<br>\n-BUT zakk also votes Jaack in that post despite only having read the first four pages of the game. This is a red flag for me. It signals that he is trying to avoid suspicion by looking like he's scumhunting and using his vote, as opposed to genuinely trying to figure out who's scum. It's also something I saw AP do the last time I played with him (Circus Mafia, AP was scum). It was pretty much the only scummy thing I thought AP did in that game until Zulfy got a pseudo-guilty on AP.<br>\n-The reasoning in #1017 kind of backs up that idea of scumZakk being overeager to look like he's scumhunting. The reasoning here for Dunn is kind of shallow (Dunn is perhaps a little prone to making lynchbait-type posts) and therefore it looks like Zakk is just looking for the first scummy stuff he can find to pick on.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThis slot still looks super scummy, and I don't like zakk trying to get a Dunn wagon going either.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Tyler</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-So not only does Tyler vote xyzzy first (non-RVS) in #46, but then he goes on to argue against possible counterwagons in Jaack and Robert in #54 and #61. Which is to say that, while I find the Tyler-HA interactions to be suspicious, he has now consistently gone after both xyzzy and zakk, who I've both found scummier than him anyway, and he bussed HA on top of it. Double bussing is much tougher for me to buy than single bussing.<br>\n-Meanwhile, the hopping from xyzzy to ira in #108/109 feels kinda towny to me just based on experience...that is, I've seen town take this approach to scumhunting before, where you kind of just prod the first person who looks scummy to you to get out of RVS, then they do something mildly towny and you're off to the next person to pressure them. It's one of those things that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can</div> look scummy, and therefore I give minor townpoints to Tyler for doing it anyway because it suggests a genuine scumhunting mindset.<br>\n-#536 should be noted I think for flip purposes. Tyler, after setting up floof as a possible lynch if HA flips scum, suddenly finds a post from floof he likes. If Tyler were scum and floof was town, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense for Tyler to set up a mislynch and then immediately go back and water it down.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nProbably the biggest thing here is that Tyler's voted for HA, floof/zakk and xyzzy. That is tough for me to reconcile with him being scum.

No one else had any significant wagon unless I'm forgetting something. This kind of leads me to believe that there was at least one scum off the wagon. The only three living players that meet this criteria are Tyler, Bins, and Keyser/Creature (who I now have an opportunity to welcome). I had a scum read on bins and still think she's a viable scum. Tyler I've been hard townreading most of this game, but that's a bit shaken now, mainly due to his aborting the wagon when it was at its weakest point (when zakk requested replacement). Looking back to D1, he was also the only person who went along with my plan to lynch Robert over now confscum HA. He did, however, give intent to lynch desmond at the end, although that was after desmond did stupid confusing things. Keyser was basically absent D2, so I don't think it's particular worthwhile to consider he actions regarding the mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the people on the lynch:<br>\n<br>\nI'm pretty sure that Jake is town. I don't think that scum would have been so against a particular lynch all day only to hammer when someone else (Tyler) had already given intent. I mean, I already thought that Jake was town, but this sort of mentally confirms it.<br>\n<br>\nI know I'm town.<br>\n<br>\nRobert expressed interesting in hammering zakk after he (zakk) requested replacement. Jumped on the wagon after Tyler moved over to xyzzy. He hadn't really been scumreading zakk prior to zakk's replacement request. Overall: still have hangups about this slot.<br>\n<br>\nThere is no funniness involving tool's vote on zakk, at least none that I see. Town<br>\n<br>\nxyzzy is still probably scum. Parks a vote on zakk fairly early on, but never really said all that much on any of the residents of that slot.<br>\n<br>\nDunn's strong lust for the f/z/d lynch for virtually all of D2 makes me pretty comfortable that he's town. I don't feel that scum under reasonable suspicion would push so hard on a weak slot's lynch.<br>\n<br>\nSo that leaves tool/jake/dunn as town<br>\nMixed on Bins/Tyler/Creature/Robert<br>\nXyzzy still probably scum<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xyzzy</span>", "time": "Thu May 19, 2016 12:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=1600", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Tyler I've been hard townreading most of this game, but that's a bit shaken now, mainly due to his aborting the wagon when it was at its weakest point (when zakk requested replacement). Looking back to D1, he was also the only person who went along with my plan to lynch Robert over now confscum HA.

Tyler I've been hard townreading most of this game, but that's a bit shaken now, mainly due to his aborting the wagon when it was at its weakest point (when zakk requested replacement). Looking back to D1, he was also the only person who went along with my plan to lynch Robert over now confscum HA.

Jake claims with two innocents. We have 3/9 confirmed townies and have 2 mislynches to work with. That's a pretty good situation.<br>\n2. Jake doesn't claim, and gets nightkilled. His inno on Robert would have been obvious, and his likely about face on his read on you would make that inno also obvious. This is the worst case scenario and we still go into D4 with two confirmed innos. Neither of you would have been lynched, because Jake would have claimed if either of you got close. This is a slightly less good situation than no. 1, but still pretty good.<br>\n3. Jake doesn't claim and either you or Robert get NKed. Jake gets one more inspection, and we either have 3/7 confirmed town, or 2 confirmed town and a confirmed scum. This scenario is what you would have been trying to accomplish if you were actually telling the truth about your gambit.<br>\n4. Jake doesn't claim and all his clears make it to D4. That would be 4/7 confirmed town, which is an insta-win, or 3/7 confirmed town with 1 confirmed scum, which is also an insta-win.<br>\n<br>\nYou're hypothetical gambit may have made scenario 3 more likely but it decreased the chance at scenario 4, the best case scenario.

And how low-activity he was too. That does go against what I remember of his town game, and Creature's entrance today fits scum very well. I am thinking atm that if Creature flips scum then Jaack would be less likely to be partner -- in which case I think I'd be looking at xyzzy based on PoE.<br>\n<br>\n(that's because of the scum-acting-together idea I had wrt to HA's claim -- Keyserslot voted HA without hesitation after HA's claim and didn't go for Robert, whereas Tyler did go for Robert. Ergo, Creature/Tyler is not as likely a scumteam as Creature/Xyzzy)<br>\n<br>\nAnd somebody (think it was tyler) made a good point about Jaack's ballsiness throughout the game. He's gone for basically everything it would be convenient for scum to go for -- Robert after he made one bad post to open the game, Robert again when he messed up his macho claim, Dunn when he gambited. It seems a little brazen for scum, and while I can see scum doing it...well, it goes back to what I talked about at the beginning of the game, where there was this feeling that scum just wasn't doing a whole lot. It'd make sense for scum to have a lot of low-key players, and Jaack hasn't been low-key.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically the more I think about it the more I think Creature is a good lynch today.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Creature</span><br>\n<br>\nThat's L-2", "time": "Fri May 20, 2016 7:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

I have you fourth out of the four, but still.<br>\n<br>\nTo narrow it down further, I think there's one scum in {Xyzzy/Tyler} and one in {Creature, Jaack}. That's why I feel pretty confident town is going to win right now.<br>\n<br>\nSo, here's my ISO notes:<br>\n<br>\nJaack:<br>\n<br>\n-#13 was an opportunistic vote on Robert.<br>\n-#66 is Jaack switching to ira without dropping his scumread on Robert, and right as Keyser is pressuring Jaack for his Robert vote.<br>\n-#221 is a bit of a reach with his reasoning for why I look scummy -- nothing in the game had really been all that \"popular\" at the time. I remember because the game was moving so slowly and it took longer than usual to see any kind of real wagon with momentum.<br>\n-Jaack's decision to vote HA over ira in #358 continues to strike me as being not partner-y. There wasn't really a pressing need to bus HA at the moment, and he had been pressuring ira for a while. This vote, in fact, sparked two more down the same page. Thinking about this in comparison to the way Keyser voted HA, I am thinking this looks less like a partner bussing than Keyser's did.<br>\n-I can let go of the fact that Jaack backed off HA following the doc claim while simultaneously doubtcasting the doc claim. That could go either way. But the going after Robert, and then continuing to go after Robert the next day, is something scum would do in that situation.<br>\n-Thinking some more about it, I don't think Jaack's logic in #635 makes sense. He gives two reasons for thinking Robert is the best person to lynch first. The first reason is that Robert could be scum with ira or with HA. I point out that it really wouldn't make sense for Robert to be scum with ira, and Jaack kinda sorta backs down on that point, but then brings out argument number two. Which is that if all three are town, Robert is the best to have die by a town mislynch. Which actually doesn't make a ton of sense to me. If we lynch Robert, then what happens is that scum have to kill ira because they'd assume ira would protect docHA. So HA's target that night wouldn't even matter. Whereas if we mislynched HA, scum would still kill ira. Either way it's the same outcome, but Jaack's using it like it's proof we need to lynch Robert first. And now we have an investigative clear on Robert, a townflip from ira and HA flipped scum.<br>\n-#1217 looks bad too. After spending a good chunk of the day arguing for why zakk isn't a good lynch, Jaack votes zakk on the grounds that \"it's better to have a vote on a wagon than not.\" Why, exactly? His other read was xyzzy, and it's not like xyzzy was being widely townread or something.<br>\n-Dunn vote in #1700 comes at an opportunistic moment. The continued arguing for why Dunn is scum actually strikes me as being possibly town...just based on the grounds that it was clearly not the popular trend and it would have been easier for scum to just back off and go \"oh yeah guess I was wrong.\" I'm not totally convinced of this one, but it's my gut feeling on it.<br>\n-Doubtcasting on Bins' claim is bad.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser:<br>\n<br>\n-OK, Keyser's unvote of Jaack in #205 is actually a little weird now that I look back on it with fresher eyes. Keyser had already stopped scumreading Jaack a while ago, and since then had just been kind of talking with other players and asking them questions. But he waits until now to unvote Jaack, and he doesn't have anybody else to put his vote on? Just seems sorta self-conscious.<br>\n-The reaction to ira in #295 is a little aggressive/defensive.<br>\n-#297 is where Keyser responds to HA and votes him, and suddenly a possibility comes to mind which I have no idea how I never thought of it before. What if it was HA bussing Keyser and not Keyser bussing HA? As in, Keyser had just come under pressure from ira and Dunn had already stated his \"sneaking suspicion that Keyser was scum.\" What if HA decided it was time to distance himself from Keyser in case Keyser wound up being the day's lynch? This is making sense to me right now. Given the lack of wagoning that happened before this on D1, it could make sense that scum would wind up going for each other instead.<br>\n-The three-part takedown of HA's entire ISO beginning in #912 does seem a little excessive. It's like Keyser was looking for any evidence he could to show why HA was scum. Overeager, perhaps.<br>\n-Creature's contributions are much fresher in my mind and I've already summarized my thoughts on them so I'm going to skip them for this analysis.<br>\n<br>\nXyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-Again, Xyzzy responding to their own posts in #89 makes it seem like the post-by-post analysis is just filler on show to look like they're doing work. And again, the Zachstral vote was an easy one to make.<br>\n-Don't like xyzzy questioning ira but then softening the blow of it by saying they don't necessarily disagree in #158. Comes across, again, like they're trying to do work but lack conviction in it.<br>\n-Same deal when questioning Jake's vote of Zachstral in #174.<br>\n-#447 and #561 is Xyzzy coming back and, after not doing much of anything with HA up until that point, deciding to go back and reread HA's ISO. Then Xyzzy comes back with a scumread on HA. This is all happening with HA at L-1 -- this is a scummy-looking turnaround.<br>\n-Xyzzy didn't go for Robert after the macho claim in #652, noted.<br>\n-Xyzzy being happy about Tyler not dying in #698 seems like it might be a like \"hey look I didn't know who was going to die!\" moment. Like trying to sound ignorant.<br>\n-It kinda looks even worse in the context of #852. The reason xyzzy said they were happy Tyler was alive was because they were curious about a post Tyler made D1 saying to lynch Xyzzy or floof on D2. Then, after bringing up that post (could be an attempt to get some momentum going on the floof slot), Xyzzy votes for zakk.<br>\n-#1626 is more of xyzzy explicitly stating something to show that they didn't know what the night kill was going to be.<br>\n-I'm also a little leery of xyzzy saying in #2001 that Robert's claim \"probably\" makes him town. I should think it's the closest thing to a guarantee that Jake is town that we could get short of him being an innocent child. It just kind of seems like xyzzy is taking pains to be careful and cover all their bases, especially since they previously were talking about believing Bins' claim, which came after Jake's claim.<br>\n<br>\nTyler:<br>\n<br>\n-I think I noted before that #505 looked like trying to set up another lynch based on a lynch that hadn't happened yet. Now we know that HA was scum and floof was town. I guess the thing I want to highlight here is the timing of this post, it happens as Tyler comes back right amid HA's doc claim and ira's CC, and it's his fourth post since all that happened. It just seems a little out of order, perhaps, since Tyler hadn't committed at that point to saying whether he thought we should lynch HA or ira. It's perhaps like he was trying to get out ahead of HA's scumflip, basically.<br>\n-And again, it has to be noted that Tyler switched to Robert in #628 after initially arguing against a Robert lynch despite the macho claim. Tyler leaving a door open to lynch HA in #646 doesn't help either, but I do concede that it makes sense from a town pov as well (if Robert was scum at that point then HA was certainly scum too).<br>\n-The combo of feeling \"spooked\" about how fast the wagon on xyzzy disappeared combined with the \"im bored\" vote on xyzzy in #1308 does seem town to me now that we know the zakk slot was town. Just because if Tyler was scum this would just mean that he worked against a mislynch he had essentially been pushing since the end of D1, and one that looked likely to go through.<br>\n-Some minor townpoints for standing up and saying dunn was town in #1731.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, Tyler's hopped around between Jaack, Xyzzy and Creature. Coupled with his \"I've been towntelling post,\" I am getting townfeels from him.<br>\n<br>\nAnd there are a couple things making me lean town on Jaack as well -- some very scummy-looking things to be sure, but some towny things as well. One is the post from HA I highlighted before where it looked like he was treating Jaack as town, and another is Jaack choosing to vote HA over ira.<br>\n<br>\nXyzzy and Creature both continue to look like scum. Of the two, Creature looks bad whereas there's a possibility Xyzzy is just not that active and that's contributing to the scumfeels I've been getting on them. Vote stays on Creature.", "time": "Sun May 22, 2016 4:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

But if we assume that that is reality for a moment, then the second that HA flipped town (which he is in this scenario) ira would be basically confirmed scum.

Macho is primarily used to balance a powerful role in a game with a doctor (e.g. a Cop+Doc is really powerful, while a Macho Cop+Doc is reasonable). There isn't really any reason for a Macho VT to exist in general. In order for such a role to come into play, both a doc and a nk would have to target what is essentially a VT. In order for that role to make any amount of sense, there would have to be multiple protects.

I'm dead tonight so lynch it.</div></blockquote>\nI agree with much of this post. I'd add something, but it's mostly covered. The reason I don't wanna vote  dunn is to get more people posting after I jumped in and more reasons on why Jaack wasn't lynched yet.

I'm going to work a lot in hypotheticals, but I think I've solved our dilemma to a reasonable extend.<br>\n<br>\n1. I still think dunn is scum, but I recognize this is a disputed issue.<br>\n<br>\n2. In the unlikely event dunn is, in fact, town, there is almost certainly scum attempting to lynch him.<br>\n<br>\n3. Of the four living players to express interest in a Dunn lynch today, two (Jake and TOF) are conftown.<br>\n<br>\n4. Therefore, if dunn is town, either creature or I (or both) must be scum.<br>\n<br>\n5. There must be at least 1 scum in between dunn, creature, and I.<br>\n<br>\nFurther explination:<br>\nI find it extremely hard to believe that scum would take absolutely no interest in lynching a town player who fakeclaimed cop, particularly when the real cop is death tunneling that player.<br>\n<br>\nSince we have two mislynches, we could lynch all three of dunn, creature, and I, and in the worst case scenario, we would end up in 3 player lylo, with those three players likely being tyler, tool, and xyzzy, as Jake and TOF are pretty obvious nks and bins, while technically unconfirmed, has pretty solid evidence preventing a possible lynch there.<br>\n<br>\nBest case scenario is we lynch one of us three *coughdunncough* today and they flip scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo the question that remains is what order. I would obviously prefer that dunn be lynched today, and, should he flip town, creature tomorrow, as I personally know myself to be town. That being said, my alignment is uncorfmable, barring my own flip or should I somehow be inspected, which isn't going to happen.<br>\n<br>\nFrom as neutral of a standpoint I can speak from, I still think dunn makes more sense to be lynched first, creature's flip would not really enlighten anyone as to my alignment and vice versa.<br>\n<br>\nAlso from the neutral perspective (which is to say I am pretending not to know my own alignment) it would make more sense to lynch me ahead of creature, purely due to this post. If (when) I flip town, it would be clear that I am not scum and that my plan here is town-motivated. If I were to flip scum (not gonna happen, but we're playing hypotheticals) then it would be clear that my plan here would have been scum motivated and thus should not be followed.<br>\n<br>\nOK, leaving the hypotheticals, I STILL want a dunn lynch today and I would never endorse my own lynch ever, but I think my logic here is sound.<br>\n<br>\ntl:dr version - there virtually has to be scum in &lt;dunn, creaure, jaack&gt;. If we lynch from that pool until we get scum, we will most likely win.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, I have an early morning tomorrow so I am going to bed, but I will answer any and all questions should you make them available as soon as I can.", "time": "Thu May 26, 2016 5:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2150", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Xyzzy goes after Dunn in a kind of provocative way, only to keep their vote on Jaack and not really come to a conclusion on Dunn. Xyzzy's explanation in #59 is that the game is still early and they're going to wait to see what Dunn does later in the day. Just seems like it could be scum searching for a good first wagon to build momentum on without wanting to be too central in the push.<br>\n-I didn't notice this before, but in #89 (xyzzy's first post-by-post analysis), they talk about at least two of their own posts...a little bizarre, since I would think the point of a post-by-post analysis would be to scumhunt. Adding in a post from themself just seems like filler.<br>\n-I noted before that xyzzy's vote on zachstral in #89 was an \"easy\" vote to make. In #158, xyzzy responds to my point by saying that it's partially just a vote to get Zachstral to talk. The problem with that is that Zachstral had actually been posting quite a bit relative to other players at that point, while floof had only posted once and HA hadn't posted at all.<br>\n-The approach to Jake in #174 also bugs me a bit. Jake had naked voted Zachstral, and xyzzy responded by asking Jake about his reasons -- normally might come across as town to me, but xyzzy specified that they were fine with votes on Zachstral. Seems like trying to come across as suspicious while simultaneously trying to keep Jake's vote on Zachstral.<br>\n-#286 only adds to that weirdness, because xyzzy says Jake is scum and then says they're going to keep their vote on Zachstral. No mention of the fact that Jake was voting Zachstral, nor the implications for Zachstral's alignment if Jake -- who was voting Zachstral -- was scum.<br>\n-Xyzzy agrees with a point from HA that I thought did not make a whole lot of sense in #393.<br>\n-The turnaround on HA #447, #561 and #566 does seem kind of...opportunistic, for lack of a better word. It's just that xyzzy didn't pay a ton of attention to HA up until that point, and actually had kept their vote on Zachstral for most of the game. Then when HA gets close to being lynched, Xyzzy reassesses and gets on board with an HA lynch.<br>\n-Should be noted that xyzzy comes out against a Robert lynch in #652. If nothing else this tells us that if Xyzzy is scum, scum expected HA to die from the doc claim.<br>\n-In #852, xyzzy defends the all-D1 Zachstral vote by saying it seemed more productive than a Jake vote. This doesn't really make a ton of sense to me; I don't remember much of any pressure on Zachstral yesterday.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOverall xyzzy looks worse than I thought. The interactions with HA (from both perspectives) are not good, the posting and voting arcs are a little confusing and possibly event contradictory, and there's a general air of trying not to open themselves up too much.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7939231#p7939231\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7939231#p7939231\" data-post-id=\"7939231\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2045</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7005\">toolenduso</a> wrote:</cite>To narrow it down further, I think there's one scum in {Xyzzy/Tyler} and one in {Creature, Jaack}.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">(snip)</div><br>\n<br>\nXyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-Again, Xyzzy responding to their own posts in #89 makes it seem like the post-by-post analysis is just filler on show to look like they're doing work. And again, the Zachstral vote was an easy one to make.<br>\n-Don't like xyzzy questioning ira but then softening the blow of it by saying they don't necessarily disagree in #158. Comes across, again, like they're trying to do work but lack conviction in it.<br>\n-Same deal when questioning Jake's vote of Zachstral in #174.<br>\n-#447 and #561 is Xyzzy coming back and, after not doing much of anything with HA up until that point, deciding to go back and reread HA's ISO. Then Xyzzy comes back with a scumread on HA. This is all happening with HA at L-1 -- this is a scummy-looking turnaround.<br>\n-Xyzzy didn't go for Robert after the macho claim in #652, noted.<br>\n-Xyzzy being happy about Tyler not dying in #698 seems like it might be a like \"hey look I didn't know who was going to die!\" moment. Like trying to sound ignorant.<br>\n-It kinda looks even worse in the context of #852. The reason xyzzy said they were happy Tyler was alive was because they were curious about a post Tyler made D1 saying to lynch Xyzzy or floof on D2. Then, after bringing up that post (could be an attempt to get some momentum going on the floof slot), Xyzzy votes for zakk.<br>\n-#1626 is more of xyzzy explicitly stating something to show that they didn't know what the night kill was going to be.<br>\n-I'm also a little leery of xyzzy saying in #2001 that Robert's claim \"probably\" makes him town. I should think it's the closest thing to a guarantee that Jake is town that we could get short of him being an innocent child. It just kind of seems like xyzzy is taking pains to be careful and cover all their bases, especially since they previously were talking about believing Bins' claim, which came after Jake's claim.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Sat May 28, 2016 5:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2175", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Xyzzy goes after Dunn in a kind of provocative way, only to keep their vote on Jaack and not really come to a conclusion on Dunn. Xyzzy's explanation in #59 is that the game is still early and they're going to wait to see what Dunn does later in the day. Just seems like it could be scum searching for a good first wagon to build momentum on without wanting to be too central in the push.<br>\n-I didn't notice this before, but in #89 (xyzzy's first post-by-post analysis), they talk about at least two of their own posts...a little bizarre, since I would think the point of a post-by-post analysis would be to scumhunt. Adding in a post from themself just seems like filler.<br>\n-I noted before that xyzzy's vote on zachstral in #89 was an \"easy\" vote to make. In #158, xyzzy responds to my point by saying that it's partially just a vote to get Zachstral to talk. The problem with that is that Zachstral had actually been posting quite a bit relative to other players at that point, while floof had only posted once and HA hadn't posted at all.<br>\n-The approach to Jake in #174 also bugs me a bit. Jake had naked voted Zachstral, and xyzzy responded by asking Jake about his reasons -- normally might come across as town to me, but xyzzy specified that they were fine with votes on Zachstral. Seems like trying to come across as suspicious while simultaneously trying to keep Jake's vote on Zachstral.<br>\n-#286 only adds to that weirdness, because xyzzy says Jake is scum and then says they're going to keep their vote on Zachstral. No mention of the fact that Jake was voting Zachstral, nor the implications for Zachstral's alignment if Jake -- who was voting Zachstral -- was scum.<br>\n-Xyzzy agrees with a point from HA that I thought did not make a whole lot of sense in #393.<br>\n-The turnaround on HA #447, #561 and #566 does seem kind of...opportunistic, for lack of a better word. It's just that xyzzy didn't pay a ton of attention to HA up until that point, and actually had kept their vote on Zachstral for most of the game. Then when HA gets close to being lynched, Xyzzy reassesses and gets on board with an HA lynch.<br>\n-Should be noted that xyzzy comes out against a Robert lynch in #652. If nothing else this tells us that if Xyzzy is scum, scum expected HA to die from the doc claim.<br>\n-In #852, xyzzy defends the all-D1 Zachstral vote by saying it seemed more productive than a Jake vote. This doesn't really make a ton of sense to me; I don't remember much of any pressure on Zachstral yesterday.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOverall xyzzy looks worse than I thought. The interactions with HA (from both perspectives) are not good, the posting and voting arcs are a little confusing and possibly event contradictory, and there's a general air of trying not to open themselves up too much.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7939231#p7939231\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7939231#p7939231\" data-post-id=\"7939231\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2045</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7005\">toolenduso</a> wrote:</cite>To narrow it down further, I think there's one scum in {Xyzzy/Tyler} and one in {Creature, Jaack}.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">(snip)</div><br>\n<br>\nXyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-Again, Xyzzy responding to their own posts in #89 makes it seem like the post-by-post analysis is just filler on show to look like they're doing work.

Then Xyzzy comes back with a scumread on HA. This is all happening with HA at L-1 -- this is a scummy-looking turnaround.<br>\n-Xyzzy didn't go for Robert after the macho claim in #652, noted.<br>\n-Xyzzy being happy about Tyler not dying in #698 seems like it might be a like \"hey look I didn't know who was going to die!\" moment. Like trying to sound ignorant.<br>\n-It kinda looks even worse in the context of #852. The reason xyzzy said they were happy Tyler was alive was because they were curious about a post Tyler made D1 saying to lynch Xyzzy or floof on D2. Then, after bringing up that post (could be an attempt to get some momentum going on the floof slot), Xyzzy votes for zakk.<br>\n-#1626 is more of xyzzy explicitly stating something to show that they didn't know what the night kill was going to be.<br>\n-I'm also a little leery of xyzzy saying in #2001 that Robert's claim \"probably\" makes him town. I should think it's the closest thing to a guarantee that Jake is town that we could get short of him being an innocent child. It just kind of seems like xyzzy is taking pains to be careful and cover all their bases, especially since they previously were talking about believing Bins' claim, which came after Jake's claim.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>\n\nI'll go point through point talking about my thoughts, because I haven't really fully responded to a lot of this:<br>\n<br>\n-I don't personally feel that h_a's limited interactions with me are indicative of me being scum, or necessarily of anything at all. <br>\n-34/42/59 -- I basically didn't get what Dunnstral was doing at all at this point in the game; I was being cautious to avoid making dumb early mistakes.<br>\n-89 -- I mostly was just trying to contextualize my earlier posts and offer followup to them based on how others had responded; doing that in response to my own posts seemed like a reasonable solution given the fact that a lot of people had said things regarding my posts, and there was no strong reason to pick anyone's response to specifically say something about.<br>\n-158 -- Zachstralkita was talking a lot at that point, but it was nothing but filler.<br>\n-174 -- I don't want someone voting for someone without a clearly stated reason. if he had motives that didn't feel faked for doing so, I would've been happy with his vote being where it was.<br>\n-286 -- finding one person scummy but not as scummy as the person you're voting for isn't really a good reason to move your vote.<br>\n-393 -- I generally feel like the move of just directly asking someone a question like \"are you scum?\" to see their reaction has some validity; later, there was reason to question h_a's use of this, but I don't think the basic concept is an inherently flawed one.<br>\n-447/561/566 -- \"It's just that xyzzy didn't pay a ton of attention to HA up until that point\" -- I'd pretty much agree; once I started paying attention I saw problems.<br>\n-852 -- that's fair. I agree that, in retrospect, my day 1 voting didn't accomplish a whole lot.<br>\n-158 (2) -- asking \"why do you believe this thing you said is true?\" isn't indicative of disagreement; in this case, I was basically neutral on the subject.<br>\n-652 -- I'm not really sure what you mean by this.<br>\n-698 -- I was genuinely super curious about Tyler's post, more due to the call to lynch me than anything else.<br>\n-852 -- as noted, my interest in that post had far more to do with my mention on it.<br>\n-1626 -- I was surprised, because I had felt confident up until that point that Zachstralkita was scum, and that was my genuine real life reaction.<br>\n-2001 -- I'll agree that the timing of that was pretty poor for me.<br>\n<br>\nI've gotta admit, I've kind of had most of my energy drained from me in this game, and I've not been nearly as active or attentive for much of it as a result; I've been somewhat sick for about 2 weeks now, and I've also been dealing with some really bad personal things that have taken away a lot of my motivation, and on top of that, there was a period where every single time I returned to the thread there were 5-10 new pages, which hasn't really been great for my ability to meaningfully focus on this game. if I happen to live, I'll definitely be trying harder as I get back to normalcy, but I just wanted to apologize for my significantly lower contributions to the game lately.

Yes, and I was really gunning for Dunn's lynch in my initial post because of the sheer convenience of his cop claim. (With a BG dead, my role is significantly more likely.) It was safe to \"clear\" a mostly confirmed town, and it outted the doctor. However, other people's reactions to his gambit covered my feelings, so I erased it. I still really don't like him, and if anything, I want him lynched cause it would provide more information, and since GF isn't blacklisted, it's a pretty safe call that he should be lynched before lylo.<br>\n<br>\n2. I wish I had an order, but I only have a top 2: Dunn Jaack. I outlined why I really dislike Jaack's early game behavior and setting up lynches for day 2 on what turned out to be a scum flip. However, he said that the town should lynch Robert (my role) first, and if scum, then lynch h_a. Since I would flip town, that means h_a would be less scummy as a result of my flip. This is doesn't sit well with me. However, with h_a flipping town, he wrote  along piece trying to get Robert lynched day 2 anyway, and that level of tunneling is suspect especially how he gives up on it (showing lack of conviction after a ridiculous level of tunneling) to just go with the lynch for the day. It's very suspect to me. Dunn, on the other hand, provides a lot of information and is too dangerous to keep in the game later.<br>\n<br>\n3. It's day talk, so given the multiple views on the matter. Is it less likely? Sure. But it would have been better not to acknowledge this so that the analysis of how the wagoners might abandon the wagon is more information.<br>\n<br>\n4. In my lasdt post, I said xyz is an issue for me because I don't see his play as scum or town motivated but disengaged player motivated. I think I am leaning very slightly scum, but only because I can better reason his disaffected state as being the result of:<br>\nsemi-afk partner<br>\nh_a got destroyed day 1<br>\nHe doesn't wanna put in effort to fix it.<br>\n<br>\nSince Town has a scum lynch within first 2 days, the only way a town can be disaffected is if he's (personally) feeling railroaded by scum and no one wants to listen. This is less likely as a person who is town could at least work and say \"hey, when I flip town, look at the play of people pushing me\" or try to find some sort of pattern on what happened in the past.<br>\n<br>\nBut, xyz's last post is KIND OF like that, talking about posts over the past few days so we have something to reference should he be lynched today. Scum could also do this, so reading him is just flat out harder cause its difficult to read anyone who just doesn't give a fuck. :/", "time": "Sun May 29, 2016 1:37 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2200", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

I still really don't like him, and if anything, I want him lynched cause it would provide more information, and since GF isn't blacklisted, it's a pretty safe call that he should be lynched before lylo.</div></blockquote>\n\nThere's a really weird thought I've been having that I want to toss around re:Dunn's stuff. <br>\n<br>\nLet's assume Dunn was scum. Then he'd have to be GF. His initial reaction was \"GF is blacklisted, so I don't even see what you're saying.\" Initially, this bugged me because I didn't know GF was blacklisted. And thought, maybe Dunn had extra information / had done research and stuff because it was his role. But now I'm thinking, if Dunn was scum, his best argument BEING GF and knowing GF ISN'T blacklisted was \"Hey no, GF is blacklisted.\" Which would a) be a really shitty play in terms of fairness and sportsmanship (trying to deceive based on false rules) and I doubt he would do that but also b) why would his main argument be something that will easily be refuted and something he knows is not true? <br>\n<br>\nI just don't think scumDunn knowing that GF isn't blacklisted (because it is his role) would use that as a defence.</div></blockquote>\n\nExcept it would be in his best interest to play town? Consider he is scum and is GF, and he already knew GF was blacklisted. Upon seeing his PM, he might find out if this was a mistake. As such, it would be reasonable to act what he (dunn) would have done had someone brought up the GF argument: \"What? No, GF is blacklisted.\"<br>\n<br>\nThis follows because town dunn would have been surprised, so a scum dunn (trying to act town) should logically say the same.<br>\n<br>\nIt's also possible that given the rarity of the role (I have been in one game that used it several years ago and no others), town dunn could also reasonably question \"is that role allowed?\" see that it is blacklisted, and then say 'yeah, no guys, it's blacklisted.\"<br>\n<br>\nBoth scum and town dunn could do this, and since I don't know his personal skill as a mafia player, I can't say whether or not he'd be clever enough to think about this, but he could have planned this outcome from the start since it was possible he'd need to fake claim and suspected a cop was in the game (as, in this scenario, he's GF. Kinda pointless without a cop.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nA better argument against lynching Dunn is the scum perspective on claiming cop today. One of them is dead, so there are only two. The only reason for dunn to get himself killed outting the cop is if the third member has been erroneously cleared by the town. This would be very difficult to do with, say, my role (the most cleared of non investigated roles, but I don't recall who the other Jake result was) because claiming can't be bodyguard townie is both a poor claim AND scum have little reason to suspect a BG + cop power role in town since the GF would weaken the cop enough to possibly allow a doctor (or paranoid doctor, whatever, I don't balance games).<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, the odds that dunn is scum go down because it would be slightly insane cause scum have day talk. This kind of gambit pays very little off and they could organize a much, much better plan than this.<br>\n<br>\nSo, if I had to guess from an actual consideration, dunn is unlikely scum. His wagon has Jaack and Creature, both of whom I dislike. Shame day 2's lynch wasn't informative.<br>\n<br>\nI think I'm willing to HAMMER Creature, but not sure if we should consider waiting for Jake's replacement.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n(This post is a bit all over the place, woops)", "time": "Mon May 30, 2016 8:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2200", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

The \"scum coordinated on HA's claim\" theory. Basically, since we know scum have day talk, I believe that they would have talked about HA's doc claim before he claimed. And since that's likely, it meant scum would have had a strategy. The strategy would have either revolved around expecting HA to live after the claim or expecting HA to get lynched after the claim. And again, because of day talk, I believe the other two scum would both adopt the same approach to HA's claim. Keyser/Creature reacted to HA's claim by immediately distrusting it, pushing to lynch the slot even harder than before, arguing for why ira's counterclaim was town and then continuing to push for HA's lynch even after Robert's macho VT claim. That means scum expected HA to get lynched. Tyler and Jaack both jumped on Robert as a possible lynch after his claim, while xyzzy continued to push for HA's lynch. Therefore, xyzzy looks the most like a partner working in tandem with the Keyser slot.<br>\n2. Creature's push on Dunn. This was done in tandem with Jaack. I don't think scum would both push on Dunn together the way that those two did. There was not a whole lot of town willpower to lynch Dunn, and it was obviously a risky play. Dunn's retraction meant, essentially, that town had just finished a quadruple play by all-but-clearing Jake, Robertslot, Bins and Dunn. In those circumstances, it would be very bullheaded for both remaining scum to work together on a risky lynch that would look awful if Dunn flipped town. This is basically an argument for Jaack being town more than it is for xyzzy being scum, but eliminating Jaack means that the only two options left are Tyler and xyzzy, and of those two xyzzy looks overall much, much scummier (see my previous summary of notes for TOF in #2183).<br>\n<br>\nI started doing some work during the night to kinda check this and make sure I wasn't missing anything, but I only got halfway through.

I can see this coming from a partner, especially now that we know Keyser was bussing the hell out of HA.<br>\n-Keyser lets go of the Jaack scumread pretty quickly, saying he looks more like paranoid town by #81. Again, possible for a partner trying to distance early.<br>\n-OK, so #297 reminded me that HA's (fake) suspicion of Keyser, as well as Keyser's subsequent vote on HA, were largely over Keyser's vote on Jaack. So that means that if Jaack is the third partner, all three scum focused on each other early in the game and decided to bus like crazy. I mean....maybe. But it seems a little far-fetched to me that scum would actually plan to enter the game that way.<br>\n-In #1868, Creature's fourth post, he says Jaack's pushes have been \"pretty terrible.\" He lists Jaack as one possible scum of three possibilities in #1973, and his last post (#2227) asks people to lynch Dunn or Jaack the next day phase. All pretty much null.<br>\n<br>\nTyler:<br>\n<br>\n-Keyser kinda buddies up to Tyler in #58, sorta like he did to me on D1 as well.<br>\n-Other than that, his discussions with Tyler are largely clinical (answering questions, talking about game theory, etc).<br>\n-Creature says Tyler's motivations look good in #1868.<br>\n-Very much nothing going on here. Small hint of non-partner feel from Keyser buddying up to Tyler.<br>\n<br>\nxyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-Keyser says xyzzy's early posts look like forced scumhunting in #58. His reasoning is basically a mimic of what Tyler said in #50.<br>\n-He turns around his read on xyzzy in #204, for basically no reason. Mainly he says it was their catch-up post, which seemed more \"natural and expressive.\" I did not get this from xyzzy's catch-up.<br>\n-He does it with another one of xyzzy's catch-up posts in #343, and then kinda tells xyzzy what they should do.<br>\n-Creature gives a vague town-lean-type read on xyzzy in #1868, says he sees xyzzy as town without explanation in #1933.<br>\n-Then in #2198, he is suddenly saying xyzzy is probable scum. He doesn't explain it and I have no idea where it comes from.<br>\n-Most of this is even more evidence for xyzzy being scum imo.<br>\n<br>\nNext, unless we can just lynch xyzzy now, I want to go through the interactions each of these slots had with Creature/Keyser.", "time": "Sat Jun 04, 2016 4:16 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2250", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

In #357 he has Keyser as his number one townread and says it's because Keyser has a similar train of thought to him. My gut leans town on this because the default for scum is to want to not look connected to their partners.<br>\n-Suspicion of the slot starts in #1620 after Creature replaces in.<br>\n-But he comes out and says he doesn't like the creature lynch in #2005.<br>\n-#2164 is kind of a weird post. It's Jaack's brainstorm on lynching between {creature, Jaack and Dunn}, and he actually more or less concludes by saying that town should lynch him (Jaack). He says in his post that Creature's flip wouldn't give anybody info on his own alignment...which, now that we've seen a scumflip from Creature, does look a little odd. Like it almost looks like Jaack is trying to preempt town's suspicion of him once Creature flips scum, but he doesn't want to lynch Creature.<br>\n-Comes in in #2219 to say he has no major problem with lynching Creature because it will give info. Also says xyzzy is more likely to flip scum, then in his next post (#2229), Jaack says he would lynch Creature first over xyzzy (while still saying we should lynch Dunn before either of them).<br>\n-It's interesting that Jaack's entrance to D4 was to say that xyzzy doesn't look as much like scum since Creature's flip. I can only imagine xyzzy would be the best mislynch option for scumJaack.<br>\n<br>\nTyler:<br>\n<br>\n-Like I said when going through Keyser's ISO, there was a lot of \"clinical\" discussion going on between these two early game. I'm a little torn on #303 though, where Tyler asks Keyser about one of his points on HA being scum. It just feels like a non-partner thing for Tyler to do (talk to one scum partner about why he's bussing the third), but at the same time Tyler is clearly a competent player so it's not like it's hard to imagine him doing this as scum, sort of an atmospheric hey-look-im-not-partners-with-these-two-teehee thing. Idk. I feel like it comes out as a small townpoint for Tyler.<br>\n-Tyler says Keyser's approach to HA doesn't look like partners in #753, and I know he did this several more times later on as well. It needs to be noted, but then, I thought the exact same thing that Tyler did around that time, so.<br>\n-After Creature replaces in, Tyler does a look back at a VC in #1894 and comes to the conclusion that Keyser bussing HA might actually make sense. Says Creature is probscum in #1869.<br>\n-Waffles around a lot on Creature after that. In #2095 he puts Creature as his third preference for lynching. Says he'll hammer Creature in #2226.<br>\n<br>\nXyzzy:<br>\n<br>\n-#89, xyzzy's first post-by-post analysis, includes a non-opinion on Keyser. Basically that they liked a post but don't have any conclusions from it. Seems like filler (which I've already noted in other aspects of that post and others that xyzzy's written).<br>\n-The note toward Dunn at the end of #89 actually strikes me as non-partnery. Xyzzy asks Dunn to let them know if Dunn's read on Keyser changes. Kind of a too-obvious vibe from this one.<br>\n-I think I've noted xyzzy's soft questioning in #158 before, but it's more significant now that we have a scumflip from the Keyser slot. Xyzzy was kind of trying to question ira over ira's vote on Keyser, but then xyzzy said that they don't disagree entirely. That's the kind of leaving-open-a-back-door I expect from a scum partner.<br>\n-In #393, xyzzy switches and says ira looks worse than Keyser.<br>\n-Says Keyser is probtown in #852.<br>\n-In #1959, says Creature's early posting looks bad but gives the slot a pass because xyzzy was townreading Keyser.<br>\n-In their next post (#2001), xyzzy turns around and says Creature looks worst by PoE, but they don't feel too strongly that Creature is scum because of Keyser's play, oh and Jake is probably town, and xyzzy trusts the people voting Creature so they'll vote Creature. This all looks like manufacturing reasoning to me.<br>\n-#2269 is WIFOM and totally fits a narrative where xyzzy was bussing. Like I can see the conversation in the scum thread now: \"Are we fucked?\" \"Yeah probably. Maybe if you bus me you can still win.\" \"OK I'm gonna bus you and you keep pushing Dunn and maybe there'll be enough support for a Dunn lynch.

The \"scum coordinated on HA's claim\" theory. Basically, since we know scum have day talk, I believe that they would have talked about HA's doc claim before he claimed. And since that's likely, it meant scum would have had a strategy. The strategy would have either revolved around expecting HA to live after the claim or expecting HA to get lynched after the claim. And again, because of day talk, I believe the other two scum would both adopt the same approach to HA's claim. Keyser/Creature reacted to HA's claim by immediately distrusting it, pushing to lynch the slot even harder than before, arguing for why ira's counterclaim was town and then continuing to push for HA's lynch even after Robert's macho VT claim. That means scum expected HA to get lynched. Tyler and Jaack both jumped on Robert as a possible lynch after his claim, while xyzzy continued to push for HA's lynch. Therefore, xyzzy looks the most like a partner working in tandem with the Keyser slot.<br>\n2. Creature's push on Dunn. This was done in tandem with Jaack. I don't think scum would both push on Dunn together the way that those two did. There was not a whole lot of town willpower to lynch Dunn, and it was obviously a risky play. Dunn's retraction meant, essentially, that town had just finished a quadruple play by all-but-clearing Jake, Robertslot, Bins and Dunn. In those circumstances, it would be very bullheaded for both remaining scum to work together on a risky lynch that would look awful if Dunn flipped town. This is basically an argument for Jaack being town more than it is for xyzzy being scum, but eliminating Jaack means that the only two options left are Tyler and xyzzy, and of those two xyzzy looks overall much, much scummier (see my previous summary of notes for TOF in #2183).</div></blockquote>\n\nThere are also a couple in my last post looking at xyzzy's interactions with the Keyser/Creature slot.

The most noteworthy thing here comes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7907403#p7907403\">976</a> where he lists \"mild suspicion\" of tool based on his interactions with HA. Well that's not really noteworthy in of itself, but it is noteworthy that Keyser does not discuss any of xyzzy, tyler, or myself (aka, the other people who are at this point, unconfirmed). In general it seems that Keyser was someone willing to bus and while bussing may seem more unlikely with only two scum compared to three, tool was on a list of 5 people, meaning Keyser could have maintained a slight scumread on tool for quite a while without ever having to push that lynch.<br>\n<br>\nCreature slight townreads tool in the same breath as slightly townreading Tyler (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7932276#p7932276\">1868</a>), and that's basically it.

Robert's claim and the circumstances surrounding the claim is the type of stuff that draws a cop inspection, which is a boon for a hypothetical GF.

Assuming the last scum doesn't trip all over themselves, lylo will likely consist of tool, tyler, and one of bins/dunn/TOF.

Nothing really strikes me as that notable until post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7868453#p7868453\">206</a>. In the latter half of that post, Keyser sort of/kind of/almost insinuates that he scumreads Tyler without actually saying it.

Right now I wish we had more scumposting, because like 90% of confirmed scumposts come from the first half of D1.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Tyler, there are a few things I find interesting from the scumposts, but it just isn't very much to make a decision on.<br>\n<br>\nNext up is to look at Tyler's posts about the scum.", "time": "Sun Jun 12, 2016 10:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2375", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Here's why:<br>\n<br>\n1. His case clearly relies on reaches in logic.<br>\n2. Some of the wording indicates that he was sure of me not being scum. Not suspecting, or paranoid, as he had been before, but somehow had suddenly become <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">sure</div> of it.<br>\n3. I saw no reason for townTyler to suddenly drop his suspicions of xyzzy -- which have existed since the beginning of the game -- or of Jaack, and suddenly start scumreading me.<br>\n4. If Tyler is scum, he is putting himself in an excellent position to win the game by lynching me.<br>\n<br>\nBefore Tyler's case, town was basically deciding between Jaack and xyzzy for today's lynch. ScumTyler would look at that and see this scenario playing out:<br>\n<br>\nTown lynches xyzzy today --&gt; Jaack tomorrow --&gt; then he has to convince town to lynch me in 3p LyLo<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, laying down a case on me early would be a crucial step for scumTyler winning the game. It would put him in the exact position he would need to be in, which would be lynching xyzzy and then Jaack (in any order) and then getting the last remaining town to vote me so he could hammer for the win.<br>\n<br>\nAnd if he could get me lynched today, it would be even better for him. Because who would really think to lynch Tyler over Jaack or xyzzy if I was out of the picture?<br>\n<br>\nIn short, if Tyler is scum then I think I was the biggest obstacle between him and victory because I was the least-suspected of the remaining town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">That was all what I thought at first upon seeing Tyler's case.</div><br>\n<br>\nOne of the first things that started bugging me about the scumTyler scenario was why he would wait until halfway through the day phase to pull out his case on me. Why not just come into today swinging at me? That would make more sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nWhat <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> messes it up is that xyzzy is actually pushing me now as well. And that looks awfully good for scumXyzzy as well, because if xyzzy is the last scum then they would at this point be clawing for life. Xyzzy's suspicion of me essentially rides the coattails of Tyler's case, and in fact the post where they voted me looks pretty bad.<br>\n<br>\nLook at what they said: That lynching either me or Jaack would provide info. Not that one or either of us looks like scum, but that lynching us would provide info. It just looks to me like self-consciousness of the need to justify their vote to town -- not to mention that it leaves a back door open for the next most likely lynch option not named xyzzy.<br>\n<br>\nAnother problem with a scenario where Tyler is scum is that it contradicts my theory about scum approaching HA's claim in the same way. That's part of why I was so taken aback when Tyler first posted his case and I started really thinking he might be the last scum. Now that xyzzy's jumped back in, well, I'm not sure. I'm still pretty wary of Tyler, but perhaps he really did just happen to go back in my ISO and psych himself into thinking I was scum.<br>\n<br>\nSince we are approaching deadline...<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xyzzy</span>", "time": "Tue Jun 14, 2016 12:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2375", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

{"number": 2430, "id": "8015677", "user": "toolenduso", "user_id": "7005", "content": "All right, so my thoughts after xyzzy flipped town.<br>\n<br>\nI'm at the point now where I'm going to have to reassess some of the stuff I was using before to narrow down choices. Obviously I was wrong about one of my theories, because the fact that Creature was pushing Dunn along with Jaack made me think Jaack wasn't scum, and the fact that Keyser reacted to HA's doc claim by bussing him like crazy made me think that Tyler wasn't scum (because he kinda moved in the other direction after HA's claim). Interestingly, Jaack also took Tyler's approach after HA's claim -- but in a slightly different way. While Tyler was kind of assessing the situation, Jaack came in and said that doc claim is a standard for scum under pressure. In the same post, he votes for ira and reasons that we shouldn't be lynching a doc claim.<br>\n<br>\nBetween the two, I think Jaack looks worse, because it seems like he actually could have been trying to take Keyser's approach of bussing HA, but then hedged his bets a little more. Tyler's response to the whole thing...I mean, I can see scumminess in it, but parts of it also look like the kind of thing scum would be a little more conscious about. Like in #505 saying that he'll be looking at floof if HA flips scum. It's kind of blatantly setting up another lynch before the flip, I don't know if a player like Tyler would really do that.<br>\n<br>\nCompared with that, I can see where Jaack's posts around the time could be more strategic.<br>\n<br>\nLooking back over the rest of my notes on the two, I am remembering why I've been reading Tyler as town for so much of this game...after the floof set-up for example, he didn't follow through and push the slot. There have been a lot of small things, basically.<br>\n<br>\nAnd conversely there have been a lot of small things with Jaack that have made him look worse. The vote on Robert at the very beginning of the game, for example. Or the time he voted zakk after arguing against a zakk lynch and gave the reasoning that it's better to be on a wagon. Tyler makes a good point about Jaack's reasoning for voting xyzzy.<br>\n<br>\nYeah. I am definitely leaning Jaack for last scum. No need to rush, though.

I was wrong, obviously, that it came to scum, but it looked strange.<br>\n<br>\n@ircher - both Dunn and your slot were pretty much conftown yesterday, and both had me high on their scumlist<br>\n<br>\nIt's actually kind of annoying because I like nk analysis, but the n1 and n3 nks were super obvious so there's literally nothing to look for there.<br>\n<br>\nN2 nk was surprising because I though Zach was relatively lynchable, but I guess scum didn't see him as particularly persuadable.<br>\n<br>\nAs for n4 - Dunn and tof had pretty similar opinions that scum was between xyzzy and I, and that in the event we were both town, then tool was slightly scummier than tyler.<br>\n<br>\nBins meanwhile was relatively open to any lynch of the unconfirmed, or at least, more open to a Tyler or tool lynch than dunn/tof.<br>\n<br>\nSo I get why bins is alive, but there's no telling why scum went for dunn over tof. So nk analysis has been pretty useless.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as who's scum between Tyler and tool, I was pretty sure that it was Tyler after xyzzy flipped, mainly because he seemed to be open to lynching any of tool/xyzzy/myself d4, but after thinking it through, I think I've swung back over to the toolscum side.<br>\n<br>\nI think that tyler's push on tool yesterday would have been to risky for scum to try. If tyler were scum, he could have just ridden the inevitable lynched on xyzzy and myself into 3p lylo, where he would get pitted 1v1 versus tool.<br>\n<br>\nTrying to lynch tool d4 was the hardest path tyler could have taken (I guess aside from a tof lynch or something dumb). Tool had also been mostly an ally up to that point, so it seems odd for scum to break that peace.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: toolenduso</span><br>\n<br>\nBut I can see I'm pretty dead today anyway, so this is mostly for posterity.", "time": "Fri Jun 17, 2016 12:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2425", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

No clear reason I see to choose Dunn over Bins, but I suppose that's reason enough -- could've been a coin flip choice for all I know.<br>\n<br>\nIf Tyler is scum, he'd see a bunch of clear townies who didn't suspect him. In that case it actually might have made more sense for him to go for Bins instead of Dunn, since Dunn seemed to think I looked more like scum than Tyler, while Bins straight up said she'd vote for Tyler instead of me if it came down to LyLo. I mean that could go into WIFOM territory pretty quickly, but the scumJaack explanation for why Dunn died is much more straightforward here. Occam's razor says Jaack.<br>\n<br>\nThe kill before that one is Jake, and the reason why Jake died is obvious.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Zachstral kill</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">This kill was a little surprising. I can only imagine that scum didn't suspect Jake as the cop, or Bins as the voyeur. I also suppose they probably thought there was still room for the Robertslot (later TOF) to be lynched, and so they didn't want to eliminate that slot.<br>\n<br>\nThat actually points toward scumJaack as well -- Jaack kept pushing for Robert after Robert's claim, and then continued the push into D2.<br>\n<br>\nTyler was one of the people who voted Rob after Rob's claim, but the difference is that Tyler didn't keep pushing it. Tyler said, I think 200 posts or so before Zachstral's NK, that he was warming up to the idea of Robert being town (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7918715#p7918715\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>).<br>\n<br>\nOn who might have suspected that Jake was an investigative, I don't see anything in Tyler's ISO (post-Jake's claim) to indicate that he caught on about Jake. Don't see any indication of that in Jaack's ISO either. So nothing to go on there.<br>\n<br>\nZachstral's reads are a little harder to look at as evidence for why scum would want to kill him. Zachstral made sarcastic votes, joked a lot and generally bounced around the game unpredictably. His last few posts showed he was townreading the Desmond slot (previously zakk and floof, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7921383#p7921383\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>) and that he was on board with a lynch of either Dunn or xyzzy (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7921443#p7921443\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>). Both have now flipped town. I went back a ways in the Zachstral ISO (not all the way through) and didn't see much clear indication of what his reads were other than that.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nLean Jaack on this one too, just because the Zachstral kill makes a little more sense if you think about it in terms of somebody who wanted to keep Robert alive.<br>\n<br>\nYep.

Come to think of it, Keyser was completely MIA during the zakk v. xy lynch choice battle. That was completely town game except for one person. Anyways, beside the point. Tyler's read on Keyser also bugs the fuck out of me and I think that's the main reason. Because it's the only reason, that's why it's paranoia. He said Keyser was \"pretty town tho\" when looking @ Creature. Which seems like a v. likely buddy stance to take. <br>\n<br>\nTool is the opposite.

I can only imagine that scum didn't suspect Jake as the cop, or Bins as the voyeur. I also suppose they probably thought there was still room for the Robertslot (later TOF) to be lynched, and so they didn't want to eliminate that slot.<br>\n<br>\nThat actually points toward scumJaack as well -- Jaack kept pushing for Robert after Robert's claim, and then continued the push into D2.<br>\n<br>\nTyler was one of the people who voted Rob after Rob's claim, but the difference is that Tyler didn't keep pushing it. Tyler said, I think 200 posts or so before Zachstral's NK, that he was warming up to the idea of Robert being town (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7918715#p7918715\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>).<br>\n<br>\nOn who might have suspected that Jake was an investigative, I don't see anything in Tyler's ISO (post-Jake's claim) to indicate that he caught on about Jake. Don't see any indication of that in Jaack's ISO either. So nothing to go on there.<br>\n<br>\nZachstral's reads are a little harder to look at as evidence for why scum would want to kill him. Zachstral made sarcastic votes, joked a lot and generally bounced around the game unpredictably. His last few posts showed he was townreading the Desmond slot (previously zakk and floof, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7921383#p7921383\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>) and that he was on board with a lynch of either Dunn or xyzzy (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7921443#p7921443\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>).

I can see both sides of it, I guess. The town explanation relies on Tyler being very sure I'm scum, which is why it would be justified for him to try to \"skip\" a day phase by going to what he thinks is going to be LyLo. Scum explanation would simply be that he thinks he has a better chance in LyLo against Jaack than he would against me.

Counterintuitive stuff like the line I was talking about were part of why I thought it was xyzzy and not you yesterday. But xyzzy has now been eliminated as a possibility, as have several other people I thought were scum instead of you, and so I know that I've been wrong about things. So I have to look at the reasons why I thought you and Tyler were both town and check them again.

Fair enough. But in that same post he votes Bins, right after Dunn begins pushing for a Bins wagon. It's the same MO as when he voted for Keyser, basically, but at this point he's putting reasoning behind it. So it kind of all comes together to look like ira was floating along trying to look active, then got criticized for it and came up with an excuse (I'm trying to get out of RVS) but also tried to escape the criticism by going to the next viable wagon he could find (Bins).

They settle on HA claiming doc. At this point I had thought that they would all have the same strategy, but they must have consciously planned against that. I guess it makes sense since Keyser was already bussing HA that he would doubtcast on HA's claim and continue pushing him while Tyler, who'd been voting ira, goes another direction.<br>\n<br>\nSo Tyler hangs back to see how people react to HA's claim, and then ira comes in and claims BG. At this point the heat is turning up so Tyler feels compelled to come in. What's key here is that Tyler kind of avoided talking too much about the HA and ira claims, he throws out a snippet or two but he is also kind of pulling attention toward robert and floof at the time while distancing mildly from HA.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason that's important is that it explains the way Tyler reacted to the Robert claim too. It looks like Tyler was still searching for a way to not lynch HA that day. Tyler unvotes and then disappears for another two days (didn't post from April 29 to May 1). So Robert claims in #562, and Tyler's response is one consistent with scum trying to figure out whether there's anything there he can work with:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7887716#p7887716\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7887716#p7887716\" data-post-id=\"7887716\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 608</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27823\">Tyler the Creator</a> wrote:</cite>my take is that i don't like roberts play but i can't remember the last time scum misread their role pm whereas town do it once in a while<br>\n<br>\nim torn</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7887721#p7887721\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7887721#p7887721\" data-post-id=\"7887721\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 609</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27823\">Tyler the Creator</a> wrote:</cite>and i guess like what's the scum motive here? try and save a buddy?<br>\n<br>\nthat's a fools errand</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7887725#p7887725\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7887725#p7887725\" data-post-id=\"7887725\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 610</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27823\">Tyler the Creator</a> wrote:</cite>i kinda just wanna lynch ha before we out all our roles lmao</div></blockquote>\n\n...he arrives at the conclusion that there's probably not anything there.

HA claims doc and Tyler skirts the issue, then Robert claims and Tyler finds something that looks like a saving grace for scum and he goes for it...only to find that there actually isn't a whole lot of support for it, and so he goes back to bussing.", "time": "Sat Jun 25, 2016 10:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2525", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

If Tyler is scum, he is putting himself in an excellent position to win the game by lynching me.<br>\n<br>\nBefore Tyler's case, town was basically deciding between Jaack and xyzzy for today's lynch. ScumTyler would look at that and see this scenario playing out:<br>\n<br>\nTown lynches xyzzy today --&gt; Jaack tomorrow --&gt; then he has to convince town to lynch me in 3p LyLo<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, laying down a case on me early would be a crucial step for scumTyler winning the game. It would put him in the exact position he would need to be in, which would be lynching xyzzy and then Jaack (in any order) and then getting the last remaining town to vote me so he could hammer for the win.<br>\n<br>\nAnd if he could get me lynched today, it would be even better for him. Because who would really think to lynch Tyler over Jaack or xyzzy if I was out of the picture?<br>\n<br>\nIn short, if Tyler is scum then I think I was the biggest obstacle between him and victory because I was the least-suspected of the remaining town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">That was all what I thought at first upon seeing Tyler's case.</div><br>\n<br>\nOne of the first things that started bugging me about the scumTyler scenario was why he would wait until halfway through the day phase to pull out his case on me. Why not just come into today swinging at me? That would make more sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nWhat <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> messes it up is that xyzzy is actually pushing me now as well. And that looks awfully good for scumXyzzy as well, because if xyzzy is the last scum then they would at this point be clawing for life. Xyzzy's suspicion of me essentially rides the coattails of Tyler's case, and in fact the post where they voted me looks pretty bad.<br>\n<br>\nLook at what they said: That lynching either me or Jaack would provide info. Not that one or either of us looks like scum, but that lynching us would provide info. It just looks to me like self-consciousness of the need to justify their vote to town -- not to mention that it leaves a back door open for the next most likely lynch option not named xyzzy.<br>\n<br>\nAnother problem with a scenario where Tyler is scum is that it contradicts my theory about scum approaching HA's claim in the same way. That's part of why I was so taken aback when Tyler first posted his case and I started really thinking he might be the last scum. Now that xyzzy's jumped back in, well, I'm not sure. I'm still pretty wary of Tyler, but perhaps he really did just happen to go back in my ISO and psych himself into thinking I was scum.<br>\n<br>\nSince we are approaching deadline...<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xyzzy</span></div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Post with same points made but abridged slightly</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote><div><cite>tool wrote:</cite>Wanted to hear from Tyler.

And how low-activity he was too. That does go against what I remember of his town game, and Creature's entrance today fits scum very well. I am thinking atm that if Creature flips scum then Jaack would be less likely to be partner -- in which case I think I'd be looking at xyzzy based on PoE.<br>\n<br>\n(that's because of the scum-acting-together idea I had wrt to HA's claim -- Keyserslot voted HA without hesitation after HA's claim and didn't go for Robert, whereas Tyler did go for Robert. Ergo, Creature/Tyler is not as likely a scumteam as Creature/Xyzzy)<br>\n<br>\nAnd somebody (think it was tyler) made a good point about Jaack's ballsiness throughout the game. He's gone for basically everything it would be convenient for scum to go for -- Robert after he made one bad post to open the game, Robert again when he messed up his macho claim, Dunn when he gambited. It seems a little brazen for scum, and while I can see scum doing it...well, it goes back to what I talked about at the beginning of the game, where there was this feeling that scum just wasn't doing a whole lot. It'd make sense for scum to have a lot of low-key players, and Jaack hasn't been low-key.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically the more I think about it the more I think Creature is a good lynch today.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Creature</span><br>\n<br>\nThat's L-2</div></blockquote>\n\nok so like<br>\n<br>\ni was using this as my reason for thinking tool was town <br>\n<br>\nbut then i realized something <br>\n<br>\nthe only big post/cases tool made in the game.. gee there weren't a lot of them <br>\nthis post is so out of place now that i'm looking at tool's other posts eh", "time": "Sun Jul 03, 2016 4:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66258&start=2625", "forum": "53", "thread": "66258"}

Fair enough. But in that same post he votes Bins, right after Dunn begins pushing for a Bins wagon. It's the same MO as when he voted for Keyser, basically, but at this point he's putting reasoning behind it. So it kind of all comes together to look like ira was floating along trying to look active, then got criticized for it and came up with an excuse (I'm trying to get out of RVS) but also tried to escape the criticism by going to the next viable wagon he could find (Bins).
