This is the start of the game, and lylo. Start of the game, everybody is on their own and trying to figure out where this game is going to go. Come lylo, every townie is going to second guess themselves a couple of times and it becomes really hard to predict where they put their money (how do they think they were being fooled so far etc). In between it's easy, you can sort of tell where town is going to go, know what the possible lynches are, play accordingly. But first appearances count and it's hard to get it right.<br><br>Now the pace of this game isn't amazing, but it's now slow either. There are some people with reads and it's going underway. Hier is about to miss the boat, and still doesn't know how to respond properly. Normal town wouldn't care, you just see the last couple of posts and comment on it. So we have someone here who wants to watch which way the wind blows, and as such stands out compared to the tempo of the townies we've seen so far. That's scumtell one.<br><br>The second is the list itself. There are two reasons to make lists. One's to get organised and present otherwise cluttered info. The other is to make sure you actually get something posted beyond a oneliner. This is the last. Page 4, too little has happened that commenting to 1 or 2 events wouldn't do. There's no use at all to post that for half of the game, you don't have a read yet. Again, hier's perfectly aware there should be a post from her here. By absence of something comfortable to post about, the safety of a rigid structure is sought and found in posting a list with a little bit non-information about everybody. At least that way you get something on first sight good looking posted. But it makes no sense to do it when we've had barely 2 pages of non rvs posting. <br><br>I guess if you look hard you could even find support for the last in that"}

You answer Dwlee who was saying it was too early to have an actual read, by showing him an \"actual\" reason for a read - but first, the reasoning behind that read just doesn't hold together (this post has already been shot down for that by Dwlee, herrcombs, Keyser - nothing to add to what they already told), and second, if you actually read Garmr for that, why would you keep your vote on herrcombs? Your vote on herrcombs was originally based on a joke and an ethereal scumslip, so how would that be less scummy than an actual point?<br><br>Before anything else, I have a few questions for you: what was the point asking people about RVS? What was herrcombs's scum slip? And also, everything ever said about 37.</div></blockquote><br>This is a bad post. Let's break down your read of mykonian;<br><br>8 - Nothing read-worthy. (Null)<br>12 and 16 - A bit convoluted and arbitrary but that's RVS (Null)<br>20 - You don't get his 'herrcombs scum slipped'. (Null)<br>34 - Not alignment indicative but giving you scum vibes (lol what?) (Null)<br>37 - OK, this one is a valid point as I asked the same thing - I didn't understand why mykonian hadn't voted Garmr when he had reasons to scum read him.<br><br>This post was a whole lot of words that really didn't say much - a busy post.<br><br>I'm watching you Felissan."}

Town players vote for those they believe to be Mafia. Mafia players vote for those they know to be Town (except when voting players they know to be Mafia, which is presumably less frequent).

Dwlee pushes against it and by 120/121 from bbt, momentum is lost. I am pretty sure that sentence is garmr thinking he's in the winning position as long as I push against him, since people voted me for it. A high postcount isn't always beneficial for one's survival. So don't think garmr thinks he can get me off him, I think he believes he can get me lynched."}

It pretty much just invites/instigates myko to tunnel him forever. It seems way too cocky to reasonably post as scum when myko is the most active poster in the game. I can't imagine him posting this as scum who thinks that it'll get myko off his back. I can't imagine him posting it as scum who is so overconfident that they want to boast. If I see a good justification for scum posting this then I might join the Garmr wagon.</div></blockquote><br><br>Momentum was decently against me at that point (decently quick wagon, 4 votes), and such wagons have gotten steam before, could have happened here. Dwlee pushes against it and by 120/121 from bbt, momentum is lost. I am pretty sure that sentence is garmr thinking he's in the winning position as long as I push against him, since people voted me for it. A high postcount isn't always beneficial for one's survival. So don't think garmr thinks he can get me off him, I think he believes he can get me lynched.</div></blockquote><br>Eh. Still doesn't seem too likely to me. I can see it as possible but I don't feel like scum-Garmr would be that concerned with making a post like that. His claim is also town. <br><br>Also don't think Hiei is scum. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Hiei wrote:</cite>I made that readlist, you're right, to contribute a little bit more than a one-liner. I'm not sure how that's scum-oriented?<br>I'm not being helpful if all my opinions are all jumbled in my head. So why not share it, even if it's minor? <br>This is the fastest pace game I've played in. I do hate missing the boat. </div></blockquote><br>This blurb felt genuine to me. It feels defensive in a genuine way. At the very least it assuages me of any feeling that Hiei's reads list was particularly scummy. Doing something like that in a fast-paced game to try to keep up as town seems reasonable to me. The \"why an I not surprised at my wagon\" line also felt not like something scum is likely to say."}

Another reason I took the break was when I came back I could see to how people would react with out my presence because I didn't want to fill 70 the chat with Me vs myko<br><br><br>Anyway what I got about three town reads out of it i'll do the scum reads after because tbh I'm lazy and it be interesting to see how people react.<br><br><br>Dwlee- He has been fighting hard for it and has a much better case than myko ever did even through it's still wrong and flawed in places. What I don't like is how he was pretty defensive of myko yet at the time myko had the best on him this worries me a lot. Also I feel like Dwelee is pushing for the fact That I am scum yet he refuses to listen to what others have to say when is criticed In a way that makes him come across as a stubborn townie rather than stubborn scum.<br><br>Heirama-I find this slot to be town. Because I don't really see a scum slot trying to push me to replace out and waste a potential mislynch that is the first big sign. Other than that heirs play has been consistent and I can see logic in pretty much all heirs posts.<br><br>Implosion-His debate with myko makes me lean more toward the town side. It looks like he his trying to convince myko of his point of view. As he thinks we are both town I think this falls in line with someone with a town mindset. He also shows more town hunting than scum hunting through scum hunting is there  process of elimination is also a thing."}

Calling another player after a very short back-and-forth \"either a worthless town or a worthless scum\", and then dehumanizing him by calling him \"it\"... No clue if this is a matter of playstyle or if he's getting super bent out of shape because his 37 was jumped on, or what. But it doesn't seem like myko is working to get past it, either way. Just seems to be instigating a fight with Dwlee.

I don\u2019t necessarily agree with his vote on Keyser, since myko was pushing Dwlee a LOT harder at that point in time than Keyser was, he just hadn't voted yet. There is a lot of ambivalent wording in Dier's posts \u2013 \u201cI could see that coming from mafia,\u201d \u201cnot a particularly strong case but not a particularly weak one,\u201d \u201cI could see that from mafia,\u201d etc. - which I know a lot of people see as scummy, but I don't necessarily think that's alignment-indicative. There are plenty of people who tend to be wishy-washy as either alignment. The fact that he has only posted 12 times in 112 pages is definitely problematic, I feel like he\u2019s just sort of jumping in with opportunistic votes. While I don\u2019t particularly like his play this game, I\u2019m not confident in reading him as scum, because he does have a few good posts where he genuinely seems to be trying to sort the game, but I wish he would post more."}

His reads on Garmr and Mykonian are in tune with mine, and his interaction with DWL around the claim was solid. He's my best bet for Town on my wagon (actually, did Lelandra ever get around to following your instructions for a vote?).<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DWL</span> is likely Town, although a bit jumpy over the potential association with Lelandra. I'd hesitate to endorse many of his reads, but maybe he'll find his feet later.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Felissan</span> has been flying below my radar. I wouldn't mind hearing more from him.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Herrcombs</span>, too, doesn't feature much in my notes. I guess that I like the English-to-English translator thing that he's got going on--it feels reasonably Town-motivated.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hieirama</span> remains suspicious to me, mostly for seeming too defensive in interactions with Mykonian.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mykonian</span> seems to be stuck in a tunnel, but I'd read him as Town.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lelandra</span> certainly bears watching. Voting for Garmr without actually reading him as Mafia is troubling, though now I need to reference that against Hieirama's activity.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Pistachion</span> is moderately suspicious. Unlike some of the others (Felissan, Herrcombs), the relative lack of content feels more intentional, and if I decide that you're not Mafia, Pistachion would be a good bet for Mafia on Garmr's wagon.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Keyser</span> has been absent for a long time. I was feeling good about him before he left, though.<br><br>That brings me to you!

According to his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7253063#p7253063\">284</a>, it's because \"Garmr's posts are townie,\" but it appears that DWL wasn't even aware why he was on Garmr's wagon to begin with. Was it a wagon on a scummy player? Was it a PL? Seems like a mix of both, and to me, it shows that DWL lacked conviction on the Garmr wagon and was just waiting to see whether there'd be enough popular support to keep it rolling.<br><br>But DWL's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7253715#p7253715\">286</a> screams town to me.

Not sure what to think of the points made to the effect that BP is the easiest scum fakeclaim.

I think it's a bit sheepy though, especially since I detailed my initial scumread of Hieirama due to a combination of her early posts, and Lalendra just kinda simplified it without adding anything new. I can't precisely follow Lalendra's thought process and read development, especially the phrase \"made some interesting points\" as a reason for leaning more noobtown. I'm not a big fan of the word \"interesting\" -- I think it's a buzzword that doesn't really convey an opinion and it's easy to hide behind.<br><br>In my reread, I saw some scummy things and some townie things in Lalendra's posts, so this would stick out as an example of the former. I am currently leaning more scum than town on her. I don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7254206#p7254206\">312</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7257733#p7257733\">375</a>, and how they followed the end of her <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252895#p7252895\">276</a>. She says she's not a fan of policy lynches, and she unvoted Garmr because it looked like he wasn't going to be anti-town anymore, yet it's her preferred lynch later in 312 and she would \"compromise\" on Dier as an alternative. If you have an actual scummy read, instead of just a PL target, wouldn't you prefer to lynch scum? Or if you don't have a scumread you feel better about voting, why not scumhunt to find one? I don't understand."}

Haschel seems to think that Lalendra being interested in a Dier wagon for information is not the proper way too go about it. (even though that is the point of wagons, correct?) Even if what Haschel pointed out is a scum tell it should be a FoS and isn't deserving a vote.</div></blockquote>This is probably getting into Philosophy (see sig), but I don't believe that votes are inherently pressureful.  In fact, a pressure vote that is explicitly stated to be a pressure vote applies no pressure at all, because the target knows it's not being cast out of a desire to see a lynch.  So yeah, when I see somebody apply a self-described pressure vote and then not actually pressure the player, yeah, I think that's scummy.  And don't tell me what \"should\" be an FoS; I think it's worthy of a vote.  If you don't, then that fact is duly noted."}

His decision to stay on Garmr after making that case on Hieirama felt to me like Town on a mission (hence not switching to Hieirama). His vote didn't move much but he was paying attention to other players, and his activity level is high enough for me to give him points for not lurking."}

My default town-read on him is deteriorating to the point where I can understand the argument that he's scum.

I say they're useless in that they accomplished nothing, but more importantly, they were both anti-town.<br><br>Garmr makes the argument today that D1 was basically over when he hammered, but that's not true. There were several outstanding questions that could have been answered (some of which were on the same page as the hammer). He says that \"people were putting intentions to hammer,\" but the only person to actually do that was DWL and it's been established that he wasn't going to immediately end the day. His arguments that his quickhammer wasn't anti-town (and wasn't even a quickhammer) just don't cut it for me. His change of mind from \"I'm in no rush for the day to end\" to a quickhammer the very next IRL day also looks really bad to me. <br><br>It feels like Garmr is taking a sledgehammer to this game, like he doesn't really give a fuck about the damage he does, and this could be a scum tactic to take out as much as he can before he's finally lynched. Not going to vote him and put him to L-1 right now though. If he's town, I don't want to risk having such a short D2 and have it end by lynching the BP, of all things. I have other people I am still interested in and I want to see if Garmr redeems himself today."}

Scum want to sit on the fence, not giving any strong opinions, so when the wind blows just right, they can opportunistically jump on the town-consensus and not look suspicious. By giving actual opinions and suspicions, you put your own thoughts at risk and scrutiny. Scum don't like to be scrutinized. Town don't give a shit because they have nothing to hide.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Read, assumption, what's the difference again?</div></blockquote><br>Assumptions are, by definition, something you take for granted without backing proof or evidence. Reads (I think of them synonymous with arguments) require evidence to build and sustain. Throughout the game, reads develop based on new evidence that is presented. By demonstrating your reads are updating to events of the game, you show that you are thinking about the game and trying to solve who is scum. Scum will try to spin narratives and try to make the evidence fit their reads, rather than the other way around. After all, they're trying to mislynch the town, so they are required to lie to achieve their wincon.<br><br>So this is why I keep asking you for specific information. I want to see if your thought process is consistent with your play, and whether you're just trying to look townie or actually trying to figure out the game. I have not been satisfied with your responses to my queries. I asked you earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7246851#p7246851\">169</a>) for your thoughts including your top scum read. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Your answer?</span> In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7247399#p7247399\">180</a> you referred me to your super-early readlist which came like 100 posts earlier.

I was like you D1, where I wanted to believe his BP claim at its face, and I didn't want the wagon to go through in case we lynched a PR D1. However, over time I noticed things from him that began to look scummy, including his change-of-mind at the end of D1 up to and including his hammer, that were making me reconsider my read.

You responded \"That quickhammer though\" immediately after it happened, which indicated you thought it was strange. And you later told me \"the message that went along with it made sense.\" Which message? Was the message alignment-indicative (anyone in this game, scum or town, can produce posts that \"make sense\")? Does it excuse Garmr, who had stated \"I am in [no] rush to end the day\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7260158#p7260158\">412</a>), and then quickhammered without warning 16 hours later?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You asked me my opinions on Garmr and I said I assumed he was Town.

By demonstrating your reads are updating to events of the game, you show that you are thinking about the game and trying to solve who is scum. Scum will try to spin narratives and try to make the evidence fit their reads, rather than the other way around.

However, I like how he's been pushing on several different people today. Pushing the game forward is townie in my eyes.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Garmr: Scumlean.</span> On the one hand, his BP claim was so abrupt as was his quickhammer, that it could be reckless-town who simply has little patience for the game. However, I don't like how he's being so blatantly anti-town, trying to spin it as not-scummy, nor do I like how he gives zero attention to people who were/are not on his wagon. His tunnel on Lalendra feels like it's sucking the energy out of the game.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Haschel: Null.</span> His RVS opening made me really uncomfortable, but a cursory meta inspection reveals that he does that same thing every game. I don't like how he never answered questions about it, but oh well... He's been doing very little, is suspiciously inactive, but I do like his push on Hiei especially in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7271236#p7271236\">478</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7271324#p7271324\">483</a>. Not a lot to talk about, but I'd like to see more from him so I can get a better read.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DWL: Town.</span> Although I've pinged out a lot of stuff he said in pages 9-11, a lot of his posts since them seem town enough. He looks like he's trying to logically figure out the game, even if he's confused at times. I identify with a lot of what he's saying, especially in the Lalendra vs Garmr argument.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Meanmelter: Null-town.</span> I like the depth with which he caught up. I agree with most of his points against Garmr. And he also seems to be pushing on other people, trying to straighten up their logic and read consistency. Can't see much I don't like from melter. Would like him to post more though.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hieirama: Scumlean*.</span> I give it the asterisk because it's exactly the type of noobtown I've lynched in the past for lapses in logic or lack of proactive scumhunting that could just as easily come from noobtown as noobscum. I will be keeping an eye on her though, I feel as the game goes on she will become easier to read.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mykonian: Town.</span> I like how he's using his activity to push the game further. Earlier in D1, I felt like he was just posting to post and build up fluff in the thread, but he's redeeming himself in my eyes. i thought he was being overdefensive early on, but I'm led to believe it's just a matter of playstyle and not alignment-indicative.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lalendra: Scumlean.</span> I'll talk about this more below, but I didn't like her push against Garmr as a PL yesterday. I discussed this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7257641#p7257641\">374</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7259676#p7259676\">408</a>. I don't like how she keeps blindly tunneling on Garmr paying attention to no one else... Although I'm curious why she thinks Dier is so obvscum? I'm missing something obviously, because I can't see in her ISO where she has a single cohesive reason to think Dier is so blatantly scum.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Keyser Soze: Null-town. </span> I think I remember reading a few of Soze's older Newbie games, and he always seemed pretty eccentric as town, interacting more directly with people in real-time. I think he's fallen under my radar this game though. Upon inspection of his ISO, he seems readily willing to scour peoples' ISOs to figure out where they're coming from. The walls strike me as different than his playstyle I witnessed previously, but I still see town-value in them. I haven't really found anything that specifically pings me as scummy from Soze's posts.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BBT: Null-town.</span> I really liked his play D1, but I am a bit baffled by his D2 play for reasons others have already mentioned. Why ignore the work people have already put in D2, declare a lynchpool that consists of the last few people on the pistachio wagon yesterday, and take nothing else into consideration? I don't see scum-motivation in that, but I don't particularly understand why he's taking this approach now.<br><br>Ok, it's time for me to weigh in on the Lalendra vs Garmr thing: it's obnoxious, and I don't think it's TvT. I'm almost considering a world in which they're both scum, just because the degree of tunneling on each other is draining this game of life and is making it painful to follow. Thing is, it seems like I have to pick a side, because they're not backing down from each other any time soon.<br><br>Gun to my head, I'm going to say Lalendra is scum over Garmr. Starting with her Dierfire case -- What is it? She says he's obvscum, but I've never seen her substantiate that. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7271295#p7271295\">480</a> comes off as super strange to me. Then, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7272283#p7272283\">497</a> seems incredibly myopic. Why not use a flip, try to analyze a wagon, and see what you find? Why just shrug it all off, saying \"I can't really disagree with anyone on the wagon cause I was all for the lynch?\"<br><br>I do think that Lalendra was misrepping Garmr in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7272325#p7272325\">498</a>. Even though I agree that Garmr responded rather emotionally, sometimes incoherently, to some of meanmelter's points, Lalendra simplified it in a way that brushed away the evidence that didn't fit her read and just made it easier to vote for Garmr. She continues to do this scummy simplification/misrepresentation, I pointed it out once earlier in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7259676#p7259676\">408</a> when she sheeped my read on Hieirama. <br><br>Lalendra's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7285298#p7285298\">652</a> seems really weird, especially since she hasn't pushed on Dier at all today. Why is Dier \"so obvscum?\" I am getting frustrated too, in part because Garmr's ISO is so hard to follow and my mind is swimming from all the defensiveness and the constant tunneling. But I am more bothered by how Lalendra is trying so hard to push the lynch, while not substantiating it well, and ignoring most else in the process.<br><br>Garmr's case against Lalendra <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7283591#p7283591\">630</a> also seems rather well put together, and I can agree with many of the presented points (I think I've mentioned a few myself earlier).<br><br>Ugh, my head hurts. I need to make smaller, more frequent posts, or I'm going to find it increasingly difficult to stay involved in this game.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lalendra</span> L-2"}

Dier also wasn't the only one town-reading Dwlee at that point, so this makes even more sense in light of that. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with his vote on Keyser, since myko was pushing Dwlee a LOT harder at that point in time than Keyser was, he just hadn't voted yet. There is a lot of ambivalent wording in Dier's posts \u2013 \u201cI could see that coming from mafia,\u201d \u201cnot a particularly strong case but not a particularly weak one,\u201d \u201cI could see that from mafia,\u201d etc. - which I know a lot of people see as scummy, but I don't necessarily think that's alignment-indicative. There are plenty of people who tend to be wishy-washy as either alignment. The fact that he has only posted 12 times in 112 pages is definitely problematic, I feel like he\u2019s just sort of jumping in with opportunistic votes.

He hasn't really done much to earn him this amount of scum attention and there are worse offenders in this game. The way he was wagoned by my scum reads would nudge him more to town side through. Look how myko has been hard pushing me all day if he actually thought I was scum then he would continue pushing. I feel like scum is having a hard time getting me lynched because there's to many players that aren't new alive. Also haschel is probably the easiest wagon to quick lynch at the moment so this would explain why so many supporters of my wagon are thinking of jumping in this direction.<br><br>Basically his a null pushed town due the actions of other around him. I know it's bad to make assumptions but Looking at how certain I am lalendra is scum I feel like it's a safe assumption that scum would rather risk a easy lynch when a important scum power is on the line (which I'm assuming lalendra is.)."}

Garmr gets huge scum points in my book for trying to do this against the remaining mason(s)' will, and for making it easier for scum to hunt them down by pressuring DWL to confirm/deny his role. I'm beginning to feel more strongly that Garmr is scum who's just super ballsy with his anti-town behavior. I just don't see town playing this kind of risk, lemme break it down -- If Garmr's wrong about Lalendra, then his 'plan' directly kills two PRs, one at night, and the other gets lynched the next day. Actually, if Garmr is town and felt so strongly about Lala being scum, he wouldn't bother with this whole runaround. He'd just want to lynch Lala today. That way, we would still have conftown more likely to survive until later.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7321177#p7321177\" class=\"postlink\">post 966</a>, Meanmelter wrote:</cite>I do not recall you not feeling townie agbout Keyser?

I wanted real answers to my questions in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322920#p7322920\">984</a>, not just fencesitting without having reread the game and without indicating a desire to figure out the game to any depth. I can't take your reads seriously, Hieirama, if you just make posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7320479#p7320479\">955</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a> without substantiation, and continue not to substantiate them after being pressured.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7328016#p7328016\" class=\"postlink\">post 1014</a>, Meanmelter wrote:</cite>So what are your opinions on me, then?</div></blockquote><br><br>I think that you have tunneled Garmr the entire game, and whether you are town or scum, it has left sort of a blind spot for other things that have been going on. That being said, I can see your push against Garmr as a town push. You have made several good points that I agree with, so that prompted my question to Hieirama when she said \"not liking how anti-Garmr Meanmelter is being\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a>. I think there are points in your push against Garmr that appear to be misrepresented (e.g. the phrase at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a> \"You went from AFK one line posts to softclaiming out of the blue...\" it's not clear whether you were trying to say Garmr was afk before he claimed, or rather that the style of his posts were afk-one-liners.) However, I think Garmr is totally overblowing how all of your posts are \"shit\" and misreps and strawmen and w/e. I think in your interactions with Garmr, Garmr looks way worse. I think Garmr complains about misreps and strawmen, all the while misrepresenting you and making strawman arguments. So I'm not liking Garmr atm.<br><br>Note to self: I should come back to myko's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7328962#p7328962\">1027</a> once I have some more time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\" class=\"postlink\">post 1030</a>, mykonian wrote:</cite>I think today I'd like to go with the theory that garmr and mean are the two remaining scum. It makes sense on a couple of levels.</div></blockquote><br><br>Could you explain the levels on which this association makes sense? I'm not seeing this conclusion as readily as you are atm. Ever since meanmelter replaced in, do you think the aggression that he's shown towards Garmr is not unlikely to occur between two scum?<br><br>Reading Garmr's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7239428#p7239428\">1040</a>, ok he's actually making a few decent points here. Like his point about the line from MM's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a>. However (let's look at the FACT THAT WASN\"T TRUE line), Garmr, you have it wrong. Your only scumreads D2 were people who were either voting you or considering it. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7275059#p7275059\">530</a>. I even called you out on this, and you sheepishly dropped your contrived scumread on me like a bad habit. Your scumread on feli D1 was AFTER he had first scumread you (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252644#p7252644\">270</a>). Same with myko. Why does this matter? Because it looks like you're only interested in lynching people who want to kill you. Your scumhunting revolves around yourself. It looks like you're looking inward, not outward, and that is scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7332266#p7332266\" class=\"postlink\">post 1044</a>, Meanmelter wrote:</cite>The mafia are NOT killing people who see you as town. I do not recall BBT calling you town,</div></blockquote><br><br>This is actually not true. BBT was pretty sure Garmr is town. Just look at his interaction with Garmr at the end of D2. And his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7283826#p7283826\">636</a>, he outright said that the Garmr wagon was bad.<br><br>Holy crap this back-and-forth between Garmr and Mean is painful. It's basically Garmr going, \"Mean did this,\" mean replies \"No I didn't,\" then Garmr goes \"Yeah you did.\" For the record Garmr, if you make claims about someone, the burden is on YOU to prove their validity. If you claim that Mean \"says i provided no reads or anything,\" and he denies saying that, then it's your responsibility to show where he in fact said it. If you claim that Mean \"tried to dispel my reads as only people that scum read me,\" and mean says he did no such thing, it is your responsibility to either show where he in fact said it, or admit that you're lying. Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7332513#p7332513\">1045</a> just looks like you're trying to back yourself out of responsibility of claims you've made against mean. \"really can't be bothered with these anwsers as they do nothing to change my points,\" well your points don't mean much if they're false to begin with. As scum, this makes complete sense, because you're using hyperbole to fabricate a case to get someone lynched. If you're town, it just means that you are lazy in how you throw shit around, making claims that aren't verifiable, exaggerating because you feel a certain way about a slot. I'm leaning towards the former.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Garmr</span>"}

Garmr gets huge scum points in my book for trying to do this against the remaining mason(s)' will, and for making it easier for scum to hunt them down by pressuring DWL to confirm/deny his role. I'm beginning to feel more strongly that Garmr is scum who's just super ballsy with his anti-town behavior. I just don't see town playing this kind of risk, lemme break it down -- If Garmr's wrong about Lalendra, then his 'plan' directly kills two PRs, one at night, and the other gets lynched the next day. Actually, if Garmr is town and felt so strongly about Lala being scum, he wouldn't bother with this whole runaround. He'd just want to lynch Lala today. That way, we would still have conftown more likely to survive until later.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7321177#p7321177\" class=\"postlink\">post 966</a>, Meanmelter wrote:</cite>I do not recall you not feeling townie agbout Keyser?

That being said, I can see your push against Garmr as a town push. You have made several good points that I agree with, so that prompted my question to Hieirama when she said \"not liking how anti-Garmr Meanmelter is being\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a>. I think there are points in your push against Garmr that appear to be misrepresented (e.g. the phrase at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a> \"You went from AFK one line posts to softclaiming out of the blue...\" it's not clear whether you were trying to say Garmr was afk before he claimed, or rather that the style of his posts were afk-one-liners.) However, I think Garmr is totally overblowing how all of your posts are \"shit\" and misreps and strawmen and w/e. I think in your interactions with Garmr, Garmr looks way worse. I think Garmr complains about misreps and strawmen, all the while misrepresenting you and making strawman arguments. So I'm not liking Garmr atm.<br><br>Note to self: I should come back to myko's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7328962#p7328962\">1027</a> once I have some more time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\" class=\"postlink\">post 1030</a>, mykonian wrote:</cite>I think today I'd like to go with the theory that garmr and mean are the two remaining scum.

Like his point about the line from MM's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a>. However (let's look at the FACT THAT WASN\"T TRUE line), Garmr, you have it wrong. Your only scumreads D2 were people who were either voting you or considering it. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7275059#p7275059\">530</a>. I even called you out on this, and you sheepishly dropped your contrived scumread on me like a bad habit. Your scumread on feli D1 was AFTER he had first scumread you (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252644#p7252644\">270</a>). Same with myko. Why does this matter? Because it looks like you're only interested in lynching people who want to kill you. Your scumhunting revolves around yourself. It looks like you're looking inward, not outward, and that is scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7332266#p7332266\" class=\"postlink\">post 1044</a>, Meanmelter wrote:</cite>The mafia are NOT killing people who see you as town. I do not recall BBT calling you town,</div></blockquote><br><br>This is actually not true. BBT was pretty sure Garmr is town. Just look at his interaction with Garmr at the end of D2. And his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7283826#p7283826\">636</a>, he outright said that the Garmr wagon was bad.<br><br>Holy crap this back-and-forth between Garmr and Mean is painful. It's basically Garmr going, \"Mean did this,\" mean replies \"No I didn't,\" then Garmr goes \"Yeah you did.\" For the record Garmr, if you make claims about someone, the burden is on YOU to prove their validity. If you claim that Mean \"says i provided no reads or anything,\" and he denies saying that, then it's your responsibility to show where he in fact said it. If you claim that Mean \"tried to dispel my reads as only people that scum read me,\" and mean says he did no such thing, it is your responsibility to either show where he in fact said it, or admit that you're lying. Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7332513#p7332513\">1045</a> just looks like you're trying to back yourself out of responsibility of claims you've made against mean. \"really can't be bothered with these anwsers as they do nothing to change my points,\" well your points don't mean much if they're false to begin with. As scum, this makes complete sense, because you're using hyperbole to fabricate a case to get someone lynched. If you're town, it just means that you are lazy in how you throw shit around, making claims that aren't verifiable, exaggerating because you feel a certain way about a slot. I'm leaning towards the former.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Garmr</span></div></blockquote><br><br><br>do you think this comes from a derp town who didn't bother to read the convo between me and melta or scum?"}

If you wanna be realistic you've done more harm than good for the town. Not only do you make it where scum will seek to target other candidates more likely to be power roles than yourself, but you also made it where you pushed a Doc to claim. This is based on the analogy that Lale really is a doc by the way, which I am still on the fence about. However I believe that your BP claim was merely a method to make it where others will not suspect you of being scum since there is no evidence you have to provide us as proof that your claim is legit.

Garmr gets huge scum points in my book for trying to do this against the remaining mason(s)' will, and for making it easier for scum to hunt them down by pressuring DWL to confirm/deny his role. I'm beginning to feel more strongly that Garmr is scum who's just super ballsy with his anti-town behavior. I just don't see town playing this kind of risk, lemme break it down -- If Garmr's wrong about Lalendra, then his 'plan' directly kills two PRs, one at night, and the other gets lynched the next day. Actually, if Garmr is town and felt so strongly about Lala being scum, he wouldn't bother with this whole runaround. He'd just want to lynch Lala today.

I can't take your reads seriously, Hieirama, if you just make posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7320479#p7320479\">955</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a> without substantiation, and continue not to substantiate them after being pressured.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7328016#p7328016\" class=\"postlink\">post 1014</a>, Meanmelter wrote:</cite>So what are your opinions on me, then?</div></blockquote><br><br>I think that you have tunneled Garmr the entire game, and whether you are town or scum, it has left sort of a blind spot for other things that have been going on. That being said, I can see your push against Garmr as a town push. You have made several good points that I agree with, so that prompted my question to Hieirama when she said \"not liking how anti-Garmr Meanmelter is being\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a>. I think there are points in your push against Garmr that appear to be misrepresented (e.g. the phrase at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a> \"You went from AFK one line posts to softclaiming out of the blue...\" it's not clear whether you were trying to say Garmr was afk before he claimed, or rather that the style of his posts were afk-one-liners.) However, I think Garmr is totally overblowing how all of your posts are \"shit\" and misreps and strawmen and w/e. I think in your interactions with Garmr, Garmr looks way worse. I think Garmr complains about misreps and strawmen, all the while misrepresenting you and making strawman arguments. So I'm not liking Garmr atm.<br><br>Note to self: I should come back to myko's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7328962#p7328962\">1027</a> once I have some more time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\" class=\"postlink\">post 1030</a>, mykonian wrote:</cite>I think today I'd like to go with the theory that garmr and mean are the two remaining scum.

However (let's look at the FACT THAT WASN\"T TRUE line), Garmr, you have it wrong. Your only scumreads D2 were people who were either voting you or considering it. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7275059#p7275059\">530</a>. I even called you out on this, and you sheepishly dropped your contrived scumread on me like a bad habit. Your scumread on feli D1 was AFTER he had first scumread you (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252644#p7252644\">270</a>). Same with myko. Why does this matter? Because it looks like you're only interested in lynching people who want to kill you. Your scumhunting revolves around yourself.

I do not recall BBT calling you town,</div></blockquote><br><br>This is actually not true. BBT was pretty sure Garmr is town. Just look at his interaction with Garmr at the end of D2. And his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7283826#p7283826\">636</a>, he outright said that the Garmr wagon was bad.<br><br>Holy crap this back-and-forth between Garmr and Mean is painful. It's basically Garmr going, \"Mean did this,\" mean replies \"No I didn't,\" then Garmr goes \"Yeah you did.\" For the record Garmr, if you make claims about someone, the burden is on YOU to prove their validity. If you claim that Mean \"says i provided no reads or anything,\" and he denies saying that, then it's your responsibility to show where he in fact said it. If you claim that Mean \"tried to dispel my reads as only people that scum read me,\" and mean says he did no such thing, it is your responsibility to either show where he in fact said it, or admit that you're lying. Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7332513#p7332513\">1045</a> just looks like you're trying to back yourself out of responsibility of claims you've made against mean. \"really can't be bothered with these anwsers as they do nothing to change my points,\" well your points don't mean much if they're false to begin with. As scum, this makes complete sense, because you're using hyperbole to fabricate a case to get someone lynched. If you're town, it just means that you are lazy in how you throw shit around, making claims that aren't verifiable, exaggerating because you feel a certain way about a slot.

However, the events of today make me townread Mean for a few reasons. Namely, Garmr's push against Mean seems buried in false accusations and hyperbole that have been challenged, and then ignored by Garmr. I don't understand why as town, Garmr needs to do this. The evidence he and others have presented so far does not compel me to vote for Mean, and furthermore, it makes me believe the Mean wagon is scum driven. I don't feel comfortable joining that wagon with two of my scumreads (Garmr and Hiei) on it. (Although it looks like Hiei is being force-replaced out, which I still have no idea how to feel about.)<br><br>This game has stagnated and it seems people are content letting the dichotomy between Garmr and Mean go unchallenged. Then again, we have less than four days left so I'm guessing we'll end up choosing between the two unless someone has strong feelings about someone else."}

However, the events of today make me townread Mean for a few reasons. Namely, Garmr's push against Mean seems buried in false accusations and hyperbole that have been challenged, and then ignored by Garmr. I don't understand why as town, Garmr needs to do this. The evidence he and others have presented so far does not compel me to vote for Mean, and furthermore, it makes me believe the Mean wagon is scum driven. I don't feel comfortable joining that wagon with two of my scumreads (Garmr and Hiei) on it. (Although it looks like Hiei is being force-replaced out, which I still have no idea how to feel about.)<br><br>This game has stagnated and it seems people are content letting the dichotomy between Garmr and Mean go unchallenged.

Later, he accused me of not being \"specific\" with my reasoning why his case against meanmelter was bad.

You've been repeatedly anti-town with an early PR claim, a quickhammer, and rolefishing (yes I'm bringing this up again so FUCK OFF), your pushes have been full of logical holes, and your \"scumhunting\" amounts to tunneling day-to-day on people who are easy mislynch targets.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7374256#p7374256\" class=\"postlink\">post 1230</a>, Aj The Epic wrote:</cite>In honesty, if it's been three days of focusing garmr without any investigative or substantive clears, he SHOULD\"VE been lynched.

Her passivity is decently out of normal bounds. Her personality doesn't really matter, but you could have a look at how easy she takes initiative in other games of hers. But also how far she's aware of certain \"known\" scum and town tells. It was a bit strange to witness her commit to garmr's defense so blatantly. <br><br>So I don't believe she's unreadable, there's material there. I just haven't been able to figure it out. This in comparison to dier (and if not for the haschel wagon, soze) where I feel the trouble I have reading them is on them. Their playstyles are geared towards reducing the amount of weird stuff, so you have them in your game but they don't make any waves. It's not lurking, it's not active lurking, but it's not achieving anything either."}

No one else seems to be suspicious of DWL; even when criticizing his play, Mykonian didn't want to vote for DWL, and other players (Garmr, Keyser, I) have been openly reading him as Town. So, if AJ is Mafia, why is he placing his vote where it doesn't do any good?<br>I suppose that one explanation is that he really hasn't read through the main thread or the Mafia thread.

Also I know if I self vote in that situation no one would lynch me and it shows how frustrated I was so It took me off the table I never get lynched I'm pretty good at surviving no matter what. My bp claim was planned as well since I would just use that as town cred and a way to survive and it did it's job just my reads were wrong."}

I was confused with the early town read but then your vote instability D1 and the day we were on was so far off without any reason that something HAD to be wrong.
