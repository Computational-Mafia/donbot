This is the start of the game, and lylo. Start of the game, everybody is on their own and trying to figure out where this game is going to go. Come lylo, every townie is going to second guess themselves a couple of times and it becomes really hard to predict where they put their money (how do they think they were being fooled so far etc). In between it's easy, you can sort of tell where town is going to go, know what the possible lynches are, play accordingly. But first appearances count and it's hard to get it right.<br>\n<br>\nNow the pace of this game isn't amazing, but it's now slow either. There are some people with reads and it's going underway. Hier is about to miss the boat, and still doesn't know how to respond properly. Normal town wouldn't care, you just see the last couple of posts and comment on it. So we have someone here who wants to watch which way the wind blows, and as such stands out compared to the tempo of the townies we've seen so far. That's scumtell one.<br>\n<br>\nThe second is the list itself. There are two reasons to make lists. One's to get organised and present otherwise cluttered info. The other is to make sure you actually get something posted beyond a oneliner. This is the last. Page 4, too little has happened that commenting to 1 or 2 events wouldn't do. There's no use at all to post that for half of the game, you don't have a read yet. Again, hier's perfectly aware there should be a post from her here. By absence of something comfortable to post about, the safety of a rigid structure is sought and found in posting a list with a little bit non-information about everybody. At least that way you get something on first sight good looking posted. But it makes no sense to do it when we've had barely 2 pages of non rvs posting. <br>\n<br>\nI guess if you look hard you could even find support for the last in that", "time": "Wed Sep 23, 2015 12:24 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63461&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "63461"}

Town players vote for those they believe to be Mafia. Mafia players vote for those they know to be Town (except when voting players they know to be Mafia, which is presumably less frequent). So, if I believe a player to be Town (such as DWL), others voting for that player are more likely to be Mafia than are others voting for some other player.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7245885#p7245885\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7245885#p7245885\" data-post-id=\"7245885\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 140</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25845\">Keyser S&#246;ze</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7243998#p7243998\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7243998#p7243998\" data-post-id=\"7243998\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 66</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25388\">Dierfire</a> wrote:</cite>DWL is Town and easy to lynch.

I've got a resounding nullread on him at this point, though. His postcount is ballooning a bit and is making the thread a little hard to follow.

You're wrong on a few things there.  First of all, your \"gambit\" was not very clear.  Your gambit makes sense if you didn't decide to completely ruin the entire thing by claiming BP.  But you did.  Second, you say Lalendra has done no scum hunting and yet they did in the post you quoted.  I liked that wall but m'kay about your opinion.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOmgus is a overused scumtell that is entirely worthless and to be afraid to state your opinion about how you feel about someone makes you failure as a town so that's why I don't care for it. <br>\n<br>\nSecond you like it but can you tell me who laendras scum list is or why she is satisfied staying on someone who she considers anti town instead of scum hunting. This isn't scum hunting this is just placing people as town reads and throwing worthless questions at people with out commiting to a scum read so she can breeze through a policy lynch. Learn the difference.<br>\n<br>\nAlso it is pretty clear looking back and doesn't take much brain power to process hint at a power role then leave it at that. But some idiot decided to blurt it out in the open which no one should do (town or scum) if they think someone is a power role so I just confirmed it then gah You can start to see why I got pissed off. But it does make perfect sense. Me ruining it through doesn't make sense for scum either because I could of played it off for longer and then burst it out latter on. Also I could of done a better fake claim like 2 shot hider so I can explain why scum didn't shoot me and confirm people as town and possible confirm a scum mate as town as well.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso you didn't criticize my second scum read so do you see the logic in that?", "time": "Sat Sep 26, 2015 2:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63461&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "63461"}

Dier also wasn't the only one town-reading Dwlee at that point, so this makes even more sense in light of that. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with his vote on Keyser, since myko was pushing Dwlee a LOT harder at that point in time than Keyser was, he just hadn't voted yet. There is a lot of ambivalent wording in Dier's posts &#8211; &#8220;I could see that coming from mafia,&#8221; &#8220;not a particularly strong case but not a particularly weak one,&#8221; &#8220;I could see that from mafia,&#8221; etc. - which I know a lot of people see as scummy, but I don't necessarily think that's alignment-indicative. There are plenty of people who tend to be wishy-washy as either alignment. The fact that he has only posted 12 times in 112 pages is definitely problematic, I feel like he&#8217;s just sort of jumping in with opportunistic votes.

I definitely don't believe that the use of \"honestly\" is relevant, and the claim makes less sense from a Mafia player than from a Town player. Still, Mykonian was reading to me as Town as well, so I'd look elsewhere on his wagon for Mafia players.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Haschel</div> hasn't done anything that makes me want to cast a vote, but I'm not reading him as Town, either.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Implosion</div> is logical enough. His reads on Garmr and Mykonian are in tune with mine, and his interaction with DWL around the claim was solid. He's my best bet for Town on my wagon (actually, did Lelandra ever get around to following your instructions for a vote?).<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DWL</div> is likely Town, although a bit jumpy over the potential association with Lelandra. I'd hesitate to endorse many of his reads, but maybe he'll find his feet later.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Felissan</div> has been flying below my radar. I wouldn't mind hearing more from him.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Herrcombs</div>, too, doesn't feature much in my notes. I guess that I like the English-to-English translator thing that he's got going on--it feels reasonably Town-motivated.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hieirama</div> remains suspicious to me, mostly for seeming too defensive in interactions with Mykonian.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mykonian</div> seems to be stuck in a tunnel, but I'd read him as Town.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lelandra</div> certainly bears watching. Voting for Garmr without actually reading him as Mafia is troubling, though now I need to reference that against Hieirama's activity.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Pistachion</div> is moderately suspicious. Unlike some of the others (Felissan, Herrcombs), the relative lack of content feels more intentional, and if I decide that you're not Mafia, Pistachion would be a good bet for Mafia on Garmr's wagon.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Keyser</div> has been absent for a long time. I was feeling good about him before he left, though.<br>\n<br>\nThat brings me to you! Figuring out whether you're wrong or Mafia will be an exciting journey for both of us, I'm sure.<br>\n<br>\nSo, overall, I feel that I'm doing better reading Town than Mafia, but I'd be suspicious of Mafia taking a relatively inactive approach (as I suspect all major wagons have been on Town so far).

I think it's a bit sheepy though, especially since I detailed my initial scumread of Hieirama due to a combination of her early posts, and Lalendra just kinda simplified it without adding anything new. I can't precisely follow Lalendra's thought process and read development, especially the phrase \"made some interesting points\" as a reason for leaning more noobtown. I'm not a big fan of the word \"interesting\" -- I think it's a buzzword that doesn't really convey an opinion and it's easy to hide behind.<br>\n<br>\nIn my reread, I saw some scummy things and some townie things in Lalendra's posts, so this would stick out as an example of the former. I am currently leaning more scum than town on her. I don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7254206#p7254206\">312</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7257733#p7257733\">375</a>, and how they followed the end of her <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252895#p7252895\">276</a>. She says she's not a fan of policy lynches, and she unvoted Garmr because it looked like he wasn't going to be anti-town anymore, yet it's her preferred lynch later in 312 and she would \"compromise\" on Dier as an alternative. If you have an actual scummy read, instead of just a PL target, wouldn't you prefer to lynch scum? Or if you don't have a scumread you feel better about voting, why not scumhunt to find one?

Though I suppose that gives the mafia the option not to kill anyone. I just don't think they would even bother with Garmr to be honest though.

I feel his post was merely to add more pressure onto his wagon. I also feel like you don't take the rest of his post from 37/the rest of it: too seriously. It's a bit early in the game, he puts his vote on the wagon for suspicion of scum, and asks some questions to him. <br>\nAlso Pistachi0n is giving me a town read, though it might change if he doesn't post more/more often.<br>\n<br>\n#<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7247516#p7247516\">200</a> I feel there's some important analysis here.

My default town-read on him is deteriorating to the point where I can understand the argument that he's scum. His two most significant actions yesterday (his BP hardclaim and his quickhammer) were pretty useless, in my opinion. I say they're useless in that they accomplished nothing, but more importantly, they were both anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr makes the argument today that D1 was basically over when he hammered, but that's not true. There were several outstanding questions that could have been answered (some of which were on the same page as the hammer). He says that \"people were putting intentions to hammer,\" but the only person to actually do that was DWL and it's been established that he wasn't going to immediately end the day. His arguments that his quickhammer wasn't anti-town (and wasn't even a quickhammer) just don't cut it for me. His change of mind from \"I'm in no rush for the day to end\" to a quickhammer the very next IRL day also looks really bad to me. <br>\n<br>\nIt feels like Garmr is taking a sledgehammer to this game, like he doesn't really give a fuck about the damage he does, and this could be a scum tactic to take out as much as he can before he's finally lynched.

Scum want to sit on the fence, not giving any strong opinions, so when the wind blows just right, they can opportunistically jump on the town-consensus and not look suspicious. By giving actual opinions and suspicions, you put your own thoughts at risk and scrutiny. Scum don't like to be scrutinized.

Reads (I think of them synonymous with arguments) require evidence to build and sustain. Throughout the game, reads develop based on new evidence that is presented. By demonstrating your reads are updating to events of the game, you show that you are thinking about the game and trying to solve who is scum. Scum will try to spin narratives and try to make the evidence fit their reads, rather than the other way around. After all, they're trying to mislynch the town, so they are required to lie to achieve their wincon.<br>\n<br>\nSo this is why I keep asking you for specific information. I want to see if your thought process is consistent with your play, and whether you're just trying to look townie or actually trying to figure out the game. I have not been satisfied with your responses to my queries. I asked you earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7246851#p7246851\">169</a>) for your thoughts including your top scum read. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Your answer?</div> In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7247399#p7247399\">180</a> you referred me to your super-early readlist which came like 100 posts earlier. This told me that you were not updating your reads (I asked for a top scumread) based on the events of the game.<br>\n<br>\nSimilarly, I asked you in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270783#p7270783\">467</a> to specifically provide a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">current</div> read on Garmr. I was like you D1, where I wanted to believe his BP claim at its face, and I didn't want the wagon to go through in case we lynched a PR D1. However, over time I noticed things from him that began to look scummy, including his change-of-mind at the end of D1 up to and including his hammer, that were making me reconsider my read. I wanted to know if you were taking those actions into consideration. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Your answer?</div> In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7274141#p7274141\">520</a> you referred me to a set of posts you made 300 posts earlier and then implied that you hadn't really considered anything since then.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It was a way for me to explain why his quickhammer wasn't scummy to me (because it apparently was to others) since you did ask about his last few actions.</div></blockquote><br>\nBut you didn't explain why his quickhammer wasn't scummy. You responded \"That quickhammer though\" immediately after it happened, which indicated you thought it was strange. And you later told me \"the message that went along with it made sense.\" Which message? Was the message alignment-indicative (anyone in this game, scum or town, can produce posts that \"make sense\")? Does it excuse Garmr, who had stated \"I am in [no] rush to end the day\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7260158#p7260158\">412</a>), and then quickhammered without warning 16 hours later?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You asked me my opinions on Garmr and I said I assumed he was Town.

Reads (I think of them synonymous with arguments) require evidence to build and sustain. Throughout the game, reads develop based on new evidence that is presented. By demonstrating your reads are updating to events of the game, you show that you are thinking about the game and trying to solve who is scum. Scum will try to spin narratives and try to make the evidence fit their reads, rather than the other way around. After all, they're trying to mislynch the town, so they are required to lie to achieve their wincon.<br>\n<br>\nSo this is why I keep asking you for specific information. I want to see if your thought process is consistent with your play, and whether you're just trying to look townie or actually trying to figure out the game.

I was like you D1, where I wanted to believe his BP claim at its face, and I didn't want the wagon to go through in case we lynched a PR D1. However, over time I noticed things from him that began to look scummy, including his change-of-mind at the end of D1 up to and including his hammer, that were making me reconsider my read.

{"number": 662, "id": "7287588", "user": "herrcombs", "user_id": "26211", "content": "First, let me get a readlist out there:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dierfire: Null-town.</div> His interactions with BBT back on page 15 still seem really unnatural and appeasy to me. However, I like how he's been pushing on several different people today. Pushing the game forward is townie in my eyes.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Garmr: Scumlean.</div> On the one hand, his BP claim was so abrupt as was his quickhammer, that it could be reckless-town who simply has little patience for the game. However, I don't like how he's being so blatantly anti-town, trying to spin it as not-scummy, nor do I like how he gives zero attention to people who were/are not on his wagon. His tunnel on Lalendra feels like it's sucking the energy out of the game.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Haschel: Null.</div> His RVS opening made me really uncomfortable, but a cursory meta inspection reveals that he does that same thing every game. I don't like how he never answered questions about it, but oh well... He's been doing very little, is suspiciously inactive, but I do like his push on Hiei especially in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7271236#p7271236\">478</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7271324#p7271324\">483</a>. Not a lot to talk about, but I'd like to see more from him so I can get a better read.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DWL: Town.</div> Although I've pinged out a lot of stuff he said in pages 9-11, a lot of his posts since them seem town enough. He looks like he's trying to logically figure out the game, even if he's confused at times. I identify with a lot of what he's saying, especially in the Lalendra vs Garmr argument.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Meanmelter: Null-town.</div> I like the depth with which he caught up. I agree with most of his points against Garmr. And he also seems to be pushing on other people, trying to straighten up their logic and read consistency. Can't see much I don't like from melter. Would like him to post more though.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hieirama: Scumlean*.</div> I give it the asterisk because it's exactly the type of noobtown I've lynched in the past for lapses in logic or lack of proactive scumhunting that could just as easily come from noobtown as noobscum. I will be keeping an eye on her though, I feel as the game goes on she will become easier to read.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mykonian: Town.</div> I like how he's using his activity to push the game further. Earlier in D1, I felt like he was just posting to post and build up fluff in the thread, but he's redeeming himself in my eyes. i thought he was being overdefensive early on, but I'm led to believe it's just a matter of playstyle and not alignment-indicative.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lalendra: Scumlean.</div> I'll talk about this more below, but I didn't like her push against Garmr as a PL yesterday. I discussed this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7257641#p7257641\">374</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7259676#p7259676\">408</a>. I don't like how she keeps blindly tunneling on Garmr paying attention to no one else... Although I'm curious why she thinks Dier is so obvscum? I'm missing something obviously, because I can't see in her ISO where she has a single cohesive reason to think Dier is so blatantly scum.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Keyser Soze: Null-town. </div> I think I remember reading a few of Soze's older Newbie games, and he always seemed pretty eccentric as town, interacting more directly with people in real-time. I think he's fallen under my radar this game though. Upon inspection of his ISO, he seems readily willing to scour peoples' ISOs to figure out where they're coming from. The walls strike me as different than his playstyle I witnessed previously, but I still see town-value in them. I haven't really found anything that specifically pings me as scummy from Soze's posts.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BBT: Null-town.</div> I really liked his play D1, but I am a bit baffled by his D2 play for reasons others have already mentioned. Why ignore the work people have already put in D2, declare a lynchpool that consists of the last few people on the pistachio wagon yesterday, and take nothing else into consideration? I don't see scum-motivation in that, but I don't particularly understand why he's taking this approach now.<br>\n<br>\nOk, it's time for me to weigh in on the Lalendra vs Garmr thing: it's obnoxious, and I don't think it's TvT. I'm almost considering a world in which they're both scum, just because the degree of tunneling on each other is draining this game of life and is making it painful to follow. Thing is, it seems like I have to pick a side, because they're not backing down from each other any time soon.<br>\n<br>\nGun to my head, I'm going to say Lalendra is scum over Garmr. Starting with her Dierfire case -- What is it? She says he's obvscum, but I've never seen her substantiate that. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7271295#p7271295\">480</a> comes off as super strange to me. Then, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7272283#p7272283\">497</a> seems incredibly myopic. Why not use a flip, try to analyze a wagon, and see what you find? Why just shrug it all off, saying \"I can't really disagree with anyone on the wagon cause I was all for the lynch?\"<br>\n<br>\nI do think that Lalendra was misrepping Garmr in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7272325#p7272325\">498</a>. Even though I agree that Garmr responded rather emotionally, sometimes incoherently, to some of meanmelter's points, Lalendra simplified it in a way that brushed away the evidence that didn't fit her read and just made it easier to vote for Garmr. She continues to do this scummy simplification/misrepresentation, I pointed it out once earlier in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7259676#p7259676\">408</a> when she sheeped my read on Hieirama. <br>\n<br>\nLalendra's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7285298#p7285298\">652</a> seems really weird, especially since she hasn't pushed on Dier at all today. Why is Dier \"so obvscum?\" I am getting frustrated too, in part because Garmr's ISO is so hard to follow and my mind is swimming from all the defensiveness and the constant tunneling. But I am more bothered by how Lalendra is trying so hard to push the lynch, while not substantiating it well, and ignoring most else in the process.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr's case against Lalendra <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7283591#p7283591\">630</a> also seems rather well put together, and I can agree with many of the presented points (I think I've mentioned a few myself earlier).<br>\n<br>\nUgh, my head hurts. I need to make smaller, more frequent posts, or I'm going to find it increasingly difficult to stay involved in this game.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lalendra</span> L-2", "time": "Fri Oct 09, 2015 10:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63461&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "63461"}

Dier also wasn't the only one town-reading Dwlee at that point, so this makes even more sense in light of that. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with his vote on Keyser, since myko was pushing Dwlee a LOT harder at that point in time than Keyser was, he just hadn't voted yet. There is a lot of ambivalent wording in Dier's posts &#8211; &#8220;I could see that coming from mafia,&#8221; &#8220;not a particularly strong case but not a particularly weak one,&#8221; &#8220;I could see that from mafia,&#8221; etc. - which I know a lot of people see as scummy, but I don't necessarily think that's alignment-indicative. There are plenty of people who tend to be wishy-washy as either alignment. The fact that he has only posted 12 times in 112 pages is definitely problematic, I feel like he&#8217;s just sort of jumping in with opportunistic votes.

He hasn't really done much to earn him this amount of scum attention and there are worse offenders in this game. The way he was wagoned by my scum reads would nudge him more to town side through. Look how myko has been hard pushing me all day if he actually thought I was scum then he would continue pushing. I feel like scum is having a hard time getting me lynched because there's to many players that aren't new alive. Also haschel is probably the easiest wagon to quick lynch at the moment so this would explain why so many supporters of my wagon are thinking of jumping in this direction.<br>\n<br>\nBasically his a null pushed town due the actions of other around him.

I really feel like I'm having 0 impact on this game. I felt like the only people on the wagon were already on it before I voted for him aside from Lale. I feel like everyone's just kinda shrugged at it. I was hoping it was going to attract attention and questions at me and Garmr, but that didn't seem to happen at all. It stayed constant for awhile, but everyone focused on Lale for awhile, gave Dier a bit of attention until finally Haschel. <br>\n<br>\nAs for Lale, I feel her <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">reasons</div> have sort of caused her wagon. As you have pointed <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7278269#p7278269\">out</a>, you felt it was her actions, but let me explain myself. I never liked her, Dier Haschel having small post counts, but at least when Lale posted it was usually content, or at least it is now. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7251816#p7251816\">I also didn't like her reasoning day 1 for voting Garmr as she made it off to be a Policy Lynch when I don't really seem why she mentioned anything about it.</a> Her <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">actions </div> are pretty good in my book. But her <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">reasons?</div> They really do not sit with me well. Her vote against Garmr persisted coming D2. I think she is the only one who read the arguments between Garmr and I, and I feel now she is no longer voting Garmr for a PL. I am not too shocked by her claim (Surely we were gonna have a cop or a doctor, only a matter of time) especially since she was L-1 with the \"You can hammer without intent we don't mind\" town mindset.

I've called him out D2 on two things I did not like, and I felt his responses were merely trying to dodge my accusations against him. However I did misunderstand him in one. I feel his inactivity and meager posts where his real downfall. He appeared to promise more posts, or at least a nice well-thought out post, but I never saw this. Though it still feels much like Pistachi0n, a flash wagon at the end of the day on someone who was inactive. I am not saying Haschel wasn't on my scum radar.

I really feel like I'm having 0 impact on this game. I felt like the only people on the wagon were already on it before I voted for him aside from Lale. I feel like everyone's just kinda shrugged at it. I was hoping it was going to attract attention and questions at me and Garmr, but that didn't seem to happen at all. It stayed constant for awhile, but everyone focused on Lale for awhile, gave Dier a bit of attention until finally Haschel. <br>\n<br>\nAs for Lale, I feel her <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">reasons</div> have sort of caused her wagon. As you have pointed <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7278269#p7278269\">out</a>, you felt it was her actions, but let me explain myself. I never liked her, Dier Haschel having small post counts, but at least when Lale posted it was usually content, or at least it is now. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7251816#p7251816\">I also didn't like her reasoning day 1 for voting Garmr as she made it off to be a Policy Lynch when I don't really seem why she mentioned anything about it.</a> Her <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">actions </div> are pretty good in my book. But her <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">reasons?</div> They really do not sit with me well. Her vote against Garmr persisted coming D2. I think she is the only one who read the arguments between Garmr and I, and I feel now she is no longer voting Garmr for a PL. I am not too shocked by her claim (Surely we were gonna have a cop or a doctor, only a matter of time) especially since she was L-1 with the \"You can hammer without intent we don't mind\" town mindset. I don't like who she protected night one, however.

He plays quite similar to Haschel, which leads me to suspect him as an accomplice because Haschel flipped scum. His lackluster posts, and questionable votes do NOT sit well with me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd Haschel. I've called him out D2 on two things I did not like, and I felt his responses were merely trying to dodge my accusations against him. However I did misunderstand him in one. I feel his inactivity and meager posts where his real downfall. He appeared to promise more posts, or at least a nice well-thought out post, but I never saw this. Though it still feels much like Pistachi0n, a flash wagon at the end of the day on someone who was inactive. I am not saying Haschel wasn't on my scum radar.

Garmr obviously is different, that wasn't a vote in response to pistache's post, but one that had us waiting for a hammer. I guess you could go either way with herr, that was just a response to a bad looking post, he could do that as scum. Soze though, seems to sit in a town place with that wagon. But lets forget about that, has nothing to do with the last flip.<br>\n<br>\n434/447 make hier town. I misremembered with the previous post that haschel got some pressure later but he has to be aware he's not doing all that great. Getting actual pressure on a uncertain looking scumbuddy that hier would be at a time where town is clearly searching is a recipe for disaster, he wouldn't do it. <br>\n<br>\n527 isn't going to be a bus.

The vote that gets haschel lynched imo. Think it might have come from a previous \"read\" on her so that he felt safe in doing that. Issue is, the way lalendra is playing, from scum point of view it's pretty w/e. Just like haschel, if things go as they go then, lalendra won't make it. It annoys me, but that could very well be a bus. Might even explain why he was in such a hurry to get on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n745. And guess who kickstarts the haschel wagon, in stead of going for say, hier, or garmr or w/e. Herr. There's no way he does that as scum, he could just let it be hope bbt and I don't get our shit together and end up on dier someway.

Lalendra<br>\n<br>\nI have to admit that it is quite annoying that dier and hier start up a counterwagon on lalendra (while I liked them for town), garmr follows but at least I haven't be able to find a town interaction with haschel yet, they basically didn't post apart from haschel's neutral response to garmr's claim.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think anyone should give garmr townpoints for his heavy push on lalendra.

Keyser S&#246;ze<br>\n<br>\nI have the vague suspicion the entire start of the pistache wagon were town, even if 2 of the players on it are still in the list above. Garmr obviously is different, that wasn't a vote in response to pistache's post, but one that had us waiting for a hammer. I guess you could go either way with herr, that was just a response to a bad looking post, he could do that as scum. Soze though, seems to sit in a town place with that wagon. But lets forget about that, has nothing to do with the last flip.<br>\n<br>\n434/447 make hier town. I misremembered with the previous post that haschel got some pressure later but he has to be aware he's not doing all that great. Getting actual pressure on a uncertain looking scumbuddy that hier would be at a time where town is clearly searching is a recipe for disaster, he wouldn't do it. <br>\n<br>\n527 isn't going to be a bus. Nobody was talking about haschel, now soze finally decides to make a vote, he could have let it be. So that's soze 90% sure not haschels buddy. <br>\n<br>\nWith 662 I am glad I haven't scratched herr from the list yet. His opinion on haschel is very wishy washy.<br>\n<br>\n664. The vote that gets haschel lynched imo. Think it might have come from a previous \"read\" on her so that he felt safe in doing that. Issue is, the way lalendra is playing, from scum point of view it's pretty w/e. Just like haschel, if things go as they go then, lalendra won't make it. It annoys me, but that could very well be a bus. Might even explain why he was in such a hurry to get on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n745. And guess who kickstarts the haschel wagon, in stead of going for say, hier, or garmr or w/e. Herr. There's no way he does that as scum, he could just let it be hope bbt and I don't get our shit together and end up on dier someway.

Lalendra<br>\n<br>\nI have to admit that it is quite annoying that dier and hier start up a counterwagon on lalendra (while I liked them for town), garmr follows but at least I haven't be able to find a town interaction with haschel yet, they basically didn't post apart from haschel's neutral response to garmr's claim.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think anyone should give garmr townpoints for his heavy push on lalendra.

Garmr gets huge scum points in my book for trying to do this against the remaining mason(s)' will, and for making it easier for scum to hunt them down by pressuring DWL to confirm/deny his role. I'm beginning to feel more strongly that Garmr is scum who's just super ballsy with his anti-town behavior. I just don't see town playing this kind of risk, lemme break it down -- If Garmr's wrong about Lalendra, then his 'plan' directly kills two PRs, one at night, and the other gets lynched the next day. Actually, if Garmr is town and felt so strongly about Lala being scum, he wouldn't bother with this whole runaround. He'd just want to lynch Lala today.

That being said, I can see your push against Garmr as a town push. You have made several good points that I agree with, so that prompted my question to Hieirama when she said \"not liking how anti-Garmr Meanmelter is being\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a>. I think there are points in your push against Garmr that appear to be misrepresented (e.g. the phrase at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a> \"You went from AFK one line posts to softclaiming out of the blue...\" it's not clear whether you were trying to say Garmr was afk before he claimed, or rather that the style of his posts were afk-one-liners.) However, I think Garmr is totally overblowing how all of your posts are \"shit\" and misreps and strawmen and w/e. I think in your interactions with Garmr, Garmr looks way worse. I think Garmr complains about misreps and strawmen, all the while misrepresenting you and making strawman arguments. So I'm not liking Garmr atm.<br>\n<br>\nNote to self: I should come back to myko's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7328962#p7328962\">1027</a> once I have some more time.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\" data-post-id=\"7328995\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1030</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9959\">mykonian</a> wrote:</cite>I think today I'd like to go with the theory that garmr and mean are the two remaining scum.

However (let's look at the FACT THAT WASN\"T TRUE line), Garmr, you have it wrong. Your only scumreads D2 were people who were either voting you or considering it. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7275059#p7275059\">530</a>. I even called you out on this, and you sheepishly dropped your contrived scumread on me like a bad habit. Your scumread on feli D1 was AFTER he had first scumread you (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252644#p7252644\">270</a>). Same with myko. Why does this matter? Because it looks like you're only interested in lynching people who want to kill you. Your scumhunting revolves around yourself.

It's basically Garmr going, \"Mean did this,\" mean replies \"No I didn't,\" then Garmr goes \"Yeah you did.\" For the record Garmr, if you make claims about someone, the burden is on YOU to prove their validity. If you claim that Mean \"says i provided no reads or anything,\" and he denies saying that, then it's your responsibility to show where he in fact said it. If you claim that Mean \"tried to dispel my reads as only people that scum read me,\" and mean says he did no such thing, it is your responsibility to either show where he in fact said it, or admit that you're lying. Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7332513#p7332513\">1045</a> just looks like you're trying to back yourself out of responsibility of claims you've made against mean. \"really can't be bothered with these anwsers as they do nothing to change my points,\" well your points don't mean much if they're false to begin with. As scum, this makes complete sense, because you're using hyperbole to fabricate a case to get someone lynched. If you're town, it just means that you are lazy in how you throw shit around, making claims that aren't verifiable, exaggerating because you feel a certain way about a slot.

Garmr gets huge scum points in my book for trying to do this against the remaining mason(s)' will, and for making it easier for scum to hunt them down by pressuring DWL to confirm/deny his role. I'm beginning to feel more strongly that Garmr is scum who's just super ballsy with his anti-town behavior. I just don't see town playing this kind of risk, lemme break it down -- If Garmr's wrong about Lalendra, then his 'plan' directly kills two PRs, one at night, and the other gets lynched the next day. Actually, if Garmr is town and felt so strongly about Lala being scum, he wouldn't bother with this whole runaround. He'd just want to lynch Lala today.

That being said, I can see your push against Garmr as a town push. You have made several good points that I agree with, so that prompted my question to Hieirama when she said \"not liking how anti-Garmr Meanmelter is being\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a>. I think there are points in your push against Garmr that appear to be misrepresented (e.g. the phrase at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a> \"You went from AFK one line posts to softclaiming out of the blue...\" it's not clear whether you were trying to say Garmr was afk before he claimed, or rather that the style of his posts were afk-one-liners.) However, I think Garmr is totally overblowing how all of your posts are \"shit\" and misreps and strawmen and w/e. I think in your interactions with Garmr, Garmr looks way worse. I think Garmr complains about misreps and strawmen, all the while misrepresenting you and making strawman arguments. So I'm not liking Garmr atm.<br>\n<br>\nNote to self: I should come back to myko's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7328962#p7328962\">1027</a> once I have some more time.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7328995#p7328995\" data-post-id=\"7328995\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1030</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9959\">mykonian</a> wrote:</cite>I think today I'd like to go with the theory that garmr and mean are the two remaining scum.

Ever since meanmelter replaced in, do you think the aggression that he's shown towards Garmr is not unlikely to occur between two scum?<br>\n<br>\nReading Garmr's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7239428#p7239428\">1040</a>, ok he's actually making a few decent points here. Like his point about the line from MM's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a>. However (let's look at the FACT THAT WASN\"T TRUE line), Garmr, you have it wrong. Your only scumreads D2 were people who were either voting you or considering it. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7275059#p7275059\">530</a>. I even called you out on this, and you sheepishly dropped your contrived scumread on me like a bad habit. Your scumread on feli D1 was AFTER he had first scumread you (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7252644#p7252644\">270</a>). Same with myko. Why does this matter? Because it looks like you're only interested in lynching people who want to kill you. Your scumhunting revolves around yourself.

It's basically Garmr going, \"Mean did this,\" mean replies \"No I didn't,\" then Garmr goes \"Yeah you did.\" For the record Garmr, if you make claims about someone, the burden is on YOU to prove their validity. If you claim that Mean \"says i provided no reads or anything,\" and he denies saying that, then it's your responsibility to show where he in fact said it. If you claim that Mean \"tried to dispel my reads as only people that scum read me,\" and mean says he did no such thing, it is your responsibility to either show where he in fact said it, or admit that you're lying. Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7332513#p7332513\">1045</a> just looks like you're trying to back yourself out of responsibility of claims you've made against mean. \"really can't be bothered with these anwsers as they do nothing to change my points,\" well your points don't mean much if they're false to begin with. As scum, this makes complete sense, because you're using hyperbole to fabricate a case to get someone lynched.

However I believe that your BP claim was merely a method to make it where others will not suspect you of being scum since there is no evidence you have to provide us as proof that your claim is legit.

Garmr gets huge scum points in my book for trying to do this against the remaining mason(s)' will, and for making it easier for scum to hunt them down by pressuring DWL to confirm/deny his role. I'm beginning to feel more strongly that Garmr is scum who's just super ballsy with his anti-town behavior. I just don't see town playing this kind of risk, lemme break it down -- If Garmr's wrong about Lalendra, then his 'plan' directly kills two PRs, one at night, and the other gets lynched the next day. Actually, if Garmr is town and felt so strongly about Lala being scum, he wouldn't bother with this whole runaround. He'd just want to lynch Lala today.

That being said, I can see your push against Garmr as a town push. You have made several good points that I agree with, so that prompted my question to Hieirama when she said \"not liking how anti-Garmr Meanmelter is being\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7322733#p7322733\">983</a>. I think there are points in your push against Garmr that appear to be misrepresented (e.g. the phrase at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7270778#p7270778\">466</a> \"You went from AFK one line posts to softclaiming out of the blue...\" it's not clear whether you were trying to say Garmr was afk before he claimed, or rather that the style of his posts were afk-one-liners.) However, I think Garmr is totally overblowing how all of your posts are \"shit\" and misreps and strawmen and w/e. I think in your interactions with Garmr, Garmr looks way worse. I think Garmr complains about misreps and strawmen, all the while misrepresenting you and making strawman arguments.

Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7332513#p7332513\">1045</a> just looks like you're trying to back yourself out of responsibility of claims you've made against mean. \"really can't be bothered with these anwsers as they do nothing to change my points,\" well your points don't mean much if they're false to begin with. As scum, this makes complete sense, because you're using hyperbole to fabricate a case to get someone lynched. If you're town, it just means that you are lazy in how you throw shit around, making claims that aren't verifiable, exaggerating because you feel a certain way about a slot. I'm leaning towards the former.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Garmr</span></div></blockquote><br>\nUgh, Mod, please fix the formatting.

The evidence he and others have presented so far does not compel me to vote for Mean, and furthermore, it makes me believe the Mean wagon is scum driven.

However, the events of today make me townread Mean for a few reasons. Namely, Garmr's push against Mean seems buried in false accusations and hyperbole that have been challenged, and then ignored by Garmr. I don't understand why as town, Garmr needs to do this. The evidence he and others have presented so far does not compel me to vote for Mean, and furthermore, it makes me believe the Mean wagon is scum driven. I don't feel comfortable joining that wagon with two of my scumreads (Garmr and Hiei) on it. (Although it looks like Hiei is being force-replaced out, which I still have no idea how to feel about.)<br>\n<br>\nThis game has stagnated and it seems people are content letting the dichotomy between Garmr and Mean go unchallenged.

So far in my reading, I question this Myokian press: What he said was incredibly controversial to this town ('honestly' being a scum tell, which it is statistically known that using 'honest' or any variants to head a sentence in speech more likely to lead into a lie than truth). However, he's pressed on an issue of what basically devolves to \"I don't like you\". And <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7242899#p7242899\">37</a> was probably the best post in the early game. <br>\n<br>\nActually, just lynch lalendra.

Justification of hopping on a simple wagon AGAIN for wrong reasons, and putting myokian in a stupid position for what is a trivial vote compared to what the town could be going after. Also, the fact that no one in the town took it at face value as a reaction test is sincerely disheartening. But then again, it drew so many reactions it might've served a greater purpose. <br>\n<br>\nDwlee, in the next post, speaks the god-given truth.

He also used an 'honestly' when self-reflecting earlier. Later on, he starts using it as if to dilute the purpose the word has in his own usage.

And she plopped her vote down on meanmelter when it was convenient to do so, scumreading him for very similar things that you have been doing.<br>\n<br>\nAJ has done nothing today to make me feel better about Hiei's questionable actions before she replaced out, and you (Myko) are beginning to make me worried about your slot too. You've flown under my radar for much of the game, but looking back specifically at your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7328962#p7328962\">1027</a>, I'm actually not a fan of how you PoE'd down to a garmr/mean or lalendra/mean scumteam. Your reasons for removing people early (like Dier and Hiei especially) seem superficial, and then you sort of coasted through the rest of the day while allowing the wagon on meanmelter to build. Independently, I can see both you and AJ being scum. And as a team, I think it's entirely plausible.<br>\n<br>\nI can't believe that my scumread on Garmr is actually weakening.

Literally what I did is notice a post in which you responded to a post by Keyser in which he asked you several questions, two of which you appeared to ignore.

If heirama didn't replace out I would of been against the aj slot.
