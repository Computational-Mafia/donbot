This town was a bit different from other towns, because it was always dark. Even between the working hours usually reserved for broad daylight, it was always completely dark outside. As for why that was, half of it is was because it's nighttime for half the year, and the other half was due to a bit of magic devised by the town founder. There, the citizens had no need for sunlight... although they didn't really mind. It was quiet and peaceful, and despite the eternal darkness, the town was very safe.<br><br>However, some started to get sick of all the darkness. Eventually, they started to take matters into their own hands. Eventually, the town leader wound up dead - it appeared he had been stabbed, then someone had inserted a UV light until he burned to death from the inside. Would the remaining townspeople be able to figure out who was responsible for this?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #A00020\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Players:</span></span></span><br>1.

I feel like that whole \"not talking at L-1\" thing isn't alignment indicative. Sure, scum would probably talk if put to L-1. But so would town, right? Town's goal is to correctly lynch people, and that also means not getting mislynched. It's okay to mess up a few times, but why would you stay quiet? Surely you would at least give some reads so that we can make something of your townflip if you're town.

If the vig knows there's a town consensus to get rid of a player (SV in this case), he will want to NK him and be done with it, so that town doesn't have to waste yet another day of discussion to lynch someone everyone already wants dead. Discussion is precious and moves the game forward, and it should be used to pursue new leads. A vig is not a loner -- he wins with the town, and should not kill someone that hasn't been under town scrutiny first, just because he thinks he's sure that person is scum.<br><br>ILemons, I must say your play is degrading.

You actually chose to look at the whole picture of someone over nitpicking mistakes that might happen to any alignment. What I didn't like was that you didn't answer my question. What I like even less is that you come back into this game after more than 72 hours of absence with no answers to the questions several people expected you to answer by then. Well at least you said you're not going to answer them instead of simply ignoring them, I guess that's something I have to be grateful for in this game. Now you look at best like another uncooperative towny and at worst scummy. I tend to the town option but if everyone is going to play this game by saying \"Hey look at me, I am a stubborn mule, I must be town\" then I don't know how you expect to win this game.<br><br>Anyhow, let me do the wagon analysis you don't want to do: Since both lynch candidates were town I assume that scum's main intention on day 1 was to either look town or to not look scum. The other intention might have been to look for a power role after SV claimed VT, but that's risky business for them. So if I look at the wagons trying to find the people who weren't involved in any intent to hammer/hammer businesses or in some odd wagon switching stuff that could raise eyebrows I mainly see Empking, undo and you (Number0ne). Reading through undo's post history not raising eyebrows seems to be his main policy. Goes for his wagon jump, then the one on CD, and today the one on you. Every time with reasons that look artificial to me. He doesn't seem to have any believable own incentive to find out scum really.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: undo</span>"}

He's minimalistic to a degree that it starts sticking out, which is the main reason I think the chance for him not to be scum is a little bit higher, but he's almost just as scummy.

Granted, we're working on odds here, but that's what we've got at the moment. You can't be so blind as to dismiss everything as WIFOM; you have to use some common sense too. How do you analyze a wagon in which you don't know the alignment of every player, for example? You're never sure of everything, sometimes you have to go with the most probable options.

Town gains very little from a claim, where scum would possibly acquire better targets for the nk. We have no set up info to go off of, and most games I've been scum in I've been provided fake claims. I would hope that town would have more power than masons and we could get another night of whatever they have to offer by keeping things a little more securely locked up, if you know what I mean."}

I can't even defend myself against this wagon because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no-one has actually presented anything against me</span>. <br><br>FTL has a clear bias against me and it is not only putting town in jeopardy by causing town to precipitate into a LyLo situtation tomorrow, but is actually blinding his judgement towards potential scum.<br><br>Like, seriously, how is iamsteve's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5846021#p5846021\">577</a> strong?

If I had to guess I'd say he's not even basing his reads on his own reasoning or gut, but on whatever Remilia said in their QT.<br><br>By the way, FTL, if your plan is lynching Empking tomorrow regardless of my flip, why do you demand my lynch to come first?

Thus, when I were lynched and flipped town, he could say \"I had nothing to do with it -- I always said he was solid town\". Naturally, Formerfish was his best option for vote-parking, because of his lolhammer the day before -- and Empking stuck to it, even though Formerfish started to look a lot more town.<br>Problem is, he didn't count on FTL to think his options over. Now he realizes his plan failed but there's nothing much he can do.</ul><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">notSakura</span><br><ul>notSakura began this day with some erratic play.
