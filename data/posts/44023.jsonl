This town was a bit different from other towns, because it was always dark. Even between the working hours usually reserved for broad daylight, it was always completely dark outside. As for why that was, half of it is was because it's nighttime for half the year, and the other half was due to a bit of magic devised by the town founder. There, the citizens had no need for sunlight... although they didn't really mind. It was quiet and peaceful, and despite the eternal darkness, the town was very safe.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, some started to get sick of all the darkness. Eventually, they started to take matters into their own hands. Eventually, the town leader wound up dead - it appeared he had been stabbed, then someone had inserted a UV light until he burned to death from the inside. Would the remaining townspeople be able to figure out who was responsible for this?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#A00020\">Players:</div></div><br>\n1.

SV flipped town and IL made it clear about his stance on both as if he didn't necessarily know they were the same alignment. I see scum more likely to make an attempt to avoid both or to ignore one while focusing on the other.  I realize his voting patterns were a bit weird, but SV was the lower risk lynch, his play at L-1 didn't make him more town, and I think IL's play falls in line with that.<br>\n<br>\nIf either had flipped scum we'd be having a different conversation right now.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RB</span><br>\n<br>\nThe only motivation I can readily see for 'oh SV suddenly looks town at L-1 for ???, let's ring up the other guy instead' is that he wanted to get CD's claim too after he realized that SV's claim wasn't gonna derail his lynch.  a VT claim by itself (especially at L-1) should not detract from a scumread on a person.<br>\n<br>\nThis is the opposite of the way IL handled it (wanted to lynch the claimed VT over the unknown role, which is understandable from town and less so from scum.)<br>\n<br>\n-b</div></blockquote>\n\nFTL also jumped off the SV wagon, can you explain why you townread FTL but scumread RB?<br>\n<br>\nInsidiousLemons: Are there other reasons you scumread thenewearth or is \"a bad vote\" everything?

If the vig knows there's a town consensus to get rid of a player (SV in this case), he will want to NK him and be done with it, so that town doesn't have to waste yet another day of discussion to lynch someone everyone already wants dead. Discussion is precious and moves the game forward, and it should be used to pursue new leads. A vig is not a loner -- he wins with the town, and should not kill someone that hasn't been under town scrutiny first, just because he thinks he's sure that person is scum.<br>\n<br>\nILemons, I must say your play is degrading.

You actually chose to look at the whole picture of someone over nitpicking mistakes that might happen to any alignment. What I didn't like was that you didn't answer my question. What I like even less is that you come back into this game after more than 72 hours of absence with no answers to the questions several people expected you to answer by then. Well at least you said you're not going to answer them instead of simply ignoring them, I guess that's something I have to be grateful for in this game. Now you look at best like another uncooperative towny and at worst scummy. I tend to the town option but if everyone is going to play this game by saying \"Hey look at me, I am a stubborn mule, I must be town\" then I don't know how you expect to win this game.<br>\n<br>\nAnyhow, let me do the wagon analysis you don't want to do: Since both lynch candidates were town I assume that scum's main intention on day 1 was to either look town or to not look scum. The other intention might have been to look for a power role after SV claimed VT, but that's risky business for them. So if I look at the wagons trying to find the people who weren't involved in any intent to hammer/hammer businesses or in some odd wagon switching stuff that could raise eyebrows I mainly see Empking, undo and you (Number0ne). Reading through undo's post history not raising eyebrows seems to be his main policy. Goes for his wagon jump, then the one on CD, and today the one on you.

You can't be so blind as to dismiss everything as WIFOM; you have to use some common sense too. How do you analyze a wagon in which you don't know the alignment of every player, for example? You're never sure of everything, sometimes you have to go with the most probable options. Some moves are just too risky for scum to make, even when they plan on playing the WIFOM card.<br>\n<br>\nSo please don't be a false WIFOM purist. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, to whom it may interest, look at this sentence:\n<blockquote><div><cite>iamsteve wrote:</cite>Then suggesting it would be more likely for one of the lesser suspects of that player to night kill him is completely absurd.</div></blockquote>\nand notice that iamsteve is talking about himself (\"one of the lesser suspects\") but doesn't express it explicitly.

I was sleeping.<br>\n<br>\nBut oh my FINALLY some SENSE prevailed!<br>\n<br>\nAnd now that you're hopefully prone to hear me out, here are my current reads:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">iamsteve</div>\n<ul><li>Even though I couldn't find anything too incriminating in his ISO, I still think iamsteve is one of the strongest suspects.<br>\n<br>\nMainly because of this: he put me at L-2 within the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">first 24 hours</div> of discussion, knowing that a mislynch would probably lead to LyLo, and with no other reason than 'one of my posts was WIFOM' (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5835437#p5835437\">485</a>).<br>\n<br>\nThen he goes into lurking, gets prodded, and in response (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5846021#p5846021\">577</a>) says he's \"happy with his vote\" and makes a simple list of my most recent actions disguised as 'justification'.</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Empking</div>\n<ul><li>The first thing that started to bother me about Empking today is that town is in verge of LyLo and he just keeps the same play pattern he used in the first two days and that lead us to this situation: parks his vote, lurks, posts vague one-liners.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I asked him his reads at the beginning of this Day 3, he says he has a townread on me \"but all his scumreads are dying\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5833929#p5833929\">466</a>). Nothing more. So basically, trying to buddy me up, not actually providing any satisfactory answer, and with no scumreads whatsoever.<br>\n<br>\nLater I asked him why he had such a strong townread on me. His answer? \"Your posts have siomply looked extremely townie to me.\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5843251#p5843251\">539</a>)<br>\n<br>\nAnd when I asked him who he was scumreading between Formerfish and iamsteve, he says \"Former\", later justifying it solely with Former's hammer, even though there were already 130+ posts of Day-3 discussion.<br>\n<br>\nThe way I see it: Empking understood that I would probably be lynched today (conftown FTL began the day by voting me, just-dead Remilia Scarlet latest suspicion was on me -- it was a relatively safe prediction), so this time he decided to park his vote on Formerfish and start buddying me up. Thus, when I were lynched and flipped town, he could say \"I had nothing to do with it -- I always said he was solid town\". Naturally, Formerfish was his best option for vote-parking, because of his lolhammer the day before -- and Empking stuck to it, even though Formerfish started to look a lot more town.<br>\nProblem is, he didn't count on FTL to think his options over. Now he realizes his plan failed but there's nothing much he can do.</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">notSakura</div>\n<ul><li>notSakura began this day with some erratic play.

OK, I could let that pass as an honest mistake.

You also didn't unvote after I repeatedly asked people to unvote so we didn't quick-lynch without getting more discussion.

Then after a JOAT claim and my urging to unvote, you kept going with it.  <br>\n<br>\nI also made a much better case against Insidious yesterday than anyone did for empking.
