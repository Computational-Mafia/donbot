Asked Org0011. He was one of the Chief Organizators.<br>'Yes, Sir. And,' The Executor paused for a split second, 'I've checked each member's Timeline personally.'<br>'Good. Now, let's get down to business. Here are the names we should get rid of.' Org0011 gave a small plastic tablet to him. He wondered whether he could trust the new Executor but... his records were good and this seemed to be an easy mission anyway. A perfect start for a new one.<br>'What sort of names are these?!' Asked the Executor raising his eyebrows.<br>'Oh, those are not real names. So-called nick-names.'<br>'Threat Level?'<br>'2. Normally.'<br>'Which means...' pondered the Executor.<br>'Unless they start talking to each other, none of them would ever reach 4 alone. But if they began to do so... the consequences might be unpredictable.'<br>'So, we are to prevent their communication. How \u2013 and when?'<br>'Take this,' Org0011 handed over a small green disk. 'Find a computer with Internet access. I think you'll find one easily even at that time.' He gave the Executor another tablet.<br>'10. 10. 2006? I learnt History, Sir. Internet Access had become very common before the Sixth Critical Date.'<br>'Indeed.' He wants to look smart but it will sort itself later out how smart he really is, thought the Org.<br>'Anything else we should be aware of, Sir?'<br>'Nothing. Good Riddance, Executor! Do not fail us.'<br><br>The Executor turned around. 'You've heard the Org. On board, everyone!'<br><br>Thirteen people, one by one, entered The House.<br><br>The House indeed looked like a house and it was big enough for at least thrice as much people. Even better: it had the ability to look like a house from outside. Wherever and when-ever it went, it looked so ...natural as if it had been there all the time. <br>One day they'd be able to build a smaller time machine, they said. But until then, The House was the best \u2013 the only solution for the trip.<br><br>As the last person entered the door, the Executor followed. No one saw the strange expression on his face.<br><br>Without any sound The House disappeared. The trip to the past started.'<br></span><br><br>________<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">RULES</span></span><br><br>(<strike>Stolen from multiple sources</strike> Found somewhere in Space/Time ^_^)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General Rules</span> <br><br>(1) Unless it's stated in a different way, <span class=\"noboldsig\">general site rules are applied</span>. <br>(2) If you're in doubt contact me via PM.<br>(3) Although these are in the general site rules, I'm pointing out a couple of things. Firstly, <span class=\"noboldsig\">do not quote or share your Role PM</span>. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>(4) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Do not talk about ongoing games.</span> This goes for games you're dead in and games played on other sites too.<br>(5) Do not use encrypted and/or unreadable (eg. very small) text. <br>(6) Play to win. Do not play against your Win Condition.<br>(7) Do not be a douchebag, please! Attack the posts, not the player itself.<br>(8) My color is <span class=\"noboldsig\">Violet</span> (#8000FF), do not use it, please!<br>(9) If you pretend to break a rule, you will face the same consequences as if you had broken that rule for real.<br>(10) If I happen to change the rules (which is unlikely anyway), you will get informed about it.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mechanics and Activity</span><br><br>(11) This is a closed Setup. There are no Roles with explicitely Non-Normal mechanics (eg. Lyncher, Jester, Nexus, etc).<br>(12) The flavour is providing a story for the game. Although it is worth reading it, <span class=\"noboldsig\">it contains NO information about possible factions, roles or alignments</span>. <br>(13) The game has a Day Start.<br>(14) The Scum faction(s) have Daytalk.<br>(15) The Day Phases last for 14 days.<br>(16) The Night Phases last for 2 days. If a player who has any Night Action doesn't inform me about his Night Action, No Action will happen. <br>(17) If a player has been inactive for 48 hours, they will get a Prod. After the Prod has happened, they will have 24 hours to post in the thread or else they will be replaced.<br>(18) As soon as a player gets their third prod, they get replaced automatically unless they start posting before a replacement is found.<br>(19) If you are planning to be inactive for a certain period, inform me about it via PM or in the thread.<br>(20) In special cases a Deadline extension may occour, but do not bank on it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting and Lynching</span><br>(21) You can vote by using the vote tag, eg. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aneninen</span> or by bold text in the following format: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Aneninen</span>. <br>(22) You need not Unvote if you want to change your vote. <br>(23) Votes are preferred being posted in a separate line. <br>(24) As long as I am able to resolve whom are you voting for, I will accept your vote. This goes for obvious abbreviations like <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ane</span>.<br>(25) If I think it is a vote, it is a vote.<br>(26) Votes posted in quotes and/or spoilers are ignored automatically. This may (but not esentially will) go for badly-formatted quotes too. I am not obligated to fix your posts or tags.<br>(27) When the majority of the living players are voting for the same person (typically half of the players +1; the exact number always appears alongside the Vote Count) a Lynch is achieved. The same amount of votes are needed for a No Lynch; in this case everyone survives the Day phase. If all living players are voting for Draw, the game ends with a Draw.<br>(28) After a Lynch (or a No Lynch) has been achieved, you may post in the thread until I lock it, but all further votes will be ignored. <br>(29) If you are dead, you are dead. Period. You are not allowed to post in the game any more. Not even \"Bah\" posts.<br>(30) If the Deadline is reached without a Lynch, the Day ends with No Lynch.<br><br>________<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample Role PM</span><br>(At least one player got this.)</span></span><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [PlayerName], you are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Abilities:</span> Although you have no special abilities, you have the two most important things you can have: your vote and your brain.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win Conditions:</span> You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</fieldset>"}

'What WAS he up to?'<br>'We need to reprogramme The House as fast as we can. Where's that tablet? It shoud be here.' That was another member of the group opening a drawer. 'Here it is,' said while picking up the tablet. 'Let me handle this, I know how to operate it.'<br>'Why YOU?' shouted a nervous voice. 'How could we know that it wasn't you who-'<br><br>'STOP!' interrupted someone the forthcoming fight. 'What do you think of this?' He took out the disk of the opened drawer and held it high. It was a red one.<br>'That's...' someone started.<br>'...not the same disk.'<br>'I saw it too!' another shout was heard. 'It was green, I saw it!'<br>'That means one thing...' a calm one who had been silent until now summarized what everyone thought. 'Some people in our group are agaist our Mission.'<br><br>'That's impossible' snapped someone. 'We all heard it. The Executor checked each of us personally.'<br>'Well, the Executor's dead. I don't know what he was up to, but it's clear that he didn't check any of us.'<br>'And you know this because...' <br>'It's obvious,' the calm voice went on. 'Some people in The House are against our Mission. They want to go back in time to do something else. I think their plan was the following: killing the Executor, changing the Disk and proceeding whatever they wanted to.'<br>'But the Time...,' asked someone.<br>'They didn't suspect that the Executor would betray all of us. They were just as surprised as all of us that we haven't arrived yet.'<br>'So, if he hadn't tried to travel to another Time, their would be successful by now...'<br>'Ironically, yes.'<br><br>'Now what?' The question was asked after a long silence.<br>'Well, it will take some time to get back to the Time we wanted to go. We're decades away again, but in the other direction. We need to sort everything out by ourselves.'<br>'Can't we just return?' Asked another nervous voice.<br>'To admit that we've failed? We'd never be allowed to travel anymore.'<br>'Oh, sh--.'<br>'So, who agrees with my theory?' The calm one interrupted the conversation.<br>Some instantly, others with a little pause, but everyone raised their hands.<br>'Who thinks that we should sort it out, finish our mission and return when everything's ready?'<br>Yet again, everyone agreed.<br><br>'So, let's get to work. Examine everything we could. And remember. We can trust no one. Anyone can be against our mission. Even me.'<br><br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Aneninen, Space/Time Saboteur</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">was killed at <span class=\"noboldsig\">Night 0</span><br></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day1 has started.</span><br>________<br><br><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Vote Count 1.00</legend><span class=\"noboldsig\">Not Voting</span> (13) \u2013 zakk, Zoronos, Klingoncelt, WoodyWoodpecker, Boonskiies, OhGodMyLife, Slandaar, Radja, BlueMoonRising, elusive, PointYBagelS, Ricastle, ChaosOmega<br><br>With <span class=\"noboldsig\">13</span> players in play, it will take <span class=\"noboldsig\">7</span> to Lynch.<br><br>The Deadline is <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2015-07-11 01:02:00)</span></span><br><br>Radja is on V/LA until Sunday evening.</fieldset></span></span>"}

There is this 3rd one that is pretty common in the mafia world... it's called a null read.

It doesn't. and I don't know why you decided to bold the black and white comment.<br><br>So yet again you fail to prove where I have had a scum read on boon.

It doesn't feel like you're trying to get a good lynch, it feels like you're trying to get Woody to slip up.  Yes, yes I know...your argument will be, \"He's scum!

I feel like your trying to get <span style=\"font-style: italic\">anyone</span> else to slip up to get the pressure off you.  How convenient that your pushing the most excitable player in the game.  The guy can't sit still for two minutes.  I bet he's bouncing in his computer chair right now!  So if you need someone to rage, who better to push than Woody.  <br><br>Again, my problem with this game so far is the reactionary play of a lot of players.  You, Boons are the first to come to my mind.  Boons states that he'll be super duper townie McTown on D2, so I'm willing to hold him to it and not vote him."}

Those that exist are mostly theme games that I wouldn't expect to be quite as relevant.<br>I'm basing a lot of the assumption that she's calmer as scum on things that Ricastle has said here, and things that Rubicon said in NY183 when she got a bit of a wagon there.<br>Admittedly hearsay but Rubicon in particular seems to be very good at reading elusive.<br><br>Regardless of that, anyone can cherrypick a game to fit their narrative.  Even with her town meta, she may occasionally react well to pressure.  I encourage you to look yourself and see, don't just rely on what I'm saying.<br><br>It's also worth noting that she has replaced out of a lot of games.

If you're town just be glad she replaced out because she wouldn't have admitted to anything and the thread would have been drenched in flame and rendered unreadable. You have made your points and anyone who reads the thread has registered your arguments. Unless you bring something new to the table try to be concise from now on or else risk people ignoring your input; or worse loosing enthusiasm for the game. If you are scum go on."}

She was asked for a read on me by Diego but refused to answer until Diego answered her rvs questions. I voted her for it and then I immediately become her top scum read. She tried to make s case on me but it was full of inaccurate information and even bold face lies. I point those out and she tries to argue with me and even admits she was trying to get me to rage quit (probably cause she sees me as a threat) and when I say I'm not going to rage quit (cause I wasn't even raging ) she quits instead.<br><br>Now all these people say the quitting is a town tell for her cause of \"meta\" also its her \"meta\" to play emotional like this but I disagree with giving her a town read solely based on meta because meta can be manipulated. Now players tried to link me to past games to prove this was her meta but the only thing I saw similar was she does tend to only replace out as town but nobody should get a free ride got anti-town behavior. <br><br>I point out specific examples of how she was different in a game played with ricastle and he immediately ignored my evidence saying it was my fault that I didn't give her a chance to play properly which is clearly BS. Later hr actually tried  to argue I didn't provide any meta arguments against her and then backtracks  and says I didn't give any good evidence and then changes his tune again and says he ignored my evidence cause I somehow \"thrusted\" it on him<br><br>Do you get that? <br><br>1. Didn't provide any<br>2. The evidence wasn't good enough<br>3. Didnt read it, he ignored it...<br><br>How can all 3 statements be the truth<br><br>Oh and he votes me citing policy Lynch reasons saying I'm playing anti-town despite the fact that I'm actually trying to get my scum suspect lynched, I'm making arguments why they are scum, and I'm debating people who try to say I'm wrong by using actual evidence to show why I don't think I'm wrong.<br><br>So a Lynch on elusive slot or a Lynch on ricastle are the only acceptable lynches.

You don't judge arguments on account of what the one who makes them does after he makes then, you judge them by how good they are and they were fucking good, which is why you tried to bury them in fluff. I was avoiding a NL AND I was scumhunting. 3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days or 3 hours left .. I'm scumhunting as town.

Here it is<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7080634#p7080634\" class=\"postlink\">post 1651</a>, WoodyWoodpecker wrote:</cite>given the voyeur flip to me it looks like he was fighting hard to save a pr.</div></blockquote><br><br>2. \"goes into omgus mode and says I've put Cow to L-1 without reasoning and now I'm a hypocrite for asking for reasons.\" - This is bullshit. What actually happened is he accused me of weasling my way onto wagons and I clearly stated my only lynch target day 1 was going to be elusive/naked. The only time I moved my votes to somebody else was when deadline was literally hours away. This imo is not \"weasling\" what I did though is point out the hypocrisy because he was just as guilty of hopping on wagons but the difference is I gave a reason, my reason was deadline was near and any lynch is better than a NL. He gave no reason at all for his votes so he basically doesn't have ground to stand on to accuse anyone of weasling onto wagons when somebody could easily say he was guilty of the same thing.<br><br>3. \"He goes into omgus mode saying I dodged the Klingon wagon and if my arguments were so conclusive I wouldn't have stepped of Klingon. \" Again he says omgus like it actually means anything. I was scum reading him since day 1 so any attack from me isn't omgus, even if it was omgus (which it wasn't) omgus isn't even scummy. And he did dodge the kling wagon and the points i kept making is if he has IN HIS WORDS \"conclusive evidence\" why wasnt he pushing harder? He votes kling which shows like he believes what he says, but takes his vote off 15 minutes later and doesn't even attempt to try and convince anyone else to follow him, he doesn't even try and convice people to unvote boon. <br><br>Also if he had \"conclusive evidence\" like he said he did, why did he still question boon? this question appears like he doesn't believe boon is town and it came AFTER his \"conclusive reasons\"<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7053153#p7053153\" class=\"postlink\">post 1191</a>, NakedJogger wrote:</cite>Hey Boon, why didn't you go after Klingon when you realized she claimed a non-normal role?</div></blockquote><br>and during all this time he still wasn't trying to lynch kling, convince people to lynch kling, or even defend boon and what did he end up doing in the end? he voted boon and he wasn't vocal about his displeasure of a boon lynch. If he had \"conclusive evidence\" don't you think he would have been more vocal?<br><br>4. \"He says we should just lynch Cow and lynch him tomorrow if Cow flips scum, but there's no evidence to suggest Cow's flip would clear or incriminate him .. so that looks like a defensive stall tactic. \" what is the point of this? this is irrelevant plus this is inaccurate, he should at least make sure he is posting the truth. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7084653#p7084653\" class=\"postlink\">What I actually said that if RC flips town than town can lynch me.</a> and I would think that if RC flipped town that would be more evidence for him to use to paint me as scum so his statement about \"no evidence to suggest\" is kind of odd since he is scum reading me.<br><br>5. \"Meanwhile he's got no problem with zakk and Radja and Ricastle voting for me or Cow despite those people not providing a reason either\" - A. Naked/RC are my top 2 scum reads and I want them lynched at all cost so no I don't really care what reasons they have for them. B. radja gave reason for his vote on RC so naked saying he didn't is a lie. C. zakk hasn't really given reasons for most of his votes for the entire game. I will say that his vote on Naked in post 1801, he said he was sheeping slandaar's reads since slandaar was NK'd. <br><br>6. He says I can't refute any of the hard stuff - Which I feel like I did. <br><br>7. He says I \"pounced\" on the meaningless stuff and than spoilers the discussion where we are discussion how hider role is used. He calls me a liar because I say I have only played it once. What he doesn't realize is he is attacking for meaningless things. He called me a liar about my personal experience. How is that a relevant attack? So he can attack me for something meaningless but I am now allowed to defend myself? BULLSHIT. I will defend myself from any untrue accusation no matter how relevant or irrelevant.  There is no reason as town he would call me a liar about my personal experience. And in the off chance I am wrong and he is town than he can literally go jump off a bridge because I am telling the truth.<br><br>8. \"he says something about his meta that I say is false because I \" I am not sure where he was going with this one but I don't think I ever brought up my own meta. I am not a hug fan of meta anyway.<br><br>9. <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7088235#p7088235\" class=\"postlink\">post 1873</a>, NakedJogger wrote:</cite>So now he's voting me because he claims: a) putting people to L-1 early in the dayphase is somehow scummy. b)Voting Boon 3 minutes before deadline to avoid a NL is scummy. c) I'm posting insignificant stuff and trolling. d) the only defense for elusive was meta and he doesn't dig meta (I've said a bunch of stuff about that but I wasn't willing to mantra it, essentially what elusive did wasn't scummy period). e) I voted for Pointy after I made those arguments for Boon not being scum and voted for Klingon because he was the largest counter wagon and I should've kept it on Klingon, so I weaseled my way off it.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't think any of this is entirely accurate. I have been scum reading this slot since day 1 and nobody was able to make a \"game related\" case as to why elusive was town.

If you want to call it conf.bias go right ahead but I tried to be as objective as possible<br><br>A. I don't think I ever said putting somebody at L-1 early in the day phase was scummy.

So why do you act like you are concerned about sound arguments now?</div></blockquote><br><br>OH OK now I get why he said this. His response back to me was implying I was calling naked scum for putting someone at L-1 early, ha ha NO. I was clearly pointing out his hypocrisy that he seems to care so much about other people not providing reasons for their votes yet he was guilty of the same thing himself. I never said he was scummy for putting someone at L-1 early and if you go back and read it in context I clearly didn't call him scummy for what he is saying.<br><br>B. I am not voting him because he voted boon 3 minutes before deadline to avoid a NL and I never said that. What I did take an issue with (as I already addressed above) is if he had all of this \"conclusive evidence\" why he didn't try harder to save boon? Why did he question boon like he was still suspicous of him like he did in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7053153#p7053153\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br><br>C. I am not voting naked for posting insignificant stuff and trolling. I have provided a plethora of reasons for why he is scum. They started day 1 with elusive and I provided more this day phase as well.<br><br>D. I am not voting naked because of elusive's meta and I am not voting him because people were defending him for use of meta. I established my own scum read on him BEFORE elusive replaced out. Once he replaced out everyone came out of the woodworks claiming meta. Meta had 0 reason for my scum read of elusive.<br><br>E. I am not voting him specifically for the fact that he voted pointy, it has more to do with the fact that he didn't even attempt to try and convince people to vote kling nor did he try to convince people to not lynch boon.  Let's go to the tape shall we? These \"conclusive arguments\" that naked claims he made were posts 1107, 1109, 1111, and 1116. So from Naked's POV boon should be town and kling should be scum right? can we agree on that since \"conclusive\" means pretty much 100% or dam close to it right?<br><br>so Naked's posts after 1116<br><br>1122 - talks about how hider+doc would work. (this imo doesn't seem like he is convinced one way or the other who is legit but again I am biased)<br>1123 - says we should lynch kling or me (I argue that if he has conclusive evidence that kling is scum, why would he throw my name into the mix where he doesn't have conclusive evidence for me?)<br>1126 - yells at ricastle to read. imo this would have been a good time for him to speak out against a boon lynch and re-state his arguments instead of just telling ricastle to read <br>1129 - this is where he quotes his posts but he doesn't say that this makes boon legit and kling scum, he leaves it there for people to make the determination on their own. I feel that if he thought these posts were conclusive enough he would have made more of an attempt to save boon, I know I would have if I was in that position.<br>1130 - votes klingon but doesn't add any commentary. Nothing about how his conclusive evidence, nothing about how kling's role is the fake one, nothing about boon is probably town. Just a vote<br>1133: shortly after slandaar says \"bagel or NJ\" naked votes Bagel - I will save you my opinion on this move, you guys are free to make your own assessment. Still nothing about Boon being the legit claim over kling. Still no attempt to save boon whatsoever<br>1135 - tells RC to stfu after being called scum<br>1146 - has an issue with rc wanting to lynch boon for \"bad reasoning\" and he wants to NOT lynch boon because of \"reasonable reasons\" (note day 1 he called them \"reasonable\" but day 3 he is calling then \"conclusive\")<br>1148 - responds to RC instead of trying to save boon or lynch kling or do anything useful <br>1171 - appeals to zak to vote kling or bagel and the only defense of boon at this time is he doesn't think boon would be stupid to claim a 2nd non normal, hardly a convincing argument...<br>1191 - this is where boon asks kling why he didn't go after kling - if he was town reading boon I don't see why he would ask this. This just puts more doubt on boon, not less<br>1194 - he gets the answer to his question from bagel but he doesn't seem like he is totally convinced. I mean when I type hmm I don't type that when I am convinced of something, I type it more when I am still kind of skeptical or I want to think about it some more.  I can't speak for how others do it or interpret it. Still no defense of boon at this point, no attempts to get people to vote anyone else besides boon (shortly before this post a vc was posted where bagel had 1 less vote than boon. If naked was convinced boon was telling the truth and deadline was almost near you would have thought he would be pushing harder for bagel at least)<br>1202 - says ricastle needs rope. no attempt to lynch bagel and no attempt to save boon. why? is he content with either wagon going through?<br>1227 - he says that boon's claim fits his trolling style and says this could be boon's way of \"fucking with us\". Clearly he isn't convinced of boon's role or even alignment does he?<br>If he did why would he cast more doubt on him so close to deadline? why wouldn't he be trying to save boon and lynch bagel?<br>1265 - responds to RC instead of trying to stop a boon lynch when it's so close to deadline...<br>1348 - votes boon. yes I realize deadline was about to hit but there was no additional commentary from him and he doesn't post again until the next day phase. Idk if he were town I would think he would have at least stuck around and tried to get some info from boon or something. Some people think that scum disappear during twilight on mislynches, I can't say that is reliable enough to use as a reason to lynch somebody but just strikes me odd.<br><br>so after all of that if he honestly felt boon was town (which he certainly didn't from my pov ) than yes he should have stuck on klingon and pushed harder, or at the very least pushed harder for bagel since he was the counter wagon.</div></div></div>"}

This just puts more doubt on boon, not less<br>1194 - he gets the answer to his question from bagel but he doesn't seem like he is totally convinced. I mean when I type hmm I don't type that when I am convinced of something, I type it more when I am still kind of skeptical or I want to think about it some more.  I can't speak for how others do it or interpret it. Still no defense of boon at this point, no attempts to get people to vote anyone else besides boon (shortly before this post a vc was posted where bagel had 1 less vote than boon. If naked was convinced boon was telling the truth and deadline was almost near you would have thought he would be pushing harder for bagel at least)<br>1202 - says ricastle needs rope. no attempt to lynch bagel and no attempt to save boon. why? is he content with either wagon going through?<br>1227 - he says that boon's claim fits his trolling style and says this could be boon's way of \"fucking with us\". Clearly he isn't convinced of boon's role or even alignment does he?<br>If he did why would he cast more doubt on him so close to deadline? why wouldn't he be trying to save boon and lynch bagel?<br>1265 - responds to RC instead of trying to stop a boon lynch when it's so close to deadline...<br>1348 - votes boon. yes I realize deadline was about to hit but there was no additional commentary from him and he doesn't post again until the next day phase. Idk if he were town I would think he would have at least stuck around and tried to get some info from boon or something.

'ok dude you just said I lied about my experience, joke's on you.. now I'm going to roll up my sleeves and refute your main arguemnts in a huge ass post ' (didn't happen, instead) but he just says it over and over to make his case on me look vaguely consistent. <br><br>Anyway, we can lynch zakk, fuck it.

The only time I moved my votes to somebody else was when deadline was literally hours away.

Klingon is not the only scum. 2. A wagon/lynch on Pointy was healthy for later analysis. 3. I knew I'd be online for the entire span till deadline to avoid a NL.

What kind of a defense is that? And how can he claim that I should at least make sure I'm posting the truth when not only is it the truth that even if I were to just disregard everything and lynch Cow instead that him flipping either town or scum by itself wouldn't provide additional substantial evidence for Wood to be scum or town. Therefore it must be a scummy stall-tactic. But then he said me saying RC's townflip wouldn't incriminate him further is somehow odd (as in scummy?) and fails to provide a reason why Cow flipping town would make him scummier. It's just as likely for town him as scum him to mislynch Cow if he can't provide good reasons. It's just that scum would profit more from it so that's why he suggested it in the midst of a FOS on him, to deflect my attacks without refuting them, illegitimately moving the spotlight back to Cow. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7090989#p7090989\" class=\"postlink\">post 1905</a>, WoodyWoodpecker wrote:</cite>5. \"Meanwhile he's got no problem with zakk and Radja and Ricastle voting for me or Cow despite those people not providing a reason either\" - A.

I am not voting him specifically for the fact that he voted pointy, it has more to do with the fact that he didn't even attempt to try and convince people to vote kling nor did he try to convince people to not lynch boon.  Let's go to the tape shall we? These \"conclusive arguments\" that naked claims he made were posts 1107, 1109, 1111, and 1116. So from Naked's POV boon should be town and kling should be scum right? can we agree on that since \"conclusive\" means pretty much 100% or dam close to it right?<br><br><br><br>so Naked's posts after 1116<br><br>1122 - talks about how hider+doc would work. (this imo doesn't seem like he is convinced one way or the other who is legit but again I am biased)<br>1123 - says we should lynch kling or me (I argue that if he has conclusive evidence that kling is scum, why would he throw my name into the mix where he doesn't have conclusive evidence for me?)<br>1126 - yells at ricastle to read. imo this would have been a good time for him to speak out against a boon lynch and re-state his arguments instead of just telling ricastle to read <br>1129 - this is where he quotes his posts but he doesn't say that this makes boon legit and kling scum, he leaves it there for people to make the determination on their own. I feel that if he thought these posts were conclusive enough he would have made more of an attempt to save boon, I know I would have if I was in that position.<br>1130 - votes klingon but doesn't add any commentary. Nothing about how his conclusive evidence, nothing about how kling's role is the fake one, nothing about boon is probably town. Just a vote<br>1133: shortly after slandaar says \"bagel or NJ\" naked votes Bagel - I will save you my opinion on this move, you guys are free to make your own assessment. Still nothing about Boon being the legit claim over kling. Still no attempt to save boon whatsoever<br>1135 - tells RC to stfu after being called scum<br>1146 - has an issue with rc wanting to lynch boon for \"bad reasoning\" and he wants to NOT lynch boon because of \"reasonable reasons\" (note day 1 he called them \"reasonable\" but day 3 he is calling then \"conclusive\")<br>1148 - responds to RC instead of trying to save boon or lynch kling or do anything useful <br>1171 - appeals to zak to vote kling or bagel and the only defense of boon at this time is he doesn't think boon would be stupid to claim a 2nd non normal, hardly a convincing argument...<br>1191 - this is where boon asks kling why he didn't go after kling - if he was town reading boon I don't see why he would ask this. This just puts more doubt on boon, not less<br>1194 - he gets the answer to his question from bagel but he doesn't seem like he is totally convinced. I mean when I type hmm I don't type that when I am convinced of something, I type it more when I am still kind of skeptical or I want to think about it some more.  I can't speak for how others do it or interpret it. Still no defense of boon at this point, no attempts to get people to vote anyone else besides boon (shortly before this post a vc was posted where bagel had 1 less vote than boon. If naked was convinced boon was telling the truth and deadline was almost near you would have thought he would be pushing harder for bagel at least)<br>1202 - says ricastle needs rope. no attempt to lynch bagel and no attempt to save boon. why? is he content with either wagon going through?<br>1227 - he says that boon's claim fits his trolling style and says this could be boon's way of \"fucking with us\". Clearly he isn't convinced of boon's role or even alignment does he?<br>If he did why would he cast more doubt on him so close to deadline? why wouldn't he be trying to save boon and lynch bagel?<br>1265 - responds to RC instead of trying to stop a boon lynch when it's so close to deadline...<br>1348 - votes boon. yes I realize deadline was about to hit but there was no additional commentary from him and he doesn't post again until the next day phase. Idk if he were town I would think he would have at least stuck around and tried to get some info from boon or something. Some people think that scum disappear during twilight on mislynches, I can't say that is reliable enough to use as a reason to lynch somebody but just strikes me odd.<br><br>so after all of that if he honestly felt boon was town (which he certainly didn't from my pov ) than yes he should have stuck on klingon and pushed harder, or at the very least pushed harder for bagel since he was the counter wagon</div></blockquote><br></a><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7093071#p7093071\" class=\"postlink\">HUUUT!</a>"}

Except nobody else seems to have a book so if you're scum you deserve this more than this town so go ahead and mislynch me. GOOOGOGOGOGO OGOG GOOGOO!"}

But what I've got in reserve is that I still feel that NJ/Loran is town, and I am cooling on my scum read of ricastle, though if he is scum it's still epic that he got saved by a town doc from the town vig.  I think radja's push against blue moon that I mindlessly followed (I kind of mindlessly followed radja a lot this game, that's what I get for reading level-headedness as a town tell in a game full of vitriol and crap) means blue cannot be scum either.  So I'm basically POEing myself down to zzzx (formerly woody) which is actually comforting, because I don't want to live in a world where one of the shitposters that made this game so unbearable for such long stretches isn't scum.<br><br>Not voting yet, but I'm provisionally ready to vote zzzx.  I feel good that my strongest townread is already voting there, but I don't want to give anyone a chance to hammer before I can at least do a little bit of reengagement with the game state.  If zzzx is scum my next best read is still ricastle, as outlandish as his being scum here may now seem.  Blue ain't scum, and I'm basically willing to stake the game on my loran townread because I'm generally much more confident in my ability to townread than my ability to scum read.  Radja misread notwithstanding.<br><br>Also, hey everyone, sorry for trying to set records for most prods ever this game.  I blame mish mash.  And procrastination.  And defeatism.  I'll get better."}

And honestly I'll fondly remember the one time I got to be a super lurking scum and get away with it, something that used to happen way back in the day a lot before lynch all lurkers entered the meta consciousness.
