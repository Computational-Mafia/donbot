Asked Org0011. He was one of the Chief Organizators.<br>\n'Yes, Sir. And,' The Executor paused for a split second, 'I've checked each member's Timeline personally.'<br>\n'Good. Now, let's get down to business. Here are the names we should get rid of.' Org0011 gave a small plastic tablet to him. He wondered whether he could trust the new Executor but... his records were good and this seemed to be an easy mission anyway. A perfect start for a new one.<br>\n'What sort of names are these?!' Asked the Executor raising his eyebrows.<br>\n'Oh, those are not real names. So-called nick-names.'<br>\n'Threat Level?'<br>\n'2. Normally.'<br>\n'Which means...' pondered the Executor.<br>\n'Unless they start talking to each other, none of them would ever reach 4 alone. But if they began to do so... the consequences might be unpredictable.'<br>\n'So, we are to prevent their communication. How &#8211; and when?'<br>\n'Take this,' Org0011 handed over a small green disk. 'Find a computer with Internet access. I think you'll find one easily even at that time.' He gave the Executor another tablet.<br>\n'10. 10. 2006? I learnt History, Sir. Internet Access had become very common before the Sixth Critical Date.'<br>\n'Indeed.' He wants to look smart but it will sort itself later out how smart he really is, thought the Org.<br>\n'Anything else we should be aware of, Sir?'<br>\n'Nothing. Good Riddance, Executor! Do not fail us.'<br>\n<br>\nThe Executor turned around. 'You've heard the Org. On board, everyone!'<br>\n<br>\nThirteen people, one by one, entered The House.<br>\n<br>\nThe House indeed looked like a house and it was big enough for at least thrice as much people. Even better: it had the ability to look like a house from outside. Wherever and when-ever it went, it looked so ...natural as if it had been there all the time. <br>\nOne day they'd be able to build a smaller time machine, they said. But until then, The House was the best &#8211; the only solution for the trip.<br>\n<br>\nAs the last person entered the door, the Executor followed. No one saw the strange expression on his face.<br>\n<br>\nWithout any sound The House disappeared. The trip to the past started.'<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n________<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RULES</div></div><br>\n<br>\n(<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Stolen from multiple sources</div> Found somewhere in Space/Time ^_^)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">General Rules</div> <br>\n<br>\n(1) Unless it's stated in a different way, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">general site rules are applied</div>. <br>\n(2) If you're in doubt contact me via PM.<br>\n(3) Although these are in the general site rules, I'm pointing out a couple of things. Firstly, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">do not quote or share your Role PM</div>. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>\n(4) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Do not talk about ongoing games.</div> This goes for games you're dead in and games played on other sites too.<br>\n(5) Do not use encrypted and/or unreadable (eg. very small) text. <br>\n(6) Play to win. Do not play against your Win Condition.<br>\n(7) Do not be a douchebag, please! Attack the posts, not the player itself.<br>\n(8) My color is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Violet</div> (#8000FF), do not use it, please!<br>\n(9) If you pretend to break a rule, you will face the same consequences as if you had broken that rule for real.<br>\n(10) If I happen to change the rules (which is unlikely anyway), you will get informed about it.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mechanics and Activity</div><br>\n<br>\n(11) This is a closed Setup. There are no Roles with explicitely Non-Normal mechanics (eg. Lyncher, Jester, Nexus, etc).<br>\n(12) The flavour is providing a story for the game. Although it is worth reading it, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">it contains NO information about possible factions, roles or alignments</div>. <br>\n(13) The game has a Day Start.<br>\n(14) The Scum faction(s) have Daytalk.<br>\n(15) The Day Phases last for 14 days.<br>\n(16) The Night Phases last for 2 days. If a player who has any Night Action doesn't inform me about his Night Action, No Action will happen. <br>\n(17) If a player has been inactive for 48 hours, they will get a Prod. After the Prod has happened, they will have 24 hours to post in the thread or else they will be replaced.<br>\n(18) As soon as a player gets their third prod, they get replaced automatically unless they start posting before a replacement is found.<br>\n(19) If you are planning to be inactive for a certain period, inform me about it via PM or in the thread.<br>\n(20) In special cases a Deadline extension may occour, but do not bank on it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting and Lynching</div><br>\n(21) You can vote by using the vote tag, eg. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aneninen</span> or by bold text in the following format: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Aneninen</div>. <br>\n(22) You need not Unvote if you want to change your vote. <br>\n(23) Votes are preferred being posted in a separate line. <br>\n(24) As long as I am able to resolve whom are you voting for, I will accept your vote. This goes for obvious abbreviations like <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ane</span>.<br>\n(25) If I think it is a vote, it is a vote.<br>\n(26) Votes posted in quotes and/or spoilers are ignored automatically. This may (but not esentially will) go for badly-formatted quotes too. I am not obligated to fix your posts or tags.<br>\n(27) When the majority of the living players are voting for the same person (typically half of the players +1; the exact number always appears alongside the Vote Count) a Lynch is achieved. The same amount of votes are needed for a No Lynch; in this case everyone survives the Day phase. If all living players are voting for Draw, the game ends with a Draw.<br>\n(28) After a Lynch (or a No Lynch) has been achieved, you may post in the thread until I lock it, but all further votes will be ignored. <br>\n(29) If you are dead, you are dead. Period. You are not allowed to post in the game any more. Not even \"Bah\" posts.<br>\n(30) If the Deadline is reached without a Lynch, the Day ends with No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\n________<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample Role PM</div><br>\n(At least one player got this.)</div><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [PlayerName], you are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Abilities:</div> Although you have no special abilities, you have the two most important things you can have: your vote and your brain.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Win Conditions:</div> You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</fieldset>", "time": "Fri Jun 26, 2015 9:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62339&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "62339"}

Actually some of them even knew that they had been way \"over-time\" but none of them dared to question the Executor.<br>\n<br>\nThey didn't really have the opportunity to question him anyway. <br>\nAs the trip started he went into the Control Room, set the door on Do Not Disturb and since then noone saw him coming out. <br>\n<br>\nAlthough they had been having fun during the trip (and to tell the truth, none of them had cared a lot about the Executor), as the Arrival Time approached, they got more and more nervous.<br>\n<br>\n'Okay, that's enough,' said the bravest of them. 'I'll check him what he's doing. We all know that we should have arrived by now. Even if we're not talking about it.'<br>\n<br>\nNoone hold him back as he waked to the door.<br>\nSurprisingly, it wasn't locked at all. <br>\n<br>\nIt took a couple of seconds until he realized what happened.<br>\n'Everyone! Come over here!' He roared.<br>\nAll of them run into the Control Room. <br>\n<br>\nThe Executor was lying on the floor. He was shot.<br>\n<br>\n'Do not touch anything!' Someone shouted. 'We need to collect every clue. Someone has killed him and it's obvious that it was one of us.'<br>\n'But what about the mission?' Asked another one. 'We are supposed to-'<br>\n'Check this out!' A third member of the group pointed at The Timer. 'It's..'<br>\n'10. 10. ...1968??!' Someone realized. 'That...'<br>\n'...belongs to the Forbidden Time.' a calm voice finished the sentence. 'What WAS he up to?'<br>\n'We need to reprogramme The House as fast as we can. Where's that tablet? It shoud be here.' That was another member of the group opening a drawer. 'Here it is,' said while picking up the tablet. 'Let me handle this, I know how to operate it.'<br>\n'Why YOU?' shouted a nervous voice. 'How could we know that it wasn't you who-'<br>\n<br>\n'STOP!' interrupted someone the forthcoming fight. 'What do you think of this?' He took out the disk of the opened drawer and held it high. It was a red one.<br>\n'That's...' someone started.<br>\n'...not the same disk.'<br>\n'I saw it too!' another shout was heard. 'It was green, I saw it!'<br>\n'That means one thing...' a calm one who had been silent until now summarized what everyone thought. 'Some people in our group are agaist our Mission.'<br>\n<br>\n'That's impossible' snapped someone. 'We all heard it. The Executor checked each of us personally.'<br>\n'Well, the Executor's dead. I don't know what he was up to, but it's clear that he didn't check any of us.'<br>\n'And you know this because...' <br>\n'It's obvious,' the calm voice went on. 'Some people in The House are against our Mission. They want to go back in time to do something else. I think their plan was the following: killing the Executor, changing the Disk and proceeding whatever they wanted to.'<br>\n'But the Time...,' asked someone.<br>\n'They didn't suspect that the Executor would betray all of us. They were just as surprised as all of us that we haven't arrived yet.'<br>\n'So, if he hadn't tried to travel to another Time, their would be successful by now...'<br>\n'Ironically, yes.'<br>\n<br>\n'Now what?' The question was asked after a long silence.<br>\n'Well, it will take some time to get back to the Time we wanted to go. We're decades away again, but in the other direction. We need to sort everything out by ourselves.'<br>\n'Can't we just return?' Asked another nervous voice.<br>\n'To admit that we've failed? We'd never be allowed to travel anymore.'<br>\n'Oh, sh--.'<br>\n'So, who agrees with my theory?' The calm one interrupted the conversation.<br>\nSome instantly, others with a little pause, but everyone raised their hands.<br>\n'Who thinks that we should sort it out, finish our mission and return when everything's ready?'<br>\nYet again, everyone agreed.<br>\n<br>\n'So, let's get to work. Examine everything we could. And remember. We can trust no one. Anyone can be against our mission.

Miss Sadlowsky went to the party but this song &#8211; its title used have been The Forest, anyway &#8211; wasn't played. She got noticed by none, got drunk, fell asleep at the party and left the place next morning. Alone. At this point everything Sadlowsky ever made suddenly changed to \"used have made\".<br>\n<br>\nSo.

The lecturer stopped for a couple of seconds. 'Consider this. How did we delete that song?'<br>\n<br>\n'Erm' another student started 'we prevented someone from making it?'<br>\n<br>\n'Very good.

However, as the resources get fewer and fewer, discontentment arises. In the short term, strict rules and laws, giving more power to the existing authorities or setting up a couple of new ones, always solves the problem. In the long term, on the other hand, there's always a critical point for the society. A critical point when \"inside factors\", like a revolution or \"outside factors\", like an invasion or a contagious disease makes the existing system fall.<br>\n<br>\nSome has already realized that the \"known world\" equals the whole planet right now, which means there are not enough resources for everyone. Not even for the majority. Anyone tries to rule at least a significant segment of the world is in a terrible situation... in theory.<br>\n<br>\nBut we've learnt from our history. <br>\nWe can't give enough for everyone &#8211; and it's definitely not our goal to DO so &#8211;, but we can give the people an ILLUSION. An illusion of being able to get everything they need. <br>\nStill, this illusion is to be maintained. Any ideas, inventions, discoveries, especially backed by are might reveal the reality.<br>\nWE are to fight against all those dangerous things.<br>\n\"Fight\" is not the proper expression, though. Noone can fight against or FOR something which... has never existed and never will.<br>\n<br>\nThat's our goal.

You don't judge arguments on account of what the one who makes them does after he makes then, you judge them by how good they are and they were fucking good, which is why you tried to bury them in fluff. I was avoiding a NL AND I was scumhunting. 3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days or 3 hours left .. I'm scumhunting as town. I'm not in the game of being sure about a read and keeping my vote there for the sake of you not to have a ridiculous reason to try to discourage my attack on you.<br>\nI wanted to see people's reactions when confronted with two wagons instead of one and I had no faith in town picking up on my arguments before the deadline and I DIDN'T NEED TO because I wasn't in a hurry to lynch Klingon, her faith was sealed and it was a question of time so I did what I thought was the better play.. contribute to having two main wagons, hoping that the unexpected one would wind up being the lynch.

Somewhere between Rajda and Moon, that makes it nullscum I guess. I also forgot to add about shamelessness that in my experience scum are more like astronauts on the moon, they move slowly and carefully, proactively working on preemptively eliminating every angle for a hypothetical attack on them, subsequently pulling the handbrake as to not be too invisible. Add a little fluff here and ther, secure the mislynch but Radja .. he's too silent.

He dodges the question and goes into omgus mode and says I've put Cow to L-1 without reasoning and now I'm a hypocrite for asking for reasons.<br>\n<br>\nHe goes into omgus mode saying I dodged the Klingon wagon and if my arguments were so conclusive I wouldn't have stepped of Klingon. <br>\n<br>\nHe says we should just lynch Cow and lynch him tomorrow if Cow flips scum, but there's no evidence to suggest Cow's flip would clear or incriminate him .. so that looks like a defensive stall tactic. <br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile he's got no problem with zakk and Radja and Ricastle voting for me or Cow despite those people not providing a reason either, even saying they haven't read the thread.. bust Woody is ecstatic 'I've been saying this all along bal balblabala', instead of wanting to know more about his experience or something. <br>\n<br>\nUhhm what else.

I also am not going to respond to Kling when/if he does actually attempt to respond. This is my take it or leave it reponse and it isn't up for debate with him. Now if anyone else wants to discuss this with me, fine but I have to put everyone on notice that I recently had a family issue come up and it requires me to travel away and I will have very limited time to focus on mafia. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">(2)</div> I have already replaced out of all my other games and will only be sticking around in this one for 1/2 days OR the end of the day phase, Whichever comes first.

What actually happened is he accused me of weasling my way onto wagons and I clearly stated my only lynch target day 1 was going to be elusive/naked. The only time I moved my votes to somebody else was when deadline was literally hours away. This imo is not \"weasling\" what I did though is point out the hypocrisy because he was just as guilty of hopping on wagons but the difference is I gave a reason, my reason was deadline was near and any lynch is better than a NL. He gave no reason at all for his votes so he basically doesn't have ground to stand on to accuse anyone of weasling onto wagons when somebody could easily say he was guilty of the same thing.<br>\n<br>\n3. \"He goes into omgus mode saying I dodged the Klingon wagon and if my arguments were so conclusive I wouldn't have stepped of Klingon. \" Again he says omgus like it actually means anything. I was scum reading him since day 1 so any attack from me isn't omgus, even if it was omgus (which it wasn't) omgus isn't even scummy. And he did dodge the kling wagon and the points i kept making is if he has IN HIS WORDS \"conclusive evidence\" why wasnt he pushing harder? He votes kling which shows like he believes what he says, but takes his vote off 15 minutes later and doesn't even attempt to try and convince anyone else to follow him, he doesn't even try and convice people to unvote boon. <br>\n<br>\nAlso if he had \"conclusive evidence\" like he said he did, why did he still question boon? this question appears like he doesn't believe boon is town and it came AFTER his \"conclusive reasons\"<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7053153#p7053153\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7053153#p7053153\" data-post-id=\"7053153\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1191</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20634\">FakedBlogger</a> wrote:</cite>Hey Boon, why didn't you go after Klingon when you realized she claimed a non-normal role?</div></blockquote><br>\nand during all this time he still wasn't trying to lynch kling, convince people to lynch kling, or even defend boon and what did he end up doing in the end? he voted boon and he wasn't vocal about his displeasure of a boon lynch. If he had \"conclusive evidence\" don't you think he would have been more vocal?<br>\n<br>\n4. \"He says we should just lynch Cow and lynch him tomorrow if Cow flips scum, but there's no evidence to suggest Cow's flip would clear or incriminate him .. so that looks like a defensive stall tactic. \" what is the point of this? this is irrelevant plus this is inaccurate, he should at least make sure he is posting the truth. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7084653#p7084653\" class=\"postlink\">What I actually said that if RC flips town than town can lynch me.</a> and I would think that if RC flipped town that would be more evidence for him to use to paint me as scum so his statement about \"no evidence to suggest\" is kind of odd since he is scum reading me.<br>\n<br>\n5. \"Meanwhile he's got no problem with zakk and Radja and Ricastle voting for me or Cow despite those people not providing a reason either\" - A. Naked/RC are my top 2 scum reads and I want them lynched at all cost so no I don't really care what reasons they have for them. B. radja gave reason for his vote on RC so naked saying he didn't is a lie. C. zakk hasn't really given reasons for most of his votes for the entire game. I will say that his vote on Naked in post 1801, he said he was sheeping slandaar's reads since slandaar was NK'd. <br>\n<br>\n6. He says I can't refute any of the hard stuff - Which I feel like I did. <br>\n<br>\n7. He says I \"pounced\" on the meaningless stuff and than spoilers the discussion where we are discussion how hider role is used. He calls me a liar because I say I have only played it once. What he doesn't realize is he is attacking for meaningless things. He called me a liar about my personal experience. How is that a relevant attack? So he can attack me for something meaningless but I am now allowed to defend myself? BULLSHIT. I will defend myself from any untrue accusation no matter how relevant or irrelevant.  There is no reason as town he would call me a liar about my personal experience. And in the off chance I am wrong and he is town than he can literally go jump off a bridge because I am telling the truth.<br>\n<br>\n8. \"he says something about his meta that I say is false because I \" I am not sure where he was going with this one but I don't think I ever brought up my own meta.

I have been scum reading this slot since day 1 and nobody was able to make a \"game related\" case as to why elusive was town.

If you want to call it conf.bias go right ahead but I tried to be as objective as possible<br>\n<br>\nA. I don't think I ever said putting somebody at L-1 early in the day phase was scummy.

His response back to me was implying I was calling naked scum for putting someone at L-1 early, ha ha NO. I was clearly pointing out his hypocrisy that he seems to care so much about other people not providing reasons for their votes yet he was guilty of the same thing himself. I never said he was scummy for putting someone at L-1 early and if you go back and read it in context I clearly didn't call him scummy for what he is saying.<br>\n<br>\nB. I am not voting him because he voted boon 3 minutes before deadline to avoid a NL and I never said that. What I did take an issue with (as I already addressed above) is if he had all of this \"conclusive evidence\" why he didn't try harder to save boon? Why did he question boon like he was still suspicous of him like he did in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7053153#p7053153\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br>\n<br>\nC. I am not voting naked for posting insignificant stuff and trolling. I have provided a plethora of reasons for why he is scum. They started day 1 with elusive and I provided more this day phase as well.<br>\n<br>\nD. I am not voting naked because of elusive's meta and I am not voting him because people were defending him for use of meta. I established my own scum read on him BEFORE elusive replaced out. Once he replaced out everyone came out of the woodworks claiming meta. Meta had 0 reason for my scum read of elusive.<br>\n<br>\nE. I am not voting him specifically for the fact that he voted pointy, it has more to do with the fact that he didn't even attempt to try and convince people to vote kling nor did he try to convince people to not lynch boon.  Let's go to the tape shall we? These \"conclusive arguments\" that naked claims he made were posts 1107, 1109, 1111, and 1116. So from Naked's POV boon should be town and kling should be scum right? can we agree on that since \"conclusive\" means pretty much 100% or dam close to it right?<br>\n<br>\nso Naked's posts after 1116<br>\n<br>\n1122 - talks about how hider+doc would work. (this imo doesn't seem like he is convinced one way or the other who is legit but again I am biased)<br>\n1123 - says we should lynch kling or me (I argue that if he has conclusive evidence that kling is scum, why would he throw my name into the mix where he doesn't have conclusive evidence for me?)<br>\n1126 - yells at ricastle to read. imo this would have been a good time for him to speak out against a boon lynch and re-state his arguments instead of just telling ricastle to read <br>\n1129 - this is where he quotes his posts but he doesn't say that this makes boon legit and kling scum, he leaves it there for people to make the determination on their own. I feel that if he thought these posts were conclusive enough he would have made more of an attempt to save boon, I know I would have if I was in that position.<br>\n1130 - votes klingon but doesn't add any commentary. Nothing about how his conclusive evidence, nothing about how kling's role is the fake one, nothing about boon is probably town. Just a vote<br>\n1133: shortly after slandaar says \"bagel or NJ\" naked votes Bagel - I will save you my opinion on this move, you guys are free to make your own assessment. Still nothing about Boon being the legit claim over kling. Still no attempt to save boon whatsoever<br>\n1135 - tells RC to stfu after being called scum<br>\n1146 - has an issue with rc wanting to lynch boon for \"bad reasoning\" and he wants to NOT lynch boon because of \"reasonable reasons\" (note day 1 he called them \"reasonable\" but day 3 he is calling then \"conclusive\")<br>\n1148 - responds to RC instead of trying to save boon or lynch kling or do anything useful <br>\n1171 - appeals to zak to vote kling or bagel and the only defense of boon at this time is he doesn't think boon would be stupid to claim a 2nd non normal, hardly a convincing argument...<br>\n1191 - this is where boon asks kling why he didn't go after kling - if he was town reading boon I don't see why he would ask this. This just puts more doubt on boon, not less<br>\n1194 - he gets the answer to his question from bagel but he doesn't seem like he is totally convinced. I mean when I type hmm I don't type that when I am convinced of something, I type it more when I am still kind of skeptical or I want to think about it some more.  I can't speak for how others do it or interpret it. Still no defense of boon at this point, no attempts to get people to vote anyone else besides boon (shortly before this post a vc was posted where bagel had 1 less vote than boon. If naked was convinced boon was telling the truth and deadline was almost near you would have thought he would be pushing harder for bagel at least)<br>\n1202 - says ricastle needs rope. no attempt to lynch bagel and no attempt to save boon. why? is he content with either wagon going through?<br>\n1227 - he says that boon's claim fits his trolling style and says this could be boon's way of \"fucking with us\". Clearly he isn't convinced of boon's role or even alignment does he?<br>\nIf he did why would he cast more doubt on him so close to deadline? why wouldn't he be trying to save boon and lynch bagel?<br>\n1265 - responds to RC instead of trying to stop a boon lynch when it's so close to deadline...<br>\n1348 - votes boon. yes I realize deadline was about to hit but there was no additional commentary from him and he doesn't post again until the next day phase. Idk if he were town I would think he would have at least stuck around and tried to get some info from boon or something. Some people think that scum disappear during twilight on mislynches, I can't say that is reliable enough to use as a reason to lynch somebody but just strikes me odd.<br>\n<br>\nso after all of that if he honestly felt boon was town (which he certainly didn't from my pov ) than yes he should have stuck on klingon and pushed harder, or at the very least pushed harder for bagel since he was the counter wagon.</div></div></div>", "time": "Sun Jul 26, 2015 3:43 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62339&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "62339"}

This just puts more doubt on boon, not less<br>\n1194 - he gets the answer to his question from bagel but he doesn't seem like he is totally convinced. I mean when I type hmm I don't type that when I am convinced of something, I type it more when I am still kind of skeptical or I want to think about it some more.  I can't speak for how others do it or interpret it. Still no defense of boon at this point, no attempts to get people to vote anyone else besides boon (shortly before this post a vc was posted where bagel had 1 less vote than boon. If naked was convinced boon was telling the truth and deadline was almost near you would have thought he would be pushing harder for bagel at least)<br>\n1202 - says ricastle needs rope. no attempt to lynch bagel and no attempt to save boon. why? is he content with either wagon going through?<br>\n1227 - he says that boon's claim fits his trolling style and says this could be boon's way of \"fucking with us\".

Idk if he were town I would think he would have at least stuck around and tried to get some info from boon or something.

What kind of a defense is that? And how can he claim that I should at least make sure I'm posting the truth when not only is it the truth that even if I were to just disregard everything and lynch Cow instead that him flipping either town or scum by itself wouldn't provide additional substantial evidence for Wood to be scum or town. Therefore it must be a scummy stall-tactic. But then he said me saying RC's townflip wouldn't incriminate him further is somehow odd (as in scummy?) and fails to provide a reason why Cow flipping town would make him scummier. It's just as likely for town him as scum him to mislynch Cow if he can't provide good reasons. It's just that scum would profit more from it so that's why he suggested it in the midst of a FOS on him, to deflect my attacks without refuting them, illegitimately moving the spotlight back to Cow. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7090989#p7090989\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7090989#p7090989\" data-post-id=\"7090989\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1905</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25930\">WoodyWoodpecker</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n5. \"Meanwhile he's got no problem with zakk and Radja and Ricastle voting for me or Cow despite those people not providing a reason either\" - A.

Still no attempt to save boon whatsoever<br>\n1135 - tells RC to stfu after being called scum<br>\n1146 - has an issue with rc wanting to lynch boon for \"bad reasoning\" and he wants to NOT lynch boon because of \"reasonable reasons\" (note day 1 he called them \"reasonable\" but day 3 he is calling then \"conclusive\")<br>\n1148 - responds to RC instead of trying to save boon or lynch kling or do anything useful <br>\n1171 - appeals to zak to vote kling or bagel and the only defense of boon at this time is he doesn't think boon would be stupid to claim a 2nd non normal, hardly a convincing argument...<br>\n1191 - this is where boon asks kling why he didn't go after kling - if he was town reading boon I don't see why he would ask this. This just puts more doubt on boon, not less<br>\n1194 - he gets the answer to his question from bagel but he doesn't seem like he is totally convinced. I mean when I type hmm I don't type that when I am convinced of something, I type it more when I am still kind of skeptical or I want to think about it some more.  I can't speak for how others do it or interpret it. Still no defense of boon at this point, no attempts to get people to vote anyone else besides boon (shortly before this post a vc was posted where bagel had 1 less vote than boon. If naked was convinced boon was telling the truth and deadline was almost near you would have thought he would be pushing harder for bagel at least)<br>\n1202 - says ricastle needs rope. no attempt to lynch bagel and no attempt to save boon. why? is he content with either wagon going through?<br>\n1227 - he says that boon's claim fits his trolling style and says this could be boon's way of \"fucking with us\". Clearly he isn't convinced of boon's role or even alignment does he?<br>\nIf he did why would he cast more doubt on him so close to deadline? why wouldn't he be trying to save boon and lynch bagel?<br>\n1265 - responds to RC instead of trying to stop a boon lynch when it's so close to deadline...<br>\n1348 - votes boon. yes I realize deadline was about to hit but there was no additional commentary from him and he doesn't post again until the next day phase. Idk if he were town I would think he would have at least stuck around and tried to get some info from boon or something. Some people think that scum disappear during twilight on mislynches, I can't say that is reliable enough to use as a reason to lynch somebody but just strikes me odd.<br>\n<br>\nso after all of that if he honestly felt boon was town (which he certainly didn't from my pov ) than yes he should have stuck on klingon and pushed harder, or at the very least pushed harder for bagel since he was the counter wagon</a></div></blockquote><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7085974#p7085974\" class=\"postlink\"><br>\n</a><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7093071#p7093071\" class=\"postlink\">HUUUT!</a>", "time": "Tue Jul 28, 2015 8:37 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62339&start=2075", "forum": "53", "thread": "62339"}

'I'm not coming back here. You're against our kind. Now I know it for sure. Thanks and goodbye! See you in a different Space/Time. Without prejudices.' He disappeared in the next second.<br>\n<br>\n'Wait!' That was BlueMoonRising. 'I don't think I should be here at all. I, actually... found something interesting and... let me think... oh never mind. 01. 07. 1995' he mumbled the last numbers quietly. Very, very quietly.<br>\n<br>\n'Okay, that's it!' Loranthaceae appeared to be very nervous. 'I want to quit! I want to get back to my own time! NOW! This whole organization is more like a dis-organization!
