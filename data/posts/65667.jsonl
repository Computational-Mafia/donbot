Do not use my color, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000A0\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Earth Blue (#0000A0)</div></div><br>\n2. If you believe a mod error has been made or you disagree with any action I took, please PM me immediately.<br>\n3. Please bold all questions or requests to the Mod.<br>\n4. After your death, you may post one contentless &#8220;Bah&#8221; post.<br>\n5. You may not quote private communication of any kind, including (real or fabricated) Moderator-supplied information. Paraphrasing is acceptable.<br>\n6. Do not talk about this game anywhere else unless I have specified it is permitted such as in a private topic. This includes PM-ing other players.<br>\n7. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Do not discuss the ongoing games.</div><br>\n8. Do not play against the spirit of the rules or of the game. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.<br>\n9. No invisible/small/encrypted text allowed. <br>\n10. This ruleset is subject to change at any time. If a change is made mid-game, it will be announced in-thread by the mod.<br>\n11. Any Violation to the General rules or Site rules may result in force replacing or Mod Killing you. Please be careful about what your doing.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000A0\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting and Deadline Rules:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. Votes should be made using bolded text (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Frozen Angel</div>) in an obvious manner or a vote tag (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Frozen Angel</span>). You can also vote for no lynch. Unvotes when changing votes are not necessary. Votes made inside quoted or spoilered text will not be counted. <br>\n2. A lynch (or no lynch) occurs when a simple majority is reached. If deadline is reached without a simple majority, a no lynch occurs.<br>\n3. All days have a deadline of 14 days. I may extend this in rare circumstances.<br>\n4. When a player is lynched, the game enters twilight. All players may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n5. Each night will end after 48 hours and no sooner. The countdown for a night deadline will not start while a replacement is being sought out.<br>\n6. All night actions must be submitted by PM or a relevant private topic. If I have not heard from you, I will presume you are not taking an action.<br>\n7. In the case of five consecutive phases with no deaths, all factions who have not yet achieved their win condition lose.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000A0\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. A prod PM will be issued if any player does not post for 48 hours. Prods will be announced in-thread. You have 24 hours to pick up your prod either by posting or PM (if at night). After this time, I may begin seeking a replacement.<br>\n2. If you show up before announcing the replacement in thread you may continue the game.<br>\n3. I may seek replacement immediately without waiting 24 hours if a player receives three or more than three prods.<br>\n4. If you plan to be gone for over 48 hours, please announce that you will be V/LA in-thread (or by PM, if at night).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000A0\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Game Setup:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n1.

You have played Mafia before this game. you have helped lynched somebody only to be wrong and probably let scum live to the end and lose. Without even going through your games I'm pretty sure almost every experienced player has had this happen to them. Mislynches happen because townies do things that get misinterpreted as scummy behavior. Scum win because scum have manipulated townies into thinking they are town. As much as it sucks yes it's basically a crap shoot most of the time. <br>\n<br>\nMy point is though, you say you think his stubbornness isn't faked and when asked how you can tell the difference you balk at the opportunity to explain how you can tell the difference.

She is well known as a professional classical lied singer but best known as the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity.

This album, Mark Jansen continues with the collection of songs that make up \"The Embrace That Smothers\". The first three parts can be found on Prison of Desire (2000), After Forever's debut album, and the following three parts can be found on The Divine Conspiracy (2007), Epica's third album.

He is definitely a threat to Scum, and he knows this. But his logic is then that, given D1 interactions, I expected he would death-tunnel you and thus I left him alive. As if that would overwrite any potential threat he would pose to me if I were Scum. It's confirmation bias: I am Scum, thus I am more likely Scum because he is alive, which must mean that I left him alive to death-tunnel you, because I am Scum.

The assertion that \"he can't consider the possibility of [his scumreads] being town\" is counteracted by the fact that he's voted 4 different people today, meaning that he's implicitly townreading (through PoE, at least) a couple of those he's previously voted.<br>\n<br>\nI think he is seeming so stubborn outwardly because he thinks moderating his position will weaken its appeal. It's true (even if it's kinda stupid) that someone who expresses no doubt will usually convince more people of his case than someone who expresses a little bit of reasonable doubt. So he's evidently doubting himself enough to change reads, but doesn't let on to it (and I believe he's admitted this much, but I don't have time to find the post right now).<br>\n<br>\nMy problem is that, unless he exposes his reasoning a bit more, it'll be hard to figure out whether the reasoning comes from town or scum.

You ignoring other people as well just added to that. <br>\n<br>\nNow on to snarky. Snarky wasn't even a top scum read of mine, I attempted to figure him out when I asked why his read on farmer changed. I noticed it changed when your read on farmer seemed to change so it was curious. He denied having a town read on him and when proven that was a lie, he said he had it cause he was sheeping a town read. The only town reads he had day 1 were farmer (the sheep one right?) and kts yet kts didn't have a town read on farmer and those were his only 2 published strong town reads. So that was thus proven to be a lie also. He later said he just threw the list reads to generate content. Now my experience only people who have to fake content are scum. <br>\n<br>\nSo there is 2 examples that prove you are wrong about me. <br>\n<br>\nHave you done anything close to that?

Originally a death metal band, Therion adjusted its musical style by adding orchestral elements, including choirs, classical musicians, and even a full orchestra at their concert performances.

She also writes an advice column in the popular rock magazine Revolver, alongside musician Vinnie Paul. Scabbia is featured in a Megadeth song, \"&#192; Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)\". She also featured on \"The Theory of Everything\", an album from Arjen Anthony Lucassen's Ayreon project, with which she is cast as the Mother. She is also the featured artist in the Apocalyptica song \"S.O.S. (Anything But Love)\" and another version of the Alter Bridge song \"Watch Over You\". Scabbia has said that the biggest compliment that a fan could pay her would be to remark on her vocal abilities. Her highest note ever hit is claimed to be an A7. Scabbia performed a duet with the Italian ex-singer of Linea 77 Emiliano Audisio on the track \"Beautiful Lie\" to be part of the soundtrack for the 2013 Italian film Passione sinistra. Scabbia has been in a relationship with Slipknot guitarist Jim Root since 2004.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Cristina_Scabbia_Cropped.jpg/220px-Cristina_Scabbia_Cropped.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div>", "time": "Sat Mar 26, 2016 6:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65667&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "65667"}

She has a younger sister by the name of Janneke who was born on Simone's second birthday. Her interest in music manifested itself at a very early age. Simons started playing flute for two years after joining music school at the age of 12. At the age of 14, she had one year of pop singing lessons, and at age 15, she switched to classical singing after listening to Nightwish's Oceanborn, which remains her favorite Nightwish album.
