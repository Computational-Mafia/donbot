Do not use my color, <span style=\"color: #0000A0\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Earth Blue (#0000A0)</span></span></span><br>2. If you believe a mod error has been made or you disagree with any action I took, please PM me immediately.<br>3. Please bold all questions or requests to the Mod.<br>4. After your death, you may post one contentless \u201cBah\u201d post.<br>5. You may not quote private communication of any kind, including (real or fabricated) Moderator-supplied information. Paraphrasing is acceptable.<br>6. Do not talk about this game anywhere else unless I have specified it is permitted such as in a private topic. This includes PM-ing other players.<br>7. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Do not discuss the ongoing games.</span><br>8. Do not play against the spirit of the rules or of the game. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.<br>9. No invisible/small/encrypted text allowed. <br>10. This ruleset is subject to change at any time. If a change is made mid-game, it will be announced in-thread by the mod.<br>11. Any Violation to the General rules or Site rules may result in force replacing or Mod Killing you. Please be careful about what your doing.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000A0\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting and Deadline Rules:</span></span></span><br><br>1. Votes should be made using bolded text (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Frozen Angel</span>) in an obvious manner or a vote tag (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Frozen Angel</span>). You can also vote for no lynch. Unvotes when changing votes are not necessary. Votes made inside quoted or spoilered text will not be counted. <br>2. A lynch (or no lynch) occurs when a simple majority is reached. If deadline is reached without a simple majority, a no lynch occurs.<br>3. All days have a deadline of 14 days. I may extend this in rare circumstances.<br>4. When a player is lynched, the game enters twilight. All players may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>5. Each night will end after 48 hours and no sooner. The countdown for a night deadline will not start while a replacement is being sought out.<br>6. All night actions must be submitted by PM or a relevant private topic. If I have not heard from you, I will presume you are not taking an action.<br>7. In the case of five consecutive phases with no deaths, all factions who have not yet achieved their win condition lose.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000A0\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules:</span></span></span><br><br>1. A prod PM will be issued if any player does not post for 48 hours. Prods will be announced in-thread. You have 24 hours to pick up your prod either by posting or PM (if at night). After this time, I may begin seeking a replacement.<br>2. If you show up before announcing the replacement in thread you may continue the game.<br>3. I may seek replacement immediately without waiting 24 hours if a player receives three or more than three prods.<br>4. If you plan to be gone for over 48 hours, please announce that you will be V/LA in-thread (or by PM, if at night).<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000A0\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Game Setup:</span></span></span><br><br>1.

At first, I was going to say that this was a weird question for you to ask because obviously my vote so early in the game was unsupported by any tremendously persuasive reasoning (else I would have shared it). In light of the more recent activity from Wisdom, I was considering that this was an attempt to make my vote look bad retroactively.

You have played Mafia before this game. you have helped lynched somebody only to be wrong and probably let scum live to the end and lose. Without even going through your games I'm pretty sure almost every experienced player has had this happen to them. Mislynches happen because townies do things that get misinterpreted as scummy behavior. Scum win because scum have manipulated townies into thinking they are town.

That's a huge red flag Imo because townoes shouldn't be afraid to communicate their thoughts, especially when asked directly for them. It seems you are afraid to answer for some reason."}

At first, I was going to say that this was a weird question for you to ask because obviously my vote so early in the game was unsupported by any tremendously persuasive reasoning (else I would have shared it). In light of the more recent activity from Wisdom, I was considering that this was an attempt to make my vote look bad retroactively. I then noticed that Wisdom had actually only one more post between my vote and the question (a vote for nnn_thekushmountains in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7728050#p7728050\">44</a>).

Every townie has (in theory anyway ) the obligation to not only identify scum but get them lynched and you can't do that without help so you should try to be convincing. Make your arguments convincing. He's not doing that but neither are a lot of people. Second. No not everyone who isn't doing that is scum.

He is definitely a threat to Scum, and he knows this. But his logic is then that, given D1 interactions, I expected he would death-tunnel you and thus I left him alive. As if that would overwrite any potential threat he would pose to me if I were Scum. It's confirmation bias: I am Scum, thus I am more likely Scum because he is alive, which must mean that I left him alive to death-tunnel you, because I am Scum. Vicious circle.<br><br>Not to mention by the same WiFoM logic I could say that Scum left him alive to think that I left him alive to death-tunnel you... ad infinitum. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7749681#p7749681\" class=\"postlink\">post 572</a>, Wisdom wrote:</cite>I've said why Maestro is scum, Jeanne.

I accept I'm going to be lynched. I expect Wisdom to reevaluate the game and continue to scumhunt, and I want him to be expecting and preparing to do so. Relatedly, I expect nobody to give him a free pass for his bullshit yesterday (with Jake) and today (with me) and hold him to his own scumthunting standards. Don't allow him to shut down and don't allow him to pretend the gamestate is static and don't allow him to continue to scumhunt, because Jake is still wrong: Wisdom is still going to be one of our strongest assets if he's Town and the possibility that he's not Town cannot be ignored, especially if he shuts down after I flip Town or selectively remembers this exchange later in the game."}

The assertion that \"he can't consider the possibility of [his scumreads] being town\" is counteracted by the fact that he's voted 4 different people today, meaning that he's implicitly townreading (through PoE, at least) a couple of those he's previously voted.<br><br>I think he is seeming so stubborn outwardly because he thinks moderating his position will weaken its appeal. It's true (even if it's kinda stupid) that someone who expresses no doubt will usually convince more people of his case than someone who expresses a little bit of reasonable doubt. So he's evidently doubting himself enough to change reads, but doesn't let on to it (and I believe he's admitted this much, but I don't have time to find the post right now).<br><br>My problem is that, unless he exposes his reasoning a bit more, it'll be hard to figure out whether the reasoning comes from town or scum. We've tried piecing together his case from what he's posted, but the responses have been something to the effect of \"No, that's not why I'm scumreading him\"."}

It isn't \"simply untrue\" it's actually fact but of course you are going to disagree. I didn't actually expect you to admit your mistakes. <br><br>Your assertion of me is also incorrect. Ive tried to figure out people. The most obvious come to mind when I asked you multiple questions early in the game. Your refusal to answer my questions led me to think you aren't town. You ignoring other people as well just added to that. <br><br>Now on to snarky. Snarky wasn't even a top scum read of mine, I attempted to figure him out when I asked why his read on farmer changed. I noticed it changed when your read on farmer seemed to change so it was curious. He denied having a town read on him and when proven that was a lie, he said he had it cause he was sheeping a town read. The only town reads he had day 1 were farmer (the sheep one right?) and kts yet kts didn't have a town read on farmer and those were his only 2 published strong town reads. So that was thus proven to be a lie also. He later said he just threw the list reads to generate content. Now my experience only people who have to fake content are scum. <br><br>So there is 2 examples that prove you are wrong about me. <br><br>Have you done anything close to that? Absolutely not. So don't sit there and falsely accuse me of shit... Oh wait you are scum so you have to falsely accuse me of shit. <br><br>Bye Felicia."}

Originally a death metal band, Therion adjusted its musical style by adding orchestral elements, including choirs, classical musicians, and even a full orchestra at their concert performances.

She also writes an advice column in the popular rock magazine Revolver, alongside musician Vinnie Paul. Scabbia is featured in a Megadeth song, \"\u00c0 Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)\". She also featured on \"The Theory of Everything\", an album from Arjen Anthony Lucassen's Ayreon project, with which she is cast as the Mother. She is also the featured artist in the Apocalyptica song \"S.O.S. (Anything But Love)\" and another version of the Alter Bridge song \"Watch Over You\". Scabbia has said that the biggest compliment that a fan could pay her would be to remark on her vocal abilities. Her highest note ever hit is claimed to be an A7. Scabbia performed a duet with the Italian ex-singer of Linea 77 Emiliano Audisio on the track \"Beautiful Lie\" to be part of the soundtrack for the 2013 Italian film Passione sinistra. Scabbia has been in a relationship with Slipknot guitarist Jim Root since 2004.</span></span><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Cristina_Scabbia_Cropped.jpg/220px-Cristina_Scabbia_Cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></div>"}

If he is town, he should talk to me differently. Plus, nobody is that certain someone is scum unless they're their buddy. Your whole 'lynch me if he flips town' kinda alludes that <span class=\"noboldsig\">you know he won't</span> and thus will be able to save yourself.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br>So I'll lynch you first and him later."}

Her interest in music manifested itself at a very early age. Simons started playing flute for two years after joining music school at the age of 12. At the age of 14, she had one year of pop singing lessons, and at age 15, she switched to classical singing after listening to Nightwish's Oceanborn, which remains her favorite Nightwish album.

I thought I was trying to draw a kill actually. Pushing hard on scum is how to make yourself look like a threat. Turns out I was just wrong. At least I was active and searching for scum. You were lurking and did hardly no scum hunting at all. Even your scum buddy was calling out your inactivity. Plus there was a cheeky exchange between you and he that imo only comes from scum<br>Buddies. <br><br>You are scum bro. It's as obvious as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. So yes if any townie votes me they deserve to be called stupid. I did more to progress the game than anyone else alive right now. <br><br>I really don't care anymore what happens at this point. Wisdom single handily ruined this game for me by playing so bad on purpose to the point of playing against his win condition just because he had an ace up his sleeve.

Shiro played it right by saying he wanted to wait to claim, because in almost every mass claim I've seen where there is an unclaimed pr, they want to go last. Shiro coming back a couple minutes later claiming looks like he was coached. He wanted to get the claim out there first for cred so he could discredit the actual person. <br><br>Fire bringing up role cop confirms that scum probably has one which is very possible. <br><br>Third thing, typically during mass claim when you popcorn, you popcorn to the person you are most suspicious of or who town is most suspicious of. Fire was town reading shiro so asking him to claim before me or Kush (who fire wanted to lynch) makes no sense. Fire should have popcorned to one of us, not shiro. <br><br>I'm fairly confident that those 2 are scum. Expe isn't scum to me anymore cause the game would be over right now if he was. Shiro/Kush is also a possibility but given the interactions between fire/shiro it's so obvious they are together. It's the same sort of cheeky interaction dier and shiro had earlier in the game."}

Despite this I still somehow enjoyed it.<br><br>My $0.02 on what went wrong:<br><br>I see now that I should've claimed at some point before Expedience's replace-in. I maintain that, based on the situation at the last point I'd read the thread before I was lynched, I was right to have believed Snarky would probably have been the lynch instead of myself. But I got greedy in wanting to make sure my role stayed hidden, and I didn't take into account the precariousness of the situation given how restless the town was for a lynch.<br><br>The main problem with the town as a whole was how it revolved around the dealings of Jake, Wisdom, and Jeanne. This was particularly true in the first two days, when the game developed an atmosphere in which the only ones under any meaningful degree of scrutiny were Jake, Wisdom, and whoever those two were wanting to lynch at a given time. The fault for this lies largely in the rest of the town, which just consented to this bipolar order out of laziness, lurking, or convenience. It almost evokes the Cold War in how one's obligation was just to pick a side and let the two leaders do the heavy lifting. The problem, of course, is that it made it easy for scum to hide.<br><br>As to the culpability of Jake, Wisdom, and Jeanne, you could say that their circular arguments made the thread hard to read. There are entire stretches of pages that, with the exception of a few posts, are just one of those three going back and forth with one another, making what were essentially the same points as they had before, albeit dressed up in a different way. This can potentially make going through the thread a slog. You already know what they're going to say, but you feel you have to read anyway lest you miss some crucial piece of evidence.<br><br>So what I've learned, and what I hope others have learned, is to take responsibility for your own reads, take responsibility for your own vote, and don't be complicit in allowing scum to hide while everyone's watching the thread's two biggest personalities go at it.<br><br>But, most importantly, the music was nice. You were a great mod, FA! And I don't recall seeing this particular one in the vote counts, so:<br><br>Nightwish: Sacrament of Wilderness<br><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/89gTXM160Dc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}
