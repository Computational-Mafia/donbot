Both Woody and ika have made strong posts against Monkey, and this one is a \"pile-on\". But at the same time, it also distracts from putting full pressure on Monkey, by also asking a question to ika - which also feels like it's somewhat defensive of Monkey. Sweevie made a post that is trying to get ika to get into the mindset of Monkey (which could be distracting from the original premise). oddmusic makes a similar post, but Sweevie's has a different intent. If there's more I see from Sweevie, then I may FoS for fake waggoning Monkey - especially due to no vote.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6913437#p6913437\" class=\"postlink\">#93</a><br>droog posts a potential town list based on reactions to Monkey. but it's also a potential scum list. It's interesting because ika sees it more as a town list. droog's language is a bit tough to follow, which may explain some of the miscommunication here.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6913771#p6913771\" class=\"postlink\">#100</a><br>OGML enters the game (hi OGML!) and focuses on the droog-woody connection. But then he also just jumps right on the monkey wagon. Interesting. Also I like the lead on droog - seemed like droog entered a conversation that perhaps droog was not yet ready to go down? Unlike Sweevie who also mentions Monkey, OGML took action and put Monkey closer to lynch (although Monkey was acting like every single vote was a death sentence back then - I wonder if this means that Monkey also thought scum was bussing him?). At this moment, suspecting both Sweevie and droog.<br><br>Elmo enters in #103 with a vote on Monkey - no reasons. Fine with me.<br><br>In #105 - droog votes OGML to possibly distract from the Monkey wagon. Not sure if it is more to push onto OGML more than just trying to find a reason to excuse self from not pushing onto Monkey. Okay, I see suspicion on droog as valid.<br><br>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6914490#p6914490\" class=\"postlink\">#106</a> - oddmusic then votes OGML. *facepalm* Except we know that Monkey is scum. It wasn't an easy mislynch. Which, oddmusic was suspecting monkey then ogml - seems like oddmusic just got easily distracted. Interesting droog-oddmusic connection now. Also interesting that oddmusic points out the monkey-droog connection but fails to connect to anyone else in that post. So many other options...especially if in the same post oddmusic votes OGML for going for the \"easy lynch\" of monkey - but then hypothesizes about monkey-droog being town vs. town? I am seeing oddmusic as a bit easily distracted.<br><br>Mom then enters the fray and makes lots of posts. Looks towny enough for me. Don't really want to focus my time on reading those posts though. Wait, but then in the end votes Woody? Woody is currently a town read for me (retrospectively knowing that monkey was scum). Okay, back to null read. Oracle challenges Mom on that vote. I don't sense that there was any bussing in that interaction. Mom-Oracle as scum pair is low for me. I still think Mom's justifications for the vote are sound. I like Mom a lot.<br><br>droog's comment on Mom in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6915131#p6915131\" class=\"postlink\">#129</a> seems scummier though. No real substance, just seems to want to comment on OGML (whom I'm town reading).<br><br>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6915181#p6915181\" class=\"postlink\">#143</a> ika mentions Mom distracting from Monkeywagon by placing onto OGML (but it really was woody). I don't buy it though.<br><br>Holy, there's another player that hadn't checked in yet? Hi Hydro Penguin! And then Hydro votes Monkey despite being wowed by Mom about Woody. So Hydro has connections to Mom and Woody in the initial post. Hydro's entry could be bussing or could not be. The momentum was already against Monkey before Hydro came in.<br><br>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6916237#p6916237\" class=\"postlink\">#178</a> Sweevie yet again piles on someone else. This time Hydro. droog also mentions that Glork's vote on Hydro is good. However, droog does not vote. Top 2 scum for me are droog and Sweevie. I wouldn't be surprised if Hydro was bussing. Going to guess no right now. I think the bussing was earlier than that, if there were any.<br><br>Seeing how strong Monkey tried to defend himself, makes me believe that no one on his team was helping him and it could have been a way to signal that the best option was to leave him alone and not defend him. I'm not going to be putting too much weight into the later votes on Monkey then.<br><br>That wagon on OGML came out of nowhere. That's cool. That's pretty quick. Hydro again is another pile-on person. So was droog. So if OGML flips town, then Hydro and droog are pretty clear scum. Doubt that both are scum though together. Three scum voting in quick succession from Oracle, to Monkey, to droog, to Hydro, yeah there's probably one scum there too, but likely not all three.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6922219#p6922219\" class=\"postlink\">#290</a> proves that Woody is the one that did the most (aside from ika of course) to bring the wagons toward Monkey rather than others. So I want to note that Elmo hadn't checked in at that time, but still parked on Monkey. Furthermore Mom hadn't checked in and her vote was parked on Woody. (yet when Mom actually comes back, she sticks on Woody and even encourages others to go there.)<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6923052#p6923052\" class=\"postlink\">#302</a> from Sweevie furthers my suspicion on Sweevie. Asking a question to the populace while not being very aggressive is a great way to look like you're contributing without doing much. Furthermore, it was a wagon that Monkey was on.<br><br>I'm getting tired of wading through most of these posts. Monkey is just annoying me while reading him. There's so much noise being created there that is making it easy for scum to hide. Wouldn't be surprised if Monkey started wagons late in D1 to hide his scum partners. Furthermore, this post by Mom kinda smells like a scum partner cautioning a targetted scum. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6926663#p6926663\" class=\"postlink\">#381</a> I'd say that Mom is a strong partner with Monkey except a) that was late in the game, and I don't think Mom would've been so obvious that late in the day. b) Monkey was way out there, and I don't think scum would've even touched Monkey with a fifteen foot pole if possible. So I'm not so convinced.<br><br>Oracle in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6927587#p6927587\" class=\"postlink\">#427</a> puts momentum toward Hydro rather than Monkey by unvoting OGML and voting Hydro.<br><br>My reads coming into the game so far -<br><br>ika - town. confirmed gunsmith.<br>Mom - town. I feel that Mom is coming from a genuine place, and that's why I think Mom is town. Content and wagon analysis may say otherwise, but I still think Mom is town.<br>OGML - town. The counterwagon was way too fast.<br>Elmo - likely town. Anger was real, and has made fine posts so far.<br>Sweevie - scumscumscum. Doesn't participate much and piles on others with little independent thought while trying to present as helpful.<br>droog - likely scum, but I can also sense that droog may just be outspoken town that is hard to read.<br>Hydro Penguin - likely scum as well. <br>Oracle - pretty safe town. Only one weird thing with voting Hydro instead of Monkey, but for the most part good.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sweevie</span>"}

This means that I see those two posts (93-94) as a misinterpretation. Furthermore, I see that right now in that you felt that I wanted you to answer my commentary. You said something about how you see 3 people (woody, oracle, oddmusic/pablito) as town, but it could also be scum. ika saw the list only as your pro-town list - which it was not. Between the two posts, there was miscommunication, when I saw your #93 as nothing about a pro-town list. I'm glad to see that you do feel that Oracle and I are town though. My comment was only made to focus on your language and why it's confusing - but still valuable. But at the same time, I'm kinda questioning why you think I'm town at this moment, when I only just replaced in. Granted, oddmusic may have given you a lot of that read, but dunno.<br><br>Regarding #129 I am comparing you to Oracle.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6915131#p6915131\" class=\"postlink\">post 129</a>, droog wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6915019#p6915019\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a>, Mom wrote:</cite>OGML's entrance is good.</div></blockquote><br><br>really? why</div></blockquote><br><br>I feel that your #129 is scummier than Oracle's reply to Mom's entry in this post. Wait, Oracle never even mentioned Mom's view on OGML? Either way, it was a comparison commentary. Yeah I don't care about that anymore.<br><br>Okay, I see your reason on #105. I still think Sweevie is the most suspicious right now. droog, I sometimes read some of your posts as hyperactive and hyperresponsive, and that's why I feel like I'm giving you a pass on some things. I feel that your intent is there, even if the content isn't necessarily backing up the options.<br><br>However, in all the posts I saw in sweevie, I just see blatant piling on. I also get that same sense from Hydro Penguin, but I think Sweevie's is more blatant and lazy, which I feel is more indicative of scum.<br><br>@droog - why I comment on oddmusic as well? I feel that it's my duty as a replacement to comment on my predecessor. Yes, we are the same person, but you are not going to be able to ever ask oddmusic again about the intent and interpretation about some of oddmusic's previous posts. As such, I am commenting on them myself. I also feel that my choice of not commenting is also communicating something. If I tell you that I am choosing to not comment on some posts that I see as <span style=\"font-style: italic\">interesting</span> from oddmusic, then it means I could be avoiding something. I want to acknowledge that I am not choosing that pathway. Take it as you want.<br><br>As for my view on Monkey's wagons overall. I think that at some moments in time, perhaps Monkey was trying to signal to fellow mafia that he did not want them to help him. That doesn't mean that fellow mafia would or wouldn't though. I think both arguments and interpretations of Monkey's and yours/Mom's actions are independent and are not necessarily contradictory. I am hypothesizing that no one was helping Monkey based on what Monkey said. At the same time, I am not excluding the possibility that maybe Monkey's fellow mafia did try or did want to and there are actions that may state such. I also mention at the end of my comment when I talk about Mom, that I do not think that her comment was indicative of her trying to \"help Monkey\"."}

I hope that your posts aren't as sparse as they seemed to be during D1.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6939613#p6939613\" class=\"postlink\">post 485</a>, Sweevie wrote:</cite>Neat application of positive vs negative connotations: here pablito describes Oracle by using \"putting momentum on\" instead of \"piling on\". His post colors my contributions with a scummy vibe while conveniently not actually having to quote me.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, it comes down to timing. Your vote of hydro specifically, Sweevie, was coincidentally within several posts of a vote. Oracle here (on my brief lookback), had no specific context in the earlier posts to come in at that moment. I don't appreciate you painting me that way. When \"putting momentum\" is talking about swinging the pendulum toward something that has been fairly silent at the moment. \"piling on\" is something like \"post #176: Glork votes Hydro\"...\"post #178: Sweevie votes Hydro\". You are quite testy and defensive here. I think you deserve pressure. Hence the vote. But I think your defense of this specific post is invalid and you're putting it back on me when you seem to be unsure of what I mean with \"piling on\". If you're not sure what I mean, just ask me what I mean. It seems that miscommunication is coming in here, but you're attributing it to me rather than the space in between us. That isn't settling me.<br><br>In my opinion, piling on creates a situation that must be addressed. A single vote here and second vote there creates a different situation. I'm not saying that \"piling on\" is inherently scummy. In fact, it may be a town read. However, because of your absences and lurking, I feel it's scummy. I will say however, that in my original read, I only looked at post numbers and not dates. Looking back, I see that many posts came within minutes. So, there's a likelihood that my sense of momentum could be completely off. I didn't realize how fast this game had gone.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":eek:\" title=\"Eek\">  So I'll have to re-read to see how much time went on where I've felt you've been absent.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6939613#p6939613\" class=\"postlink\">post 485</a>, Sweevie wrote:</cite>I don't mind him being wordy, by the way, but I would prefer him to be more concise and less implicatory.

The reason for this is that almost all posts that rubbed me the wrong way on D1 don't seem incriminating in light of the N1 results (it'd be good if someone else took a look, too, though).

Evidently droog entirely missed the part where Monkey had previously claimed.  This is actually only further evidence they are scum buddies.  droog doesn't have to pay any actual attention to the content of monkey's posts because he doesn't really care, he knows monkey's alignment and he's never ever called him anything but neutral the whole game.<br><br>So let's move on to day two, shall we?

No, I don't, nothing with Elmo, all with Titus. I'll elaborate. The actual only impression that Elmo left on me was her being ticked off in one of her only posts. I was sympathetic to that pronoun stuff but that's completely non-indicative of her alignment. Her annoyance outside of that was a bit thickly put on for my tastes but that's all I had on her.<br>So the main difference is in the attitude between their hammers, self-righteousness on the one hand, ignorance on the other. That's where my difference in reaction comes from. She said she did it by mistake, she missed ika's check on Mom. (Speaking of ignorance... are there non-gun carrying roles that are of a different faction other than town?) I look forward to what she will contribute other than noise.<br>And that no one really seems to care about time so much this game.<br><br>...2.) My perspective is that as long as you can ensure you have someone to hammer before the day is over the heightened tension of the deadline can be useful. I felt we had that ready.<br>Then again, I'm not the cynical grizzled ol' mafia veteran. And you are right, it's not as wasteful of time as the D1 quick-hammer, so that also tempered my reaction."}

Mom spends a lot of time defending her vague +1 of my initial post, but comes back to defending monkey again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6924149#p6924149\">331</a> and gets onboard the Hydro wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6925649#p6925649\">348</a> (which we now know to be another counterwagon on town).  Straight up coaching in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6926648#p6926648\">375</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6926663#p6926663\">381</a>, and monkey's wellbeing remains the focus of her posting to the detriment of chiming in on much else at all.  More and more posts about monkey, requesting better cases against monkey, a picture of a refrigerator here in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6926718#p6926718\">396</a> all of which is still accomplishing an implicit monkey defense.  On day two she joins the hydro wagon before echoing droog's scummy \"the case on the dead scum was bad\" point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6941935#p6941935\">499</a>.

The only other thing mom actually has to say on day two is how I'm vaguely scummy because of data she can't quite pin down, and now that we've hit day three she's voting me without even so much as bringing up her own reasons to suspect me, just sheeping droog.<br><br>Oracle - has been far under my radar thus far.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6914769#p6914769\">109</a> stands out for trying to neg ika and make a droog/monkey pair seem implausible.  Oracle is also the initiator of the day one flashwagon on myself (the first big anti monkey counterwagon) with his spurious appeal to page number reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6920623#p6920623\">259</a> which I took him to task for at the time.  He eventually moves to the Hydro wagon, before finally laying down the L-1 vote on monkey in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6927966#p6927966\">441</a>, but only after ika's claim.

I don't think I've ever said that. I do think droog acts scummy. I don't think I've said much differently.

But I do admit that droog is not in my top 2 scum at the moment. I just am distracted by wagons that smell better to me. There's a tendency for me that obv-scum wagons are my blind spot.

But now at D3 we also find ourselves in a (bad term to use but you know what I mean) \"refined\" state of the game.<br>And in regards to @Titus: the I-made-an-honest-mistake-excuse is not a great defense but it's also a dead end for pressure. That's why I said I want to hear her thoughts on another subject first.

But he seems to facilitate the conversation rather than contribute to it. I agree that this feels weird. <br><br>-<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6912429#p6912429\" class=\"postlink\">Post 25</a>, several people called this post from odd music strange and/or scummy (including his replacement). I agree that the post is useless, but I actually thought it sounded kind of townish. People are talking about the night kill right now and, rather than join the discussion and blend in, odd music is the first to actually speculate as to a player\u2019s alignment (in this case, droog). <br><br>-droog defended Monkey, coached Monkey, even followed Monkey in at least one of his votes. I would have found this townish for droog\u2026 if he didn\u2019t have that other game (where he does the same thing as town) ready to pull out of his back pocket. Seems convenient. <span class=\"noboldsig\">droog</span>, when you are scum, how do you usually treat your partners? <br><br>-OGML has this theory that Monkey/Droog are scum and killed Kaboose with the intention of setting someone up\u2026 not realizing that this would effectively backfire on Monkey. This seems like a stretch to me. It\u2019s possible that Monkey/Droog are scum, I just doubt that they would try to set someone up without first making sure that the kill doesn\u2019t implicate themselves. <br><br>-OGML calls the scum team Monkey/Droog/Hydro at one point. I\u2019m having trouble accepting this as a genuine guess. Something about it just feels\u2026 easy.<br><br>-<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6925265#p6925265\" class=\"postlink\">Post 344</a>, this is an interesting post from Sweevie regarding Monkey. Here he provides additional support for the bandwagon yet continues to not be on it. This could be scum trying to distance from Monkey without actually contributing to the lynch. <br><br>-OGML had just complained about the boring repetitiveness of Monkey, droog, and Woody\u2019s arguments. droog tells OGML to pick a new topic of conversation and he responds with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6926221#p6926221\" class=\"postlink\">post 356</a> where he asks droog a few good questions. What I am wondering is: why did OGML need this encouragement from droog to scum hunt? <br><br>-My first impression from reading the short exchange between Monkey and Elmo in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6926533#p6926533\" class=\"postlink\">posts 362 and 363</a> was that it felt like scum v. scum. In 362, Monkey misreps Elmo just to try and make a point. I\u2019m not sure if he would do this to a townie. In 363, Elmo claims that he\u2019s done interacting with Monkey. It feels disingenuous because this is only her second post interacting with Monkey - and he completely ignores it. Elmo is either; a.) unusually impatient town, b.) scum trying to be rude and distance from Monkey, or c.) scum that wants to quickly end the conversation with Monkey to avoid giving anything away.  <br><br>-<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6926565#p6926565\" class=\"postlink\">Post 364</a>, slip that Hydro and OGML are town? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6913269#p6913269\" class=\"postlink\">post 85</a>, Sweevie wrote:</cite>I don't like the vehemence in monkey's defensiveness.

Firstly, this statement is meaningless because almost everyone was a part of those two wagons. Secondly, this feels fake because droog proceeds to NOT act on this at all. <br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">pablito</span>, I thought it was weird that you thanked me for not hammering the person you were voting. But now that I\u2019ve read, I completely understand. And for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not the kind of player to quick hammer. <br><br><br>Initial thoughts;<br>-pablito is probably not mafia. He is moving his vote around a lot and in a seemingly genuine manner, like he is really thinking about his reads. The only issue that I have is that this frequent vote switching could be an SK-tell - e.g. he doesn\u2019t want to tunnel on scum because then he\u2019s a night kill target. I am still developing my other reads right now. <br><br>-OGML suggested mass claim and I think everyone ignored him. But in my opinion, mass claim is a good idea at this stage. We\u2019ve already lost three town power roles, so it\u2019s very likely that a vigilante is our only power role left (if it\u2019s a vigilante). But a vigilante is no longer of any use to us right now because they have no business killing any more, anyway. So we don\u2019t really have anything to lose. Mass claim is good because it can give us a greater picture of the setup. a.) There are signs for a vigilante and signs for an SK - I think we should know which it is. b.) If we find out how strong our town is, we can figure out how strong the scum are. c.) I think today is the best day to mass claim. I don\u2019t want to deal with a counterclaim tomorrow, but would LOVE to see one today. I literally just lost a game as town where I think mass claiming the day before LyLo could have made a big difference. <br><br>-Mom could be scum, but I am inclined to say that lynching her today is a bad idea. The gunsmith result makes it less likely she is scum. Also, if we lynched someone else and they flipped Mafia Doctor, then Mom is almost certainly confirmed town. On the other hand, if we tried lynching someone else and they flipped Mafia Goon, then the gunsmith result can almost be ignored - she\u2019s almost on an equal playing field with us. Either way, lynching Mom before a mass claim would be a huge mistake."}

You weirdly are usually the second vote on the wagons. I agree that your voting is probably like a North Korea exhibition game coached by Rodman, but not like current Rodman, more like bridal veil Rodman. And when nothing's happening you don't post. Strategic lurking. It's good that you're defending yourself, but at the same time - way too convenient. Especially if we consider that D1 you lurked. D2 you parked a vote on Hydro, then when it was building you stayed there, when little was happening you stayed there, and during the entire time that you mention that Hydro was at L-1, you still didn't unvote. Then toward the end of the day, you're also conspicuously absent. Then in D3 you lament the whole hammering situation without acknowledging that you were part of the issue as well. Then you have failed to well pressure Titus about the hammer and you are treating Titus with very different hands than you did OGML in D2. You unvoted droog...only to vote Mom in the end, while at the same time you want more from Titus. These are the posting patterns that are pretty convenient. When a wagon is continuing, you stay there without even contemplating whether to get yourself off of it. The only time, that's been different is when you unvoted droog...but then oddly followed my lead to Mom. You have such pointed jabbing and then you hide behind a rock a lot of times when the time is convenient. This reeks scummy to me. <br><br>So question @Sweevie - what <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do/did</span> you think of my vote on Mom? You commented on my unvote, but I want to hear your opinion on my vote on Mom in the first place.<br><br>Regarding massclaim - I've been good with a massclaim ever since OGML suggested it. Nothing wicked said convinced me otherwise.
