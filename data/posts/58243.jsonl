The group of friends had known each other since preschool, inseparable they were. Of course they had their little squabbles here and there but in the end they were all the thickest of thieves! The trip was meant to end out their last summer before they all went to college, breaking them apart for the first time ever.<br><br>Spirits were high as the 14 teens dragged their half asleep asses out of the cars, a couple of them darting straight for the front door to the cabin. A few staying back at the cars unpacking their belongings, and the rest slowly making their way to two-story log cabin they had all rented together. This weekend was looking to be crazy, a truly epic way to end the summer, but little did they know this wasn\u2019t just the end of summer for some of them\u2026<br><br>As the night went on, the teens partied and drank and had the greatest times of their lives, one by one they wandered off to bed, sometimes in pairs, sometimes more than pairs. Eventually the party died out and the cabin returned to the quiet little house in the middle of the woods.<br><br>As the teens awoke, they stumbled around trying to overcome the horrible hangover that cursed each and every one of them. Once they all got their minds in the right place, so began the amazing breakfast feast! The smell of bacon, eggs and maple syrup filled the air, drawing everyone to the living area of the cabin. Only after they all began to chow down did they realize they were one member short. Quickly tidying up, the group split into sections to look for their missing friend, but none had to go very far, for they found their poor friend in the outhouse. Bloodied and pale, he had been gruesomely killed sometime in the night. No one had any idea who could have done it, but they did know one thing, it was at least one of them!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Player List:</span><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>Cheery Dog (Replaced Boonskiies)</li><li>Aneninen</li><li>Misaka Network (Hydra of FakeGod and Gaiden)</li><li>sthar8 (replaced BroodKingEXE)</li><li>chaoslord54</li><li>evilpacman18</li><li>Riddleton (Replaced Antihero) <span style=\"font-size: 4%;

While I don't like his play at all, the meta read and his relative inexperience is leaving me hesitant to label him as scum.

Thus I agree with Konowa's 108 in that Boonskiies may have committed a \"why me fry me\" in 64. reinoe's insistence that there is a scum on this wagon feels very forensic science to me, like he's getting out his microscope to examine the \"crime scene\" of the Boonskiies wagon when it's unlikely such a crime has happened.<br><br>Post 194: what? wait, did reinoe just 180 on his whole \"conf town\" for Konowa's miller claim?

So, every townie claims their real role. Therefore the scums may have every data they need about the setup and the identities of the townies' roles while the townies can only have a rough estimation about the setup. Even worse, the scums can falseclaim many kind of roles that are hard to be confirmed (eg. Backup-X, Even-Night Jailkeeper) so as to confuse our setup reads. We may end up lynching our own power roles due to mistrust or serve them on a silver tray to get them nightkilled.

It seems like you are trying to wiggle out of something if you aren't doing it now.<br><br>Post 226: I don't like how reinoe refers to Konowa as a \"negative utility town slot\" due to his miller claim. First off, it's silly to say such a pessimistic thing; if Konowa is a miller as I believe him to be, then I think he did the right thing by claiming immediately in an attempt to settle the miller matter as cleanly as possible, and be able to participate in scumhunting as efficiently as possible. Obviously, past pages show that this has been muddied up. Second to reinoe's comment, anyway, is that he seems very certain in calling Konowa such, and I think this coincides with another point where reinoe is very confident that Konowa is a miller (though I have more to say on that which may refute this point a bit lol)<br><br>Post 235: Antihero, your list is cute and all but I would like reasons, because right now it looks like you picked the 4 players with the lowest post count plus Bert and Broodking.<br><br>Post 251: Ah yes. Guyett brings up the fact that reinoe seems certain about Konowa's millerness, but let's think this logically: what sort of role, especially normal, would know that another player was a miller? I guess he could assume that scum-reinoe would think that Konowa wasn't lying, but that doesn't feel certain enough to me. This also kind of loosens my earlier point about reinoe's absolutes; maybe that's just his speaking style? I still like my vote on him for reasons other than this.<br><br>Post 258: Antihero what do you mean by \"shotgunned\"<br>Post 262: Oops nevermind you defined this later. I think you're wrong, but you could try to sway me by showing people why it's \"terrible\" and then comparing it to the much better posting elsewhere in this game<br><br>Post 269: I don't like how Guyett rectifies that any VCA may have to wait; it seems to simply push aside the fact that my lynch at this point in the game would be based on weak evidence and thus nearly everyone on it would be worthy of critique.

The fact that you're now advocating policy lynching me for following the advice of mafiascum, advice you know you're familiar with because you referenced it, is another scum tell in my book.<br><br>So Guyett, why don't you explain to Misaka Network why in your previous town games you were much more \"trolly\" and in this game you're not so trolly?"}

I assume the rvs list was a joke. but if you're going to use such a list as reasoning for a vote, then your vote should make sense. which it didn't, because the vote was on the goon. I assume start has other reasons for the vote. but like I stated before, I don't see them. part of why I am asking for the case on chevre. the votes have piled up and I don't see a case. no one has laid it out, or if they have, I missed it.<br><br>so again: what's the case on chevre?"}

VCA is a byproduct of analyzing posts; you don't lock onto something early D1 and then go \"herpaderpderp, let's just lynch this and do VCA later\" because the more you talk about VCA now the more it's corrupted later.  you go for Day 1 scumlynches, not \"information lynches\" (i don't even know what that means anyway).<br><br>if you have a particular issue with a case/wagon then spit it out.  don't say you don't see anything and demand everyone else spoonfeed you.  it's not town motivated and i actually see it as a way for scum to tread water and not have to take any controversial stances and just shit up the thread by \"asking questions\" in order to just look busy.  i don't really care if you would describe yourself as a day 1 power player or not;  if you really are town, now's the time for an attitude adjustment."}

And then he states that he will look at what I'm all about, which is sort of against this whole idea he's been?

Why bother asking questions and trying to motivate us to talk to you if you're not listening? And what I said about your playstyle makes perfect sense; unless you do have noticeable changes in your meta between factions, your playstyle \"works\" regardless of whether you are town or scum, so it should by no means make you seem more town. For your final quote from me, I question it because it seems contradictory; you say you are using your playstyle yet you are planning to break from it to look at me. Even if it is by Antihero's request, it's out of place because you've been stubbornly defending your playstyle for your last few posts, so it concerns me.<br><br>Post 368: Aneninen, did my answer to your question make any impact?

The two votes are identical in that they don't provide any reasoning, but Boon treats them entirely differently. He asks Konowa to explain, but essentially provides reasons as to why Misaka may have voted him. I think it's a bit suspicious but also a definite link should one of them turn up scum, considering Boonskiie's newbieness.<br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5981138#p5981138\" class=\"postlink\">88</a>: I know this post is mentioned later as evidence to show why Boon is newb town rather than newb scum but it doesn't really do anything for me.

The first is one is circumstantial, and I'm not sure what the second even means. What exactly is proper \"follow-up\" to a miller claim?<br><br>The \"suspicion\" that formed on me on Page 8 is really strange and out of place. I'm not even remotely sure where any of the suspicion came from, given I hadn't really delved into the game at all at that point, in my opinion.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5985459#p5985459\" class=\"postlink\">260</a>: Not that I necessarily want to bring the game back full circle to miller claim discussion, but this post reminds me that there seem to be warring interpretations of what to do in the event of such a claim. Antihero calls it null and says to disregard it completely, and Guyett agrees with this, but earlier Broodking was suspecting people who did not react to the claim, yet he isn't attracting near as much suspicion as reinoe is simply because reinoe concretized his stance more to the point of arbitrariness.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5985459#p5985459\" class=\"postlink\">262</a>: I still haven't heard much in the way of any of Anti's claims about my posts and it boggles me to no end that people actually see verity in such a raw-edged case.<br><br>purl=http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5993775#p5993775]451[/url]: I think it's interesting that once epm starts getting serious pressure from Antihero and co. he attempts to re-encourage the townbloc idea, which was previously proposed by don_johnson and included epm in it<br><br>Responding to newer stuff:<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5996042#p5996042\" class=\"postlink\">482</a>: I'd say this is WIFOM, Aneninen.

I. can't. deal.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Final Player Reads</span><br><br>Boonskiies: I'm still really sold on this; a readthrough of the thread didn't really produce anything standing in the wayside of his scumminess. Like I said, 88 was brought up but it didn't really convince me that he was newbtown. I don't like the way he's reacted to my vote on him at all; it's just been defense-defense-defense with none of the content he keeps promising. <br><br>Aneninen: I don't really feel like Aneninen has been an influential entity in this game. He's really emotionally charged though, and I've questioned if that is sincere or a sort of confident-scum. For now I'm inclined to believe he's town whose play is off, but should he escape into later days with a lot of the same, I'd be wary.<br><br>Misaka Network: I actually think I align with a lot of Misaka's reads (except that which is on me obviously). His analysis and stance on the apathy of this game feel very town. While his votes are never explained within the same post, they do not feel opportunistic.<br><br>BroodkingEXE: I'm wary. The meta thing, which has been by far Broodking's biggest contribution, was kind of half-baked. Since then, he's promised content which we really haven't gotten.<br><br>chaoslord54: I'm actually going to abstain from discussing chaoslord, but from his few posts, he's town.<br><br>evilpacman18: He's not useful, but he's like the first of three for whom I could say that. What makes him a bit scummy is that he's always quick and eager to defend himself, but little else.<br><br>Antihero: Playstyle-wise, I have a problem with Antihero's flippant, confident attitude; it's producing big statements with little to no explanation, such as his bracketed suspect lists and his case on me. That aside though I think he is town because what explanation escapes him has been relatively logical. He's also, as he promised, explosive; I questioned his move from EPM to me even though he said he wasn't moving but now I think that's just how he is.<br><br>Guyett: Not really impressed? Despite his numerous posts I can't really recall anything original aside from his case on me. He feels as though he plays lackey to Antihero a lot. In my gut he feels scummy, his posting just doesn't feel as town as Misaka, Konowa, or even Antihero.<br><br>don_johnson: oh my jesus. Where do I begin. I have tried to avoid confrontation with his posts recently because we are honestly going to get nowhere with him. Everything he said on Day 1 was contradictory, but I knew for sure his playstyle was NOT the same as ours and it worked FOR HIM and no matter how you tried to restate it you were MISREPPING him and SPINNING his words and he was just not fun to talk to. I know this is all playstyle related and I probably should leave it alone, but it explains my null read on him because he simply attributes anything which one would consider scummy about him to be playstyle-related and when anyone questioned that it was instantly greeted with claims of word entanglement and \"scum!\". Unless he magically erupts from this vile cocoon and becomes a magical scum-finding vote-count-analyzing butterfly tomorrow, I recommend he be vigged at once.<br><br>startfromtheheart: Speaking of obfuscating playstyles...however I feel his uselessness is 100% intention. Yet I also think there is a chance that he could choose to become helpful, which don_johnson or evilpacman18 honestly have little potential for IMO. I'd put Bert in the same boat as Aneninen.<br><br>Konowa: The miller claim feels pretty legit and I think he's been fairly analytic and critical all day, so he seems like one of the more clear cut town in this game<br><br>reinoe: He was certainly flailing today, and I don't think I can forgive that 180 flip on his stance on millers regardless of the context that influenced it. I do think after that settled down though he didn't seem to shrink away as much as say Boonskiies did when the pressure left him. So I'd probably have him leaning town.<br><br>Final ranking, scum to town<br>Boonskiies<br>evilpacman18<br>BroodkingEXE<br>Guyett<br>startfromtheheart<br>Aneninen<br>reinoe<br>Antihero<br>Konowa<br>Misaka Network<br>chaoslord54"}

You simply say I wanted to do it.  Bizarre since I was taking a megaton of flak for it and you could have at least picked a reason that someone mentioned.

So I don't really care if chaoslord claims or not: that's a choice he needs to make.  I'm not going to demand that he claim.  I merely listed a bunch of scenarios in which I've claimed my role and I actually encouraged chaos to make up his own mind...<br><br>\"You do what you feel is best for you.\"<br><br>That's the exact quote.  Anyway that's fine if you want to be vague about your chaoslord=townread.  It's a playstyle choice.  I'm trying not to call people scummy because of playstyle differences."}

They soon found there to be no cell phone signal anywhere around, calling for help seemed futile. A few noticed pretty quickly that the tires on all the vehicles had been slashes, and the fuel drained out. Being miles from the nearest cabin, they found themselves stuck with at least one murderer and the dead body of their friend.<br><br>A couple from the group began to take charge, almost furiously accusing their fellow friends of killing another. This only sparked anger and confusion in the crowd, many erupting into tears, stomping off or even hitting others. <br><br>A loud whistle came from the middle of the crowd, the tall, fairly quiet girl stepping forward, attempting to calm everyone down. She was able to get everyone to listen for once that day, most backing down simply because they knew where these fights would lead. <br><br>Once organized they started doing their own detective work, working themselves into a bit of a frenzy trying to find the killer before they killed again. Slowly, but surely, they began to piece together what had happened here. When it was first suggested that it was the one sitting quietly in the corner, they all passed it off as \u201cNah, he\u2019s harmless\u201d or \u201cHim? Ha, he couldn\u2019t hurt a fly\u201d. It slowly dawned on each and every one of them that this quiet kid could have something sinister going on within him. <br><br>The quiet kid stood up when the others began to squabble about him, attempting to sneak out of the cabin, only to be caught fairly quickly. The others began to get furious again, some even calling for his death! Those some took ahold of the situation, dragging him out to the front of the cabin. Many couldn\u2019t watch what was happening in front of them, but stayed anyways, their eyes glued to this quiet, seemingly harmless kid. They group began yelling at him, berating him. He didn\u2019t break, only keeping an oddly sinister smile on his face as they locked him in a small shed out back.</span></span></fieldset><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Chevre, <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Goon</span></span>, was lynched Day 1.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: magenta\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">It is now Night 1.

We all should have some quark and leek for breakfast and please, no bacon this time. ^_^<br><br>Broodking, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6010623#p6010623\">645</a>: not Nightkilling Konowa is a well-known example of WIFOMpossibilities\u2122 (URL here: <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=WIFOMproducts%C2%AE\" class=\"postlink\">http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=WIFOMproducts%C2%AE</a>). I know it's only my intuition but consider this: if Konowa were scum he wouldn't have killed Reinoe, that would have been really dumb. Therefore, the scums Nightkilled Reinoe because they hope we're going to lynch Konowa next. So, I would suggest that we should ignore Konowa until we get new information on this topic.<br><br>Antihero: our conversation had been interrupted because the day ended. As far as I know I answered everything.<br>However, I have a question. Why did you unvote Chevre in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000361#p6000361\">592</a>? Because \"you were not ready?\" Hmmm... Originally you were the third one on that wagon. By that time it was pretty unsure that the wagon would reach L\u20131 later. Were you scared that your innocent-looking bussing could lead to a lynch? In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6002106#p6002106\">613</a> you mentioned that you would do a reads list and use the hammer but in your list (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6004468#p6004468\">625</a>) you wrote this: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Chevre - his last couple posts are the towniest he's been all game. he may flip scum but i doubt it.\"</span> <span class=\"noboldsig\">This is FoS at least!</span><br><br>By the way, the latter might be important:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@mod: you had left out Antihero's name in the final Vote Count of Day 1. (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6005132#p6005132\">640</a>).

I want to add something else here. His case against Reinoe was this: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5999699#p5999699\">580</a> which I found poor. (Basicly, it was a kind of paraphrasis of others' arguments.) However, he voted on Chevre later a situation in which he hadn't been forced to do so. The latter fact is townish for me while the others are scummy, including the soft-defense mentioned by BroodKing. All's put together, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Chaoslord is still FoS.</span> (Especially since Reinoe was voting for him and Nightkilling Reinoe, in my opinion, was about producing the WIFOM mentioned above.)<br>By the way, that Day1 starter randomization is funny but it's hardly an argument, pretty please.<br><br>I'd add a third <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS, EvilPacman</span>. I thought during Day1 that he was scummy and he was not on the Chevre wagon. Okay, he was away but, arriving back one hour after the hammer well, it does have some probability but what if he was been here but didn't dare to defend Chevre (which might have looked scummy anyway)? I know, this read is a bit intuitional but it still exists."}

Nowhere, or in worst case, to a mislynch.<br><br>Since it seems that I'm the only one who can see this wagon is poor at real arguments, I'm the only one who thinks that many pieces of information having provided by me in my Day 2 posts have been ignored, my growing unwillingness to go on with this discussion is not a surprise. I can fortell that maintaining this topic all I can get are tags like \"VI defense\", \"newbscum gameplay\" and things like those \u2013 regardless of my answers. I can also fortell the forthcoming words as well: \"flailing\", \"WIFOMizing\", \"misrepresenting\". Fankly, I'm sick of this phenomena. (It also exists in IRL Mafia games but, there a Day phase like this lasts for 3 minutes tops.)<br><br>Let me expain it by elaborating one single thing. Case:<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> \"someone was bussing Chevre and it was Aneninen.\"</span><br>(1) I've told the reason why was I voting for Reinoe in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5998136#p5998136\">527</a>; also mentioning that I might join a Chevre or an Evilpacman wagon if the Reinoe wagon went nowhere.<br>(2) I voted for Chevre in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000147#p6000147\">587</a>, putting him on L\u20131.<br>(3) Posted a funny summary in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6001677#p6001677\">610</a>. However, there <span style=\"font-style: italic\">were</span> some <span style=\"font-style: italic\">real</span> bits in it. Eg: thinking Reinoe, Chevre and Evilpacman are scum.<br>(4) Started an argument with Antihero in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6004699#p6004699\">630</a>.<br><br>For me, something seems to be logical. If I were Chevre's scum partner<br>(1) I wouldn't have voted for him so as to put him on L\u20131.<br>(2) I would have jumped off the wagon after his summary (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000236#p6000236\">588</a>), simply saying something like \"hmmm... I'm not sure about this wagon right now\". (Hint who were the players who had jumped off that wagon?)<br>(3) I could have put back my vote on Reinoe after this post of him: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000434#p6000434\">593</a> (so as to let you call me a stubborn player), or as a worst case scenario change my vote to Antihero as our argue started (to gain an OMGUSnewb tag or something like that).<br><br>None of these things happened. <br><br>However, if you are having an interest in my wagon, I'm pretty sure that you can \"U\u2013pipe\" these arguments as well. (U\u2013piping: misusing arguments to prove the exact opposite out of the same things.)<br><br>Still, feel free to go on with my wagon; but on Day3 you all really should examine whose interest it will have been to push this wagon."}

(Which I noticed by the way has been inactive for 3 days on here but has been active everywhere else)<br><br>@Guyett<br>Same goes for you. What's making you so certain that Aneninen is scum and what are your reads on EPM or Boonskies?</div></blockquote><br>It really all revolves around the Cherve wagon and how I think it went down. Right now, I don't feel like Anen's story is accurately portraying Anti on that front. That being said:<br><br>@Anen, what is your account of the Cherve lynch? Who started it? Who were the most active lynch pushers? How do you think Anti handled the lynch in the early stages, as he did have suspicions on him from the start? Your wagon hopping theory could be plausible, but it doesn't match Anti's support of the lynch in the early stages."}

However, I think I found something strange. The Chevre wagon was originally started by Startfromtheheart (Bert), he left it for Reinoe in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5985306#p5985306\">243</a>, rejoined it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5985536#p5985536\">280</a>, left it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5989254#p5989254\">361</a>... and never joined it again. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Startfromtheheart</span>: It's about the thing I've mentioned above <span class=\"noboldsig\">plus</span> the fact that you keep reposting your random table from the very start of the game. Plus, your recent vote for me without providing any content. I think you owe us an explanation.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Konowa</span>: I don't think Don jk'ed me last night; as far as I can remember I wasn't on his scum-list. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Everyone</span>: It's strange that neither Konowa nor Chaos got nightkilled. Either one of them (or both of them?) are lying or it's a pure WIFOM produced by the scums and they want us to lynch them sooner or later.<br>However, the tracking of Chaos is correct: I didn't visit anyone last night. So, noone shall be surprised by this claim: I'm a Vanilla Townie.<br><br>Just one more thing about Chaos which might confirm that he's telling the truth. If he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">were</span> a scum, providing a fake-tracking about me would be risky: if I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">had</span> a role with a targetting ability I would know instantly that he's lying!<br><br>Also, something about Don_Johnson. I've tried finding a softclaim by ISO-ing his posts. If he had softclaimed he should have used the letter <span class=\"noboldsig\">J</span>, which is really rare in English. It has been easy to check all the J's in his posts but, I have found NOTHING which might have been a softclaim.<br>This means... (1) either the scums were dumb and lucky by Nightkilling them (2) or <span class=\"noboldsig\">they must have a rolecop</span>! If (2) is true, that may explain why Konowa and Chaos are still alive.<br><br>I know that I'm not the smartest player on this forum but I hope that at least the latest bit helps."}

He also seemed to be one of the people that was under most people's suspicions so I was hoping by tracking him maybe it could lead to the idea of pushing forward with lynching him through being scum or to maybe help support the Anti is scum wagon by proving that Anen is town.

Went for Bert in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5992835#p5992835\">437</a>, back to Bert 4 posts later (!), returned to Chevre in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5997389#p5997389\">521</a>. Left that wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000361#p6000361\">592</a>. His Day 2 started with voting on me, then came a drama with a self-vote and finally it was he who hammered Misaka. Well, okay... that pattern makes no sense as a scum (as a partner of Chevre), but makes no sense as a townie as well. Has anyone got an idea about this?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Chaoslord wrote:</cite>I tracked Anen because of the whole back and forth between him and Anti in D-1 and a little in D-2. He also seemed to be one of the people that was under most people's suspicions so I was hoping by tracking him maybe it could lead to the idea of pushing forward with lynching him through being scum or to maybe help support the Anti is scum wagon by proving that Anen is town. I felt either way it gave us someone a little more solid to lynch.</div></blockquote><br><br>This explanation looks genuine. However, I don't agree that proving town-alignment means that Antihero's a scum. See above!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Evilpacman wrote:</cite>One of Konowa or chaos has to be scum I think =\\</div></blockquote><br><br>Not true. The more I think about it the surer I am that the scum team has a Rolecop. That explains the Nightkill of Don_Johnson (the Rolecop must have targetted him at Night1) and the fact that both Konowa and Chaos are still alive. You can read about this in my previous post: I tried to find a softclaim from Don_Johnson and I found nothing. (If there had been a softclaim, the scums might have de-crypted it somehow.)<br>Also, if Chaos were a scum, it would be risky to give a fake-track read since I could have had a town PR and could have caught him lying immediately. If he were a Mafia Tracker how could the scums benefit by <span style=\"font-style: italic\">publishing</span> his reads? Again, what would happen if he FOUND a town PR for real...? (I mean, in this case he might have tracked Don_Johnson at Night1... but, why did he claimed tracker only to provide NO tracking info afterwards?)<br><br>The latter answer goes for CherryDog as well: I don't think any of the claims are scum. I'm almost sure that both of them are real.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Bert</span>: you haven't answered my question about your voting pattern nor about voting for me without providing any pieces of information yet."}

Anens posting at that point was reading scummy, but so stubborn it could be seen as a townie misreading the game. His content at that point was feeling more towny.

I feel like Anti's activity when Chevre was L-2 supports it and am trying to see if there is a scum team that could have caused such a scenario.

What you were describing in D2 was an action Chevre jumps off Chevre wagon, but I couldn't find the scum motivation for his push on Chevre, as Konowa is pointing out. If you can figure out why Anti did what he did D1 scum perspective your case would be totally valid."}

In addition: it's clear that I can't have any night-action PR (by the way, other kinds of PRs would be highly unlikely too, see later) which means I'm expendable as well.<br><br>The logic about why my VT claim was true:<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">There are the following possibilities:<br><br>(1) Chaos is Town Tracker and I'm VT. Nothing extra-ordinary in this case. I still might have a PR with no night target ability or it might be possible that I didn't use my ability at Night2. In both cases I would stfu and wouldn't tell you that I'm expendable. (Unless I'd be an X-shot Bulletproof but we all wish I were one.)<br><br>(2) Chaos is Town Tracker and I'm scum. The original setup is most probably 10:3. (There were no multiple Nightkills and 9:4 would be absurd.) One Mafia Goon is down. Amongst the other two there must be a Rolecop: Don't Nightkill is only logical if they <span style=\"font-style: italic\">knew</span> who he was or at least they knew that he was targetting someone before. As Bert wrote it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6039164#p6039164\">1016</a>, the standard procedure is that one of the scums performs the Kill while the other one performs the Night Action. In both cases if I were scum, I would have done something and Chaos would have known about it. His \"no action\" read would have been possible only if my scum partner had performed both the Kill and the Targetting. This could be possible if my partner were the Rolecop, but in this case I'd stfu instead of trying rolefishing the scum group. In short, (2) is not entirely impossible but very unlikely.<br><br>(3) Chaos is Scum and I'm VT. That's an interesting version. In this case he may be either the Mafia Tracker or the Mafia Rolecop. The sequence of the events could have been the following. Night 1: Chaos tracks Don. Day 2: he claims Tracker and says he tracked Reinoe (there's no way to confirm or contradict this). Night 2: Mafia kills Don (either they knew he was a Jailkeeper or they only knew that he had a PR). Day 3: he makes up his tracking about me. That may be risky <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but</span>, telling that he tracked Don would have been way too suspicious. So, he takes the risk and makes up a name. He's lucky because without having a PR with Night-targetting I can't counterclaim him. I think (1) is more likely than (3) but, the fact that he haven't tracked Konowa yet makes (3) more probable. (If I were a Tracker I'd have been tracked Konowa during Night1. It's still possible that Knowa doesn't perform an action \u2013 though, if the scums indeed have a Rolecop, that's not too likely, see (2)! \u2013 but, as for Millers, a Tracker can get more info about them than a Cop, since the Copread is useless.)<br><br>(3/2) Both Konowa and Chaos are scum. A weird idea but it's not impossible. That would explain why didn't he track Konowa and if they bus each other effectively, none of us will consider the un-lynched one out of them after the other one will have flipped scum... or would we? ^_^ By the way, if (3/2) is true my alignment is town, yet again. (There can't be three living scums.)<br><br>(4) Both Chaos and I are scum. In this case faking tracking me would be nonsense. We'd know that Konowa's claim was real and he could have lied that he checked Konowa's claim with the tracking (regardless of his real target, Chaos' possible roles if he's scum are detailed under (3)). This version is impossible in practitce, I think, and not only because I would have advised Chaos to track Konowa (or f-ck, anyone else but me). If we were both scum, there could be an investigate role on the town side as well. If a \"real\" town Tracker targetted me later and got a positive result, it would be pretty much game over for us. (See (2) for details, especially the \"one scum Kills, the other one performs the action part. If a Cop gets a \"scum\" read on me after targetting, the situation is rougly the same, though there would be a slim chance that Chaos got away with the story.)</div></div></div><br><br>Conclusion: I'll examine everything thorougly as soon as I can. Feel free to point out if my logic in the forthcoming posts are wrong but, until we have a 100,00% confirmed town player, you should trust me. Even if I'm not the smartest player on the forum, I'll try to do my best."}

Sure it may be fake (see my previous post, this post or other players' posts about it) but one thing bothers me considering it fake. Why did he claim on Day2 with tracking Reinoe? Wouldn't it have been easier to wait for Day3? Eg. he could have chosen from more dead players to give away uninformative tracks... He voted on Chevre on Day 1. Even if he didn't give an explanation for that (as far as I saw) it would have made no sense if he were Chevre's partner.<br>Scumtells: His case on Reinoe on Day1 was shyt. His claim happened in an inappropriate moment, I think. (There was no wagon against him and he provided no info by that.) His jump on the Misaka wagon was awkward. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6036301#p6036301\">980</a>: that's not true.

I haven't wanted to talk about it but a Tracker+Cop+Miller setup would be imbalanced. Yet another thing which makes me think that Chaos's faking. (Why haven't I wanted to post about it? Call me a noob but I thought it would have been town-rolefishing.)<br>Others: The more I read his posts the more I think that he's scum. Still, what if we're wrong?

He was not on the Chevre wagon but was on the Misaka wagon. His recent turn against Konowa is another FoS.

Chaos may also know that a Tracker+Miller+Cop setup could be broken (and a Miller without a Cop seems to be a bit \"bastard\" for me). So, there is a chance that the Miller claim is the fake one.

Sure it may be fake (see my previous post, this post or other players' posts about it) but one thing bothers me considering it fake. Why did he claim on Day2 with tracking Reinoe? Wouldn't it have been easier to wait for Day3? Eg. he could have chosen from more dead players to give away uninformative tracks... He voted on Chevre on Day 1. Even if he didn't give an explanation for that (as far as I saw) it would have made no sense if he were Chevre's partner.<br>Scumtells: His case on Reinoe on Day1 was shyt. His claim happened in an inappropriate moment, I think. (There was no wagon against him and he provided no info by that.) His jump on the Misaka wagon was awkward. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6036301#p6036301\">980</a>: that's not true.

(Though I can't see any reason for that choice.) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Post-edit</span>: Yes, that's it, BroodKing! I haven't wanted to talk about it but a Tracker+Cop+Miller setup would be imbalanced. Yet another thing which makes me think that Chaos's faking. (Why haven't I wanted to post about it? Call me a noob but I thought it would have been town-rolefishing.)<br>Others: The more I read his posts the more I think that he's scum. Still, what if we're wrong? We shouldn't lynch the Tracker in this case. How can I say, I wouldn't suggest lynching him today because the loss might be detrimental. Maybe tomorrow.

Sure it may be fake (see my previous post, this post or other players' posts about it) but one thing bothers me considering it fake. Why did he claim on Day2 with tracking Reinoe? Wouldn't it have been easier to wait for Day3? Eg. he could have chosen from more dead players to give away uninformative tracks... He voted on Chevre on Day 1. Even if he didn't give an explanation for that (as far as I saw) it would have made no sense if he were Chevre's partner.<br>Scumtells: His case on Reinoe on Day1 was shyt. His claim happened in an inappropriate moment, I think. (There was no wagon against him and he provided no info by that.) His jump on the Misaka wagon was awkward. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6036301#p6036301\">980</a>: that's not true.

(Though I can't see any reason for that choice.) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Post-edit</span>: Yes, that's it, BroodKing! I haven't wanted to talk about it but a Tracker+Cop+Miller setup would be imbalanced. Yet another thing which makes me think that Chaos's faking. (Why haven't I wanted to post about it? Call me a noob but I thought it would have been town-rolefishing.)<br>Others: The more I read his posts the more I think that he's scum. Still, what if we're wrong? We shouldn't lynch the Tracker in this case. How can I say, I wouldn't suggest lynching him today because the loss might be detrimental. Maybe tomorrow.

He was not on the Chevre wagon but was on the Misaka wagon. His recent turn against Konowa is another FoS. (He voted for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6042545#p6042545\">1047</a> and Chaos followed him in the next post.

I personally have played a lot of games in which cops D4 claim, because at that point you have a lot of results that can help town. I tried to make the tone of 1112 more advisory than imperative. At this point, we know that scum have 1KP and maybe a RB depending on how you perceive the events of town. As of now we have 3 blue claims (if a cop claims), and a miller claim. Even in the worst case it takes scum two days to get rid of investigative roles. That's D6 and with results we can lynch both scum in that time with days to spare."}

I don't think I should explain that, no information = no tell.<br>(3) Anti-town: trying to find scumtells in my later posts AFTER ignoring my long posts. Thing is merely about fudging my original questions plus driving the thread away from my long posts, as if they contained nothing useful.

Also, so far the \"regardless of\" phenomenon is true as well.<br>Others: It's strange that you haven't even thought that being unaware of the fact my links are not working is a possibility. You know, I simply skimmed over some posts, since I had (and have) very little time. You're thinking that I'm pretending it so as to avoid producing real content. You may or may not believe but I'm not pretending this, I indeed have busy days. You should ISO me and read my posts assuming that I indeed have little time. Your thoughts may change. In spite of everything I think your posts are coming from a paranoid and a bit frustrated town, not a scum. <br>Answering your question \"why did I put Chevre on L\u20131?\": (1) I didn't like that he had chosen \"random-looking\" posts so as to respond to in his walls.

(It would have been silly if he were Chevre's scumpartner.) He started asking questions about my long posts and arguing my reads. He started defending EPM. Since EPM didn't think that Chaos might buddy-ing him it is possible that both of them are town. There were posts about it why they can't be scum together so this is a minor townread on EPM as well. (I think EPM would have \"pumped up\" Chaos's \"soft-defense\" somehow so as to protect his a$$ if he were scum.)<br>Scumtells: I gave an answer for your questions about my scumtells. Check that.<br>Others: He has been echoing the \"Aneninen's latest posts are scummy\" song lately. However, echoing =/= starting it. He might be affected by other players \u2013 some of these must be interested in taking out me or my thoughts out of the game. So, this attitude is not a real tell though it might change later.

Re-quoting his own random reads make no sense if he's town. He had kept posting (almost) zero content till he got pressurized a bit (...and that wasn't a big pressure!). Than he changed. A Bodyguard claim when we know that we had a Jailkeeper? Plus, performing that claim at a silly moment (revealing a PR when he's way far from lynch?). He admits that he protected Chaos twice? First of all, noone can confirm or \"counter\" that action. Second, eg. in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6022325#p6022325\">870</a> he posted \"Konowa seems town.\" He voted for Konowa only in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6064161#p6064161\">1157</a>. Why didn't he protect Konowa at Night1 or Night2?

I get that it can come off as scummy, but it really was more of a misunderstanding of mechanics and getting a little too excited over my read. Now as for your concern over my actions on day 1 I will break it down for you a little more clearly. I was feeling that Reinoe was being scummy especially because he was jumping around a lot on his stances and it was coming off weird to me but I still leaned towards the idea that Chevre was scum as well. When I saw that no one was exactly seeing my points that Reinoe was scum I decided to back off and go after Chevre because my hopes were to then track Reinoe during the night phase and find evidence that he was scum afterall which I could then use to push for a quick lynch against him in day 2. That's why I switched so quickly but did not explain it much is because I was hoping to use my PR role to help my case in the second day."}

(Chaos telling the truth, Aneninen being scum that didn't submit the kill) you've ruled out on the rolecop assumption that Mafia wouldn't have killed Don unless they knew he was a power role, and that mafia would apparently have different members submit their different actions. Until there is actual proof of a rolecop existing, that whole thing is flawed."}

Since he's posted more and explain himself, he has become more scummy to me. My main tell is the fact he claims \"When I tracked Anen I got no results which made me assume he didn't visit anyone.\" which indicates he thinks (or knows) Anen is not a VT. He makes the distinction that getting \"No Results\" is different from getting \"Did not visit anyone\" (owtte).<br>Aside from that, I find his play has been passive, not because of lurking but because of defensiveness. <br>My indifference is because I don't know what to make of this. I have a feeling he's scum but I'm still not 100% sure. Hence indifference. My play is like that, to be honest. It's rare I say \"this guy is definitely scum\" even for my top reads.

They had decided it would be best for them to all go as one large group, instead of splitting up and causing excess risk with this killer out there. There were a couple opposed to this trek outside, they figured with all this talk of risk, why are they risking their lives against the elements AND a killer now? Most of these complaints were just grumbles, nothing really of note, until one stood up and explained how bad of an idea this was. No one listened to him, he was ignored and the group continued with the preparations.<br><br>This one rebel got more and more frustrated with these people he once considered friends and decided to take matters into his own hands. He wanted to prove to them how dangerous it was outside. He grabbed his jacket and some thicker boots and stomped outside, making sure everyone heard his rage. The ground was slick, mud had formed everywhere. He nearly slipped and fell multiple times as he head out towards the trail that lead the teens to the cabin. He stopped near the broken down cars, and raised his arms in the air. <br><br>\"See how stupid this is? You people won't make it a mile before one of you breaks something!\" He yelled, his voice barely audible over the clattering of the rain.<br><br>One of the vehicles began to noticeably shift in the mud. The ground had softened and moved enough that heavier objects were slipping quickly. As the man yelled, the teens motioned for him to get out of the way, yelling and screaming for him to move. A couple ran to get him before the car struck the teen down. The car had picked up speed now, the rear coming towards him, possibly enough to run him down. Before the others could save him, the teen finally noticed the vehicle barrelling towards him and jumped out of the way, being clipped by the corner of the car and falling to the ground. The front tire of the car pinned his legs, his face towards the ground. He tried to yell, but the muddy water had risen and filled his mouth. The ones that tried to save him stood staring momentarily, before rushing to help him. Moving the car would only mangle this kids leg more, but he was drowning. The teens all pushed the car as hard as they could, finally getting it off his leg. They carried him inside and set him in the middle of the living area.

I really think Cheery Dog is town, because of both his posting today and because of the way Chevre and Konowa both went after him from D1. I think Guyett - whose VCA is really important to his reads in general - missing this is pretty incriminating. Hopefully that read doesn't seem defensive, there's not really precedent for much of anything in my ISO but as far as it goes, I think I have been leaning scum on him the entire game. I sort of let it go when FG and Anti were letting him go, and because I really didn't care about anything while Konowa was left alive for no reason. Aneninen is a ?<br><br>I think Konowa and Chevre's ISOs and VC history offer all the proof anyone should need that Boonskiies/Cheery was decidedly not scum. Chevre near the end of D1 looks like he was just trying to be on whatever the most likely counterwagon to his lynch was gonna be. Konowa and Chevre both had turns on the Boonskiies wagon. I notice in the D1 vote counts too that Konowa tends to be just a few steps behind either Chevre or Guyett for basically the entire day.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5983998#p5983998\">190</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5984013#p5984013\">192</a> are interesting. Time-wise they're super close together and they're both responses to particular posts, but in 192, Konowa addresses Guyett's 179. It's random because the intent of those two very close together posts is otherwise completely conversational, and it's an oddly specific quote that he picks out to talk about, it just seems to me like he's trying to be in conversation with Guyett.<br>Anen remains a ?, Konowa's ISO is unhelpful in that regard but I think that's a good thing.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6068023#p6068023\">1187</a> is valuable, I normally wouldn't read something like \"Guy has been obvtown all game\" as something one scumbuddy would say to another scumbuddy (from Konowa's point of view, here) but I noticed in I think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6041936#p6041936\">1035</a> that Konowa seemed pretty submissive to Guy. Like he expresses in multiple posts that he doesn't understand peoples' reasoning, but it's only with Guyett that he asks for help understanding (\"what am I missing?\"), rather than acting smarter than/coachy to the other person (compare with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6042121#p6042121\">1042</a> for instance, \"you're being too gullible\").<br>On Brood/sthar, Konowa's ISO is also fairly unhelpful.<br><br>So right now scum-&gt;town I've got Guyett, sthar, Anen, Cheery<br>Chevre's ISO is next"}

Each being taken out in a new, inventive way, and totally not a rip off of other people's ideas. 7 teens dropped to 6 when the group got nervous about the food being served, paranoid the one who cooked spiked the eggs. They turned savage on him feeding him every last egg they had. As it turned out, someone got to the eggs before they were even cooked. Now at 6 teens, the group sat awake at night, no one sleeping. This went on for 2 nights, no sleep, everyone too afraid to leave the cabin in fear of the storm picking up again. It had turned to only a light drizzle now. One teen got fed up with the no sleep and grabbed the bottle of sleeping pills one of the dead members had in their pack, crushing them up and spiking the drinking water. He waited until everyone had a drink of it before finally he had some himself, sure that everyone would be asleep and they would be safe. He was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">dead</span> wrong (he was stabbed in the face that night).<br><br>Now down to 5 left, the remaining members decided it was time to brave the outside world. Exiting the cabin, they noticed the rain picking up slightly as they trekked up the road. They all kept their distance from one another, constantly checking around, making sure no one was going to stab them or kill them in some other super creative way. The storm picked up even more half way to the neighbour's cabin. The road became slick yet again, a stream running beside the road picked up in speed, the volume of water rose, encroaching on the road. One girl stumbled on a loose rock, falling into the guy in front of her. He immediately turned around, forcefully shoving her away. She stumbled backwards now, falling into the stream, hitting her head off of a rock on the bottom. She began to float in the stream, while the one who pushed her began yelling about how she tried to push him in, how she was going to kill him. The teens did nothing to save this girl.<br><br>Finally after the long trek in the storm, they reached the neighbours cabin only to find it empty. They all began to search the place, looking for a landline, or any form of communication with the outside world. Once the reconvened in the common space, they realized the place had nothing. It had been a loss. They decided to stay here for the night, hoping the storm would lighten up by morning so they could head to the next place. Of course, someone didn't make it through the night. They all had the 'bright' idea of splitting up and staying in different rooms. Well in the morning, they found one cabinmate chopped up and a piece in each of their rooms.<br><br>Now only 3 left. The yelling began. They all screamed and went at each other for hours, the fighting went into the night and back into the day again. Shoving and pushing each other around until finally someone snapped. He shoved the last girl left and she stumbled backwards, falling onto the hardwood floor. He stood over her and with a disgusted look on his face he took out the last of his rage, thinking she had to be the killer, he killed her first.<br><br>Standing above him after he finished killing the poor girl was the only other teen left. <br><br>\"Good Choice\" the other teen said...</fieldset></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">evilpacman18, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Town</span></span>, has been lynched on Day 6.<br>sthar8, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Town</span></span>, has been endgamed.</span><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"color: magenta\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">MAFIA HAVE WON.<br><br>Congratulations Chevre, Guyett, and Konowa!

Also, congratulations to the scum team, you had a great gamelplay!<br><br>I've learnt something important.<br>After Chaos had revealed his investigation on me, I tried to collect a lot of data about everything. As you can see now, I was telling the truth, even if some of you didn't believe me. The main problem was the following. I was waiting for someone who might actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">use</span> my data, I tried to start discussions about everything instead of figuring out something useful out of the things I had collected. I had the opportunity to hammer Konowa earlier but, instead of doing it I watched his wagon dissolving into nothingness and in the end of the Day I was on the Riddleton wagon \u2013 which I consider the most terrible wagon of the game as I look back now.<br>Next Day I was V/LA because I was on holiday, so I missed the Konowa lynch. But, the worst part of my gameplay was Day5. I was reading the game 'till the cows came home and I decided many times that I would ISO everyone, I would post more... after all, I had all the information collected, I only would have had to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">use</span> them! Still, I did nothing but watched the Day ending \u2013 though, by that time everyone was sure that I was town. That was the THIRD time when I simply failed to do anything at the end of the Day. I had the opportunity to solve the game and I did nothing.<br>It's no surprise that Bipolar made a jigsaw puzzle out of my corpse (lololol!), as if he had said \"Aneninen, pull yourself together\".<br>Such a gameplay was unacceptable."}

As I said in dead thread, I didn't know who the scum were nor was I recruitable.  So I couldn't even signal for them to try and kill me.  I really thought claiming miller when the scum knew there was a traitor would have tipped them off.  I was pretty confident in Chevre scum which is why I delayed getting on their till as late as possible.  I honestly thought the Antihero/Riddleton slot was scum and felt bad pushing that lynch but figured if it went through I would have pretty clear.  <br><br>Fun game regardless, and good job Guy for winning for us."}
