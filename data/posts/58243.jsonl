The group of friends had known each other since preschool, inseparable they were. Of course they had their little squabbles here and there but in the end they were all the thickest of thieves! The trip was meant to end out their last summer before they all went to college, breaking them apart for the first time ever.<br>\n<br>\nSpirits were high as the 14 teens dragged their half asleep asses out of the cars, a couple of them darting straight for the front door to the cabin. A few staying back at the cars unpacking their belongings, and the rest slowly making their way to two-story log cabin they had all rented together. This weekend was looking to be crazy, a truly epic way to end the summer, but little did they know this wasn&#8217;t just the end of summer for some of them&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nAs the night went on, the teens partied and drank and had the greatest times of their lives, one by one they wandered off to bed, sometimes in pairs, sometimes more than pairs. Eventually the party died out and the cabin returned to the quiet little house in the middle of the woods.<br>\n<br>\nAs the teens awoke, they stumbled around trying to overcome the horrible hangover that cursed each and every one of them. Once they all got their minds in the right place, so began the amazing breakfast feast! The smell of bacon, eggs and maple syrup filled the air, drawing everyone to the living area of the cabin. Only after they all began to chow down did they realize they were one member short. Quickly tidying up, the group split into sections to look for their missing friend, but none had to go very far, for they found their poor friend in the outhouse. Bloodied and pale, he had been gruesomely killed sometime in the night. No one had any idea who could have done it, but they did know one thing, it was at least one of them!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player List:</div>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>Cheery Dog (Replaced Boonskiies)<br>\n</li><li>Aneninen<br>\n</li><li>Misaka Network (Hydra of FakeGod and Gaiden)<br>\n</li><li>sthar8 (replaced BroodKingEXE)<br>\n</li><li>chaoslord54<br>\n</li><li>evilpacman18<br>\n</li><li>Riddleton (Replaced Antihero) <div style=\"font-size: 10%;

It seems like you are trying to wiggle out of something if you aren't doing it now.<br>\n<br>\nPost 226: I don't like how reinoe refers to Konowa as a \"negative utility town slot\" due to his miller claim. First off, it's silly to say such a pessimistic thing; if Konowa is a miller as I believe him to be, then I think he did the right thing by claiming immediately in an attempt to settle the miller matter as cleanly as possible, and be able to participate in scumhunting as efficiently as possible. Obviously, past pages show that this has been muddied up. Second to reinoe's comment, anyway, is that he seems very certain in calling Konowa such, and I think this coincides with another point where reinoe is very confident that Konowa is a miller (though I have more to say on that which may refute this point a bit lol)<br>\n<br>\nPost 235: Antihero, your list is cute and all but I would like reasons, because right now it looks like you picked the 4 players with the lowest post count plus Bert and Broodking.<br>\n<br>\nPost 251: Ah yes. Guyett brings up the fact that reinoe seems certain about Konowa's millerness, but let's think this logically: what sort of role, especially normal, would know that another player was a miller? I guess he could assume that scum-reinoe would think that Konowa wasn't lying, but that doesn't feel certain enough to me.

The fact that you're now advocating policy lynching me for following the advice of mafiascum, advice you know you're familiar with because you referenced it, is another scum tell in my book.<br>\n<br>\nSo Guyett, why don't you explain to Misaka Network why in your previous town games you were much more \"trolly\" and in this game you're not so trolly?", "time": "Wed Jul 02, 2014 6:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58243&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "58243"}

I assume the rvs list was a joke. but if you're going to use such a list as reasoning for a vote, then your vote should make sense. which it didn't, because the vote was on the goon.

And then he states that he will look at what I'm all about, which is sort of against this whole idea he's been?

Why bother asking questions and trying to motivate us to talk to you if you're not listening? And what I said about your playstyle makes perfect sense; unless you do have noticeable changes in your meta between factions, your playstyle \"works\" regardless of whether you are town or scum, so it should by no means make you seem more town. For your final quote from me, I question it because it seems contradictory; you say you are using your playstyle yet you are planning to break from it to look at me.

The two votes are identical in that they don't provide any reasoning, but Boon treats them entirely differently.

Antihero calls it null and says to disregard it completely, and Guyett agrees with this, but earlier Broodking was suspecting people who did not react to the claim, yet he isn't attracting near as much suspicion as reinoe is simply because reinoe concretized his stance more to the point of arbitrariness.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5985459#p5985459\" class=\"postlink\">262</a>: I still haven't heard much in the way of any of Anti's claims about my posts and it boggles me to no end that people actually see verity in such a raw-edged case.<br>\n<br>\npurl=<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5993775#p5993775\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 5#p5993775</a>]451[/url]: I think it's interesting that once epm starts getting serious pressure from Antihero and co. he attempts to re-encourage the townbloc idea, which was previously proposed by don_johnson and included epm in it<br>\n<br>\nResponding to newer stuff:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5996042#p5996042\" class=\"postlink\">482</a>: I'd say this is WIFOM, Aneninen.

I. can't. deal.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Final Player Reads</div><br>\n<br>\nBoonskiies: I'm still really sold on this; a readthrough of the thread didn't really produce anything standing in the wayside of his scumminess. Like I said, 88 was brought up but it didn't really convince me that he was newbtown. I don't like the way he's reacted to my vote on him at all; it's just been defense-defense-defense with none of the content he keeps promising. <br>\n<br>\nAneninen: I don't really feel like Aneninen has been an influential entity in this game. He's really emotionally charged though, and I've questioned if that is sincere or a sort of confident-scum. For now I'm inclined to believe he's town whose play is off, but should he escape into later days with a lot of the same, I'd be wary.<br>\n<br>\nMisaka Network: I actually think I align with a lot of Misaka's reads (except that which is on me obviously). His analysis and stance on the apathy of this game feel very town. While his votes are never explained within the same post, they do not feel opportunistic.<br>\n<br>\nBroodkingEXE: I'm wary. The meta thing, which has been by far Broodking's biggest contribution, was kind of half-baked. Since then, he's promised content which we really haven't gotten.<br>\n<br>\nchaoslord54: I'm actually going to abstain from discussing chaoslord, but from his few posts, he's town.<br>\n<br>\nevilpacman18: He's not useful, but he's like the first of three for whom I could say that. What makes him a bit scummy is that he's always quick and eager to defend himself, but little else.<br>\n<br>\nAntihero: Playstyle-wise, I have a problem with Antihero's flippant, confident attitude; it's producing big statements with little to no explanation, such as his bracketed suspect lists and his case on me. That aside though I think he is town because what explanation escapes him has been relatively logical. He's also, as he promised, explosive; I questioned his move from EPM to me even though he said he wasn't moving but now I think that's just how he is.<br>\n<br>\nGuyett: Not really impressed? Despite his numerous posts I can't really recall anything original aside from his case on me. He feels as though he plays lackey to Antihero a lot. In my gut he feels scummy, his posting just doesn't feel as town as Misaka, Konowa, or even Antihero.<br>\n<br>\ndon_johnson: oh my jesus. Where do I begin. I have tried to avoid confrontation with his posts recently because we are honestly going to get nowhere with him. Everything he said on Day 1 was contradictory, but I knew for sure his playstyle was NOT the same as ours and it worked FOR HIM and no matter how you tried to restate it you were MISREPPING him and SPINNING his words and he was just not fun to talk to. I know this is all playstyle related and I probably should leave it alone, but it explains my null read on him because he simply attributes anything which one would consider scummy about him to be playstyle-related and when anyone questioned that it was instantly greeted with claims of word entanglement and \"scum!\". Unless he magically erupts from this vile cocoon and becomes a magical scum-finding vote-count-analyzing butterfly tomorrow, I recommend he be vigged at once.<br>\n<br>\nstartfromtheheart: Speaking of obfuscating playstyles...however I feel his uselessness is 100% intention. Yet I also think there is a chance that he could choose to become helpful, which don_johnson or evilpacman18 honestly have little potential for IMO. I'd put Bert in the same boat as Aneninen.<br>\n<br>\nKonowa: The miller claim feels pretty legit and I think he's been fairly analytic and critical all day, so he seems like one of the more clear cut town in this game<br>\n<br>\nreinoe: He was certainly flailing today, and I don't think I can forgive that 180 flip on his stance on millers regardless of the context that influenced it. I do think after that settled down though he didn't seem to shrink away as much as say Boonskiies did when the pressure left him. So I'd probably have him leaning town.<br>\n<br>\nFinal ranking, scum to town<br>\nBoonskiies<br>\nevilpacman18<br>\nBroodkingEXE<br>\nGuyett<br>\nstartfromtheheart<br>\nAneninen<br>\nreinoe<br>\nAntihero<br>\nKonowa<br>\nMisaka Network<br>\nchaoslord54", "time": "Mon Jul 07, 2014 8:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58243&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "58243"}

There were two reasons for me saying so and despite you detailing that I had approximately 11 posts dedicated to the project you don't actually mention what's scummy about wanting to lynch the miller.  You simply say I wanted to do it.  Bizarre since I was taking a megaton of flak for it and you could have at least picked a reason that someone mentioned.  Furthermore I had perfectly valid reasons for wanting to lynch the miller.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5999699#p5999699\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5999699#p5999699\" data-post-id=\"5999699\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 580</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24044\">chaoslord54</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nThen in<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5984863#p5984863\">229</a>, he suddenly makes a claim that&#8217;s scummy because he brings attention away from himself and the fact that he&#8217;s been claiming to lynch the miller half the time and tries to bring the idea of focusing on the other people he&#8217;s convince to get on his wagon.  </div></blockquote><br>\nThis post does not make any sense, awkward post or not.  How am I bringing attention away from myself?  I'm answering a question that is predicated on focusing on other people.  I'm in no way shape or form trying to convince anyone to get on the Konowa wagon at that point.

That's me building a cursory case one someone whom I'm starting to believe is scum.  Look carefully: I'm seeing a behavior and then labeling what's scummy about it, which is not what you're doing in your \"case\" against me.  You're simply saying \"look at reinoe he's posting\" without saying what's scummy about it and you can't because there's really nothing scummy about it.  Look at this case: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF0000\">he&#8217;s desperately trying to defend himself</div></div></div></div>.<br>\n1) That tone is not one of desperation<br>\n2) You're saying that trying to defend myself is scummy <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <br>\nThis is trash masquerading as a \"case\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5999699#p5999699\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5999699#p5999699\" data-post-id=\"5999699\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 580</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24044\">chaoslord54</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nAfter running more up the miller in claim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5992636#p5992636\">433</a> he randomly switched against EPM without much evidence on why.  On top of that his arguments on the wagon and using meta as his defense was just horrible.   And with him randomly joining sides with the person he&#8217;s been targeting the entire day so far, it just seems suspicious and scummy.</div></blockquote><br>\nFinally you made a semi-worthwhile point in your first sentence.  Except that I was phone posting so I couldn't give a detailed explanation for my scumread on EPM.  Furthermore Anti listed the reasons for why EPM could be scum and it's rather inconvenient to rehash something someone else says when phone posting.  <br>\n<br>\nI don't even know what your second sentence even means.<br>\n<br>\nThe third sentence: I'll see if I can decipher it...<br>\nYou think it's suspicious for two people to join in on the same wagon if they've been targeting each other all day.  Except I already mentioned I'm not entirely convinced Konowa is scum.  I said that it's 50/50: part of my push on Konowa is because I wanted to test the miller claim and that it's part policy lynch.

They soon found there to be no cell phone signal anywhere around, calling for help seemed futile. A few noticed pretty quickly that the tires on all the vehicles had been slashes, and the fuel drained out. Being miles from the nearest cabin, they found themselves stuck with at least one murderer and the dead body of their friend.<br>\n<br>\nA couple from the group began to take charge, almost furiously accusing their fellow friends of killing another. This only sparked anger and confusion in the crowd, many erupting into tears, stomping off or even hitting others. <br>\n<br>\nA loud whistle came from the middle of the crowd, the tall, fairly quiet girl stepping forward, attempting to calm everyone down. She was able to get everyone to listen for once that day, most backing down simply because they knew where these fights would lead. <br>\n<br>\nOnce organized they started doing their own detective work, working themselves into a bit of a frenzy trying to find the killer before they killed again. Slowly, but surely, they began to piece together what had happened here. When it was first suggested that it was the one sitting quietly in the corner, they all passed it off as &#8220;Nah, he&#8217;s harmless&#8221; or &#8220;Him? Ha, he couldn&#8217;t hurt a fly&#8221;. It slowly dawned on each and every one of them that this quiet kid could have something sinister going on within him. <br>\n<br>\nThe quiet kid stood up when the others began to squabble about him, attempting to sneak out of the cabin, only to be caught fairly quickly. The others began to get furious again, some even calling for his death! Those some took ahold of the situation, dragging him out to the front of the cabin. Many couldn&#8217;t watch what was happening in front of them, but stayed anyways, their eyes glued to this quiet, seemingly harmless kid. They group began yelling at him, berating him.

A few barely staying awake attempting to protect those asleep. All was for not, as when the group arose in the morning, they were met with another gruesome surprise. One of the shed guards sat slumped against the shed, throat slit, lifeless and pale. The other knocked out cold beside him.<br>\n<br>\nIn the shed they found the body of the quiet kid, a knife sticking out of his chest, with a note attached.

I know it's only my intuition but consider this: if Konowa were scum he wouldn't have killed Reinoe, that would have been really dumb. Therefore, the scums Nightkilled Reinoe because they hope we're going to lynch Konowa next. So, I would suggest that we should ignore Konowa until we get new information on this topic.<br>\n<br>\nAntihero: our conversation had been interrupted because the day ended. As far as I know I answered everything.<br>\nHowever, I have a question. Why did you unvote Chevre in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000361#p6000361\">592</a>? Because \"you were not ready?\" Hmmm... Originally you were the third one on that wagon. By that time it was pretty unsure that the wagon would reach L&#8211;1 later. Were you scared that your innocent-looking bussing could lead to a lynch? In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6002106#p6002106\">613</a> you mentioned that you would do a reads list and use the hammer but in your list (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6004468#p6004468\">625</a>) you wrote this: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Chevre - his last couple posts are the towniest he's been all game. he may flip scum but i doubt it.\"</div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This is FoS at least!</div><br>\n<br>\nBy the way, the latter might be important:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@mod: you had left out Antihero's name in the final Vote Count of Day 1.

(Basicly, it was a kind of paraphrasis of others' arguments.) However, he voted on Chevre later a situation in which he hadn't been forced to do so. The latter fact is townish for me while the others are scummy, including the soft-defense mentioned by BroodKing. All's put together, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Chaoslord is still FoS.</div> (Especially since Reinoe was voting for him and Nightkilling Reinoe, in my opinion, was about producing the WIFOM mentioned above.)<br>\nBy the way, that Day1 starter randomization is funny but it's hardly an argument, pretty please.<br>\n<br>\nI'd add a third <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS, EvilPacman</div>. I thought during Day1 that he was scummy and he was not on the Chevre wagon.

Nowhere, or in worst case, to a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nSince it seems that I'm the only one who can see this wagon is poor at real arguments, I'm the only one who thinks that many pieces of information having provided by me in my Day 2 posts have been ignored, my growing unwillingness to go on with this discussion is not a surprise. I can fortell that maintaining this topic all I can get are tags like \"VI defense\", \"newbscum gameplay\" and things like those &#8211; regardless of my answers. I can also fortell the forthcoming words as well: \"flailing\", \"WIFOMizing\", \"misrepresenting\". Fankly, I'm sick of this phenomena. (It also exists in IRL Mafia games but, there a Day phase like this lasts for 3 minutes tops.)<br>\n<br>\nLet me expain it by elaborating one single thing.

Eg: thinking Reinoe, Chevre and Evilpacman are scum.<br>\n(4) Started an argument with Antihero in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6004699#p6004699\">630</a>.<br>\n<br>\nFor me, something seems to be logical. If I were Chevre's scum partner<br>\n(1) I wouldn't have voted for him so as to put him on L&#8211;1.<br>\n(2) I would have jumped off the wagon after his summary (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000236#p6000236\">588</a>), simply saying something like \"hmmm... I'm not sure about this wagon right now\". (Hint who were the players who had jumped off that wagon?)<br>\n(3) I could have put back my vote on Reinoe after this post of him: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6000434#p6000434\">593</a> (so as to let you call me a stubborn player), or as a worst case scenario change my vote to Antihero as our argue started (to gain an OMGUSnewb tag or something like that).<br>\n<br>\nNone of these things happened. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, if you are having an interest in my wagon, I'm pretty sure that you can \"U&#8211;pipe\" these arguments as well.

You obviously wanted us to be reminded of your emotional crackage and take that into account when judging you. I don't think AtE is scummy because any player is liable to get emotionally invested and their feelings hurt, but I'm confused as to why you've put yourself in such a conspicuous role of leadership if you're so susceptible to breaking down.

Right away, a couple began to pack for the trek to find help, but soon the thunderclouds rolled in. Rain began to slowly drizzle and then shower and finally it began pouring.

No one could sleep that night; everyone was on edge, afraid for their lives. This did not stop another from being picked off. <br>\n<br>\nOne of the guys that took the lead in killing that poor girl seemingly passed out early in the morning in a corner of the cabin, a couple friends around him making sure nothing happened. As the day approached noon, he was still passed out in the corner. The group began to worry and attempted to wake him up. He was cold. He must have gone sometime in the night.

Either one of them (or both of them?) are lying or it's a pure WIFOM produced by the scums and they want us to lynch them sooner or later.<br>\nHowever, the tracking of Chaos is correct: I didn't visit anyone last night. So, noone shall be surprised by this claim: I'm a Vanilla Townie.<br>\n<br>\nJust one more thing about Chaos which might confirm that he's telling the truth. If he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">were</div> a scum, providing a fake-tracking about me would be risky: if I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">had</div> a role with a targetting ability I would know instantly that he's lying!<br>\n<br>\nAlso, something about Don_Johnson. I've tried finding a softclaim by ISO-ing his posts. If he had softclaimed he should have used the letter <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">J</div>, which is really rare in English. It has been easy to check all the J's in his posts but, I have found NOTHING which might have been a softclaim.<br>\nThis means... (1) either the scums were dumb and lucky by Nightkilling them (2) or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">they must have a rolecop</div>! If (2) is true, that may explain why Konowa and Chaos are still alive.<br>\n<br>\nI know that I'm not the smartest player on this forum but I hope that at least the latest bit helps.", "time": "Mon Jul 21, 2014 10:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58243&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "58243"}

The more I think about it the surer I am that the scum team has a Rolecop. That explains the Nightkill of Don_Johnson (the Rolecop must have targetted him at Night1) and the fact that both Konowa and Chaos are still alive. You can read about this in my previous post: I tried to find a softclaim from Don_Johnson and I found nothing. (If there had been a softclaim, the scums might have de-crypted it somehow.)<br>\nAlso, if Chaos were a scum, it would be risky to give a fake-track read since I could have had a town PR and could have caught him lying immediately. If he were a Mafia Tracker how could the scums benefit by <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">publishing</div> his reads? Again, what would happen if he FOUND a town PR for real...? (I mean, in this case he might have tracked Don_Johnson at Night1... but, why did he claimed tracker only to provide NO tracking info afterwards?)<br>\n<br>\nThe latter answer goes for CherryDog as well: I don't think any of the claims are scum.

Anens posting at that point was reading scummy, but so stubborn it could be seen as a townie misreading the game. His content at that point was feeling more towny.

What you were describing in D2 was an action Chevre jumps off Chevre wagon, but I couldn't find the scum motivation for his push on Chevre, as Konowa is pointing out.

That I wouldn't answer your question that I already talked about?  Your opening play this day was manipulative due to the whole \"Anen is town because he didn't visit anyone thus Anti is scum\".

In addition: it's clear that I can't have any night-action PR (by the way, other kinds of PRs would be highly unlikely too, see later) which means I'm expendable as well.<br>\n<br>\nThe logic about why my VT claim was true:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">There are the following possibilities:<br>\n<br>\n(1) Chaos is Town Tracker and I'm VT. Nothing extra-ordinary in this case. I still might have a PR with no night target ability or it might be possible that I didn't use my ability at Night2. In both cases I would stfu and wouldn't tell you that I'm expendable. (Unless I'd be an X-shot Bulletproof but we all wish I were one.)<br>\n<br>\n(2) Chaos is Town Tracker and I'm scum. The original setup is most probably 10:3. (There were no multiple Nightkills and 9:4 would be absurd.) One Mafia Goon is down. Amongst the other two there must be a Rolecop: Don't Nightkill is only logical if they <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">knew</div> who he was or at least they knew that he was targetting someone before. As Bert wrote it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6039164#p6039164\">1016</a>, the standard procedure is that one of the scums performs the Kill while the other one performs the Night Action. In both cases if I were scum, I would have done something and Chaos would have known about it. His \"no action\" read would have been possible only if my scum partner had performed both the Kill and the Targetting. This could be possible if my partner were the Rolecop, but in this case I'd stfu instead of trying rolefishing the scum group. In short, (2) is not entirely impossible but very unlikely.<br>\n<br>\n(3) Chaos is Scum and I'm VT. That's an interesting version. In this case he may be either the Mafia Tracker or the Mafia Rolecop. The sequence of the events could have been the following. Night 1: Chaos tracks Don. Day 2: he claims Tracker and says he tracked Reinoe (there's no way to confirm or contradict this). Night 2: Mafia kills Don (either they knew he was a Jailkeeper or they only knew that he had a PR). Day 3: he makes up his tracking about me. That may be risky <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but</div>, telling that he tracked Don would have been way too suspicious. So, he takes the risk and makes up a name. He's lucky because without having a PR with Night-targetting I can't counterclaim him. I think (1) is more likely than (3) but, the fact that he haven't tracked Konowa yet makes (3) more probable. (If I were a Tracker I'd have been tracked Konowa during Night1. It's still possible that Knowa doesn't perform an action &#8211; though, if the scums indeed have a Rolecop, that's not too likely, see (2)! &#8211; but, as for Millers, a Tracker can get more info about them than a Cop, since the Copread is useless.)<br>\n<br>\n(3/2) Both Konowa and Chaos are scum. A weird idea but it's not impossible. That would explain why didn't he track Konowa and if they bus each other effectively, none of us will consider the un-lynched one out of them after the other one will have flipped scum... or would we? ^_^ By the way, if (3/2) is true my alignment is town, yet again. (There can't be three living scums.)<br>\n<br>\n(4) Both Chaos and I are scum. In this case faking tracking me would be nonsense. We'd know that Konowa's claim was real and he could have lied that he checked Konowa's claim with the tracking (regardless of his real target, Chaos' possible roles if he's scum are detailed under (3)). This version is impossible in practitce, I think, and not only because I would have advised Chaos to track Konowa (or f-ck, anyone else but me). If we were both scum, there could be an investigate role on the town side as well. If a \"real\" town Tracker targetted me later and got a positive result, it would be pretty much game over for us. (See (2) for details, especially the \"one scum Kills, the other one performs the action part.

Sure it may be fake (see my previous post, this post or other players' posts about it) but one thing bothers me considering it fake. Why did he claim on Day2 with tracking Reinoe? Wouldn't it have been easier to wait for Day3? Eg. he could have chosen from more dead players to give away uninformative tracks... He voted on Chevre on Day 1. Even if he didn't give an explanation for that (as far as I saw) it would have made no sense if he were Chevre's partner.<br>\nScumtells: His case on Reinoe on Day1 was shyt. His claim happened in an inappropriate moment, I think. (There was no wagon against him and he provided no info by that.) His jump on the Misaka wagon was awkward. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6036301#p6036301\">980</a>: that's not true. Antihero used to lead a wagon against me but later he abandoned it. There would have been a better track than me, I suppose. What if he tries to buddy me? (Though I can't see any reason for that choice.) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post-edit</div>: Yes, that's it, BroodKing! I haven't wanted to talk about it but a Tracker+Cop+Miller setup would be imbalanced. Yet another thing which makes me think that Chaos's faking. (Why haven't I wanted to post about it? Call me a noob but I thought it would have been town-rolefishing.)<br>\nOthers: The more I read his posts the more I think that he's scum. Still, what if we're wrong? We shouldn't lynch the Tracker in this case. How can I say, I wouldn't suggest lynching him today because the loss might be detrimental. Maybe tomorrow.

He was not on the Chevre wagon but was on the Misaka wagon. His recent turn against Konowa is another FoS. (He voted for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6042545#p6042545\">1047</a> and Chaos followed him in the next post.

His flip-flopping during Day2 (others were talking about that too). <br>\nOthers: By ISO-ing him I've ignored his emotional posts. (I don't know whether it's a mistake.) As for him I'm at a loss.

Re-quoting his own random reads makes no sense as well if he's town. <br>\nOthers: He's aware of his inactivity and \"content-lessness\".

(Though, it can be faked of course.) His votes make sense in general. Mostly <br>\nScumtells: However, sometimes his FoS-es are silly. (Eg. BroodKing). <br>\nOthers: He claimed earlier Miller and Chaos claimed Tracker later. Chaos may also know that a Tracker+Miller+Cop setup could be broken (and a Miller without a Cop seems to be a bit \"bastard\" for me). So, there is a chance that the Miller claim is the fake one. Yet I think Chaos looks scummier. On the other hand, mislynching a Miller is not as bad as mislynching a Tracker.

I personally have played a lot of games in which cops D4 claim, because at that point you have a lot of results that can help town. I tried to make the tone of 1112 more advisory than imperative. At this point, we know that scum have 1KP and maybe a RB depending on how you perceive the events of town. As of now we have 3 blue claims (if a cop claims), and a miller claim. Even in the worst case it takes scum two days to get rid of investigative roles.

All of these show an interest in scumhunting in my eyes.

I don't think I should explain that, no information = no tell.<br>\n(3) Anti-town: trying to find scumtells in my later posts AFTER ignoring my long posts.

Since EPM didn't think that Chaos might buddy-ing him it is possible that both of them are town. There were posts about it why they can't be scum together so this is a minor townread on EPM as well.

I still think he's a possible scum but he's not the first name on my scumlist right now.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">mark</div>: 3&#8211;4<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Antihero</div><br>\nHe's on V/LA, my reads are unchanged.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mark</div>: 3<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Guyett</div><br>\nTowntells: Pushing and hammering Chevre (regardless of that fake-hammer, I consider it as a null). I still don't understand why he voted on me (PoE?) but his vote for Misaka seems legit (that vote from Misaka in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6020810#p6020810\">817</a> was awkward). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6022830#p6022830\">890</a>: I like this (I've realized it just now, ISO-ing everyone.) In general, active scumhunting. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">His recent posts are a bit contentless but still not scummy. Also, he pointed out something in my posts (which was silly).</div><br>\nScumtells: Not many. Maybe the fact that his Vote Analysis-es are long and either uninformative or I don't see the logic in them.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mark</div>: 1 (I think he's the strongest townread of mine now.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Startfromtheheart</div><br>\nTowntells: He may be Bodyguard, according to his claim. but...<br>\nStumtells: Not voting for Chevre! Re-quoting his own random reads make no sense if he's town. He had kept posting (almost) zero content till he got pressurized a bit (...and that wasn't a big pressure!). Than he changed. A Bodyguard claim when we know that we had a Jailkeeper? Plus, performing that claim at a silly moment (revealing a PR when he's way far from lynch?). He admits that he protected Chaos twice? First of all, noone can confirm or \"counter\" that action. Second, eg. in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6022325#p6022325\">870</a> he posted \"Konowa seems town.\" He voted for Konowa only in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6064161#p6064161\">1157</a>. Why didn't he protect Konowa at Night1 or Night2? If Konowa's Miller claim is real he may be a likely target for the Nightkill!<br>\nAlso, his vote was on Chaos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6057599#p6057599\">1120</a>, on Broodking in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6059080#p6059080\">1139</a>, on Konowa in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6064161#p6064161\">1157</a>, on me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6064177#p6064177\">1160</a>. Back to Konowa in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6066644#p6066644\">1174</a>, back to Broodking in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6068543#p6068543\">1191</a>, than me again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6071505#p6071505\">1207</a>. WTF?! It's not only the flip-flopping. He also added many times that \"I'm sure about this\", \"he's 100% scum\" and things like that. It seems that he just wants to find a lynchable player regardless of their alignment.<br>\nAlso, playing the language barrier card against me is a BIG FOS! It would be against the rules to explain it right now but it's FoS in my eyes and being sticked to it is an auto-scum read. <br>\nHe's picking up small bits so as to boost any weak cases without content but with a big noise. This time I'm his target but as we can see it can change anytime, his khm, \"cases\" has short lifespans in general. Eg. I was town according to his reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6068549#p6068549\">1192</a> scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6071505#p6071505\">1207</a> (and he had a scum read on me before...) <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mark</div>: 5+<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Konowa</div><br>\nTowntells: Yes, an instant Miller claim is one of the possible gameplays. (Though, it can be faked of course.) His votes make sense in general. <br>\nScumtells: He ignored my long posts and started to scumread me, but, right after the Chaos wagon seemed to be stopped. Again, no real case against me.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mark</div>: 4</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nIn general, I think the global town attitude is greatly affected by the scums.<br>\nIt's <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">possible</div> if you don't believe my logic about proving that I'm town but, it <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">would have been</div> okay <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">only</div> if any of you had pointed out holes in my logic. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It has never happened.</div>.<br>\nIt's <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">okay</div> to ignore both my post about my alignment and my questions, reads, ideas.

I get that it can come off as scummy, but it really was more of a misunderstanding of mechanics and getting a little too excited over my read. Now as for your concern over my actions on day 1 I will break it down for you a little more clearly. I was feeling that Reinoe was being scummy especially because he was jumping around a lot on his stances and it was coming off weird to me but I still leaned towards the idea that Chevre was scum as well. When I saw that no one was exactly seeing my points that Reinoe was scum I decided to back off and go after Chevre because my hopes were to then track Reinoe during the night phase and find evidence that he was scum afterall which I could then use to push for a quick lynch against him in day 2. That's why I switched so quickly but did not explain it much is because I was hoping to use my PR role to help my case in the second day.", "time": "Sat Aug 02, 2014 6:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58243&start=1250", "forum": "53", "thread": "58243"}

They had decided it would be best for them to all go as one large group, instead of splitting up and causing excess risk with this killer out there. There were a couple opposed to this trek outside, they figured with all this talk of risk, why are they risking their lives against the elements AND a killer now? Most of these complaints were just grumbles, nothing really of note, until one stood up and explained how bad of an idea this was. No one listened to him, he was ignored and the group continued with the preparations.<br>\n<br>\nThis one rebel got more and more frustrated with these people he once considered friends and decided to take matters into his own hands. He wanted to prove to them how dangerous it was outside. He grabbed his jacket and some thicker boots and stomped outside, making sure everyone heard his rage. The ground was slick, mud had formed everywhere. He nearly slipped and fell multiple times as he head out towards the trail that lead the teens to the cabin. He stopped near the broken down cars, and raised his arms in the air. <br>\n<br>\n\"See how stupid this is? You people won't make it a mile before one of you breaks something!\" He yelled, his voice barely audible over the clattering of the rain.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the vehicles began to noticeably shift in the mud. The ground had softened and moved enough that heavier objects were slipping quickly. As the man yelled, the teens motioned for him to get out of the way, yelling and screaming for him to move. A couple ran to get him before the car struck the teen down. The car had picked up speed now, the rear coming towards him, possibly enough to run him down. Before the others could save him, the teen finally noticed the vehicle barrelling towards him and jumped out of the way, being clipped by the corner of the car and falling to the ground. The front tire of the car pinned his legs, his face towards the ground. He tried to yell, but the muddy water had risen and filled his mouth. The ones that tried to save him stood staring momentarily, before rushing to help him. Moving the car would only mangle this kids leg more, but he was drowning. The teens all pushed the car as hard as they could, finally getting it off his leg. They carried him inside and set him in the middle of the living area.

{"number": 1434, "id": "6130291", "user": "evilpacman18", "user_id": "14166", "content": "I'm starting with reading up on Konowa's interactions with everyone who's still alive.<br>\n<br>\nI'm kind of a blank slate but I'm leaning towards Guyett and/or sthar. I really think Cheery Dog is town, because of both his posting today and because of the way Chevre and Konowa both went after him from D1. I think Guyett - whose VCA is really important to his reads in general - missing this is pretty incriminating. Hopefully that read doesn't seem defensive, there's not really precedent for much of anything in my ISO but as far as it goes, I think I have been leaning scum on him the entire game. I sort of let it go when FG and Anti were letting him go, and because I really didn't care about anything while Konowa was left alive for no reason. Aneninen is a ?<br>\n<br>\nI think Konowa and Chevre's ISOs and VC history offer all the proof anyone should need that Boonskiies/Cheery was decidedly not scum. Chevre near the end of D1 looks like he was just trying to be on whatever the most likely counterwagon to his lynch was gonna be. Konowa and Chevre both had turns on the Boonskiies wagon. I notice in the D1 vote counts too that Konowa tends to be just a few steps behind either Chevre or Guyett for basically the entire day.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5983998#p5983998\">190</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5984013#p5984013\">192</a> are interesting. Time-wise they're super close together and they're both responses to particular posts, but in 192, Konowa addresses Guyett's 179. It's random because the intent of those two very close together posts is otherwise completely conversational, and it's an oddly specific quote that he picks out to talk about, it just seems to me like he's trying to be in conversation with Guyett.<br>\nAnen remains a ?, Konowa's ISO is unhelpful in that regard but I think that's a good thing.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6068023#p6068023\">1187</a> is valuable, I normally wouldn't read something like \"Guy has been obvtown all game\" as something one scumbuddy would say to another scumbuddy (from Konowa's point of view, here) but I noticed in I think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6041936#p6041936\">1035</a> that Konowa seemed pretty submissive to Guy. Like he expresses in multiple posts that he doesn't understand peoples' reasoning, but it's only with Guyett that he asks for help understanding (\"what am I missing?\"), rather than acting smarter than/coachy to the other person (compare with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6042121#p6042121\">1042</a> for instance, \"you're being too gullible\").<br>\nOn Brood/sthar, Konowa's ISO is also fairly unhelpful.<br>\n<br>\nSo right now scum-&gt;town I've got Guyett, sthar, Anen, Cheery<br>\nChevre's ISO is next", "time": "Tue Aug 19, 2014 11:12 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58243&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "58243"}

Each being taken out in a new, inventive way, and totally not a rip off of other people's ideas. 7 teens dropped to 6 when the group got nervous about the food being served, paranoid the one who cooked spiked the eggs. They turned savage on him feeding him every last egg they had. As it turned out, someone got to the eggs before they were even cooked. Now at 6 teens, the group sat awake at night, no one sleeping. This went on for 2 nights, no sleep, everyone too afraid to leave the cabin in fear of the storm picking up again. It had turned to only a light drizzle now. One teen got fed up with the no sleep and grabbed the bottle of sleeping pills one of the dead members had in their pack, crushing them up and spiking the drinking water. He waited until everyone had a drink of it before finally he had some himself, sure that everyone would be asleep and they would be safe. He was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">dead</div> wrong (he was stabbed in the face that night).<br>\n<br>\nNow down to 5 left, the remaining members decided it was time to brave the outside world. Exiting the cabin, they noticed the rain picking up slightly as they trekked up the road. They all kept their distance from one another, constantly checking around, making sure no one was going to stab them or kill them in some other super creative way. The storm picked up even more half way to the neighbour's cabin. The road became slick yet again, a stream running beside the road picked up in speed, the volume of water rose, encroaching on the road. One girl stumbled on a loose rock, falling into the guy in front of her. He immediately turned around, forcefully shoving her away. She stumbled backwards now, falling into the stream, hitting her head off of a rock on the bottom. She began to float in the stream, while the one who pushed her began yelling about how she tried to push him in, how she was going to kill him. The teens did nothing to save this girl.<br>\n<br>\nFinally after the long trek in the storm, they reached the neighbours cabin only to find it empty. They all began to search the place, looking for a landline, or any form of communication with the outside world. Once the reconvened in the common space, they realized the place had nothing. It had been a loss. They decided to stay here for the night, hoping the storm would lighten up by morning so they could head to the next place. Of course, someone didn't make it through the night. They all had the 'bright' idea of splitting up and staying in different rooms. Well in the morning, they found one cabinmate chopped up and a piece in each of their rooms.<br>\n<br>\nNow only 3 left. The yelling began. They all screamed and went at each other for hours, the fighting went into the night and back into the day again. Shoving and pushing each other around until finally someone snapped. He shoved the last girl left and she stumbled backwards, falling onto the hardwood floor. He stood over her and with a disgusted look on his face he took out the last of his rage, thinking she had to be the killer, he killed her first.<br>\n<br>\nStanding above him after he finished killing the poor girl was the only other teen left. <br>\n<br>\n\"Good Choice\" the other teen said...</fieldset></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">evilpacman18, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Town</div>, has been lynched on Day 6.<br>\nsthar8, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Town</div>, has been endgamed.</div><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:magenta\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MAFIA HAVE WON.<br>\n<br>\nCongratulations Chevre, Guyett, and Konowa!

Also, congratulations to the scum team, you had a great gamelplay!<br>\n<br>\nI've learnt something important.<br>\nAfter Chaos had revealed his investigation on me, I tried to collect a lot of data about everything. As you can see now, I was telling the truth, even if some of you didn't believe me. The main problem was the following. I was waiting for someone who might actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">use</div> my data, I tried to start discussions about everything instead of figuring out something useful out of the things I had collected. I had the opportunity to hammer Konowa earlier but, instead of doing it I watched his wagon dissolving into nothingness and in the end of the Day I was on the Riddleton wagon &#8211; which I consider the most terrible wagon of the game as I look back now.<br>\nNext Day I was V/LA because I was on holiday, so I missed the Konowa lynch. But, the worst part of my gameplay was Day5. I was reading the game 'till the cows came home and I decided many times that I would ISO everyone, I would post more... after all, I had all the information collected, I only would have had to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">use</div> them! Still, I did nothing but watched the Day ending &#8211; though, by that time everyone was sure that I was town. That was the THIRD time when I simply failed to do anything at the end of the Day. I had the opportunity to solve the game and I did nothing.<br>\nIt's no surprise that Bipolar made a jigsaw puzzle out of my corpse (lololol!), as if he had said \"Aneninen, pull yourself together\".<br>\nSuch a gameplay was unacceptable.", "time": "Sat Aug 23, 2014 8:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58243&start=1475", "forum": "53", "thread": "58243"}
