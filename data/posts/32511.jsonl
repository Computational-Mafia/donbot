The king had died without an heir, which had never happened in the history of this land. The royal advisor, the late king's right hand, sat in the now empty court, wondering how he would deal with this situation. He realized the lords of each realm in the kingdom would soon begin to lay claims to the throne. Most of them, he knew, would loyally give allegiance to whoever the advisor chose, but others would not be so easily appeased. Some would seek to eliminate the competition - violently.<br>\n<br>\nTo avoid a civil war, he invited each of them to a private council at the palace. As the last lord arrived, the gates were sealed and the last of the guards took their place along the wall. None remained inside, save for the advisor and 14 lords of Bayoth. The council would begin at dawn.<br>\n<br>\nThe following morning, the advisor woke to sounds of shouting in the courtyard. One of the lords had been murdered in the night, and now there remained only 13. Before a king could be chosen, the murderers would need to be caught. </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">This game is currently in <div style=\"display:inline;color:magenta\">END GAME.</div></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Playerlist:</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">*denotes a prod</div>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\">\n<li>Guyett<br>\n</li><li>Matias <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Wake88</div><br>\n</li><li>Jingle*<br>\n</li><li>Dessew<br>\n</li><li>Green Crayons<br>\n</li><li>yessiree<br>\n</li><li>emogirl123<br>\n</li><li>Slandaar<br>\n</li><li>Hermy<br>\n</li><li>Klazam<br>\n</li><li>Paschendale<br>\n</li><li>Nominull<br>\n</li><li>Abhorsen</li></ol>\n\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Guyett<br>\nMatias<br>\nJingle<br>\nDessew<br>\nGreen Crayons<br>\nyessiree<br>\nemogirl123<br>\nSlandaar<br>\nNominull</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Hermy, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div><br>\nPaschendale, <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Mafia Roleblocker</div><br>\nKlazam, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div><br>\nAbhorsen, <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Mafia Godfather</div></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rules</div></div><br>\n* Stolen from Equinox &lt;3 (and bits/pieces from other awesome mods)*<br>\n<br>\nAll rules listed in the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Boilerplate%20Mafiascum%20Game%20Rules\">Boilerplate Mafiascum Game Rules</a> page apply to this game except where contradicted in the additional rules below, in which case the following rules will take precedence:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Game-play:</div>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">Blue</div></div> is reserved for the moderator.

In a manner that usually hurts town. And you probably don't use cases to convince town to see things your way. Regardless, you've spent way too long talking about how you're not a bad player and not enough time talking about the game.

He senses that people are overanalyzing something he has done. His earlier post that yessiree jumped is indeed innocent, however he shows a conscious decision to remove his vote off of paschendale and move it onto emogirl to appeal to the thread. As he is getting more and more overanalysis from green crayons and yessiree, he posted <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416455#p5416455\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> as a response to everyone overanalyzing.

He does explain this as he labeled me as jumpy. His argument for forced posting is also a good point as I was making bad posts.

I will note, however, that I don't think that that post is particularly important in and of itself -- at the time, I found Klazam's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416455#p5416455\" class=\"postlink\">reaction</a> <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416468#p5416468\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a> more off putting.  (And as of now Klazam has sort of dropped off my radar, though I was uneasy with his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416974#p5416974\" class=\"postlink\">potential buddying</a>.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyways:<br>\n<br>\nI personally look for some reason to vote for someone during the RVS, even though it's going to be pretty flimsy as an early vote.  I know most people don't do this, and I don't hold it against them -- nor do I typically share my reasoning, because I don't find it to be particularly helpful.  It is, after all, the RVS, and my \"reason\" is usually not a very good one.  It just makes me feel better to know that I'm voting based on something more than pure randomness.<br>\n<br>\nSo, when someone puts out a reason for a RVS that's not an obvious joke, I take it to be a sign that they want to share with the class a reason that has moved beyond a \"lolRVS\" basis -- even if it is pretty flimsy.<br>\n<br>\nThe posting-after-being-called-out justification for Klazam's vote is not on the same level as \"scum found, discuss\" or \"my role pm says he's scum\" as you suggested earlier.  It's an attempt to justify a vote based on the (very) limited information at that stage of the game, and just because that justification will be naturally weak (due to the limited information available) does not mean it is a \"joke.\"  Therefore, even though it was a Page 1 vote, Klazam wanted everyone to know that his first vote for paschendale was justified not solely based on RVS, but also in part on \"confirming right after being called out on &lt;being late to confirm.&gt;\"", "time": "Tue Oct 29, 2013 9:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32511&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "32511"}

As this is his first post, we need to wait and see if he still maintains neutrality throughout all of his accusations.<br>\n<br>\nklazam (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416415#p5416415\" class=\"postlink\">40</a>): Interesting play here. He senses that people are overanalyzing something he has done. His earlier post that yessiree jumped is indeed innocent, however he shows a conscious decision to remove his vote off of paschendale and move it onto emogirl to appeal to the thread. As he is getting more and more overanalysis from green crayons and yessiree, he posted <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416455#p5416455\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> as a response to everyone overanalyzing. I believe this was out of place.<br>\n<br>\ndessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416484#p5416484\" class=\"postlink\">49</a>): This seems like an opportunistic vote as I previously voted for two people without offering much insight. He does explain this as he labeled me as jumpy. His argument for forced posting is also a good point as I was making bad posts. In response to this, I wanted to see how serious he was about the vote by <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416503#p5416503\" class=\"postlink\">escalating</a> the issue. He did not take his accusations seriously after this point and allows abhorsen to take over the attack. This <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416683#p5416683\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> was weak.<br>\n<br>\nabhorsen (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416543#p5416543\" class=\"postlink\">59</a>): This was a good post to pressure emogirl and extract more information. I thought his intent was obvious when he mentioned squirm. Yessiree's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416552#p5416552\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> does not take into account the fact that abhorsen is just trying to extract information even though he did the same thing on klazam earlier. I assume this is ignorance. This <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416727#p5416727\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> clearly shows that abhorsen's intent changed from pressure into an actual vote without any basis other than a weak personality read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Note that the discussions that occured between these two posts were not game related.

He got an <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416768#p5416768\" class=\"postlink\">answer</a>, but did not respond directly, but you can see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418686#p5418686\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> that he dropped the accusation of being jumpy. Note how this was done way after when the bandwagon lost steam.<br>\n<br>\nyessiree (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416815#p5416815\" class=\"postlink\">138</a>): Vote based on weak personality reads based on guyett not taking a stance and his neutrality and no attempt to find scum. No real pushes in convincing thread to lynch. Just claiming a personal stance and defending it. Clears abhorsen for suspecting guyett, which is his target. No further detail specified other than \"the exchange\" for why abhorsen seems town, leaves open to interpretion.<br>\n<br>\ngreen crayons (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416840#p5416840\" class=\"postlink\">142</a>): This post is meant to appear logical and appeal to emogirl's request on why post 34 warranted a vote.

Takes the opposite stance. Town reads based on weak reasoning. Does not appear to be a strong push towards abhorsen, but it was strong towards the change of momentum. Expected behaviour as bandwagon on emogirl was weak and bound to meet resistance. Null read as it is possible for scum to take advantage of situation as well. Reasonable questioning of yessiree's stance on guyett as yessiree did not make a strong push. <br>\n<br>\nyessiree (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416996#p5416996\" class=\"postlink\">150</a>): Aggro towards everyone not sharing the same point of view as him playstyle. This tends to lean town than scum for most players. Weak read. Reasonable but weak <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5417563#p5417563\" class=\"postlink\">push</a> to defend his point of view.<br>\n<br>\npaschendale (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5417777#p5417777\" class=\"postlink\">166</a>): Strong push towards abhorsen. Town read on klazam and emogirl comes naturally with the strong push for abhorsen. Support yet no push for guyett lends to why he claimed yessiree is town.<br>\n<br>\ndessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418686#p5418686\" class=\"postlink\">174</a>): Reading this post makes my head hurt for some reason. I'm not sure what stance he is taking there. I mentioned earlier that he did not mention \"emogirl is jumpy\" anymore after a post explaining the motives for emogirl's voting pattern during RVS. This post feels neutral more than anything supporting both abhorsen and emogirl.<br>\n<br>\nslandaar (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418717#p5418717\" class=\"postlink\">176</a>): This post explains <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5417605#p5417605\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>. Makes an accusation that town don't assume players are bad for making a bad read. Strongly disagree with this. The rest of the post is trival. He states that he votes first, reason later. Null read.<br>\n<br>\ndessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418736#p5418736\" class=\"postlink\">177</a>): This is a bad read with no reasoning.<br>\n<br>\nklazam (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418806#p5418806\" class=\"postlink\">178</a>): I disagree with this. Being logical is part of the game, not indicative of your alliance.<br>\n<br>\nguyett (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418846#p5418846\" class=\"postlink\">180</a>): I don't see your town push towards dessew. I just don't see it. the push for yessireeh was weak considering how that was your vote. Your stance currently is to piggyback on the abhorsen wagon, while your personal stance is to town-read your defender dessew, and vote your attacker yessiree. I like the green crayons read, that is the only thing I like about this post. However just to note, in your list of town to scum read, you placed slandaar as more scum and green crayons as more town. This contradicts what you claimed earlier in this post where slandaar is slight scum lean, whereas green crayons is a decent scum lean. From your arguments for both players, it is obvious that green crayons is above slaandar.<br>\n<br>\nnominull (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419330#p5419330\" class=\"postlink\">201</a>): Awkward post seems forced. But the accusation is air as well. Purpose is to defend why he has been under the radar and not a scum being under the radar. He has said nothing groundbreaking up to that point and nothing has changed. This post was a result of directly being addressed. Which is why it's awkward.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">yessiree and Guyett needs to direct their attention elsewhere temporarily. their interaction now consists of \"no u read my shit\", \"no u\" and it doesn't tell us much anymore. if you didn't convince anyone to start the bandwagon on each other, it's not going to start. contribute elsewhere and come back to this later. this is especially true for yessiree as he did not provide any insight into players other than guyett recently</div><br>\n<br>\ndessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419615#p5419615\" class=\"postlink\">213</a>): I previously thought you were being neutral. Now I see that you are just blindly pushing for a lynch based on blind gut feelings. If I didn't think you were a bad player, this would set off alarms for me to lynch you for not actively finding scum.<br>\n<br>\nnominull (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419789#p5419789\" class=\"postlink\">217</a>): This depends whether or not hermy comes back into the thread. Null read for now. Lynching hermy for great info about emogirl is weak. Concluding hermy has a high chance of flipping scum after 2 posts and using that as a reason for his vote is weak. It could be him mentioning how it has aditional benefits if hermy indeed flips scum. Seems like just stating the obvious.<br>\n<br>\ngreen crayons (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5420135#p5420135\" class=\"postlink\">224</a>): wtf?<br>\n<br>\nnominull (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5420142#p5420142\" class=\"postlink\">225</a>): ??? you used she she she 3 times. Are you trying to say \"if emogirl stays in the wagon and hermy turns up scum, then it looks good for emogirl?\"<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Solid Reads</div><br>\n<br>\nGuyett's post 180 was forced out of him by the thread dynamic. As he can no longer maintain his under the radar behaviour as several major players are starting to suspect him, he is forced to change his image resulting in the post. Taking advantage of yessiree's weak push, he retaliates with a similar weak push towards yessiree while encouraging the rest of the team to instead go for abhorsen. This is consistent with his neutral image.<br>\n<br>\nGreen Crayons hops aboard the hermy wagon. It is easy to agree with as hermy is currently inactive and made two shit posts. Everyone hates on an inactive who bandwagons. He displays a facade of being helpful yet none of his does not go into much detail unless prodded. I don't see how green crayons is contributing to the town.<br>\n<br>\nHermy overall is a good lynch by default if we do not come to a consensus, but I feel uneasy with a lynch on someone based on two posts.<br>\n<br>\nAbhorsen is a good lynch for all of the reasons posted in the thread already. This lynch would provide us with the most information regarding associations in the game's current state.<br>\n<br>\nYessiree's aggro is in line with his entrance to the game.<br>\n<br>\nDessew doesn't seem like a good lynch. Focused on a player after the bandwagon has cooled down is town trait, whereas scum trait is to take advantage of the situation and hop wagons to abhorsen.<br>\n<br>\nSeveral things need to happen. Guyett needs to post more, Green Crayons needs to still post rather than wait for a response from Hermy, Hermy needs to come back, Abhorsen needs to post something, Yessiree needs to stop talking to guyett for a page or two, Dessew needs to become better at this game.<br>\n<br>\nNo one else was interesting.", "time": "Tue Oct 29, 2013 12:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32511&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "32511"}

I like his reads list and his ISO response to yes makes a lot of sense to me. <br>\n<br>\nOn Wake- his claim is awful, but I'm inclined to believe it for now. If he is still alive after it would have been used I may reconsider, but I'm going to assume he's town until something else convinces me otherwise. I shouldn't need to say this, but just in case, NOBODY ELSE CLAIM.<br>\n<br>\nOn Nom- This reads exactly the same as Nom-town from my newbie. He's incredibly scummy, but in that game it drew out a lot of discussion. Hopefully the discussion here is more successful. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Pasch- is he actually townie looking as scum? If so, I'm fairly sure on my townread.</div><br>\n<br>\nOn Emo-I'm firmly on the fence here. The rolefishing seems joking. She asks questions of most of the town. Her worry in 137, while probably not relevant, sounds very sincere. On the other hand, she's not very willing to answer other player's questions and a lot of what she posts is fluff. On the plus side, she's active enough that I'm sure better reads will come with time.<br>\n<br>\nDess, Klazam, and Pasch are going to require more thought. <br>\n<br>\nHerms is ringing lurkerscum bells in my head, but we're early enough that that is probably untrue. Slandaar also needs to post more, but I liked his more recent posts. We'll see.<br>\n<br>\nI've already addressed Ab, and don't have much to add to that front.<br>\n<br>\nYes seems suspicious to me. He criticizes Guyett for not reading the thread, then seems to misunderstand many of Guy's posts.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not really devoting the time to this thread that I should, but until I'm able to get a better handle on people I'm going to sheep Guy.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: yessiree</span><br>\n<br>\nSleeping now, reading again and hopefully being useful tomorrow afternoon.<br>\n<br>\nPEdit: No we can't confirm the claim tonight, but if Wake survives then he should be fairly easy to sort on D3. He is definitely not the only member of the scumteam. Also, ask yourself, why would scum fakeclaim D1 with almost 0 pressure. It makes no sense, as he is now in the middle of the town's thoughts. Also, a tracker can easily confirm or deny his claim and scum wouldn't know if town has power roles.

{"number": 270, "id": "5422297", "user": "Guyett", "user_id": "21810", "content": "First one. Have you played with Yessiree before? have you seen his town game. Have you seen his scum game? Players on this site such as JasonWazza and Wisdom are very aggressive players regardless of playstyle. If you want a bit of light reading I would suggest having a look at newbie 1390. It was my first game on the site but it features a pretty aggro JasonWazza who flips scum in the end. As for blindly fixating on the target I believe this is called Death Tunneling. Both scum and town do this. Wisdom and Saki for example both do this. Regarding the \"all support being lost\" well if they keep pushing and probing the person on the other end of the death tunnel could get frustrated or annoyed and do something anti town. Scum can then jump on this. So I would not rule out Scum Yessiree because yuo think scum can't be aggro and death tunnel.<br>\n<br>\nDessew doesn't seem like a good lynch... well as I currently think he is town of course he is not a good lynch. Scum will keep focusing on a player as much as town. Both scum and town take advantage of situations and hop on wagons so that is a null tell. The timing of these hops to wagons is what is most telling. Also if the hop is to an obvious mislynch then scum might stay on their previous target stating that the new target is town and people are making a mistake so that when the mislynch occurs and they flip town the scum can get nice town cred and swing the towns attention back to the earlier target.<br>\n<br>\nDoes that help?", "time": "Tue Oct 29, 2013 10:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32511&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "32511"}

Still, Nom comes out slightly scummy at worst, and there are definitely better candidates.  It's possible that it's just a slow start.<br>\n<br>\nI see no reason to doubt Wake's claim at this juncture.  It's reckless move, but it doesn't really change anything.

He's backing Emogirl completely into a corner.  I could absolutely see her actions as noobishly defending her scumpartner.  &lt;&lt; This is, of course, if Yessiree flips scum, so it's just speculation for the moment.

All you have to do is read the thread and see that yes's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416552#p5416552\" class=\"postlink\">Post 62</a> was talking about Abhorsen's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416543#p5416543\" class=\"postlink\">Post 59</a>, and there you have the answers.  Because of the obviousness of these answers, yes's response was fairly non-substantive (e.g., <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416577#p5416577\" class=\"postlink\">Post 70</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416592#p5416592\" class=\"postlink\">Post 77</a>).  Guyett then calls this \"unhelpful and anti-town at best,\" (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418846#p5418846\" class=\"postlink\">Post 180</a>), which is an overblown sentiment.<br>\n<br>\nB.  The third question ostensibly has merit.  But Guyett never follows up on that question.  Guyett instead seizes upon the fact that yes refused to answer the first two questions (which was valid because, as explained above, the answers were obvious).  So instead of clarifying his valid question, Guyett exploits yes's blanket response to suggest that yes is failing to respond despite the fact that yes has responded -- just not to this particular third question.  This exploitation creates a basis for Guyett to excuse his vote on yes, but that basis is completely manufactured.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2.  Other parts of Guyett's case against yes also feel contrived.  Guyett's initial belief that yes's Page 1 criticism was misguided (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416362#p5416362\" class=\"postlink\">Post 33</a>) gets blown into \"push&lt;ing&gt; bullshit lynches\" (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418846#p5418846\" class=\"postlink\">Post 180</a>) and \"an attempt to push an early lynch\" (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5422392#p5422392\" class=\"postlink\">Post 283</a>).  What?  yes's <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Page 1/Page 2</div> suspicion and vote was a push for an early lynch?  Even though yes had already switched his vote a mere two hours later in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416552#p5416552\" class=\"postlink\">Post 62</a>?  It's just a gross mischaracterization that seems sourced to make the \"problem\" of yes's early suspicion of Klazam much more than it is, thereby attempting to validate an overblown suspicion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n3.  I agree more with yes than with Guyett in the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419300#p5419300\" class=\"postlink\">Post 94</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419300#p5419300\" class=\"postlink\">Post 96</a> exchange.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n4.

The other parts have some merit, but are honestly a weak case.  Activity level is a very unreliable way to determine alignment, and not being helpful is honestly pretty unreliable, too.  Plenty of town players act like idiots and assholes.  Often when they feel like their pride has been insulted.  I'm not saying that this is what's happening with Hermy, just that Nominull's case isn't terribly compelling.<br>\n<br>\nLooking back, I see the appeal for pity.  It's stupid.  Hermy, contribute someone if you want anyone to take you seriously.  Whining about how you're no good at this game doesn't make anyone want to keep you around.  If you're as bad as you claim to be, don't just putter around, TRY THINGS.  You'll get better by practicing, not asking for people to just let you fart around and not play.<br>\n<br>\nI definitely can see Nominull or Hermy as scum.

Klazam tried to push for my lynch based on it, which was obviously nonsense.  I don't think that necessarily puts him as scum, I think he's a victim of confirmation bias - he misunderstood my original case on Hermy and ever since then I've been marked as scummy in his head and it's been twisting his perceptions of me.

I'm offering theories, it's frankly ridiculous to say I'm not.  I'm not latching on to anything from anybody else (unlike you, piggybacking off Klazam's weak nonsense. projecting?).  I'm plenty committed, who doesn't know where I stand? I've been pushing Hermy hard.  I've been open and free with my other suspicions as well.

Policy lynches suck- and Hermy is shaping up to be one. It's much better to leave her out there for vigs to take care of, espically now that we know about one. Why do policy lynches suck? Scum and Town are both equally motivated on these. Other lynches can garner associtative tells postflip. Not policy lynches.

The thread dynamic was shifting towards a bandwagon on me due to my play style, and I did not intervene. Notice how I didn't respond to the questions immediately even though I was fully capable of doing so. After a certain amount of votes, I was interested in who would take advantage of the bandwagon by either pushing for or against it, as the bandwagon was weak and a lot of my actual good posts are being skimmed over and a lot of the focus was on the endless banter between everyone in the thread and me.<br>\n<br>\nSince I know my own alignment, and scum feels that I am a relatively easy target to lynch compared to other players, it set the thread up to go from RVS stage, to people making actual accusations. My interest wasn't who would make the accusations, but how they would reanalyze my motives for playing the way I did in the early stages of the game. Jingle pointed this out.<br>\n<br>\nEven you mentioned in your post, I had valid points. It is just among all of the fluff posts, which can easily be undermined or exploited.<br>\n<br>\nWhen questioning guyett and dessew about why they find me scummy, although they have my entire ISO to base off of, they do not post anything other than a glance at the surface of the thread content. If they were to even slow down for a second and notice the change in my tone instead of continuing to explain to the thread that I am an annoying as fuck player and has no original point of view or thoughts and shadow other players, then they would see that they don't even know what they are talking about and would miss the fundamental point of this game.<br>\n<br>\nMy read on you is leaning town only because you didn't have to agree with my case with defending Nom. As a scum, you would continue to undermine of all of my posts, or encourage others to (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5435842#p5435842\" class=\"postlink\">pasch</a>.) instead of pointing out that they indeed make perfect sense and is disguised together with poor posts. Which by the way, is easy for scum to manipulate.<br>\n<br>\nNow why would I do all of this? Because I am a capable enough of a player to play the situation to my advantage and see who is trying to manipulate my posts for a lynch. What is rather annoying is that most votes on me hasn't been anyone actually trying to lynch me with reason. It is just \"oh, emogirl is caught scum that's why she is acting like this\". I have read your reasoning for accusing me and have responded to it multiple times. My problem is with Dessew and Guyett. I already said I town-read dessew because I don't think he is a strong player at all. I'm running on null with Guyett and read his reactions to me as emotional.

I don't care what the site meta might be, it's a scummy move, and making excuses like that just looks like there aren't any real reasons.  88 looks like bullshit to me.  \"Not giving reasons stimulates discussion.\"  The issue is not whether or not good players do this.  The issue is whether or not TOWN players do this.  I don't think they do.  I also don't like the unvote.

She's not contributing information and basically sitting on her ass.  That would be scummy, except that she's not being discreet.  She's not trying to slip by unnoticed.  She's a center of discussion.  So this would be null.  But then, she's acknowledging that she's doing this, and that it is the wrong thing to do.  She's refusing to help.  That makes it lean back towards scum for me.  But this sort of thing is a weak reason.

She's not contributing information and basically sitting on her ass.  That would be scummy, except that she's not being discreet.  She's not trying to slip by unnoticed.  She's a center of discussion.  So this would be null.  But then, she's acknowledging that she's doing this, and that it is the wrong thing to do.  She's refusing to help.  That makes it lean back towards scum for me.  But this sort of thing is a weak reason.  I would much rather pursue someone with stronger evidence for their alignment.<br>\n<br>\nI have not sat on a fence about her at all.

If you find out that something is drinkable, this tells you a lot about whether it's water: you can rule out, for example, the possibility that it's freedom.<br>\n<br>\nI suspect, but don't have time to work out the math and I have learned that math is only for analysis not persuasion anyhow, that saying one member of a pair is \"more informative\" as to the other, in your sense, is equivalent to saying they're the less scummy of the two.

Not using a roleblock would have benn a pity, so he most likely roleblocked but then he couldn't submit the NK if I understand the roles correctly, ergo Sland was roleblocked.

I believe the loss of the roleblocker, Paschendale, was a huge blow to the scum team, but also, that town trusted each other and each claim so closely. I had anticipated the claims to cause serious confusion and paranoia, as well as the false positives for the gunsmith. Another aspect to the quickness of the game came from the mafia choosing to target Jingle two nights in a row. Interestingly enough, I believe it was Dessew, who mused he could be a hider, but quickly discarded that idea. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> I also feel that the activity level of the scum team attributed greatly to town's ability to confirm each other and form a solid town block. <br>\n<br>\nThe mafia, in no way, did badly at all, though. Dessew displayed a convincing town POV (imo) throughout D1/D2. I also particularly liked the way Paschendale handled his read of Abhorsen, and Abhorsen's responses to inquiries. <br>\n<br>\nThe star of the show, by far, is Jingle. He concealed his Hider status and played the D3 options for night actions very well. I'm really proud of him. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> He took the role and made it everything I had envisioned for it. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'd also like to thank my review team: mykonian, JacobSavage and Empking. They put up with my arguing over the balance, but they are wiser than I am, and I should have listened.</div>  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">  Town had a ton of unchecked power. I wasn't expecting the RB to go under so quickly.
