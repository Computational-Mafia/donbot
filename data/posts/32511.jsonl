The king had died without an heir, which had never happened in the history of this land. The royal advisor, the late king's right hand, sat in the now empty court, wondering how he would deal with this situation. He realized the lords of each realm in the kingdom would soon begin to lay claims to the throne. Most of them, he knew, would loyally give allegiance to whoever the advisor chose, but others would not be so easily appeased. Some would seek to eliminate the competition - violently.<br><br>To avoid a civil war, he invited each of them to a private council at the palace. As the last lord arrived, the gates were sealed and the last of the guards took their place along the wall. None remained inside, save for the advisor and 14 lords of Bayoth. The council would begin at dawn.<br><br>The following morning, the advisor woke to sounds of shouting in the courtyard. One of the lords had been murdered in the night, and now there remained only 13. Before a king could be chosen, the murderers would need to be caught. </span><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">This game is currently in <span style=\"color: magenta\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">END GAME.</span></span></span></span></div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Playerlist:</span><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">*denotes a prod</span><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>Guyett</li><li>Matias <strike>Wake88</strike></li><li>Jingle*</li><li>Dessew</li><li>Green Crayons</li><li>yessiree</li><li>emogirl123</li><li>Slandaar</li><li>Hermy</li><li>Klazam</li><li>Paschendale</li><li>Nominull</li><li>Abhorsen</li></ol><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Guyett<br>Matias<br>Jingle<br>Dessew<br>Green Crayons<br>yessiree<br>emogirl123<br>Slandaar<br>Nominull</div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Hermy, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><br>Paschendale, <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Roleblocker</span></span><br>Klazam, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><br>Abhorsen, <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Godfather</span></span></div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Rules</span></span><br>* Stolen from Equinox &lt;3 (and bits/pieces from other awesome mods)*<br><br>All rules listed in the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Boilerplate%20Mafiascum%20Game%20Rules\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Boilerplate Mafiascum Game Rules</a> page apply to this game except where contradicted in the additional rules below, in which case the following rules will take precedence:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Game-play:</span><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li> <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Blue</span></span></span> is reserved for the moderator.

In a manner that usually hurts town. And you probably don't use cases to convince town to see things your way. Regardless, you've spent way too long talking about how you're not a bad player and not enough time talking about the game.

Abhorsen basically posted my case on emogirl (I thought my reasons were obvious, as it turned out, they weren't.) It's good enough for me to give her towncred. And yes, that was the case, there were two finished pages, for God's sake. And what's the problem with pushing the lynch of someone whose wagon you're on? If you wagon without the intent to lynch or without pretending to have the intent to lynch, the wagon does nothing, as far as I know.

He senses that people are overanalyzing something he has done. His earlier post that yessiree jumped is indeed innocent, however he shows a conscious decision to remove his vote off of paschendale and move it onto emogirl to appeal to the thread. As he is getting more and more overanalysis from green crayons and yessiree, he posted <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416455#p5416455\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> as a response to everyone overanalyzing. I believe this was out of place.<br><br>dessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416484#p5416484\" class=\"postlink\">49</a>): This seems like an opportunistic vote as I previously voted for two people without offering much insight. He does explain this as he labeled me as jumpy. His argument for forced posting is also a good point as I was making bad posts. In response to this, I wanted to see how serious he was about the vote by <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416503#p5416503\" class=\"postlink\">escalating</a> the issue. He did not take his accusations seriously after this point and allows abhorsen to take over the attack.

I thought his intent was obvious when he mentioned squirm. Yessiree's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416552#p5416552\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> does not take into account the fact that abhorsen is just trying to extract information even though he did the same thing on klazam earlier. I assume this is ignorance. This <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416727#p5416727\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> clearly shows that abhorsen's intent changed from pressure into an actual vote without any basis other than a weak personality read."}

I will note, however, that I don't think that that post is particularly important in and of itself -- at the time, I found Klazam's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416455#p5416455\" class=\"postlink\">reaction</a> <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416468#p5416468\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a> more off putting.  (And as of now Klazam has sort of dropped off my radar, though I was uneasy with his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416974#p5416974\" class=\"postlink\">potential buddying</a>.)<br><br><br>Anyways:<br><br>I personally look for some reason to vote for someone during the RVS, even though it's going to be pretty flimsy as an early vote.  I know most people don't do this, and I don't hold it against them -- nor do I typically share my reasoning, because I don't find it to be particularly helpful.  It is, after all, the RVS, and my \"reason\" is usually not a very good one.  It just makes me feel better to know that I'm voting based on something more than pure randomness.<br><br>So, when someone puts out a reason for a RVS that's not an obvious joke, I take it to be a sign that they want to share with the class a reason that has moved beyond a \"lolRVS\" basis -- even if it is pretty flimsy.<br><br>The posting-after-being-called-out justification for Klazam's vote is not on the same level as \"scum found, discuss\" or \"my role pm says he's scum\" as you suggested earlier.  It's an attempt to justify a vote based on the (very) limited information at that stage of the game, and just because that justification will be naturally weak (due to the limited information available) does not mean it is a \"joke.\"  Therefore, even though it was a Page 1 vote, Klazam wanted everyone to know that his first vote for paschendale was justified not solely based on RVS, but also in part on \"confirming right after being called out on &lt;being late to confirm.&gt;\""}

He senses that people are overanalyzing something he has done. His earlier post that yessiree jumped is indeed innocent, however he shows a conscious decision to remove his vote off of paschendale and move it onto emogirl to appeal to the thread. As he is getting more and more overanalysis from green crayons and yessiree, he posted <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416455#p5416455\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> as a response to everyone overanalyzing. I believe this was out of place.<br><br>dessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416484#p5416484\" class=\"postlink\">49</a>): This seems like an opportunistic vote as I previously voted for two people without offering much insight. He does explain this as he labeled me as jumpy. His argument for forced posting is also a good point as I was making bad posts. In response to this, I wanted to see how serious he was about the vote by <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416503#p5416503\" class=\"postlink\">escalating</a> the issue. He did not take his accusations seriously after this point and allows abhorsen to take over the attack.

I thought his intent was obvious when he mentioned squirm. Yessiree's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416552#p5416552\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> does not take into account the fact that abhorsen is just trying to extract information even though he did the same thing on klazam earlier. I assume this is ignorance. This <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416727#p5416727\" class=\"postlink\">post</a> clearly shows that abhorsen's intent changed from pressure into an actual vote without any basis other than a weak personality read.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Note that the discussions that occured between these two posts were not game related.

He got an <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416768#p5416768\" class=\"postlink\">answer</a>, but did not respond directly, but you can see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418686#p5418686\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> that he dropped the accusation of being jumpy.

No real pushes in convincing thread to lynch. Just claiming a personal stance and defending it. Clears abhorsen for suspecting guyett, which is his target. No further detail specified other than \"the exchange\" for why abhorsen seems town, leaves open to interpretion.<br><br>green crayons (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416840#p5416840\" class=\"postlink\">142</a>): This post is meant to appear logical and appeal to emogirl's request on why post 34 warranted a vote. Expected behaviour, weak push, null read.<br><br>klazam (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416974#p5416974\" class=\"postlink\">147</a>): Offical end of bandwagon on emogirl. Takes the opposite stance. Town reads based on weak reasoning. Does not appear to be a strong push towards abhorsen, but it was strong towards the change of momentum. Expected behaviour as bandwagon on emogirl was weak and bound to meet resistance. Null read as it is possible for scum to take advantage of situation as well. Reasonable questioning of yessiree's stance on guyett as yessiree did not make a strong push. <br><br>yessiree (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416996#p5416996\" class=\"postlink\">150</a>): Aggro towards everyone not sharing the same point of view as him playstyle.

Town read on klazam and emogirl comes naturally with the strong push for abhorsen.

I'm not sure what stance he is taking there. I mentioned earlier that he did not mention \"emogirl is jumpy\" anymore after a post explaining the motives for emogirl's voting pattern during RVS. This post feels neutral more than anything supporting both abhorsen and emogirl.<br><br>slandaar (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418717#p5418717\" class=\"postlink\">176</a>): This post explains <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5417605#p5417605\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>. Makes an accusation that town don't assume players are bad for making a bad read. Strongly disagree with this. The rest of the post is trival. He states that he votes first, reason later. Null read.<br><br>dessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418736#p5418736\" class=\"postlink\">177</a>): This is a bad read with no reasoning.<br><br>klazam (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418806#p5418806\" class=\"postlink\">178</a>): I disagree with this. Being logical is part of the game, not indicative of your alliance.<br><br>guyett (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418846#p5418846\" class=\"postlink\">180</a>): I don't see your town push towards dessew. I just don't see it. the push for yessireeh was weak considering how that was your vote. Your stance currently is to piggyback on the abhorsen wagon, while your personal stance is to town-read your defender dessew, and vote your attacker yessiree. I like the green crayons read, that is the only thing I like about this post. However just to note, in your list of town to scum read, you placed slandaar as more scum and green crayons as more town. This contradicts what you claimed earlier in this post where slandaar is slight scum lean, whereas green crayons is a decent scum lean. From your arguments for both players, it is obvious that green crayons is above slaandar.<br><br>nominull (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419330#p5419330\" class=\"postlink\">201</a>): Awkward post seems forced. But the accusation is air as well. Purpose is to defend why he has been under the radar and not a scum being under the radar. He has said nothing groundbreaking up to that point and nothing has changed. This post was a result of directly being addressed. Which is why it's awkward.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">yessiree and Guyett needs to direct their attention elsewhere temporarily. their interaction now consists of \"no u read my shit\", \"no u\" and it doesn't tell us much anymore. if you didn't convince anyone to start the bandwagon on each other, it's not going to start. contribute elsewhere and come back to this later. this is especially true for yessiree as he did not provide any insight into players other than guyett recently</span><br><br>dessew (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419615#p5419615\" class=\"postlink\">213</a>): I previously thought you were being neutral. Now I see that you are just blindly pushing for a lynch based on blind gut feelings. If I didn't think you were a bad player, this would set off alarms for me to lynch you for not actively finding scum.<br><br>nominull (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419789#p5419789\" class=\"postlink\">217</a>): This depends whether or not hermy comes back into the thread. Null read for now. Lynching hermy for great info about emogirl is weak. Concluding hermy has a high chance of flipping scum after 2 posts and using that as a reason for his vote is weak. It could be him mentioning how it has aditional benefits if hermy indeed flips scum. Seems like just stating the obvious.<br><br>green crayons (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5420135#p5420135\" class=\"postlink\">224</a>): wtf?<br><br>nominull (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5420142#p5420142\" class=\"postlink\">225</a>): ??? you used she she she 3 times. Are you trying to say \"if emogirl stays in the wagon and hermy turns up scum, then it looks good for emogirl?\"<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Solid Reads</span><br><br>Guyett's post 180 was forced out of him by the thread dynamic. As he can no longer maintain his under the radar behaviour as several major players are starting to suspect him, he is forced to change his image resulting in the post. Taking advantage of yessiree's weak push, he retaliates with a similar weak push towards yessiree while encouraging the rest of the team to instead go for abhorsen. This is consistent with his neutral image.<br><br>Green Crayons hops aboard the hermy wagon. It is easy to agree with as hermy is currently inactive and made two shit posts. Everyone hates on an inactive who bandwagons. He displays a facade of being helpful yet none of his does not go into much detail unless prodded. I don't see how green crayons is contributing to the town.<br><br>Hermy overall is a good lynch by default if we do not come to a consensus, but I feel uneasy with a lynch on someone based on two posts.<br><br>Abhorsen is a good lynch for all of the reasons posted in the thread already. This lynch would provide us with the most information regarding associations in the game's current state.<br><br>Yessiree's aggro is in line with his entrance to the game.<br><br>Dessew doesn't seem like a good lynch. Focused on a player after the bandwagon has cooled down is town trait, whereas scum trait is to take advantage of the situation and hop wagons to abhorsen.<br><br>Several things need to happen. Guyett needs to post more, Green Crayons needs to still post rather than wait for a response from Hermy, Hermy needs to come back, Abhorsen needs to post something, Yessiree needs to stop talking to guyett for a page or two, Dessew needs to become better at this game.<br><br>No one else was interesting."}

I like his reads list and his ISO response to yes makes a lot of sense to me. <br><br>On Wake- his claim is awful, but I'm inclined to believe it for now. If he is still alive after it would have been used I may reconsider, but I'm going to assume he's town until something else convinces me otherwise. I shouldn't need to say this, but just in case, NOBODY ELSE CLAIM.<br><br>On Nom- This reads exactly the same as Nom-town from my newbie. He's incredibly scummy, but in that game it drew out a lot of discussion. Hopefully the discussion here is more successful. <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Pasch- is he actually townie looking as scum? If so, I'm fairly sure on my townread.</span><br><br>On Emo-I'm firmly on the fence here. The rolefishing seems joking. She asks questions of most of the town. Her worry in 137, while probably not relevant, sounds very sincere. On the other hand, she's not very willing to answer other player's questions and a lot of what she posts is fluff. On the plus side, she's active enough that I'm sure better reads will come with time.<br><br>Dess, Klazam, and Pasch are going to require more thought. <br><br>Herms is ringing lurkerscum bells in my head, but we're early enough that that is probably untrue. Slandaar also needs to post more, but I liked his more recent posts. We'll see.<br><br>I've already addressed Ab, and don't have much to add to that front.<br><br>Yes seems suspicious to me.

He is definitely not the only member of the scumteam. Also, ask yourself, why would scum fakeclaim D1 with almost 0 pressure. It makes no sense, as he is now in the middle of the town's thoughts. Also, a tracker can easily confirm or deny his claim and scum wouldn't know if town has power roles. His play was sloppy, but I'm pretty sure it came from town."}

Have you played with Yessiree before? have you seen his town game. Have you seen his scum game? Players on this site such as JasonWazza and Wisdom are very aggressive players regardless of playstyle. If you want a bit of light reading I would suggest having a look at newbie 1390. It was my first game on the site but it features a pretty aggro JasonWazza who flips scum in the end. As for blindly fixating on the target I believe this is called Death Tunneling. Both scum and town do this. Wisdom and Saki for example both do this. Regarding the \"all support being lost\" well if they keep pushing and probing the person on the other end of the death tunnel could get frustrated or annoyed and do something anti town. Scum can then jump on this. So I would not rule out Scum Yessiree because yuo think scum can't be aggro and death tunnel.<br><br>Dessew doesn't seem like a good lynch... well as I currently think he is town of course he is not a good lynch. Scum will keep focusing on a player as much as town. Both scum and town take advantage of situations and hop on wagons so that is a null tell. The timing of these hops to wagons is what is most telling. Also if the hop is to an obvious mislynch then scum might stay on their previous target stating that the new target is town and people are making a mistake so that when the mislynch occurs and they flip town the scum can get nice town cred and swing the towns attention back to the earlier target.<br><br>Does that help?"}

It has nothing to do with him death tunnelling. <br>He is opportunistically jumping on things that are either borderline anti town or obvious jokes in an attempt to push an early lynch.<br>He has been misrepping me by claiming all of my posts were fluff when in fact I was asking questions to work towards cases on you and him. Instead of responding he decided to go down a route that is anti town at best."}

Because of the obviousness of these answers, yes's response was fairly non-substantive (e.g., <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416577#p5416577\" class=\"postlink\">Post 70</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416592#p5416592\" class=\"postlink\">Post 77</a>).  Guyett then calls this \"unhelpful and anti-town at best,\" (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418846#p5418846\" class=\"postlink\">Post 180</a>), which is an overblown sentiment.<br><br>B.  The third question ostensibly has merit.  But Guyett never follows up on that question.  Guyett instead seizes upon the fact that yes refused to answer the first two questions (which was valid because, as explained above, the answers were obvious).  So instead of clarifying his valid question, Guyett exploits yes's blanket response to suggest that yes is failing to respond despite the fact that yes has responded -- just not to this particular third question.  This exploitation creates a basis for Guyett to excuse his vote on yes, but that basis is completely manufactured.<br><br><br>2.  Other parts of Guyett's case against yes also feel contrived.  Guyett's initial belief that yes's Page 1 criticism was misguided (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416362#p5416362\" class=\"postlink\">Post 33</a>) gets blown into \"push&lt;ing&gt; bullshit lynches\" (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5418846#p5418846\" class=\"postlink\">Post 180</a>) and \"an attempt to push an early lynch\" (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5422392#p5422392\" class=\"postlink\">Post 283</a>).  What?  yes's <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Page 1/Page 2</span> suspicion and vote was a push for an early lynch?  Even though yes had already switched his vote a mere two hours later in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5416552#p5416552\" class=\"postlink\">Post 62</a>?  It's just a gross mischaracterization that seems sourced to make the \"problem\" of yes's early suspicion of Klazam much more than it is, thereby attempting to validate an overblown suspicion.<br><br><br>3.  I agree more with yes than with Guyett in the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419300#p5419300\" class=\"postlink\">Post 94</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5419300#p5419300\" class=\"postlink\">Post 96</a> exchange.<br><br><br>4.  I'm not keen on Guyett's reaction to Wake's claim.  In particular, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5420979#p5420979\" class=\"postlink\">Post 251</a> comes across as waiting to see how others react to the claim.  Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5422161#p5422161\" class=\"postlink\">Post 258</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5422274#p5422274\" class=\"postlink\">Post 263</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5422279#p5422279\" class=\"postlink\">Post 264</a> all either explicitly state or imply that Wake's claim should not be trusted, although it's a pretty solid town claim.  Looks like scum hoping to undercut a strong town action.<br><br><br>-----<br><br>I think most of the emogirl/Guyett stuff is null, particularly because emogirl is all over the place and wrong about her characterizations of posts.  (As an aside, I'm not sure whether to put emogirl under the \"new\" or \"scum\" column.)  In light of my above suspicions, however, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Guyett</span>."}

The other parts have some merit, but are honestly a weak case.  Activity level is a very unreliable way to determine alignment, and not being helpful is honestly pretty unreliable, too.

I think I've already elaborated plenty on my scumread of Hermy.  She's responded by using lots of ellipses, which fits into the whole \"responding with sarcasm rather than argument\" thing she's got going on. But she's not the only one ridiculing my cool awesome tell, so I dunno that it's really alignment-indicative.  (Much as I'd like to call everyone who doubts the power of the ellipsis tell scum.)<br><br>More than the reactions of townies to my case, I'm interested in the reactions to my disinterest in screwing with power roles.  Now, I said that because it's true, not in the interest of eliciting reactions, but the nice thing about being open and honest is that it gets you plenty of reactions without you even having to try.  Klazam tried to push for my lynch based on it, which was obviously nonsense.  I don't think that necessarily puts him as scum, I think he's a victim of confirmation bias - he misunderstood my original case on Hermy and ever since then I've been marked as scummy in his head and it's been twisting his perceptions of me.  But what I do find interesting is how Paschendale jumped on his weak nonsense as an excuse to join the wagon on me.  I'd already had my eye on him (my own confirmation bias?) and to me this looks fairly inexcusable.<br><br>Pasch, you wanna come defend your vote on me?

If any noobiness is shown it's either faked or deliberate.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is truth.<br><br>I did not make up the stuff about baiting out votes to get to L-1. The thread dynamic was shifting towards a bandwagon on me due to my play style, and I did not intervene. Notice how I didn't respond to the questions immediately even though I was fully capable of doing so. After a certain amount of votes, I was interested in who would take advantage of the bandwagon by either pushing for or against it, as the bandwagon was weak and a lot of my actual good posts are being skimmed over and a lot of the focus was on the endless banter between everyone in the thread and me.<br><br>Since I know my own alignment, and scum feels that I am a relatively easy target to lynch compared to other players, it set the thread up to go from RVS stage, to people making actual accusations. My interest wasn't who would make the accusations, but how they would reanalyze my motives for playing the way I did in the early stages of the game. Jingle pointed this out.<br><br>Even you mentioned in your post, I had valid points. It is just among all of the fluff posts, which can easily be undermined or exploited.<br><br>When questioning guyett and dessew about why they find me scummy, although they have my entire ISO to base off of, they do not post anything other than a glance at the surface of the thread content. If they were to even slow down for a second and notice the change in my tone instead of continuing to explain to the thread that I am an annoying as fuck player and has no original point of view or thoughts and shadow other players, then they would see that they don't even know what they are talking about and would miss the fundamental point of this game.<br><br>My read on you is leaning town only because you didn't have to agree with my case with defending Nom. As a scum, you would continue to undermine of all of my posts, or encourage others to (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5435842#p5435842\" class=\"postlink\">pasch</a>.) instead of pointing out that they indeed make perfect sense and is disguised together with poor posts. Which by the way, is easy for scum to manipulate.<br><br>Now why would I do all of this? Because I am a capable enough of a player to play the situation to my advantage and see who is trying to manipulate my posts for a lynch. What is rather annoying is that most votes on me hasn't been anyone actually trying to lynch me with reason. It is just \"oh, emogirl is caught scum that's why she is acting like this\". I have read your reasoning for accusing me and have responded to it multiple times. My problem is with Dessew and Guyett. I already said I town-read dessew because I don't think he is a strong player at all. I'm running on null with Guyett and read his reactions to me as emotional. Leaving me with why I had a funny feeling about \"pasch\" because I really did expect more out of him."}

I believe the loss of the roleblocker, Paschendale, was a huge blow to the scum team, but also, that town trusted each other and each claim so closely. I had anticipated the claims to cause serious confusion and paranoia, as well as the false positives for the gunsmith. Another aspect to the quickness of the game came from the mafia choosing to target Jingle two nights in a row. Interestingly enough, I believe it was Dessew, who mused he could be a hider, but quickly discarded that idea. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> I also feel that the activity level of the scum team attributed greatly to town's ability to confirm each other and form a solid town block. <br><br>The mafia, in no way, did badly at all, though. Dessew displayed a convincing town POV (imo) throughout D1/D2. I also particularly liked the way Paschendale handled his read of Abhorsen, and Abhorsen's responses to inquiries. <br><br>The star of the show, by far, is Jingle. He concealed his Hider status and played the D3 options for night actions very well. I'm really proud of him. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> He took the role and made it everything I had envisioned for it. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'd also like to thank my review team: mykonian, JacobSavage and Empking. They put up with my arguing over the balance, but they are wiser than I am, and I should have listened.</span>  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">  Town had a ton of unchecked power. I wasn't expecting the RB to go under so quickly. Next time will be better.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> <br><br>Very well done, everyone.

In practice, I think you could use a little more finesse, particularly with your interaction with others. Overall, you survived to end game, which, even in this town-powered setup, is impressive in any game.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\":cool:\" title=\"Cool\">"}
