There will not be a lynch if the game goes to night due to this deadline--someone has to consciously place a hammer vote.<br>\n</li><li>I will probably be online when the deadline strikes, and I'll lock the thread at that point. But if I'm not, and you beat me to the punch with a hammer, you can have it. The lynch will go through normally in that case.<br>\n</li><li>You may choose to go to night without a lynch before then, by having at least half of the players <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: No Lynch</div>. (That's half, not a full majority.)<br>\n</li><li>Votes should be posted in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Anarchy</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Anarchy</span>. I expect them to be entirely bold, but don't try to exploit this to trick someone. I will register misspellings and nicknames if I can figure out who you're referring to. You do not have to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote</div>, but you're welcome to do so anyway.<br>\n</li><li>When a player has the majority of the votes at a single point, it is dead and the game goes to twilight. Feel free to post in twilight.<br>\n</li><li>Night deadlines are \"whenever I next get online 48 hours after [the lynch scene/finding any necessary replacements].\" I will not announce day sooner, even if all choices are in. If I'm missing your choice and I know you're online, I'll contact you and give you a minute to think of something.<br>\n</li><li>Failing that, the game will just have to go to day without you. If any anti-town faction with unlimited shots misses a chance to kill, then a fallback kill will still go through--trying to confirm people through their inactivity is not recommended. This default option only applies to the scum nightkill and compulsory roles. Any other abilities will simply go unused.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">What is and isn't allowed:</div></div><br>\n</li><li>Please don't be a giant raging asshole. I'm asking you nicely here.<br>\n</li><li>Unless otherwise specified, living players can't communicate with each other out of the thread. Anyone who's an exception to this rule will get a private topic. They're free to talk outside of it, if they have a method they prefer. Transcripts from that are appreciated, but if you're Skyping or something, don't worry about taping every single thing you say. I trust you.<br>\n</li><li>You <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">may</div> rant to both dead players and nonplaying friends, although you're encouraged to first make sure that said friends aren't interested in replacing in with you. (I am of course available, sympathetic and discreet. Feel free to AIM me at CaffieneDeity, or Skype me at unvote.) Regardless of where you found them, rantbuddies may not reveal their own opinions on the game, and nothing about your discussion should surface publicly before the game is over.<br>\n</li><li>\"Dead\" means \"dead.\" Don't AIM the guy who hammered you to tell him what a scumbag he is, and definitely don't keep making game-relevant posts. Just lie there...and think dead thoughts.<br>\n</li><li>Read your role PM and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">summarize it in your confirmation</div>. Unless I've posted it publicly, you may not reference its wording in-thread. In fact, don't reference the wording of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">any</div> private messages anyone sends you about this game. No timestamps. Nothing.<br>\n</li><li>Do not try to encourage others to break the above rule.

Don't use them. Don't pretend to use them.<br>\n<li>The smallest font size you can use is <div style=\"font-size: 70%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">size 70</div>.

I will automatically prod anyone who has not posted over 48 hours--and that's pretty lenient; you are expected to post more than once every two days. If asked, I will disclose the status of any prod.<br>\n</li><li>If you don't post in-thread in response to a prod within 48 hours, I will seek a replacement to take over your role. Future prods must be responded to within 24 hours. (I might bump this back up later at my discretion, but don't count on it.) I may seek replacement for a player who lurks consistently without breaking this rule, but you'll have some sort of warning first.<br>\n</li><li>I'll try to post one votecount per page, as close to the top as possible.

{"number": 170, "id": "6957487", "user": "Pegasus30", "user_id": "25707", "content": "Okay, caught up. <br>\n<br>\nAP is probably scum. His reads leave a lot to be desired. The weirdest thing I noticed was that his top three townreads (Empire, Chamber, Quilford) were the exact same three people that I read as town before AP posted. Considering he was posting responses to other players and declaring their posts \"town\" or making shifty faces to express his disapproval, I'd expect him to comment on those reads and agree but he didn't mention me at all except to later point out that my Untrod vote was bad. I think having not one but multiple reads overlap with your own would be worthy of comment. Angry's posts to me seem a bit targeted - like he thinks I would lurk and be an easy lynch. He modded a game where I posted once in 25 pages (I was mafia then but legitimately busy and ease of lynching is something that translates across alignments).<br>\n<br>\nUntrod's later posts haven't diminished my scumread on him and I don't really understand his defense of AP. I could maybe see on a surface level saying that Angry's posts being content rich referred to Angry posting a long wall and a list of reads. I also think AP should explain what it is about Untrod that was so town beyond saying that Untrod is town for no reason at all. <br>\n<br>\nThere are a couple of other players I think are town since I last posted: Green and Yos. Green because he focused on the big picture when voting AP rather than individual points which is similar to how I'm seeing AP. AP's logic isn't unreasonable but his intent seems malignant. Green's questions to Yos about Yos's initial AP vote were good digging. My reaction to Yos's first AP vote was similar. @ Chamber, you are going to have to walk me through why Green is scum because I'm not seeing it. <br>\n<br>\nYos's response to UT's gif was similar to mine except he thought AP was scummier. His subsequent meta was actually well-used.

GC directly asked you about your vote on me and your response was essentially \"Well <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">obviously</div> its not only to do with his first post!\"  Then what the hell is it?!  Are you conveniently going to continue ignoring the context of my first posts in the game and ignore talking about all subsequent posts I make.

I'm guessing this would have to do with his narrative about what he did in this thread, particularly how he read me.  I'll make an honest effort to look for what you are hinting at in a bit today.  I have fairly mixed opinions about GC right now.  Mostly that his overall presence has looked increasingly town, but he feels different than I've seen him before.  I haven't noticed any obvious inconsistencies in his push on me.  All I remember about that though is that he thought my wall post looked scummy for gutmeta/tone, and then attempted to find something more concrete but couldn't.<br>\n<br>\nQuor, I know how to play mafia.  I'm fully aware that claiming at L - 2 isn't 'correct' play.  My point is that I'm a good lynch for reasons I've already repeated, but I'll do it again here for your benefit.  No one is townreading me (except now Chamber), I'm a VT, I'm going to be a distraction if I remain in the game, and my points are being largely ignored this game.  To summarize, I agree with your opinion that getting lynched as town can be protown and thats what I'm supporting right now.  This game isn't the sole source of my mental well-being or lack thereof.  If you actually cared about what I'm doing, you could find hints as to why I might be upset though.  Forget hints, I've been pretty damn transparent this game.  I'm not sold on Quil's interactions with me being scummy but I am having doubts about my read there.<br>\n<br>\nGC, I have no idea what point you are trying to make about chamber.  Could you just make it instead of expecting me to wade through another wall of quotes?  I don't care if you vote me; thats kind of the point of claiming a role that is lynchable and making myself hated.

I never said otherwise.   I'm also asking you questions to try to understand where you're coming from, because I still don't get it. <br>\n<br>\nFrom my point of view, what it looks like is that you wanted to quietly ride a bad bandwagon all the way to lynch  without drawing attention to the fact that you were on it, while at the same time trying to attack others in order to set up mislynches for future days.  Specifically by making cases that would be even more effective in the future if AP flipped town (both against Q and against me).   When chamber questioned you out on it, you gave a very weak explanation, and still never really acted like you were trying to scumhunt AP.   <br>\n<br>\n(Of course, that's if AP is town; it's also possible you're buddies with AP and wanted to get a vote on him into the voting record but never really wanted him to be lynched, which is why your attacks on him were so weak.  It could go either way; if you do flip scum, it doesn't really tell me much about AP's alignment.)<br>\n<br>\nYour early-game case against me also felt very artificial and weak; you attacked me for acting in the exact same way I acted in my last game with you when I was town, then claimed you forgot about that game and even claimed you didn't remember that I was town in that game, and basically refused to go look at it even when chamber brought it up, even though it would have taken literally 30 seconds to do so.  You basically just said \"whelp, I guess we'll never know, but I'm going to keep suspecting Yos anyway\" rather then bother to find out.

Also, if you're suspicious of the person leading the wagon your on, that should normally make you a little more hesitant about staying on it, which i didn't see either.

I can buy that his stances are 'convenient'.  His case on me was kind of difficult to follow if you haven't been in the last Open we were in together and his case on you is based on your push on someone he found scummy (me).  I'm not really thinking he is scum despite this though.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not going to quote anything from P11, but my overall impression of this page is that Yosarian and GC are the same alignment.  So, most likely town.  I could go into details on why that is, but I certainly don't want to quote more from that exchange than I have to.  I understand why they each find the other suspicious, but all these posts just look increasingly pedantic and laden with confirmation-bias.  The main disagreement seems to be over GC sniping at Q's post.  I can fathom someone seeing this as chainsaw defending but I don't think Q even directly called me scum?  All I recall from his wall is that he was  <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://lib.iamdisappoint.com/sites/iamdisappoint.com/logo.png?1392021326\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div>about my posting which I can buy.

The rest of the argument seems to balloon out from this point.<br>\n<br>\n/11<br>\n<br>\nI think both GC and Yos are town.  If I'm wrong about one of them, its probably Yos.

I'd normally be afraid that this is a 'shallow' read based on them both generating content and that its alignment neutral, but I am not really having a hard time identifying with their posts on an emotional level at all.  I especially think Yos's stance on my lynch is more likely to come from town...or at least the way he expressed it is, which is to say hes essentially ready to take any blame for lynching me.  He never outright said it- but it was somewhat implied and I overall don't really think he's faking anything.  GC....my points for Yos-town kind of rolled of my tongue and I'm having a bit more trouble expressing my feelings on GC.  Which is upsetting because I was pretty content with calling them both town and moving on to better things.  Eh.  I'm going to just say \"I think GC is town, -HITOSHRUG-\" for the time being here.<br>\n<br>\nChamber - Actually advancing the game state.  Seems involved and his questions all form a pretty readable mindset for me so far.  His scumplay in the Open game I played with him felt more hollow in a lot of ways whereas this doesn't.<br>\n<br>\nEmpire - I think hes being open this game and saying what is on his mind.

AP was legitimately suspicious early on in the day, so I don't share GC's dislike for that push.  But you yourself have said that it was a weak push on Day One.  You've also shown real awareness of your meta (bringing up Oldy2 as an example of a game in which you acted this way).  <br>\n<br>\nI do think that your arguments early on assumed that AP was scum.  Otherwise why would \"defending AP\" be a negative point against GC?  You say that nothing GC says indicates that he actually, honestly suspects AP but the same is exactly true of you.  You move from a scumread (yes, I think a vote indicates at least some kind of scumread) on AP to a scumread on GC for questioning you about what is, by your own admission, a pretty weak argument for AP scum.  <br>\n<br>\nBasically, everything you've accused GC of doing, you've done yourself.  You haven't proven that you honestly have suspicions on the people you claim to suspect (which, in both your defenses, would be pretty freaking hard to do), you have been inconsistent in your reads and you have accused GC of defending AP while you're attacking him for not suspecting him convincingly enough. <br>\n<br>\nYour arguments are not making sense to me.  To ME, it looks like the both of you are doing precisely the same things (using buzzwords, talking around the subject, alternately defending and attacking AP) and I don't see why it's obvscum to you when GC does it but it's fine when you do.<br>\n<br>\nIf you don't believe me on this, read your ISO again.  You're using tactics that you're accusing others of.  I don't know that it makes you scum (because GC was doing the same thing) and I wouldn't call it flailing; it's a lot more expert than flailing imo.  But I think you need to stop tunneling and look at the rest of the game, because this back and forth is helpful to no one.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yeah, that's an invitation to engage with me.

But, as I said, you don't seem to be scumreading me over this and I actually thought you were pretty town up until now.  Well I still think you are town, but the business of asserting that there was no town motivation in what I'm doing implies you think it was scummy but perhaps you didn't really make that leap which means my whole rant about \"lack of town motivation\" does not equate to \"scummy\" was mostly irrelevant.

{"number": 467, "id": "6976642", "user": "Empire", "user_id": "19826", "content": "Alright, so I finally finished my reread of the game (as well as catching up to the latest posts), I still feel like I have an extremely nebulous hold on this game (there's also the issue that I don't think the bottom three really fit as a team at this point) but I wanted to lay out where I stand with everyone in the game so far. I really hope over time people end up above the line. I know this post is going to probably be rambly and ponderous but I'd like everyone to read it and engage with me on it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">TOWN</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">chamber:</div> Not really sure where people's concerns about his play are coming from (I think some people are just really unfamiliar with him?), but his play here massively fits with the town meta that I know of him. I can follow/understand most of his thought processes even if I don't agree with him (ex: I can understand why he asked about AP's smiley usage in #69 even if the question was a bit weird). From what I remember, chamber really hates being scum and is far less engaged in the game, so posts like #168 where he voices his frustration that no one understands his GC vote/unstated reasoning make more sense from him as town - I think he'd be far less inclined to give a shit as scum. I liked his \"trying to prevent AP from self destructing\" post in #220, think he'd just let AP continue to do so if he were scum. Him trying to get GC and Yos to stop flooding the thread in #308 is immensely town, he'd surely just let them continue to drown the thread out if he were scum here. Finally, #221 is a post that is just so off beat in terms of its \"internal dialogue\" style of explaining his thought process that I would be really shocked if scum came up with that. Overall, I'd probably just spiral into permanent state of existential pessimism if he were scum in this game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pegasus30:</div> I've already stated quite a bit of why I think this dude's really town, but it bears repeating. I really liked the timing and statement of the townreads on myself and chamber in #46, given that no one had stated a read on us yet, it shows that he is willing to take the initiative while scumhunting. His thoughts on AP and myself in #170 seem to be colored by a paranoia that scum would want to pounce on trying to mislynch him due to his perception as an easy-to-lynch player and I think these bias are more likely to come from newbie town as opposed to scum. I like that he took the extra effort to verify Yosarian's meta analysis on AP in #176 and wanting to back out of a potential wall war with AP in #178, the latter specifically because I feel like getting into a back-and-forth with AP at this stage would give him free content and would allow him to clutter the thread if he were scum. He is also more forceful with people than I would expect newbie scum to be in posts like #295 (&#8220;Ap, you want to be engaged...&#8221;; &#8220;Empire, you are standing on the sidelines despite being active...&#8221;) and his frustration at not having strong townreads impeding his gamesolving in #392 reads really genuine to me. This dude is another dude I'd be really surprised if he flipped scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">AP:</div> While I did find AP's entrance into the game a bit forced and over the top, I can buy that this is just a playstyle thing and not really alignment indicative. It's hard to really dig in and find specific points for why I think he's town but I will say that I liked the introspective bits/efforts to be transparent that appear throughout his posting (ex: #64 &#8211; &#8220;I considered editing parts of my post to make it less 3-dimensional...\"; #124 &#8211; &#8220;I do feel pressured to contribute, but that is coming from within&#8221;; #162 &#8211; &#8220;Talking about myself is just going to make people care less about what I say...\"). #65 and the subsequent explanation in #67 suggest that he is posting without a filter, which I think is way more likely town. And I think his whole thing where he claimed VT and threatened to self hammer is a towntell in that it is more likely to come from a demotivated town-AP.<br>\n<br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">GC:</div> While I'm nowhere near as confident as the above three that he's town, I do think he's done some solidly town stuff enough to place him just under the line. I actually thought #112 was a town post in that I think as scum he'd have just made up some bullshit or manufactured a case against AP at that point (and I certainly think GC is competent enough as scum to have done so). I don't see the scum motivation in posting given that it de facto undermines your push to admit you don't have any specific points against that player, if that player is town and you are trying to get them lynched. All in all, I like the way he handles himself in his responses to Yosarian, he hits the right frustrated town tone and his points all resonate with me, particularly those articulated in #277. Bonus: he also does the food tell in #208 &gt;_&gt;.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Quilford:</div> I think the little mini case that Quilford presented in #47 is slightly more likely to come from town in that town are more likely to experience that feeling of deja vu / make the connection between the exact wording of someone else's play in this game and their scum play in another game. The subsequent questioning of UT also seems like he's genuinely trying to get a read on him. Overall, Quilford generally is hitting the natural/snarky/sassy town tone that is more similar to the TM Twin Trap rather than the more robotic and stiff tone he had in Mafia on the Metro. Would really like to see his thoughts/reads when he catches up, though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">UT:</div> I already touched on this before but the reasoning he uses in #95 to suspect me in the TM Large Theme where we were town together and I think it makes him slightly more likely to be town. I liked #216 in that UT's level of mad/frustration seems similar to how he reacted to suspicion in the TM Large Theme and from memory UT is far less inclined to give a shit when he's scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">DrDolittle:</div> This one is very weak but I liked that he went out of his way to look up the number of times AP used a certain smiley as it shows some proactive effort. I skimmed MacBeth (where he was scum) very briefly earlier today and he does seem to be playing very differently than he is here in that in MacBeth he was a lot more \"by-the-book\" and formal in his approach but I need to dig a bit deeper in order to verify this.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NULL</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">SKrew:</div> I liked where he was going in his questioning during the early game but it's weak and I want to see where he goes when he has the time to fully catch up here and state his thoughts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Axxle:</div> Despite having had some content, I've got nothing on this guy. Hopefully, whoever jumps into this slot will be a lot more readable for me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF THIS GUY, PLS HELP:</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Yosarian2:</div> I had him in the scum pile initially, but I reviewed his ISO again and it occurred to me that a lot of his posts could go both ways. That said, I still have a lot of problems with his play. Normally, I'd consider the meta diving into AP's early game play in #98 to be a towntell but it gives off the impression to me that he was looking for stuff to suit his conclusions (Ex: &#8220;I'm seeing the kind of self-conscious stuff he's talking about here, but I'm still not getting the \"I'm neutral, don't mind me, I'm just here\" vibe that bugged me here.&#8221;). The thought process laid out in #147 does seem a bit more likely town, though. I still really dislike his push on GC though and a lot of it feels like he is trying to conform GC&#8217;s posts to fit the conclusion that he&#8217;s scum. #255 still feels off &#8211; like, Yos didn&#8217;t even have a read on Quaroath so I still don&#8217;t really get why he is making this argument since it assumes Quaroath is town and GC is trying to chain up his mislynch. I&#8217;m trying to figure out if he&#8217;s just like confirmation biasing or something. However, I looked a bit at Karma Mafia and he does seem to be playing slightly differently than there.

I don&#8217;t like that he doesn&#8217;t take a position one way or the other, though. And I don&#8217;t like how this stuff didn&#8217;t appear in his first catch up in #57. The criticism of AP feels like empty posturing in #202 every time I reread the post although I haven't fully gone through his meta yet to see if this is a thing he does across both alignments. Vote on Quilford is weird given that he spent the first part of the post criticizing AP for his actions (yet doesn&#8217;t take much of a position on AP in that post), not to mention his entire mini-case here about Quilford here just feels like a scum case. #380 just feels that way too, particularly the attempt to link me and Yosarian together.

(Someone actually went through and did statistical analysis on several years of mafia games at one point, and found that town lynches worse then random on day 1.  The reason is that town are only acting slightly better then random, while scum are actively trying to push mislynches, so the end result is worse then random.)<br>\n<br>\nObviously, when you're looking for that kind of behavior on day 1, you have to do it without actually knowing anyone's alignment.   So what you say is \"this post by X looks like it matches the 'scum trying to push a mislynch on Y'\" behavior, based on the (fairly subtle) ways that that kind of behavior can look different from \"town honestly looking for scum\" behavior.      <br>\n<br>\nI mean, how else can you scumhunt on day 1 when you don't have anything solid?  Day 1 scumhunting is all based behavior patterns, hunches, meta, or guesses.    And one of biggest differences between town and scum play is <br>\nthat townies are actually trying to find scum, while scum are trying to get townies mislynched, and that can look a little bit different.<br>\n<br>\nNow, later on in the game after a few flips, you start to know who was scum and who was town, you could use that fact and have a better shot at figuring out the difference when looking back, but you don't have that on day 1, so you just have to look for behavioral tells being made by the attacker to try to figure out his motives without knowing the alignment of the person being attacked.  Which is what I was trying to do.  It's...not an exact science, but it's still one of the biggest divergences between town and scum playstyles on day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nHowever, I looked a bit at Karma Mafia and he does seem to be playing slightly differently than there.

{"number": 501, "id": "6979799", "user": "Pegasus30", "user_id": "25707", "content": "I'm a little surprised no one caught onto what was odd about Quaroth's posts: his interaction with Empire. Every time he posts towards Empire, his posts seem forced and manufactured - like he doesn't actually have anything to say but is trying to find stuff to snipe at Empire about. At first, I thought he and Empire were scum distancing but after Empire's latest list of reads, I'm unsure (and I'll get to Empire's list in a bit). But even if Empire is town, Quar's posts are worthy of a close look.<br>\n<br>\nI recommend everyone keep his posts in isolation open in a different window as you read through:<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6954469#p6954469\">Post 59</a> - The weird jump at Empire calling him \"foolish\" and then oscillating back-and-forth with no conclusion. Then he criticizes Empire for his impatience, calls it strange and leaves it there without offering his opinion. The criticisms themselves feel overblown.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958833#p6958833\">Post 202</a> - His completely misrepresents what Empire was saying about Untrod. I thought it was fairly obvious that Empire was responding to AP. Empire had said that scum would latch onto his early posts. AP replied that only Untrod latched onto them. Empire responded by saying that Untrod had in the past incorrectly called Empire scum (implying that Untrod latching onto his posts isn't cause for a scumread). Quar then twists it as if Empire was saying that he and Untrod were both town here because Untrod read Empire wrongly in the past. Quar <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> have misunderstood but I just hate the totally overblown response \"WHAT!??!?!? Please explain this using logical thought processes\" in caps with multiple punctuation and exclamation marks.<br>\n<br>\nThis is in fact a recurring theme through many of his posts. In the same post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958833#p6958833\">202</a>), look at his chiding of AP: <br>\n<br>\n\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Your job of friggen defend yourself.

How the hell does your death help catch the scum if you self-hammer because QQ? Why should anyone defend you... do it your own damn self.</div>\"<br>\n<br>\nThe underlying theme that sets me off the hardest is the extreme overreaction. \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Wha...?</div>\" \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">WHAT!?!??!</div>\" \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">crock of shit</div>\" \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why the HELL.</div>\" It doesn't feel like genuine emotion in a relevant context. Feels more like he is bullshitting his reactions. I wondered if it was simply a playstyle clash and whether his reaction simply appear scummy to a more restrained player like me. <br>\n<br>\nSo, I went through his old games to check how much of it is just playstyle. My impression was that he reacts strongly as both alignments but his overreactions as scum seem <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">significantly more pronounced and over the top</div>. This was what I was hoping Empire would point out when he committed to reading through Quar's games. There's another thing I want talk about but I want to see if Empire does mention it before I elaborate.<br>\n<br>\nMoving on, the rest of his interactions with Empire:<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969686#p6969686\">Post 380</a> - He accuses Empire of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">distancing</div> from Yos which is a really perplexing accusation to make. What exactly from Empire/Yos's interaction looks like distancing? It seems to have come from Yos having a weak suspicion of Empire.

I also really don't like pegasus' method of presenting points. It annoyed me (and made me suspicious of him) when he did it to AP.

My general impression without reviewing anything is that people think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958833#p6958833\">202</a> is scummy.  The whole sideways push on me which is mostly just critiquing my play has come up a few times now and I mostly just disagree that its a scummy thing to say to me (I think the opposite, really).<br>\n...<br>\nOk, I just reread the Pegasus post on him.  This is probably what sparked the comment about meta-&gt;confirimationBias because he pretty much asserted that Quar's posts were scummy for being overly emotive then found evidence that he is that way as both alignments, but more so as scum.  Kinda hard to pass a judgement on..I could do legwork to see if I agree but the sample size of posts I'd have to read to feel I was doing the case justice is a lot.<br>\n<br>\nAccusing Yos of distancing from Empire is interesting, but I can see that Quar was pinging Empire all game even if he never really came out with a hard scumread or case for it.  I can see someone thinking Yos was doing that given individual reads on both of them.  Yos never really pressed Empire from what I remember except that post that Quar mentioned which really did throw shade at Empire without committing to a read/vote on him.  Compare to other Yos posts which are more heavy handed.  All in all, I'm not seeing a compelling reason to vote Quar and I'm gut townreading the guy for some of his behavior.<br>\n<br>\nI wouldn't complain too much about lynching him I guess because there are some things that give me pause.  (Like the wagon being weird as chamber mentioned although Im seeing maybe an opposite conclusion from it :S)<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: Errrr, I've been updating them like every few days or so so that everyone knows what I'm thinking.

I'm fairly certain a complete read of the ten games I pulled don't show I overreact more as scum if you read em *all* not just one.

So the only thing I can pick out where you make an argument of scumminess is really that his words are \"overblown\" aka forced (I guess?) which isn't really the conclusion I came to.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The underlying theme that sets me off the hardest is the extreme overreaction. \"Wha...?\" \"WHAT!?!??!\" \"crock of shit\" \"why the HELL.\" It doesn't feel like genuine emotion in a relevant context.

It reminds me of people hating on SpyreX or Fate or Reck for allcaps posting and \"fake rage\".  And I know from playing with those dudes extensively that the rage isn't necessarily fake, those guys do actually get pissed sometimes, so I have a hard time giving credence to emotion-based arguments.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not gonna address the next paragraph, that's something he needs to talk about.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Even more so since scum in this game can converse during the day.</div></blockquote><br>\nholy shit<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nP.S.

Have you in the past as town called replace-outs suspicious? If so, can you link them for me. <br>\n3) It would be very helpful if you can post your updated reads. I think quite a lot has happened since you excused yourself due to exams and I want your take on the latest events.<br>\n<br>\nOther thoughts:<br>\n<br>\nGoing through his posts strengthened my townread on him. Most of Quilford's posts have involved scumhunting at a reasonable depth. He sometimes posts things I agree with which by itself isn't a huge indicator of alignment but are small points in favor of thinking we have similar motivations. His suspicion changes according to things that happen in thread in a reasonable manner (AP being scum and then later town when he found out that AP was trying to change stuff). He's fairly engaged with the game and follows up on his questions fairly often. He seems to be particularly wary of Untrod who won as scum against him in the past which I find reasonable.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think it is completely impossible for a scum player to post like he did but the sum total of content he put in thread makes me lean far, far more in the town direction than scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">He's not a wagon I'll support today.

Some of his posts made me cringe while others felt like busywork. But through the bad posts, there are several that expose his town motives. The push on Axxle wasn't bad. His changing his mind on Quilford felt like he had actual reasons for it although I want them explained. Some of his sentiments like his concerns about Chamber seem like ones I think town would have whereas scum would be more likely to not want to provoke Chamber, the near-universally agreed upon obvtown.<br>\n<br>\nI understand why he was wagoned as the votes on him came shortly after his cringeworthy posts but the entire sum of posts I think are likelier town than scum.

If Pegasus had such a tremendous townread on Quilford, the one wagon he doesn't seem to like, then I would expect him to have had an opinion back then (it's not like Quilford has been tremendously active since then).  <br>\n<br>\nAs for the Katsuki thing:  Axxle pinged me.  Axxle got my vote for a good long while.  I don't typically jump around my votes and I damn well wasn't going to vote for AP during his meltdown -- how would that have helped?  Katsuki also sets up an interesting parallel in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6984019#p6984019\">Post 552</a>: \"Bookitty is probably scum if Quar flips scum.\"  <br>\n<br>\nI was defending Quaroath.  I empathise with real-life things taking priority over this game, as I have had them (I had a cold that developed into bronchitis, I had to take two days V/LA, I STILL don't feel 100 percent and I'm sleeping way more than usual).  Quaroath was the competing wagon to me at that time.  Given the general trend in this game, I could have just laid down a naked vote on him and been safer myself.  But I didn't think that was the right thing to do.<br>\n<br>\nBut that's not what was interesting about Katsuki.  She's acting like I'm this major threat as scum but thinks that I would outright defend a buddy in the way I was doing if I were scum.  SERIOUS cogdis here, tantamount (just for you, AP) to saying that \"Bookitty is a threat as scum, but she defends her buddies so it's easy to tell who they are.\"  Really?<br>\n<br>\nI have repeatedly asked for people to start making cases and not just flop their votes down on whatever wagon is most convenient.  I have yet to see a case against me despite little flippant votes and comments on me all through.  I was kind of waiting around to see what my wagon would look like, since I know I'm town and you won't be lynching me today.  But we're close enough in to deadline now that I don't want to waste time with this.<br>\n<br>\nPegasus, I know you defended Quilford.  That doesn't change your overall pattern of only commenting on the wagons and suspicion already in existence and supporting almost all of them.  It looks to me like you are the \"active scum\" covering for lurker scum and trying to push through wagons (or obstruct them) on their behalf.<br>\n<br>\nSince you think I am scum, why do you rule out an SK-Bookitty pairing?

This was based off of very weak reasoning, and went nowhere.  Which isn't bad in and of itself, but what makes it suspicious is the fact that this empty calorie case it's a large component of Quil's substantive presence in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.</div> The AP vote/unvote.  It's clear that Quil voted AP for awkwardness + Pegasus/Yos points (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6954597#p6954597\">Post 63</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a>), which (once again), is fine whatever in and of itself.  Here, however, my problem is Quil's voting pattern and - more importantly - his justification for his quick unvote.<br>\n<br>\nQuil unvoted because he didn't want \"any derps\" giving AP the chance to self-hammer (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958035#p6958035\">Post 192</a>).  Quil reiterates that someone could have either missed AP's self-hammer claim or would have put AP at L-1 anyways (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958962#p6958962\">Post 203</a>).  I call shenanigans.  AP's self-hammer claim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> wasn't buried in some massive wall post.  It was clearly stated in the single line post - hard to miss, and so I find it suspicious that Quil was concerned that someone would have missed it.  The other fear that someone would have put AP at L-1 in any event is also pretty unjustified, seeing as how it was only Page 8; and, in any event, such a vote would have effectively been the hammer so that the person making such a vote would have come under appropriate suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is all to say, Quil's unvote justification looks artificial.  He voted AP for perfectly adequate reasons for a Page 8 vote, but the immediate jump off based on the reasons articulated looks like a calculated attempt to look town from a player who knows that the voted player (AP) is frustrated town.<br>\n<br>\nFeeding into this is I also don't buy Quil's explanation of Quil's reading AP town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961567#p6961567\">Post 242</a>).  The timing doesn't really hold up:  Quil claims that he was starting to townread AP immediately after AP's claim of self-hammering (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958011#p6958011\">Post 188</a>), but that was never indicated in Quil's justifications for unvoting.  Also, the only thing that could justify Quil's AP town read from the time between Quil's AP vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a>) and Quil's AP townread (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>) would be AP's self-hammer claim - which I guess is plausible, but I don't see how that caused a 180 degree spin in Quil's assessment of AP (as opposed to simply being the turning point of Quil's diminishing suspicions of AP).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3.</div> And then there's Quil's push against UT based on the differences between Empire's and AP's awkwardness (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955613#p6955613\">Post 89</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955677#p6955677\">Post 96</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955716#p6955716\">Post 101</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>).

Why disappear or not comment about his reads?<br>\n2.)

It is AGAINST THE RULES to discuss ongoing games, so you have made an accusation here that you know I cannot answer without violating site rules.  This really bothered me, especially because of the way you worded it.  I invite anyone to look at my activity and to consider why I might have been \"posting quite a bit elsewhere\" in that case.  I can't actually defend myself about this because of site rules, which truly infuriates me since it allows Pegasus to misrepresent things here with impunity.  I didn't answer it then, but I think my answer here doesn't violate rules any more than your initial accusation does, so I should be fine.<br>\n<br>\nIt's interesting that both Katsuki and Pegasus have postulated a Quaroath-Bookitty team because I was unwilling to vote someone I thought was town.  While that townread has weakened, I still think it's ridiculous in both cases.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as my activity, I believe I told everyone I have freaking bronchitis.  I'm currently on my second round of antibiotics (which are approximately the size of a submarine) and I am not really in the mood to defend myself for crap I cannot help.<br>\n<br>\n@Pegasus:  I have seen this before from SleepyKrew as both alignments.  Gun to head I would guess he's more likely scum for it, but I can't read him with any confidence at this point.  Also, the posts you are talking about (apart from DrDoolittle, who looks to me like an easy fall-back scumread) referred to a leading wagon.  If I were reading things the way you apparently are, I'd be arguing for a Quilford-Pegasus scumteam because you defended him.<br>\n<br>\n@Quaroath:  I apologise if the way I framed my question offended you.  I was irritated (and still am) because I don't have any case to which to respond.  It's all nebulous and impossible to address.  It means that I can't pinpoint scum on my wagon and everyone is just adding me as their \"plus one\" for scum without reasons.  You don't like it when a question is framed to you that presupposes you are scum -- that is pretty much how I've felt from the start here.", "time": "Mon Jun 29, 2015 12:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

You say you can sympathize with him because of irl stuff and that's part of why you don't like the wagon but that has nothing to do with his alignment and is objectively a bad reason to defend someone. Your points about the supposed contradiction between Katsuki and AP thinking you were a threat as scum but also hunting for your buddies also aren't very strong. Defending partners isn't necessarily the mark of a poor scum player especially when done convincingly. You again comment on Yos and say that his reads are \"all over the place.\" I don't really understand your interactions with Yos. It seems like you spend a lot of time on him (more than you do on others) but don't have him as particularly scummy or vote him at any point. I'm guessing it could be based on past history (your opening posts suggest that). I'd like to hear a concrete opinion on him.<br>\n<br>\nOverall thoughts:<br>\n<br>\nGoing through all of her posts makes me a less sure on Bookitty. I can reasonably follow most of her suspicions and by themselves, there are only a few posts that are troublesome. Most of her descriptions of me or the cases I made seem like misinterpretations or oversimplifications. They could come from lazy town potentially. I didn't like the responses to the suspicion on her from AP. It seemed like she was throwing shade more than addressing them but at least she admits it. The interactions with Yosarian look like they are steeped in past games and I can't decide what it says about either of their alignments just yet. The townread on AP doesn't seem very well thought-out.<br>\n<br>\nMy biggest problem initially with Bookitty was that it seemed like she was posting occasionally, making contributions but not really in a way that shakes things up and was relatively unremarkable. She seems fairly focused on a narrow selection of players (Yosarian, AP, Ax/Katsuki) and defends Quar for real life reasons - although the last had a defiant town feel to it. I don't know what to make of her at this point.

Here, however, my problem is Quil's voting pattern and - more importantly - his justification for his quick unvote.<br>\n<br>\nQuil unvoted because he didn't want \"any derps\" giving AP the chance to self-hammer (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958035#p6958035\">Post 192</a>).  Quil reiterates that someone could have either missed AP's self-hammer claim or would have put AP at L-1 anyways (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958962#p6958962\">Post 203</a>).  I call shenanigans.  AP's self-hammer claim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> wasn't buried in some massive wall post.  It was clearly stated in the single line post - hard to miss, and so I find it suspicious that Quil was concerned that someone would have missed it.  The other fear that someone would have put AP at L-1 in any event is also pretty unjustified, seeing as how it was only Page 8; and, in any event, such a vote would have effectively been the hammer so that the person making such a vote would have come under appropriate suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is all to say, Quil's unvote justification looks artificial.  He voted AP for perfectly adequate reasons for a Page 8 vote, but the immediate jump off based on the reasons articulated looks like a calculated attempt to look town from a player who knows that the voted player (AP) is frustrated town.<br>\n<br>\nFeeding into this is I also don't buy Quil's explanation of Quil's reading AP town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961567#p6961567\">Post 242</a>).  The timing doesn't really hold up:  Quil claims that he was starting to townread AP immediately after AP's claim of self-hammering (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958011#p6958011\">Post 188</a>), but that was never indicated in Quil's justifications for unvoting.  Also, the only thing that could justify Quil's AP town read from the time between Quil's AP vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a>) and Quil's AP townread (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>) would be AP's self-hammer claim - which I guess is plausible, but I don't see how that caused a 180 degree spin in Quil's assessment of AP (as opposed to simply being the turning point of Quil's diminishing suspicions of AP).</div></blockquote><br>\nI get the first three paragraphs and I do think Quil's vote + unvote was pretty awkward. Personally, if someone claimed that they would self-hammer, I wouldn't mind putting them at L-1. That's such an anti-town play that they would deserve to be lynched so I disagree with both you and Quil here. But I see the scum motivation there. I disagree that \"missing APs self-hammer threat\" was an invalid reason to unvote. People do skim and miss posts sometimes.<br>\n<br>\nThe chain of events seem to be:<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a> - Quil votes AP citing agreement with me and Yos and his earlier AP suspicion.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> - I'm a vt.

If you need details or if I missed questions, please let me know and I'll do my best to deal with them tonight when I'm NOT at work.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have a lot of experience with AP.  I don't think he's seen me as scum, which is why I asked -- alts exist, so maybe he has.  I don't have a great deal of self-awareness about my meta as either alignment; I can say I'm not much of a town leader because I'm not, but other than that I don't know what pings people.  I felt like AP needed to give some sort of support for his claimed meta read on me and I don't feel like he's really done that.<br>\n<br>\nSK -- why do I think he is more likely scum than not?  In my experience with him, he's been more out there and \"IDGAF\" as town.  Here he's not exhibiting that combination of combative-cute that I associate with his town game -- I think he lurks tremendously as scum, but I don't remember from where I think that, so it's sort of a wash for me.<br>\n<br>\nI thought Yos's interchange with GC was reachy and unconvincing.  I have a very strong townread on GC.  The fact that Yos backed off after a while looks more town than scum to me -- I think scum-Yos would have pushed that wagon with fervor because it's harder to start a new wagon than it is to continue pushing an existing one.  So I do think Yos is town, but I'm not ironclad like I am with GC and almost so with Chamber.  (Chamber is playing much like I recall from Oldy Mafia 2 -- I was scum in that game and I could give a link if it would be helpful, but it's crazy long.)<br>\n<br>\nI still do not like Axxle/Katsuki but since Kat is having the issue with spam filters, I have no interest in pursuing that today.  Either she'll have to replace out or she'll resolve it and I can argue with her directly.<br>\n<br>\nMy townread on Quaroath, interestingly enough, derives from a post that I had real trouble finding but now I have.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6969119#p6969119\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6969119#p6969119\" data-post-id=\"6969119\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 370</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1155\">Yosarian2</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6968992#p6968992\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6968992#p6968992\" data-post-id=\"6968992\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 363</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19826\">Empire</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nI just find that particular argument really weird because it suggests that Hamtaro is town and there is nothing on Yosarian's ISO that even implies a townread on that guy. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWho's Hamtaro?  Is that Quaroath?<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I don't have a strong read on Quaroth at the moment, either way.   I will say that he's probably not scum with GC; if GC is scum, Quaroth is probably town, and vice versa.    <br>\n<br>\nThe main point of my post was that GC's behavior seems weird and internally inconsistent.  I don't inherently have a problem with his push on Quar in a vacuum, but the timing was weird.     <br>\n<br>\nUnrelated note, I am going to be away for the weekend, going to leave in a few hours.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis was still part of the ongoing battle between GC and Yos.  I don't like these dichotomies in general (and have had little fits about them before, because they're a hallmark of lining up lynches) and this one really pinged me because I was sure GC was town.  So setting up a \"if Quar flips town GC is scum and vice versa\" thing made me think both Quar and GC were town.  As I've gradually come to believe that Yos might be town, that isn't such good justification NOW I guess.  But I just don't feel like Quar is scum and I stand by that even if my initial reasons might not have been 100 percent correct.<br>\n<br>\nPlease pummel me with the questions I've missed.

I really liked her questions to AP in posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955454#p6955454\">#85</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956496#p6956496\">#157</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956602#p6956602\">#161</a>, it's clear she smells a rat in what AP has been saying about her and she really nails him on his hypocrisy (even if she agrees with him that it's not a scumtell for him).<br>\n<br>\nI'm confused by what she was trying to get at with her question to Yos in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6964135#p6964135\">#293</a>. It's a question that seemingly isn't prompted by anything Yos has said about AP or asked her, and she mentions she specifically wants his response before giving her opinion, noting that she's \"pretty sure they won't be the same thing.\" I mean, this reads to me like she's found something alignment-indicative about AP's early game shenanigans and she has some idea of what she thinks Yos will think about it, but she doesn't follow up on Yos's answer at all, and when she next mentions her read on AP it doesn't include anything specific about the \"meltdown.\" <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Bookitty: where were you going with that&#8212;what's your opinion on what distinguishes AP!meltdown-town from AP!awkward-scum and why were you expecting Yos to have a different one to you?</div><br>\n<br>\nIt's odd that she does not respond to Yos after he replies to her massive attack on him / defense of GC in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969545#p6969545\">#372</a>. She says \"that's an invitation to engage with me\" and then doesn't engage with his response at all.<br>\n<br>\nAlso odd: in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969015#p6969015\">#364</a> she says she voted Axxle because she \"felt like he was passive AND active lurking\" and then in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6978069#p6978069\">#485</a> she says it was \"because of his initial comment, which struck me as just wrong in a lot of ways\"... it's not a direct contradiction, necessarily. But I think it's strange she didn't mention the problems she had with his initial comment in her first post about him.<br>\n<br>\nSigh, okay. I really think she is town for pursuing the fact that nobody's posting a case on her that she can defend herself from. The line to Quaroath in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6994171#p6994171\">#695</a> \"You don't like it when a question is framed to you that presupposes you are scum -- that is pretty much how I've felt from the start here\" reads as hella genuine too.

But, looking now, I buy into his explanations for voting new people and they look like they naturally arise as a result of his old scumreads fizzling out a bit. Furthermore, while I didn't agree with his case on Green Crayons it was at least internally consistent and well-argued and I really liked that he consciously made the decision in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6965784#p6965784\">#307</a> not to continue their back-and-forth because he felt it would clutter up the thread.

As I've already mentioned, I agree with Bookitty that his townmeta is considerably more combative. Additionally, he doesn't appear to have anything close to resembling a consistent train of thought (most of his posts have just been replies to the newest posts in the thread at the time). He voted and unvoted Pegasus, Katsuki and now has voted DrDolittle without mentioning any sort of suspicion of them in earlier posts. At all. .___.' His sudden push on me also strikes me as kiiiiiinda suspicious considering I've got the most votes and we're close to deadline. And I don't think it's consistent with him asking me why I haven't brought up my town meta, as I've explained. :I PEELY.<br>\n<br>\nEmpire / lalaladucks: I have consistently had no idea whatsoever about what to think of his much-discussed super weird posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953754#p6953754\">#36</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953754#p6953754\">#40</a>, except that I thought the lack of specificity in his reads in the latter felt a bit out of character. I did like how straightforward he was in his replies to people, though. I also super agreed with his #467 at the time he posted it, and since I was in a similar position with him re: having an \"extremely nebulous hold\" on the game, I felt like it pointed towards our thought patterns being similar. My assessment of Empire's scum meta is that he's not bad at it at all, and is capable of putting impressive amounts of effort into it, but that he just really hates playing it and the stress of deception really takes it out of him. To me, his overall pattern of play doesn't look like that. lalala's entrance is profoundly underwhelming though. The only thing that's stopping me from really having her as scum based on the shallowness of her catchup is that, for a time, my efforts at catching up were pretty surface-level too. :S", "time": "Tue Jun 30, 2015 11:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

I remember thinking he looked like he was pulling the classic scum tactic of commenting on strange / noteworthy posts as a substitute for looking for scummy ones in the early game (he was pretty vague about the alignment-indicativeness of the Empire and AP shenanigans, despite writing a lot of words about them). But he hasn't been doing that as much outside of the early game. I find his reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6991402#p6991402\">#641</a> unconvincing: putting Zito and Katsuki at town for their reactions to the whole daytalk thing strikes me as symptomatic of forgetting how to townhunt (admittedly, town occasionally do this as well), a theory which is further advanced by the fact he gave no reason for not wanting to lynch AP, Yos, chamber, myself, GC /or/ Empire&#8212;that's a lot of people to eliminate from your lynch pool for no reason. And even then, his reads on Sleepy and DrDo are pretty short... the Bookitty read is ok, but I think there's a bit too much bluster there for someone who doesn't appear to have any other strong reads. He's also thrown his vote around a fair bit recently in a way that makes me wonder how much continuity there is to his reads. AND YET, I'm not super comfortable with having him at scum right now? Maybe I should be? Call it gut.<br>\n<br>\nUT / PZ: UT spends most of his posts doing what I'm pretty sure is his schtick of bouncing in and out and commenting on whatever gets his attention. When he brings up his reads, they usually look like they've come out of nowhere. I liked his interactions with me over the AP wagon, but otherwise I don't really know how to read him (having an irritating counterproductive playstyle is generally pretty good for maintaining hard-to-distinguish town and scum play). Zito pretty much picks up where he left off. I'm a bit suspicious that he's focusing so much on me and SleepyKrew, not giving me much confidence he's trying to gamesolve. I also don't like how he coasted by on my wagon without giving any reasoning (he also didn't elaborate on his Yos read. or any other read, basically) and will be interested to see what he does now that it doesn't really exist anymore.

Re-reading some of Empire's posts, there were a bunch of town things - the way he changed his read on Yosarian  from scum to \"don't know what to do\" was one of them and it seemed like he was putting in effort to get a read there. I'm hesitant to consider Lalala's lack of knowledge of daytalk a towntell as this was already discussed in thread so I wouldn't put it past scum to fake it.

What makes me skeptical that he is simply a townie correctly reading AP are his reasons for his read: \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why is ap scum? his posts seems perfectly fine to me. there is contributin factions as well as good logic.</div>\" - These feel like shallow reasons to townread someone who demonstrably showed that he was a strong, active player even as he was being wagoned. \"Good logic?\" What good logic? In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6991520#p6991520\">Post 645</a>, he responds with \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">What I saw was that AP was contributing to the game. I didn't find AP's intro that strange.</div>\" There's no mention of good logic and \"contributing to the game\" by itself isn't really indicative of alignment-indicative. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nEarlier, when I called some of Doolittle's posts town tells, you claimed that was just his meta.   Don't you think that this kind of thing you're attacking him for (giving reads with just a few words to explain them) is also his meta?  This just feels like a weird case for you to make after making such a big deal about his meta a few pages ago. <br>\n<br>\nIf you really don't want to lynch SK for some reason, we still have other options.   But there is no way I'm going to vote Dolittle today without a good reason (and no, \"he defended someone that I think is town\" is not a good reason.)", "time": "Thu Jul 02, 2015 2:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

But I think we can do better.<br>\n<br>\nAnd here are the remaining players:<br>\n<br>\n(7) GreenCrayons - I haven't ISO'd him in depth yet but I overall lean town. There are some things I don't understand that I want explained like what changed his mind of Quil and when but I'll probably follow up on this D2.<br>\n<br>\n(8) Papazito - Willing to give him a pass for being the first to slip not knowing about daytalk. I wish his reaction was more town like \"how do you know scum have daytalk\" or a vote for me but his reaction was a but ambiguous. I found his posting since replacing in okay but not very telling either way.<br>\n<br>\n(9) Lalaladucks - Re-reading Empire's posts made me second-guess this read. There were some points where he was trying extremely hard to figure you out. I don't have an opinion on Lalala. She seems unremarkable for the most part.<br>\n<br>\n(10) Quaroath - The post where he responded to my Pbpa by changing his read felt like town switching reads based on new info. But I admit it doesn't amount to much considering many others seem townier as I disliked most of his earlier posts.<br>\n<br>\n(11) Quilford - I'm probably the only one who didn't instantly townread him based off of his readslist and there are a bunch of people I can see Quilford being scum with - Bookitty for a start but I haven't figured out whether I think their argument is Scum v Scum.<br>\n<br>\n(12) Bookitty - Easily the least town in the game for me. There are some townie pushes. Her questions to you looked town from an outside perspective but I'm not sure how much she's capable of when she's scum. She seems really low-key. I've second guessed myself here but through sheer POE, I think there's a good chance she's scum.

I'm trying to figure out if there's enough votes to lynch someone other then SK this day, because I don't think he's all that likely to be scum.   The reason I'm talking about lynching you, specifically, is because almost everyone who's posted (including me) suspects you.  You actually wouldn't be my first choice, you're about my third, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of support for Quar.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I'm not going to leave the SK wagon unless I'm sure there's enough votes to lynch someone else, because I don't want a no-lynch.<br>\n<br>\nIt's odd that in those two sentences you basically explain all of my motives, and yet you say that it's \"fishy\".  I don't really think SK is that likely to flip scum (although I don't have a town read on him either) but I don't want a no lynch so I'm not going to leave his wagon unless we've got enough votes to lynch someone else.   What is \"fishy\" about that, exactly?  <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, who do you think is scum?  Who do you want to lynch?

So you should basically avoid doing that at almost any cost, short of actually being lynched.

I think the way he handled it was silly, but not really scummy at all.  Obviously the best thing to do would be to just drop it and move on (like PZ suggested).  Your attack on Yos for going after townies all Day (citing me, you GC) definitely read as if you knew GC was town before he flipped.  Otherwise your suspicion on Yos would be new and more forward whereas it was obviously just carried over here and GC's death just reinforced it.<br>\n<br>\nIMO, GC's death implicates people at the fringe of his reads.  I find it relatively unlikely that people being townread by GC (chiefly DrD and Quar) are likely to kill him here.  Yosarian obviously has some motivation, but the kill really makes him look bad and I think Yos would be more interested in keeping GC alive since the two of them were kind of distracting and would periodically wall the thread up.  Also I don't think Yos was in ~that~ much danger of being lynched so a blatant GC kill would just draw attention to him by breaking up that dichotomy.", "time": "Tue Jul 07, 2015 7:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

Firstly, there isn't much to gain from the kill.  Yosarian wasn't under such pressure that offing GC was a notable benefit.  GC being alive formed a weird dichotomy with Yosarian in which they both went after each other and generated some apathy due to the nature of their arguments.  Purely the only reason for Yos to kill GC would be if he were truly afraid of GC getting him lynched which seems unlikely to me, especially given your point about Yos having an ego.  Secondly, the kill is going to make him look bad.  The first thing that crossed my mind on seeing the flip was \"oh ya Yosarian had a big fight with that guy\" and sure enough I look back and see that Quilford and Yos are the 2 biggest scumreads from GC.  Unless Yosarian is just having the time of his life and laughing his ass off at what he can get away with in this game, I don't see why its worth making the kill.  There would have been more subtle options (Boo?) or options that hit people largely considered town (Peg).<br>\n<br>\nI think the GC kill was partial utility (why would scum leave him alive if his reads were all garbage when they could be killing someone like Pegasus).  So his reads likely have like 2 scum in them imo in the (Yos, Quilford, Chamber, Katsuki) grouping.  When I compare the motivation for Katsuki and Chamber to kill GC, I see a world of difference.  Remove a detractor without it being super obvious, remind everyone that Yosarian shoved this townie hard and vice versa, and distract from \"obvtown\" not getting killed by making a prominent kill.", "time": "Tue Jul 07, 2015 7:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

I'm still pretty confident that AP isn't scum because he was the first one to upset the status quo: he, Chamber, and Katsuki seemed to be generally townread with himself and Chamber being the most townread along with me. I think it would have been easy for AP as scum to use that towncred and influence to direct lynches amongst the less townread players away from his buddies - but instead he turns on Chamber and I have a hard time seeing that as a scum-move. I'm still reading Katsuki as town.<br>\n<br>\nThe Green Crayons kill is probably based on his reads - I doubt scum figured out the Mason pair and in general, I can see where AP is coming from with his analysis.

His recent posts all look insanely town.  The bookitty interactions are insanely unnecessary as scum, but could easily come from confused and excited town.  No reason for him to kill GC.  I'm at the point where I would actually mastin-gambit over this read...(and then feel stupid when I end up wrong but eh).<br>\n<br>\nHamtaro- Don't really think he'd kill GC.  He's been under pressure and that kill just removes one of his few supporters.  Not seeing anything scummy from him really.  Push on me looks town-motivated here.<br>\n<br>\nBooKitty- Duh<br>\n<br>\nPegasus- Basically I'm convinced that hes invested in solving the game.  If he is scum, then hes rather good at it.  Not overly interested in lynching him in the foreseeable future.

Still a townread, but has motive to kill GC.  Would entertain although I suspect its not viable Today and I'm not interested enough to shove it hard.<br>\n<br>\nQuilford- Man what should I think about this slot?  Could easily see it making a kill on GC.  Some of the AtE from the slot makes me not want to lynch it.  Also pride in Bookitty read is sort of townie but not un-fakeable.  Slightly tempted to trust Bookie's read on him.<br>\n<br>\nDrD- Not convinced by last few posts.  Could definitely see this slot being partners with a few different people.

I read through all of Lalala's posts and there is a pretty consistent thread of attacking you because \"you don't feel the same\" (I'm assuming you've played before). She seemed like a new-ish, more casual player who isn't very articulate so I don't mind that much that she doesn't have amazing reasons to scumread you. It felt somewhat like Quilford's push on Untrod in that it is a push that town are more likely to do. I think scum would be either more hesitant or wait until they had more solid reasons before making a push like that and this one just seems off-the-cuff and town. I have a slight town-lean on Empire because the effort he put into trying to read Yos looked town and it is solidified with Duck's posting. I also think Ducks list of reads are likelier town - she has some unusual suspicions there i.e. not a \"safe\" list.", "time": "Wed Jul 08, 2015 11:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

That looked like buddying and just being disjoint from the game.<br>\n<br>\nPZ redirecting me to the GC/Yos walls when I said I felt lost was... ??  I was calling them prob town most of D1 and I read their walls and said I thought it was likely TvT at one point.  Just being redirected there looks like an attempt to distract me with tedious posts.<br>\n<br>\nHe made a soft push on Quilford right away and then got defensive when people (me and Pegasus?) pinged him about it and went on about how it wasn't a push.  But then he ends up wanting to lynch Quilford later anyways which just bleh.  Also just gut I guess.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nslight interjection: fucking LOL at the people blaming Yos for Bookitty claiming.  She didn't have to.  She had what, 2/6 votes and was a PR that doesn't really need to claim then.  I mean.  I did it with a VT claim at 5/7 and got tons of shit for it.

Congrats.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, there are a couple of big issues with that.  First of all, I didn't start off the day picking a fight with Bookitty, Bookitty started off the day picking a fight with me; she was on my suspect list, so I took the oppertunity to engange with her and repeat my questions, but I wasn't the one who started that in the first place.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, after Bookitty hinted at her role, if I was scum I would have done exactlaly what you're suggesting; back away suddenly, in a showy and dramatic way, and then someone else would have asked her if she was a mason.  All I had to do to out her as a mason at that point was to do literally nothing.   For that matter, after she had hinted, if I was scum I would have just shut the fuck up and then nightkilled her, not done...whatever it is you think I did.<br>\n<br>\nThirdly, your whole case seems to imply that I have literally superhuman powers of deduction; I could spot Boo was the mason based on nothing, and then I somehow knew I could make her claim by kind of attacking and kind of defending her while nobody was even voting for her?   I mean, I'm flattered, but nobody's that good.<br>\n<br>\nAnd fourth of all, it probably didn't matter what I did.  If you look at the trajectory of Bookitty's posts, it's pretty obvious that she rolled into the day thinking \"I'm going to pick a fight with Yos, then I'm going to claim mason, and then BOOM he's going to be dead!  Yeeehaaaa!\"   I don't think it mattered how I reacted to anything, looks like she was planning on claiming from the start (or else she probably wouldn't have hinted like that anyway).    <br>\n<br>\nSo, yeah.  Your whole case doesn't really make sense.   Nobody could do what you're accusing me of doing, and even if I could I wouldn't anyway.   Ten stars for comedic value though.

On the one hand, yeah, that's risky, you might accidentally lynch a power role without them getting a chance to claim.   I don't remember actually seeing happen, but it is always a risk.  <br>\n<br>\nBut on the other hand that kind of last second scramble is also the kind of high-pressure, no-margin for error, no time to think kind of situation that tend to cause scum to make serious mistakes, one way or the other.   <br>\n<br>\nIt's risky to make last second moves like that, but it's also one of the best times to actually get information and catch scum, IMHO.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, that was kind of a half-hearted effort.  If I was really serious about trying to run you up, I would have unvoted Sk, voted for you, and see if I could get people to follow me, and then maybe switched back to hammer SK if not.  A \"are there enough people around interested in lynching BooKitty\" question is more an attempt to get information and generate some last-second reads on people then anything else; I didn't really expect that 6 people would show up, say \"yes, we all want to lynch Bookitty\" and then all switch over at once.

So did you, Yos, whether you realise it or not.  You used virtually the same words I did in doing so, so I noticed it immediately and tried to back off you because I assumed you were a power role.

Either:<br>\n<br>\nMy softclaiming was obvious to everyone and your behaviour surrounding it was a complete waste of time, or<br>\nMy softclaiming was pretty opaque, only you probably noticed it and thus you didn't need to try to hide it and you could have just dropped it at that point.<br>\n<br>\nYou're arguing that the first was true, but then threw a fit because I outright stated what apparently was already obvious.

Especially not on day 1, and especially not if the game is moving slowly and needs to be shaken up a bit.    These days I tend to think that townies need to be aggressive, on the attack, need to be risk-takers, and need to aggressively put pressure on people to get the game moving, and the earlier in the game it is and the less info the town has, the more true that is.   Townies are going to be wrong a lot, but it's still better to lead the town and risk being wrong then to sit back, let the scum take the lead, and guarantee it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I didn't agree 100 percent with GC's counterattacks, but I didn't understand why you were focusing so much attention on someone who hadn't done anything scummy that *I* had seen.

You had information I didn't have.  So you were able to just dismiss my whole case without really stopping and thinking about it first, and instead were more trying to look for ways to pick it apart right from the start.  Perfectly natural, but from my point of view, it felt like you were trying to pick me apart instead of trying to understand what I was thinking, and it just felt weird.  It felt even weirder because you weren't actually voting for me and didn't seem to be tunneling on me; I really wasn't sure what you were doing, and it was giving me a really weird gut read on you.<br>\n<br>\nIt's a pretty common problem; people with information like cops often tend to look like scum to the rest of the town because they know stuff that the rest of the town doesn't and it makes their reactions look off.   I remember one game I was a cop with a guilty on day 1, was trying to lynch the guy without claiming, and almost got ran up to a lynch myself because I was trying so hard to lynch him for reasons that weren't quite solid and it looked really scummy to the rest of the town.

I don't think anyone else thought so either.

I tend to make those calls based on the rest of their play.

Because he did post a lot of reads/walls content.<br>\n<br>\n2. I don't think GC kill exonerates Quar mostly because of reasons I outlined earlier: GC wasn't really the one going to bat for him, that was you and Chamber.

But I actually want to talk more on your latest post: what are your doubts about him? My issue is not just with the fact that I find his content scummy but he fits that lurker-scum profile almost perfectly. He's not being blatant about it. He does churn out a wall once in two days.

Nearly the entire post is you pointing out that you were confused by Bookitty's questions, found them strange and noted that she doesn't follow up or engage with her scumreads. The only three town things you pointed out were a) Nailing AP on hypocrisy. b) Persuing the fact that nobody posted a case on her. c) Agreeing with her meta-assessment of SleepyKrew. Out of those, the only decent reason is the third one on SleepyKrew. The second one; being frustrated at the lack of a case on you is null as scum could easily be frustrated at not knowing why they are caught. Would like an elaboration on why you think this is a towntell. The first one - the hypocrisy point makes no sense to me. She <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956602#p6956602\" class=\"postlink\">asks</a> AP if he considers hypocrisy a scumtell and when he <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956842#p6956842\" class=\"postlink\">says he doesn't</a>, she <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969015#p6969015\" class=\"postlink\">townreads</a> him for it which strikes me as a really shallow read but it is far from \"nailing him\" on the hypocrisy point since she never actually scumreads him.<br>\n<br>\nA few other reads I want elaborated on: <br>\n(1) What exactly about Yos's case on Green do you find \"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6999924#p6999924\" class=\"postlink\">internally consistent</a>\" and why is it townish on his part? I don't know what you mean by \"internally consistent\" and how it applies here so defining it and explaining it in context would help.<br>\n(2) You never talk about AP in your initial reads-list on D1. Explain your read and your reasons for them.<br>\n(3) What is it about PZ that caused a \"burgeoning\" townread in contrast to his D1 play where you didn't seem to like anything he posted in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7002137#p7002137\">Post 823</a>?<br>\n(4) When you get the chance, I'd like to see you talk about what caused the change in your read on DrDolittle from \"probably town\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7000005#p7000005\">Post 804</a> to nearly at the bottom of your scumlist in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7046831#p7046831\">Post 1214</a>.", "time": "Sun Jul 12, 2015 9:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

I'd normally be afraid that this is a 'shallow' read based on them both generating content and that its alignment neutral, but I am not really having a hard time identifying with their posts on an emotional level at all.  I especially think Yos's stance on my lynch is more likely to come from town...or at least the way he expressed it is, which is to say hes essentially ready to take any blame for lynching me.  He never outright said it- but it was somewhat implied and I overall don't really think he's faking anything.  GC....my points for Yos-town kind of rolled of my tongue and I'm having a bit more trouble expressing my feelings on GC.

He seems to have absolutely no sense of self-preservation at all, and really never has; it doesn't look like he's picking who to attack and who to defend based on convenience or based on what's more likely to keep him alive.  I kind of like the way he's gone back and forth on Kat, because I feel the same way; from a logical/scumhunting point of view, Kat's posts and voting pattern looks like scum to me, but a lot of Kat's post have a pretty convincing \"townie\" tone and style to them.

I'm townread you before for your push on AP and now for your most recent set of posts. You can disagree if you want but based on what's been put in this thread so far, I deduced that most you vs AP battles will end with him winning. Regardless, it is mostly a moot point, my read only strenghthened based on the latest content. <br>\n<br>\n@ Bookitty - While it may be fulfilling to lynch everyone whose playstyle varies from yours enough to be a frustration, we'll run out of mislynches pretty fast if we do that. SleepyKrew <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> town. And I'm relatively confident Katsuki is too. <br>\n<br>\nA lot of your suspicion of him seems to be based on his push of you and his not giving reasons why he thought you were scum. I think reasons - or the lack of them - are primarily a playstyle thing. When people don't give reasons, I normally try and see if their positions make sense to me and I understand almost everything Katsuki posted in the thread. <br>\n<br>\nHe started off suspecting AP in his opening presumably because of AP's opening in the first few pages which many found scummy (including you).<br>\n<br>\nHe suspects you of being scum, potentially with Quar because you dismissed the Quar wagon. As someone who was pushing Quar at the same time, I had a similar reaction (that you were scum with Quar). While we know now that you are town, this wasn't information anyone had at that time and Katsuki's speculations matched mine pretty closely.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7003085#p7003085\">Post 833</a>, he cautions me about pushing a lynch on Lalala stating that she was town. I didn't initially get his reasoning but I assume it is because he thought (just like I do now) that Lalala's opening push on AP was town. It was based on reasoning similar to Katsuki's (AP's first few posts were scummy) and that got me reading her posts in more depth to see what I missed.<br>\n<br>\nHis D2 vote and push on AP was also based on reasoning I can relate to regardless of AP's alignment - and I still think your read on AP was weak - him saying that hypocrisy wasn't a scumtell as opposed to flailing is alignment null. Most people tend to tell the truth about game philosophies as scum. Katsuki's reaction to AP's readslist was fairly town where AP accused him and Lalaladucks of being scum - it makes sense because Lalaladucks seemed to have been a pretty strong townread for Katsuki and AP's posts were just re-inforcing his earlier scumread from when he entered the game.<br>\n<br>\nKatsuki not answering your questions might be frustrating but you are confirmed town and if town, he doesn't gain as much by explaining himself to you as he would by pushing his scumreads.<br>\n<br>\nHe's one of my few solid townreads and in a game where half the players are disengaged and phoning it in, townreads have been hard to come by. I'd be very disappointed if we wind up lynching Katsuki. If I move my vote, it'd probably be to save Katsuki but at this point Quar is the biggest wagon <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> my biggest scumread so I want to stick with that.", "time": "Thu Jul 16, 2015 9:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

This doesn't look conclusive at all to me; the effort appears conscious and in a reasonable timeframe but also nothing about it screams town/scum to me in particular.<br>\n<br>\nKatsuki is still likely town (I think, I hope) but I know that he has done things like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5617506#p5617506\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\">this</div></a> where he faked a Tracker guilty on town and got town lynched with it.  Soooooo forgive me if I'm really edgy about this softclaim and the whole situation in general despite my good senses telling me to just trust Katsuki's softclaim and burn the odd-claim-out with fire.<br>\n<br>\nX-shot gunsmith claim is certainly odd.  Trying to argue whether or not it fits in the setup is just irrelevant mod-WIFOM.  &#191;Robocopter? ran Futurama mafia which had a Gunsmith in it for no reason whatsoever just to fuck with the players.  There is no reason a mod can't just run a GS instead of a cop; it gives scum possible fake claims when they get investigated and is just weaker than a cop overall.  That said, the claim DOES look out of place a tad bit and the CC from Katsuki makes me want to lynch it.  I was thinking that with mason/mason there was likely one other weak role out there.  2 roles more would be a lot and probably not something I would peg Ether for including.  A 1-shot GS would make sense with 2 masons.  1-shot GS + something else really weak and a mafia Rolecop might make sense but ehhhhhhh, less likely.  Unfortunately, Katsuki could just be entirely full of shit because being entirely so is his schtick.<br>\n<br>\nDucks posts on the last page.....she singles out the one objectively correct and most alignment neutral post from me to call sketchy.  Terrible scumhunting or just scum?, find out tonight at 11pm on CNN!  Nothing from her on that page really makes me think she's town.  The lack of answering my question about what was different was still terrible and still a dodge of engaging me on the situation.  Hand waving her lack of response away with \"well you didn't say anything interesting\" is pretty unforgivable considering I followed up on her accusation and asked her to just tell me what she perceived was different.  Like.  ITs not like I was asking for an essay or a strong opinion, just a follow up clarification on her initial observation which she wouldn't even do but WHATEVER.  I'm perfectly willing to look like a moron when she flips town and I tunneled her over trivialities.<br>\n<br>\nWhat else needs to be said....Yos and Pegasus are still hilariously town.  Quilford is making good posts which doesn't make him town, but makes me less inclined to lynch him for sure.  While I understand the arguments about DrD and Chamber not being on a scumteam together, I respectfully disagree that they should be given much weight.  I still think DrD and Ducks are scum, especially after the point regarding DrD not voting me.  In fact the vote on Chamber makes little sense to me at all which makes me think it could very well be a bus.  Quar might be scum and I wish I had a strong opinion on him right now.  Part of me is saying that the CC + Mason claims + weird claim = scum and the other part of me wants to believe that the claim is too out there to be scum and that Katsuki is too erratic to be a trustworthy source in this situation, alignment aside.  At this point, Katsuki should basically have just full claimed IMO.  If he's town and we lynch scum-Quar Today, then he's basically certain to be shot regardless of how much he claims and I kind of want the information just for my own curiosity and benefit.  Mmmmmmmm.  I will say 100% that if we lynch Quar and he flips town then I am voteparking Katsuki regardless of what he claims and how much evidence of being a VI he can muster up.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Chamber</span> although I will hammer if the alternative is NL or something.", "time": "Thu Jul 16, 2015 8:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62195&start=1350", "forum": "53", "thread": "62195"}

Two masons + a gunsmith is already arguably too much town power.    Any other strong town power role would almost certanly mean Quar is a liar.   Doctor, vig; there's a lot of roles that would just break the game wide open with 2 masons and a gunsmith.   <br>\n<br>\nI'd really rather we not speculate about roles any farther at this point.   Only way we should press Kat for more of a claim today is if we're planning to lynch him today otherwise.  <br>\n<br>\nFrankly, assuming Quar flips scum, I don't want the scum to know if they should target you or Kat tonight.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I don't think \"x shot gunsmith\" even sounds like a real role, and Quar hasn't posted for days now.     I really think he's going to flip scum.  I was willing to wait a day just in case, but Kat's claim drops the odds of Quar being town below where that seems worthwhile to do, IMHO.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you really think Quar might be town here and you have a better idea of who to lynch, I'm willing to sheep on you here.

No follow-up on the meta-digging. His is the fourth vote on the wagon. I dislike the vote without checking what he said he would check and could potentially see this as scum wanting in on the bus so he doesn't look bad.

This sequence is likely town because scum motive to draw momentum from Quar to Quil is undermined by the quick unvote and vote of PapaZito who had no wagon on him. So here, he doesn't have the towncred of being on Quar. He doesn't achieve scum goals of pushing a counterwagon and saving Quar. It doesn't make sense at all from scum. He also committed to reading Quil as town which means he'd be expected to vote Quar if D1 had come down to Quil vs Quar.

It is the sort of post that obligates him to vote Quar if that wagon becomes viable but doesn't give him a lot of towncred because he was only a \"compromise\" vote.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7059853#p7059853\">Post 1299</a> - Says that Quar could be scum re-iterating his scumread from D1.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7065076#p7065076\">Post 1381</a> - Says that he doesn't think Quar is scum.

The experiment he said he did of looking at random games to see if he could guess his alignment shows a lot of scumhunting effort and I find it unlikely that scum would do it for their partners.

I lean town on this one as well. The scum motive is obvious - speak out against his partner's wagon hoping that it would dismantle. But the town motivation that he doesn't trust anything I'm doing, feels uneasy about a wagon he thinks is based on conf-bias and stopping it seems overwhelmingly more likely than the scum explanation. It also is fairly consistent with his earlier thought process and his later claims that my playstyle traits makes him distrust me.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6983431#p6983431\">Post 535</a> - This looks fairly reasonable as well as not a lot of people seemed like they had their own reasons for voting Quar and the wagon seemed to be built on a case he disagrees with.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6983640#p6983640\">Post 537</a> - The issue I have with this post is why he didn't say anything about me when I first made the case on AP.

It could simply be an issue on ethics/principles though. I have a feeling that he was scum, he would say that in his private scum topic and vent there. I haven't discounted that it was meant to incite the town to rally for Quar or make town think that Quar was being unfairly treated to incite the mob.

For one, I think he would have distanced a partner who he thought may not make it to endgame, he wouldn't have been so blatant about pursuing Katsuki as opposed to Quar. The few concerns I had were that he was missing a lot of what made Quar scum and never really questioned Quar or considered him potential scum focusing more on defending him from the pushes and wagons made on him. The town motive for this can be explained by his distrust of the ones pushing Quar and I feel scum wouldn't be as blatant. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ Quilford</div>, I haven't forgotten your promised case on Chamber at the end of D2.

In this Quar post, he accuses Yos and Empire of distancing. He first takes issue with Yos saying that GC/Quar aren't scum together and interprets it as Yos saying that only one of them can be scum. Then he accuses Yos and Empire of distancing, and votes Yos as the likelier scum. I didn't like this accusation when he made it and it seemed like he was quickly rushing to post a counter-theory to Empire's tinfoil theory that he and Yos are scum together. <br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6973860#p6973860\">Post 417</a> - Yos's first post where he attacks Quar. He had no suspicion on Quar earlier. The response was overaggressive. Quar could easily have misinterpreted Yos's \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">if GC is scum, Quaroth is probably town, and vice versa</div>\" as saying that if GC is town, Quar is scum as the \"vice versa\" here isn't very clear as to what it refers to. The hyperaggression from Yos was unwarranted and looks like scum wanting to place an early bus vote on a buddy that might be lynched. <br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6973891#p6973891\">Post 418</a> - Votes Quar. Apparently, the post from Quar convinced him that he was wrong on Green Crayons and now that he thinks Quar is scum, GC has to be town. The problem I have with this is that one post by Quar wasn't close to the amount of evidence he had against GC. Quar could have easily been town and misinterpreted what you meant by the GC/Quar dichotomy. It doesn't take away from the pile of evidence you had against GC and comes suspiciously after I voted Quar. <br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6974753#p6974753\">Post 422</a> - This Quar post is actually something that makes me doubt my Yos scumread.

I don't particularly see why Ether would include that when the core of the setup is clearly masons/RB and the commuter is just kind of awkward.  I guess it can help town get back to Evens with the RB but it feels like a tad bit of overkill and it seems unnecessary.  Furthermore, the claim looks extremely convenient for mafia in this situation.  A kill goes missing which sucks for scum, but claiming commuter throws just enough doubt on the whole situation to invalidate an RB/Doc claim.  Its also such a miniscule-y nothing of a role that it can exist or not in pretty much any scenario and the game will still look balanced.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nAll that said, I'm not totally convinced that Katsuki is scum although I am 100% sure that Quilford is town.  Chamber is really giving me mixed emotions.  His certainty that Katsuki was lying sort of makes sense given that he expressed similar concerns as I did about his reliability on Day 1.  Of course if Chamber is scum then he would know Katsuki is lying and could just be defending me for credit.  Chamber's insistence that the Commute claim was legitimate before Quilford claimed despite Chamber's distrust of Katsuki is kind of weird....So the tracker claim was obviously a lie but the Commute claim wasn't?  The logic for that seems to be based on \"Well the tracker fake claim makes sense in the context of having commuted\" which..... is kind of like saying that Katsuki claimed to be a Square but later retracted and said hes just a Rectangle, which must be true since Katsuki wouldn't claim Square unless he were at least sort of a Square. :S<br>\n<br>\nRight.

Yet, he defended Quar quite blatantly. He even went so far as to read Quar's past games using my case as a baseline so he could get a read on both Quar and me.

But (at least in general) if a scum makes a list of everyone else in the game, they don't put their partner in the \"most town\" catagory, they put them in the middle somewhere.    At least, as a rule.   They also tend to try to defend their partners in indirect ways, or in \"soft\" ways, or by attacking people who are attacking them.   <br>\n<br>\nAll of that is all WIFOM, of course.   AP's play in general doesn't really make any sense as scum, though.

When he first claimed, your play looked to me like you wanted him dead and once he died and flipped town, you'd point back to that game and say that he was town and lying so you could get away with it.<br>\n<br>\nThe only reason you brought up that I see as legitimate is wondering why Kats was so sure Quar was town despite him believing Quil's claim when both Quil's and Quar's claims were of similar strength. But for someone that fakes guilties on people, I wouldn't rule out that he just didn't believe Quar and wanted him dead. Who's your best bet for scum with Katsuki and why?

I also really don't like pegasus' method of presenting points. It annoyed me (and made me suspicious of him) when he did it to AP.

I asked you in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6990711#p6990711\">Post 627</a> and your answer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6991520#p6991520\">Post 645</a> wasn't really an answer. I want to know specifically what you've found off about Chamber and your reasons for scumreading him.<br>\n2) The dichotomy between your posts to AP and the refusal to vote him on D2 doesn't make sense to me.

(It's not the reason GC voted for him, since GC didn't trust me, but other then that.)   I also never left the wagon until the very end of the day, and started the wagon on him on day 2 once that whole bookitty mess was cleared up.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, if you think that I'm overestimating how much influence I've had in this town, I guess that's a matter of opinion.    I really don't think that either the day 1 AP wagon nor the day 1 Quar wagon would ever have gone anywhere without me leading those wagons, but I suppose it's possible they could have. But note that the post you're attacking here was in response to Bookitty implying I hadn't done anything this game, so I was giving examples of all the big things I did on day 1.   That's the context here, which you seem to be missing.   I wasn't claiming \"credit\" for anything, I was explaining what I've done this game.

There is no way in hell the town would have lynched Quar at all if I hadn't caught him on day 1, and I caught him because of the bullshit case he tried to make against me, and the way he reacted when I called him out on it.   <br>\n<br>\nI think you're dramatically overestimating the importance and influence of your own play this game and dramatically underestimating mine.

His previous read on Bookitty in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6983740#p6983740\">Post 541</a> seemed to be moving townward so it makes no sense to telegraph a vote change from Quar to Bookitty at this point. I'd really like an elaboration for the explanation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7008633#p7008633\">Post 883</a> on why you had second thoughts about the Bookitty townread.</li></ul></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI have already explained that.   BooKitty's response to my attack on GC case on me was really, really weird; now we know why that was, she's a pro-town role who had information, but at the time, I just knew that she didn't seem to be scumhunting, didn't seem to be listening to what I was saying, and it seemed like she kept misrepesenting my case against GC.  And every time I explained, she just seemed to get more adjtated, ignore my explination, and attack me from a differnet direction, but it didn't seem like she was scumhunting me.   Of course now we know why that was, but at the time, it just seemed really strange and scummy, and gave be a bad gut read on her.   <br>\n  <br>\nAlso; \"telegraph moving off the Quar wagon\"?  Really?  The point of post 639 was just me expressing that in general I thought Bookitty's play looked suspicious, but that that one specific post I was talking about looked like a town tell to me.   <br>\n<br>\nWhen I threaten to vote someone (like Bookitty, or lala) but keep my vote on someone else (Quar), I'm expressing suspicion of them, and trying to communicate that/get a reaction, but it also means that I'm still more suspicious of Quar then I am of them.   There's nothing wrong with having multiple suspicious, and in fact anyone paying attention to the game probably should.<br>\n<br>\nIf I had wanted to move my vote off of Quar at any time, I quite easily could have.   I had other suspects.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\n(4) His overblown townread on AP is ridiculous. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nUnless it's right.  Which, frankly, it probably is, and that's actually just becoming more and more clear as the game goes.    If it's right, then that just means I'm good at playing the game and good at reading people.   <br>\n<br>\nJust because you don't understand how to read a player like AR, doesn't mean it's impossible to do so.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\n<li>His latest analysis is shallow and contrived [/list][/list]</li></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI spent more then an hour on that analysis, as you can easily see from the time of my posts. And there was nothing \"shallow\" or \"contrived\" about it; not in the slightest.  I read every single post in that time period, mentioned/summarized all the posts related to the day 1 Quar wagon (more for my own use then for everyone else, frankly), and used them to try to figure out who his most likely scumbuddies were.   <br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I'm just going to assume you're just being deliberately offensive in order to try to troll a reaction out of me.   And, you know, that's not even a scumtell on your part, that's a common way to try to get a read on someone.

Then I unvoted AP and voted GC, at which point the AP wagon collapsed almost immediately, and the entire game was nothing but several pages of walls going back and forth between me and GC, and other people's reaction to the Yos v GC fight, with almost nothing else going on.   Then I unvoted GC and went after Quar, at which point everyone stopped talking about GC and the Quar wagon pretty quickly became the focus of the game.<br>\n<br>\nFrom my point of view, it felt like I was the one leading the whole town pretty much up to that point.  Every major event, every change of focus, that had happened up to that point seemed (from my perspective) to have been something initiated by me.   I was actually worried about that, because it felt like something like half the people in the game were lurking or hanging back, and I was worried that that might be because I was posting too much, and that was making it harder to get a read on a lot of other people.   So I made the deliberate decision at that point to start to hang back a little and let other people take the lead for a while.<br>\n<br>\nI get that you think your day 1 contributions to the Quar wagon might have been even bigger then mine, and fine, objectively you may be right.

I'm always stubborn but my potshots comments that I somewhat regret and challenging aura that manifests in asking to be lynched is not the sort of bravado I have as scum.
