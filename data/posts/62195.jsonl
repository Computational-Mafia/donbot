There will not be a lynch if the game goes to night due to this deadline--someone has to consciously place a hammer vote.</li><li>I will probably be online when the deadline strikes, and I'll lock the thread at that point. But if I'm not, and you beat me to the punch with a hammer, you can have it. The lynch will go through normally in that case.</li><li>You may choose to go to night without a lynch before then, by having at least half of the players <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: No Lynch</span>. (That's half, not a full majority.)</li><li>Votes should be posted in the format <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Anarchy</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Anarchy</span>. I expect them to be entirely bold, but don't try to exploit this to trick someone. I will register misspellings and nicknames if I can figure out who you're referring to. You do not have to <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span>, but you're welcome to do so anyway.</li><li>When a player has the majority of the votes at a single point, it is dead and the game goes to twilight. Feel free to post in twilight.</li><li>Night deadlines are \"whenever I next get online 48 hours after [the lynch scene/finding any necessary replacements].\" I will not announce day sooner, even if all choices are in. If I'm missing your choice and I know you're online, I'll contact you and give you a minute to think of something.</li><li>Failing that, the game will just have to go to day without you. If any anti-town faction with unlimited shots misses a chance to kill, then a fallback kill will still go through--trying to confirm people through their inactivity is not recommended. This default option only applies to the scum nightkill and compulsory roles. Any other abilities will simply go unused.<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">What is and isn't allowed:</span></span></li><li>Please don't be a giant raging asshole. I'm asking you nicely here.</li><li>Unless otherwise specified, living players can't communicate with each other out of the thread. Anyone who's an exception to this rule will get a private topic. They're free to talk outside of it, if they have a method they prefer. Transcripts from that are appreciated, but if you're Skyping or something, don't worry about taping every single thing you say. I trust you.</li><li>You <span style=\"font-style: italic\">may</span> rant to both dead players and nonplaying friends, although you're encouraged to first make sure that said friends aren't interested in replacing in with you. (I am of course available, sympathetic and discreet. Feel free to AIM me at CaffieneDeity, or Skype me at unvote.) Regardless of where you found them, rantbuddies may not reveal their own opinions on the game, and nothing about your discussion should surface publicly before the game is over.</li><li>\"Dead\" means \"dead.\" Don't AIM the guy who hammered you to tell him what a scumbag he is, and definitely don't keep making game-relevant posts. Just lie there...and think dead thoughts.</li><li>Read your role PM and <span class=\"noboldsig\">summarize it in your confirmation</span>. Unless I've posted it publicly, you may not reference its wording in-thread. In fact, don't reference the wording of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any</span> private messages anyone sends you about this game. No timestamps. Nothing.</li><li>Do not try to encourage others to break the above rule. Don't push me.</li><li>The <span style=\"color:darkred; font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">ooc</span> font and [mech] tags are my domain. Don't use them. Don't pretend to use them.</li><li>The smallest font size you can use is <span style=\"font-size: 70%; line-height: 116%;\">size 70</span>. Don't use a font color with the intent of making it more difficult to see, either.<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">What to expect from me:</span></span></li><li>Do try to be active, and leave a notification in-thread and/or by PM if that's not possible. I will automatically prod anyone who has not posted over 48 hours--and that's pretty lenient; you are expected to post more than once every two days. If asked, I will disclose the status of any prod.</li><li>If you don't post in-thread in response to a prod within 48 hours, I will seek a replacement to take over your role. Future prods must be responded to within 24 hours. (I might bump this back up later at my discretion, but don't count on it.) I may seek replacement for a player who lurks consistently without breaking this rule, but you'll have some sort of warning first.</li><li>I'll try to post one votecount per page, as close to the top as possible. If I make errors, please correct me.</li><li>I'm one of those \"spirit-of-the-game\"-type hippies. This ruleset is a guideline. I reserve the right to change it at will, and even in extreme circumstances enforce it retroactively. If a strategy feels shady to you, you might want to take it up with me first.<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Spectators</span></span></li><li>Got a song request? Feel free to call in via PM, AIM (CaffieneDeity) or Skype (unvote), and I'll see what I can do. Keep it mainstream, please: nothing too obscure to have a karaoke version on YouTube.

I mean, I guess his questioning seems alright to me but I want to hear more from him reads-wise.

I can see why someone unfamiliar with UT's playstyle would think that reaction to Quilford's post was scummy (although it's really not out of character for UT-town at all). And what I liked about Pegasus's statement of reads was that it felt like he took some initiative - I don't think anyone had stated townreads on either myself or chamber yet and I liked that he came out of the gate with those, especially the townread on me because I feel like my posts were something he could have easily latched onto as scum."}

It was a decent effort to move the game forward. Untrod's reaction to it was to belittle and minimize it rather than respond seriously.

His reads leave a lot to be desired. The weirdest thing I noticed was that his top three townreads (Empire, Chamber, Quilford) were the exact same three people that I read as town before AP posted. Considering he was posting responses to other players and declaring their posts \"town\" or making shifty faces to express his disapproval, I'd expect him to comment on those reads and agree but he didn't mention me at all except to later point out that my Untrod vote was bad. I think having not one but multiple reads overlap with your own would be worthy of comment. Angry's posts to me seem a bit targeted - like he thinks I would lurk and be an easy lynch. He modded a game where I posted once in 25 pages (I was mafia then but legitimately busy and ease of lynching is something that translates across alignments).<br><br>Untrod's later posts haven't diminished my scumread on him and I don't really understand his defense of AP. I could maybe see on a surface level saying that Angry's posts being content rich referred to Angry posting a long wall and a list of reads. I also think AP should explain what it is about Untrod that was so town beyond saying that Untrod is town for no reason at all. <br><br>There are a couple of other players I think are town since I last posted: Green and Yos. Green because he focused on the big picture when voting AP rather than individual points which is similar to how I'm seeing AP. AP's logic isn't unreasonable but his intent seems malignant. Green's questions to Yos about Yos's initial AP vote were good digging. My reaction to Yos's first AP vote was similar. @ Chamber, you are going to have to walk me through why Green is scum because I'm not seeing it. <br><br>Yos's response to UT's gif was similar to mine except he thought AP was scummier. His subsequent meta was actually well-used. He found something scummy and then went to check whether the scummy thing was present in a towngame which makes sense with his mindset, and it doesn't come across as doing busy work because he was pursuing his biggest scumread while checking to see if he could be wrong.<br><br>My townread on Chamber lessened a bit. I don't see the point on checking the number of times AP uses emoticons nor do I follow his DrDolittle vote which I want explained. The series of questions to Green followed by a vote seems odd and I don't see what's scummy about thinking another player was scum and then going back for specifics only to find that it was a big picture read.<br><br>The townread on Empire increased. His read on me makes sense with his other reads (Chamber and Quilford) and he pointed out what AP neglected. And if he read Bullfit, I think if he was scum here, he wouldn't be so eager to defend me. I'm not clear though if you are saying that this is how Untrod always plays regardless of alignment or whether you are explicitly saying that Untrod is town. Clarify that for me."}

Buddying Yosarian over thinking that UT was scummy.  Don't try and put more into this than there is.  Ut posted a goddamn picture and Yos commented that  it was scummy.  Thinking that a picture is scummy is an extremely flimsy basis for asserting that someone is probably town for thinking the same way as you.

I dont care how many town games you want to compare it to.  It doesn't come across as busywork because what???  Your reasons for saying it doesn't look like busywork are silly.  Me being his top scumread - well I HOPE he'd care more about me, his alignment aside if thats what hes pitching as his #1 read.  He checked to see if he could be wrong, but he didnt even look at a scum game of mine?  How do you know he was actually evaluating my games rather than just cherrypicking them or whatnot?  Its not like he found anything specific that he commented on, just vague statements about a lack of something that was there."}

Are you conveniently going to continue ignoring the context of my first posts in the game and ignore talking about all subsequent posts I make.

I'm guessing this would have to do with his narrative about what he did in this thread, particularly how he read me.  I'll make an honest effort to look for what you are hinting at in a bit today.  I have fairly mixed opinions about GC right now.  Mostly that his overall presence has looked increasingly town, but he feels different than I've seen him before.

No one is townreading me (except now Chamber), I'm a VT, I'm going to be a distraction if I remain in the game, and my points are being largely ignored this game.  To summarize, I agree with your opinion that getting lynched as town can be protown and thats what I'm supporting right now.  This game isn't the sole source of my mental well-being or lack thereof.  If you actually cared about what I'm doing, you could find hints as to why I might be upset though.  Forget hints, I've been pretty damn transparent this game.  I'm not sold on Quil's interactions with me being scummy but I am having doubts about my read there.<br><br>GC, I have no idea what point you are trying to make about chamber.

The only difference between them is their experience. Pegasus being a new guy who finds that sort of behavior scummy makes sense to me, and if he's really trying to jump on surface level things as scum, why didn't he just jump onto the case Quilford put or even my early posts?

I never said otherwise.   I'm also asking you questions to try to understand where you're coming from, because I still don't get it. <br><br>From my point of view, what it looks like is that you wanted to quietly ride a bad bandwagon all the way to lynch  without drawing attention to the fact that you were on it, while at the same time trying to attack others in order to set up mislynches for future days.  Specifically by making cases that would be even more effective in the future if AP flipped town (both against Q and against me).   When chamber questioned you out on it, you gave a very weak explanation, and still never really acted like you were trying to scumhunt AP.   <br><br>(Of course, that's if AP is town; it's also possible you're buddies with AP and wanted to get a vote on him into the voting record but never really wanted him to be lynched, which is why your attacks on him were so weak.  It could go either way; if you do flip scum, it doesn't really tell me much about AP's alignment.)<br><br>Your early-game case against me also felt very artificial and weak; you attacked me for acting in the exact same way I acted in my last game with you when I was town, then claimed you forgot about that game and even claimed you didn't remember that I was town in that game, and basically refused to go look at it even when chamber brought it up, even though it would have taken literally 30 seconds to do so.  You basically just said \"whelp, I guess we'll never know, but I'm going to keep suspecting Yos anyway\" rather then bother to find out.  It felt very artificial, like you wanted to position yourself so you could attack me later (say, after the AP wagon) but didn't actually care if what you were saying was true or not.<br><br>At this point, you being scum is the explanation for your actions that makes the most sense to me.    I've been trying to get you to give some kind of alternate explanation, something that makes sense to me if you're town, and I haven't seen one yet."}

That doesn't negate the reasons I was voting him before that, though.<br><br>As for 277, it doesn't really address the issues I have with his earlier play.   I wasn't going to respond to it line by line because this has already turned into too much of a wall-of-text war, and that doesn't help anyone.   To address some key points, though:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>--&gt; this is dumb from GC-scum perspective because VCA would bite me in the ass if AP is town</div></blockquote><br><br>Not really.   Half of the people in the game are going to vote for any wagon that goes all the way to a lynch; being on a wagon on day 1 that end up lynching a scummy-looking VT isn't much of a tell.   And, in any case, my other point was that it looked like he was already trying to deflect blame for the wagon on to others.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>--&gt; this is dumb from a GC-scum perspective because \"set&lt;ting&gt; up mislynches\" before a flip is dumb and heavy-handed, and while I see plenty of people actually voice this suspicion (as both town and scum), I don't think I have ever seen scum actually do this<br><br>---&gt; this is also a bad theory because it pushes the fundamentally flawed position that one can never question others who vote the same player as themselves without simultaneously be \"setting up mislynches\"</div></blockquote><br><br>Scum do the first part (\"setting up mislynches\") all the time.   Maybe not explicitly, but planting suspicions early that can be used later, setting things up to your advantage so that townies get mislynched and someone else takes the blame for it; oh yeah, skilled scum do that stuff all the time.   They can, because they have extra information that town don't have.   <br><br>It's totally normal to question anyone, including people on the same wagon as you.   But I just don't get why, for example, GC didn't switch over to voting Quaroath around page 9; GC's Quaroth case seemed a lot stronger then his AP case ever did, he personally seemed a lot more convinced by it, and he gave the impression that he thought that AP was likely just a townie self-destructing.<br><br><span style=\"color:darkred; font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">Tags fixed.</span>"}

The problem is that GC seemed to have what looked like several actual suspicious based on real things, but he kept his vote on the AP wagon, when he couldn't explain why he was there except for some very vague \"big picture\" comments.    Also, if you're suspicious of the person leading the wagon your on, that should normally make you a little more hesitant about staying on it, which i didn't see either.

I can buy that his stances are 'convenient'.  His case on me was kind of difficult to follow if you haven't been in the last Open we were in together and his case on you is based on your push on someone he found scummy (me).  I'm not really thinking he is scum despite this though.<br><br>I'm not going to quote anything from P11, but my overall impression of this page is that Yosarian and GC are the same alignment.  So, most likely town.  I could go into details on why that is, but I certainly don't want to quote more from that exchange than I have to.  I understand why they each find the other suspicious, but all these posts just look increasingly pedantic and laden with confirmation-bias.  The main disagreement seems to be over GC sniping at Q's post.  I can fathom someone seeing this as chainsaw defending but I don't think Q even directly called me scum?  All I recall from his wall is that he was  <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><img src=\"http://lib.iamdisappoint.com/sites/iamdisappoint.com/logo.png?1392021326\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div>about my posting which I can buy.  So GC's response to him definitely looks more like trying to understand Q's issue with my posting rather than whiteknighting me indirectly.  The rest of the argument seems to balloon out from this point.<br><br>/11<br><br>I think both GC and Yos are town.  If I'm wrong about one of them, its probably Yos.  If one of them ever flip scum I'd be suspicious of the other, but at this point I think they are both town and I'm fully ready for them both to get upset that I'm asserting I think they are the same alignment."}

I'd normally be afraid that this is a 'shallow' read based on them both generating content and that its alignment neutral, but I am not really having a hard time identifying with their posts on an emotional level at all.  I especially think Yos's stance on my lynch is more likely to come from town...or at least the way he expressed it is, which is to say hes essentially ready to take any blame for lynching me.  He never outright said it- but it was somewhat implied and I overall don't really think he's faking anything.  GC....my points for Yos-town kind of rolled of my tongue and I'm having a bit more trouble expressing my feelings on GC.  Which is upsetting because I was pretty content with calling them both town and moving on to better things.  Eh.  I'm going to just say \"I think GC is town, -HITOSHRUG-\" for the time being here.<br><br>Chamber - Actually advancing the game state.  Seems involved and his questions all form a pretty readable mindset for me so far.

I find that they aren't all that useful to parse through from a town/scum perspective for the amount of effort is takes.

AP was legitimately suspicious early on in the day, so I don't share GC's dislike for that push.  But you yourself have said that it was a weak push on Day One.  You've also shown real awareness of your meta (bringing up Oldy2 as an example of a game in which you acted this way).  <br><br>I do think that your arguments early on assumed that AP was scum.  Otherwise why would \"defending AP\" be a negative point against GC?  You say that nothing GC says indicates that he actually, honestly suspects AP but the same is exactly true of you.  You move from a scumread (yes, I think a vote indicates at least some kind of scumread) on AP to a scumread on GC for questioning you about what is, by your own admission, a pretty weak argument for AP scum.  <br><br>Basically, everything you've accused GC of doing, you've done yourself.  You haven't proven that you honestly have suspicions on the people you claim to suspect (which, in both your defenses, would be pretty freaking hard to do), you have been inconsistent in your reads and you have accused GC of defending AP while you're attacking him for not suspecting him convincingly enough. <br><br>Your arguments are not making sense to me.  To ME, it looks like the both of you are doing precisely the same things (using buzzwords, talking around the subject, alternately defending and attacking AP) and I don't see why it's obvscum to you when GC does it but it's fine when you do.<br><br>If you don't believe me on this, read your ISO again.  You're using tactics that you're accusing others of.  I don't know that it makes you scum (because GC was doing the same thing) and I wouldn't call it flailing; it's a lot more expert than flailing imo.  But I think you need to stop tunneling and look at the rest of the game, because this back and forth is helpful to no one.<br><br>And yeah, that's an invitation to engage with me.  You know you want to anyway! &lt;3"}

Can you see <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scum</span> doing this?  If the answer is \"well I don't think so?\" or anything along those lines, then why on earth are you only focusing on the town side of it?  Now I'm just confused because you are talking as if my post was scum-motivated although you seem to be null unless I'm misremembering.<br><br>Point is, just because people are behaving chaotically or you don't get the \"town\" motivation doesn't make them scum, ESPECIALLY if you ask yourself the opposite question \"what is the scum motivation for doing this?\" and the answer comes back as \"I don't know\" although people tend to assume that scum are more likely to do inexplicable things because they are scum (this is what truly makes no sense) and assume players who troll or otherwise do something \"that has no town motivation\" are scum.  But, as I said, you don't seem to be scumreading me over this and I actually thought you were pretty town up until now.  Well I still think you are town, but the business of asserting that there was no town motivation in what I'm doing implies you think it was scummy but perhaps you didn't really make that leap which means my whole rant about \"lack of town motivation\" does not equate to \"scummy\" was mostly irrelevant.

I really hope over time people end up above the line. I know this post is going to probably be rambly and ponderous but I'd like everyone to read it and engage with me on it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">TOWN</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">chamber:</span> Not really sure where people's concerns about his play are coming from (I think some people are just really unfamiliar with him?), but his play here massively fits with the town meta that I know of him. I can follow/understand most of his thought processes even if I don't agree with him (ex: I can understand why he asked about AP's smiley usage in #69 even if the question was a bit weird). From what I remember, chamber really hates being scum and is far less engaged in the game, so posts like #168 where he voices his frustration that no one understands his GC vote/unstated reasoning make more sense from him as town - I think he'd be far less inclined to give a shit as scum. I liked his \"trying to prevent AP from self destructing\" post in #220, think he'd just let AP continue to do so if he were scum. Him trying to get GC and Yos to stop flooding the thread in #308 is immensely town, he'd surely just let them continue to drown the thread out if he were scum here. Finally, #221 is a post that is just so off beat in terms of its \"internal dialogue\" style of explaining his thought process that I would be really shocked if scum came up with that. Overall, I'd probably just spiral into permanent state of existential pessimism if he were scum in this game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Pegasus30:</span> I've already stated quite a bit of why I think this dude's really town, but it bears repeating. I really liked the timing and statement of the townreads on myself and chamber in #46, given that no one had stated a read on us yet, it shows that he is willing to take the initiative while scumhunting. His thoughts on AP and myself in #170 seem to be colored by a paranoia that scum would want to pounce on trying to mislynch him due to his perception as an easy-to-lynch player and I think these bias are more likely to come from newbie town as opposed to scum. I like that he took the extra effort to verify Yosarian's meta analysis on AP in #176 and wanting to back out of a potential wall war with AP in #178, the latter specifically because I feel like getting into a back-and-forth with AP at this stage would give him free content and would allow him to clutter the thread if he were scum. He is also more forceful with people than I would expect newbie scum to be in posts like #295 (\u201cAp, you want to be engaged...\u201d; \u201cEmpire, you are standing on the sidelines despite being active...\u201d) and his frustration at not having strong townreads impeding his gamesolving in #392 reads really genuine to me. This dude is another dude I'd be really surprised if he flipped scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">AP:</span> While I did find AP's entrance into the game a bit forced and over the top, I can buy that this is just a playstyle thing and not really alignment indicative. It's hard to really dig in and find specific points for why I think he's town but I will say that I liked the introspective bits/efforts to be transparent that appear throughout his posting (ex: #64 \u2013 \u201cI considered editing parts of my post to make it less 3-dimensional...\"; #124 \u2013 \u201cI do feel pressured to contribute, but that is coming from within\u201d; #162 \u2013 \u201cTalking about myself is just going to make people care less about what I say...\"). #65 and the subsequent explanation in #67 suggest that he is posting without a filter, which I think is way more likely town. And I think his whole thing where he claimed VT and threatened to self hammer is a towntell in that it is more likely to come from a demotivated town-AP.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">GC:</span> While I'm nowhere near as confident as the above three that he's town, I do think he's done some solidly town stuff enough to place him just under the line. I actually thought #112 was a town post in that I think as scum he'd have just made up some bullshit or manufactured a case against AP at that point (and I certainly think GC is competent enough as scum to have done so). I don't see the scum motivation in posting given that it de facto undermines your push to admit you don't have any specific points against that player, if that player is town and you are trying to get them lynched. All in all, I like the way he handles himself in his responses to Yosarian, he hits the right frustrated town tone and his points all resonate with me, particularly those articulated in #277. Bonus: he also does the food tell in #208 &gt;_&gt;.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Quilford:</span> I think the little mini case that Quilford presented in #47 is slightly more likely to come from town in that town are more likely to experience that feeling of deja vu / make the connection between the exact wording of someone else's play in this game and their scum play in another game. The subsequent questioning of UT also seems like he's genuinely trying to get a read on him. Overall, Quilford generally is hitting the natural/snarky/sassy town tone that is more similar to the TM Twin Trap rather than the more robotic and stiff tone he had in Mafia on the Metro. Would really like to see his thoughts/reads when he catches up, though.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">UT:</span> I already touched on this before but the reasoning he uses in #95 to suspect me in the TM Large Theme where we were town together and I think it makes him slightly more likely to be town. I liked #216 in that UT's level of mad/frustration seems similar to how he reacted to suspicion in the TM Large Theme and from memory UT is far less inclined to give a shit when he's scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">DrDolittle:</span> This one is very weak but I liked that he went out of his way to look up the number of times AP used a certain smiley as it shows some proactive effort. I skimmed MacBeth (where he was scum) very briefly earlier today and he does seem to be playing very differently than he is here in that in MacBeth he was a lot more \"by-the-book\" and formal in his approach but I need to dig a bit deeper in order to verify this.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NULL</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">SKrew:</span> I liked where he was going in his questioning during the early game but it's weak and I want to see where he goes when he has the time to fully catch up here and state his thoughts.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Axxle:</span> Despite having had some content, I've got nothing on this guy. Hopefully, whoever jumps into this slot will be a lot more readable for me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF THIS GUY, PLS HELP:</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Yosarian2:</span> I had him in the scum pile initially, but I reviewed his ISO again and it occurred to me that a lot of his posts could go both ways. That said, I still have a lot of problems with his play. Normally, I'd consider the meta diving into AP's early game play in #98 to be a towntell but it gives off the impression to me that he was looking for stuff to suit his conclusions (Ex: \u201cI'm seeing the kind of self-conscious stuff he's talking about here, but I'm still not getting the \"I'm neutral, don't mind me, I'm just here\" vibe that bugged me here.\u201d). The thought process laid out in #147 does seem a bit more likely town, though. I still really dislike his push on GC though and a lot of it feels like he is trying to conform GC\u2019s posts to fit the conclusion that he\u2019s scum. #255 still feels off \u2013 like, Yos didn\u2019t even have a read on Quaroath so I still don\u2019t really get why he is making this argument since it assumes Quaroath is town and GC is trying to chain up his mislynch. I\u2019m trying to figure out if he\u2019s just like confirmation biasing or something. However, I looked a bit at Karma Mafia and he does seem to be playing slightly differently than there. I\u2019m still leaning towards him being scum but I am definitely not sure about it at all.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Yos</span> \u2013 do you have a more recent scum game than Karma Mafia?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">SCUM</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Quaroath:</span> In my experience, town are slightly more likely to phrase things in a \u201cI was thinking \u2018[quote detailing inner thoughts]\u2019\u201d kind of way like he did in #59 but this is admittedly pretty weak.

The criticism of AP feels like empty posturing in #202 every time I reread the post although I haven't fully gone through his meta yet to see if this is a thing he does across both alignments. Vote on Quilford is weird given that he spent the first part of the post criticizing AP for his actions (yet doesn\u2019t take much of a position on AP in that post), not to mention his entire mini-case here about Quilford here just feels like a scum case. #380 just feels that way too, particularly the attempt to link me and Yosarian together.

(Someone actually went through and did statistical analysis on several years of mafia games at one point, and found that town lynches worse then random on day 1.  The reason is that town are only acting slightly better then random, while scum are actively trying to push mislynches, so the end result is worse then random.)<br><br>Obviously, when you're looking for that kind of behavior on day 1, you have to do it without actually knowing anyone's alignment.   So what you say is \"this post by X looks like it matches the 'scum trying to push a mislynch on Y'\" behavior, based on the (fairly subtle) ways that that kind of behavior can look different from \"town honestly looking for scum\" behavior.      <br><br>I mean, how else can you scumhunt on day 1 when you don't have anything solid?  Day 1 scumhunting is all based behavior patterns, hunches, meta, or guesses.    And one of biggest differences between town and scum play is <br>that townies are actually trying to find scum, while scum are trying to get townies mislynched, and that can look a little bit different.<br><br>Now, later on in the game after a few flips, you start to know who was scum and who was town, you could use that fact and have a better shot at figuring out the difference when looking back, but you don't have that on day 1, so you just have to look for behavioral tells being made by the attacker to try to figure out his motives without knowing the alignment of the person being attacked.  Which is what I was trying to do.  It's...not an exact science, but it's still one of the biggest divergences between town and scum playstyles on day 1.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>However, I looked a bit at Karma Mafia and he does seem to be playing slightly differently than there.

Every time he posts towards Empire, his posts seem forced and manufactured - like he doesn't actually have anything to say but is trying to find stuff to snipe at Empire about. At first, I thought he and Empire were scum distancing but after Empire's latest list of reads, I'm unsure (and I'll get to Empire's list in a bit). But even if Empire is town, Quar's posts are worthy of a close look.<br><br>I recommend everyone keep his posts in isolation open in a different window as you read through:<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6954469#p6954469\">Post 59</a> - The weird jump at Empire calling him \"foolish\" and then oscillating back-and-forth with no conclusion. Then he criticizes Empire for his impatience, calls it strange and leaves it there without offering his opinion. The criticisms themselves feel overblown.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958833#p6958833\">Post 202</a> - His completely misrepresents what Empire was saying about Untrod. I thought it was fairly obvious that Empire was responding to AP. Empire had said that scum would latch onto his early posts. AP replied that only Untrod latched onto them. Empire responded by saying that Untrod had in the past incorrectly called Empire scum (implying that Untrod latching onto his posts isn't cause for a scumread). Quar then twists it as if Empire was saying that he and Untrod were both town here because Untrod read Empire wrongly in the past. Quar <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span> have misunderstood but I just hate the totally overblown response \"WHAT!??!?!? Please explain this using logical thought processes\" in caps with multiple punctuation and exclamation marks.<br><br>This is in fact a recurring theme through many of his posts. In the same post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958833#p6958833\">202</a>), look at his chiding of AP: <br><br>\"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Your job of friggen defend yourself. It doesn\u2019t help CATCH SCUM to self hammer, so what the hell? Do you want to lose?</span>\" <br><br>\"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">The appeal to emotion here is just... Wha\u2026?

How the hell does your death help catch the scum if you self-hammer because QQ? Why should anyone defend you... do it your own damn self.</span>\"<br><br>The underlying theme that sets me off the hardest is the extreme overreaction. \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Wha...?</span>\" \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">WHAT!?!??!</span>\" \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">crock of shit</span>\" \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">why the HELL.</span>\" It doesn't feel like genuine emotion in a relevant context. Feels more like he is bullshitting his reactions. I wondered if it was simply a playstyle clash and whether his reaction simply appear scummy to a more restrained player like me. <br><br>So, I went through his old games to check how much of it is just playstyle. My impression was that he reacts strongly as both alignments but his overreactions as scum seem <span style=\"font-style: italic\">significantly more pronounced and over the top</span>. This was what I was hoping Empire would point out when he committed to reading through Quar's games. There's another thing I want talk about but I want to see if Empire does mention it before I elaborate.<br><br>Moving on, the rest of his interactions with Empire:<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969686#p6969686\">Post 380</a> - He accuses Empire of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">distancing</span> from Yos which is a really perplexing accusation to make. What exactly from Empire/Yos's interaction looks like distancing? It seems to have come from Yos having a weak suspicion of Empire. But that's really generic and not at all unusual for a townie to have suspicions that they aren't willing to push right that moment because they have a bigger scumread."}

Quar's posts only seemed geared to push AP over the top even more. If Quar wanted AP to calm down, he would have at least mentioned that he thought AP was town so AP knows he has someone to rely on but he doesn't."}

I haven't found the drive to do my due diligence. One thing I can say is that none of pegasus' points are things I thought while reading the thread initially, and that's at least a knock against it(skimming the case again that's not entirly true, I did think that quar's comment to pegasus in 422 stuck out a bit). I also really don't like pegasus' method of presenting points. It annoyed me (and made me suspicious of him) when he did it to AP. Now I just think it's a play style thing, but it's a bad play style thing. He uses a lot of rhetoric and builds up points to seem as major as he can. Makes it a lot harder for me to parse."}

My general impression without reviewing anything is that people think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958833#p6958833\">202</a> is scummy.  The whole sideways push on me which is mostly just critiquing my play has come up a few times now and I mostly just disagree that its a scummy thing to say to me (I think the opposite, really).<br>...<br>Ok, I just reread the Pegasus post on him.  This is probably what sparked the comment about meta-&gt;confirimationBias because he pretty much asserted that Quar's posts were scummy for being overly emotive then found evidence that he is that way as both alignments, but more so as scum.  Kinda hard to pass a judgement on..I could do legwork to see if I agree but the sample size of posts I'd have to read to feel I was doing the case justice is a lot.<br><br>Accusing Yos of distancing from Empire is interesting, but I can see that Quar was pinging Empire all game even if he never really came out with a hard scumread or case for it.  I can see someone thinking Yos was doing that given individual reads on both of them.  Yos never really pressed Empire from what I remember except that post that Quar mentioned which really did throw shade at Empire without committing to a read/vote on him.  Compare to other Yos posts which are more heavy handed.  All in all, I'm not seeing a compelling reason to vote Quar and I'm gut townreading the guy for some of his behavior.<br><br>I wouldn't complain too much about lynching him I guess because there are some things that give me pause.  (Like the wagon being weird as chamber mentioned although Im seeing maybe an opposite conclusion from it :S)<br><br>P-edit: Errrr, I've been updating them like every few days or so so that everyone knows what I'm thinking.  My townread on Quar is p interesting I thought since he seems to be undesirable #1 for a lot of people."}

I thought it was fairly obvious that Empire was responding to AP. Empire had said that scum would latch onto his early posts. AP replied that only Untrod latched onto them. Empire responded by saying that Untrod had in the past incorrectly called Empire scum (implying that Untrod latching onto his posts isn't cause for a scumread). Quar then twists it as if Empire was saying that he and Untrod were both town here because Untrod read Empire wrongly in the past.

I'm fairly certain a complete read of the ten games I pulled don't show I overreact more as scum if you read em *all* not just one. How about reading different games to establish a meta, or is just that one game enough for you?

Yos voted shortly after I did and provided reasons. Dolittle, GC, and Katsuki gave none. I don't find any of them scummy for their jump.<br><br>One thing I was initially concerned about was that the Quar-wagon and the Bookitty-wagon seemed to be leading counterwagons and I had suspicions that Bookitty could be scum and it seemed too good to be true that both leading wagons were on scum. Bookitty's reaction actually made me feel better as she did exactly what I'd expect her to do if she and Quar were scum. Denounce her counterwagon and push in a new direction entirely.<br><br>Katsuki hasn't posted much but what little he posted I liked - specifically his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6984019#p6984019\">Post 552</a>.<br><br>What I dislike most about Bookitty's posting is a very under-the-radar feel that I get from her posts. I looked at her onsite activity and over the past few days, she's been posting quite a bit elsewhere but has only been making minimal contributions here. <br><br>One more thing: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6983642#p6983642\" class=\"postlink\">post 538</a>, Bookitty wrote:</cite>DrDoolittle, you were voting Axxle who is now Katsuki.

What do you think of people voting him without a word of explanation?</div></blockquote><br><br>These two posts feel like fear mongering. It doesn't feel like Bookitty is scrutinizing Dolittle's vote or thought process but more like \"look, that evil Kats voted on your wagon, how do you feel about that!\" The second quote is similar - framing the wagon in a negative way while questioning someone subtly discouraging it.<br><br>I almost feel like she might do it even if Quil is town because the wagon seems to have run out of momentum and the opposing voices (Chamber, AP) were actively trying to bring it down. <br><br>I'm still mulling over Quar. I don't understand the reasons anyone is townreading him. Not willing to vote Katsuki. I'm going to ISO Quilford since I seem to have forgotten about him but probably not willing to vote there either.

I made the case the evening of June 23rd. Quar logged on that night, posted in other games, then he logged on last night, posted some more in other games while excusing himself from this one. Then he logged on this morning, posted yet some more elsewhere until finally addressing my case this afternoon. I feel like if he was convinced I was scum bullshitting and excited about catching scum, he'd be all over me in his righteous fury the moment he saw the case. But yet he waits days before getting to it which makes me think part of it was planned. Even more so since scum in this game can converse during the day."}

Later says Bookitty and SleepyKrew are the worst people on counterwagon. I agree. <br><br>Questions:<br><br>1) You say that your <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955620#p6955620\" class=\"postlink\">initial push on Untrod was done for reactions</a>. Did you find anything helpful based on the reactions?<br>2) Why do you find replace-outs to be concerning? Have there been events in your past games where scum replaced out? Have you in the past as town called replace-outs suspicious? If so, can you link them for me. <br>3) It would be very helpful if you can post your updated reads. I think quite a lot has happened since you excused yourself due to exams and I want your take on the latest events.<br><br>Other thoughts:<br><br>Going through his posts strengthened my townread on him. Most of Quilford's posts have involved scumhunting at a reasonable depth. He sometimes posts things I agree with which by itself isn't a huge indicator of alignment but are small points in favor of thinking we have similar motivations. His suspicion changes according to things that happen in thread in a reasonable manner (AP being scum and then later town when he found out that AP was trying to change stuff). He's fairly engaged with the game and follows up on his questions fairly often. He seems to be particularly wary of Untrod who won as scum against him in the past which I find reasonable.<br><br>I don't think it is completely impossible for a scum player to post like he did but the sum total of content he put in thread makes me lean far, far more in the town direction than scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">He's not a wagon I'll support today. In fact, I want the wagoners to put together coherent reasons why they are voting him and in what way they feel that he has been \"active-lurking\" or sliding below the radar. I'd like an explanation for the votes on him.</span>"}

My first impression was it looked like busywork that accomplishes nothing and I don't think frequency of emoticon usage would be remotely related to alignments. That seems to be more of a playstyle trait. It's followed up by more discussion with Chamber about how to search for them.

Good logic? That's alignment independent a lot of the time. I understand the Quilford vote and I can understand why Quilford's hop on to the AP wagon can be perceived as opportunistic by someone like Dr. who doesn't seem to engaged in the game enough to note that Quilford had previous expressed suspicion of AP's opening posts.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6960482#p6960482\">Post 233</a> - Referencing Untrod's (uncle's) post in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6959721#p6959721\">Post 219</a> seems bad on the surface but in this case, I actually like it as it seemed like he truly believed Quilford's jump on AP was bad and was looking for a more articulate player to say it for him which uncle seemed to have done effectively.

I wonder if Axxle is the type to usually make such pushes. Is he? However, reading the entire back-and-forth between Axxle and Dr.Dolittle, I think I liked both sides of the argument. Dr. does make good points on Axxle's lack of engagement on GC vs Yos while Axxle defends himself well stating that back-and-forth walls are often difficult to parse through - a sentiment I happen to agree with.

But at least he's consistent. I also think it unlikely for a scum to vote Quil, then decide Quil's not scum and then vote someone else. I don't know what specifically he remembered in that one minute that made him think Quil's not scum though.<br><br>Questions: <br><br>(1) Talk about your AP read more in depth. What is this \"good logic\" from AP that you saw that you don't think AP would post as scum? What sort of logic would you expect AP to use if he were scum?<br>(2) What do you mean by \"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958541#p6958541\" class=\"postlink\">contribution factions</a>?\"<br>(3) What's your own opinion on the Yos/GC walling and have you played with Axxle before? Is he the type to take strong positions on wall wars?<br>(4) What \"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6974825#p6974825\" class=\"postlink\">weird and irrelevant facts</a>\" is Chamber talking about? Specify them for me.<br>(5) What does a \"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6980233#p6980233\" class=\"postlink\">cupcake</a>\" mean as it relates to mafia? What do \"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6985471#p6985471\" class=\"postlink\">jeep's tells</a>\" mean and how do they apply to PapaZito?<br>(6) What did you remember about Quilford in the gap between <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6985460#p6985460\">Post 580</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6985462#p6985462\">Post 581</a> that made you suddenly get this inspiration that Quilford isn't scum?<br>(7) What about Quilford's response to his AP unvote was as town-motivated as you are claiming it to be? Essentially, I want an elaboration on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6988748#p6988748\">Post 613</a><br>(8) I asked you earlier for your reads and thoughts on the players in this game? I want a response.<br><br>Other thoughts:<br><br>So, I went in expecting Dr. to be null but I'm actually seeing a lot of town there. Some of his posts made me cringe while others felt like busywork. But through the bad posts, there are several that expose his town motives. The push on Axxle wasn't bad. His changing his mind on Quilford felt like he had actual reasons for it although I want them explained. Some of his sentiments like his concerns about Chamber seem like ones I think town would have whereas scum would be more likely to not want to provoke Chamber, the near-universally agreed upon obvtown.<br><br>I understand why he was wagoned as the votes on him came shortly after his cringeworthy posts but the entire sum of posts I think are likelier town than scum. I'm less opposed to his wagon than I am to Quilford but very pessimistic about the chances that he's actually going to flip mafia. Most likely will not be voting here."}

My impression of him as a person is that he finds all sorts of weird things town which he can't explain very well and tends to think outside the box. He designs games that blow up D1 and seems to have a very unorthodox approach. A lot of his later posts make a lot of sense and the general feeling was that he's trying very hard to understand and figure out the game. His read on Quar made me strongly want to look at Quar's posts from a new perspective. Before reading, I had AP as marginally townish but he's pretty strongly in my townlist at this point."}

She's acting like I'm this major threat as scum but thinks that I would outright defend a buddy in the way I was doing if I were scum.

This was based off of very weak reasoning, and went nowhere.  Which isn't bad in and of itself, but what makes it suspicious is the fact that this empty calorie case it's a large component of Quil's substantive presence in the game.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.</span> The AP vote/unvote.  It's clear that Quil voted AP for awkwardness + Pegasus/Yos points (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6954597#p6954597\">Post 63</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a>), which (once again), is fine whatever in and of itself.  Here, however, my problem is Quil's voting pattern and - more importantly - his justification for his quick unvote.<br><br>Quil unvoted because he didn't want \"any derps\" giving AP the chance to self-hammer (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958035#p6958035\">Post 192</a>).  Quil reiterates that someone could have either missed AP's self-hammer claim or would have put AP at L-1 anyways (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958962#p6958962\">Post 203</a>).  I call shenanigans.  AP's self-hammer claim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> wasn't buried in some massive wall post.  It was clearly stated in the single line post - hard to miss, and so I find it suspicious that Quil was concerned that someone would have missed it.  The other fear that someone would have put AP at L-1 in any event is also pretty unjustified, seeing as how it was only Page 8; and, in any event, such a vote would have effectively been the hammer so that the person making such a vote would have come under appropriate suspicion.<br><br>Which is all to say, Quil's unvote justification looks artificial.  He voted AP for perfectly adequate reasons for a Page 8 vote, but the immediate jump off based on the reasons articulated looks like a calculated attempt to look town from a player who knows that the voted player (AP) is frustrated town.<br><br>Feeding into this is I also don't buy Quil's explanation of Quil's reading AP town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961567#p6961567\">Post 242</a>).  The timing doesn't really hold up:  Quil claims that he was starting to townread AP immediately after AP's claim of self-hammering (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958011#p6958011\">Post 188</a>), but that was never indicated in Quil's justifications for unvoting.  Also, the only thing that could justify Quil's AP town read from the time between Quil's AP vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a>) and Quil's AP townread (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>) would be AP's self-hammer claim - which I guess is plausible, but I don't see how that caused a 180 degree spin in Quil's assessment of AP (as opposed to simply being the turning point of Quil's diminishing suspicions of AP).<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.</span> And then there's Quil's push against UT based on the differences between Empire's and AP's awkwardness (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955613#p6955613\">Post 89</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955677#p6955677\">Post 96</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6955716#p6955716\">Post 101</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>).  This is all a weird, pointless discussion for which I could fault Quil and UT equally tbqh.  But, once again, its particularly suspicions of Quil in the sense that this is the third pillar of the totality of Quil's substantive contribution to the game."}

A lot of the stuff he's done, the timing of his votes and unvotes, and the reasoning behind them (when he bothers to give it), make sense and resemble some of my own reactions.  And at the same time, he seems to absolutely not care at all what he looks like or if he contradicts himself or to be making any attempt to censor his thought process to look better.   Basically I'm getting a really strong \"what you see is what you get\" vibe from him.<br><br>Here, I'll give some examples:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6953688#p6953688\" class=\"postlink\">post 28</a>, DrDolittle wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6953684#p6953684\" class=\"postlink\">post 27</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite>Hi guys.</div></blockquote><br><br>found scum <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: AngryPidgeon</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Exact same reaction I had seeing that post.<br><br>His case on axxle (which was basically \"axxle looks scummy because it looks like he's trying too hard to stay neutral and not step on toes\") made sense.  <br><br>Some good questions after that (\"why is chamber obvtown\"  \"empire why don't you have any strong reads\")<br><br>Then there was this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6985460#p6985460\" class=\"postlink\">post 580</a>, DrDolittle wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: quilfrod</span><br>woop woop goes the sound of the police. <br>woop woop that's the sound of the beast</div></blockquote><br><br><br>and then about a minute later<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6985462#p6985462\" class=\"postlink\">post 581</a>, DrDolittle wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>actually nvm quilford isn't scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Scum just don't do stuff like that, in my experience.  Join a growing wagon without bothering to give a reason, and then have second thoughts and bail literally 60 second later?   I can totally see a townie doing that, but scum tend to be a little more deliberate in their voting, a little more strategic in trying to lynch people, and try a little harder to look consistent and logical then that.<br><br>And that whole \"I haven't sheeped this game.  Ok maybe once\" set of posts just strikes me as someone who hasn't felt the need to go back and read his own posts to try to sound consistent, which I also take as a town tell.   <br><br>Obviously none of my reads are rock solid right now, but I'd be really surprised if DrDoolittle wasn't town."}

It is AGAINST THE RULES to discuss ongoing games, so you have made an accusation here that you know I cannot answer without violating site rules.  This really bothered me, especially because of the way you worded it.  I invite anyone to look at my activity and to consider why I might have been \"posting quite a bit elsewhere\" in that case.  I can't actually defend myself about this because of site rules, which truly infuriates me since it allows Pegasus to misrepresent things here with impunity.  I didn't answer it then, but I think my answer here doesn't violate rules any more than your initial accusation does, so I should be fine.<br><br>It's interesting that both Katsuki and Pegasus have postulated a Quaroath-Bookitty team because I was unwilling to vote someone I thought was town.  While that townread has weakened, I still think it's ridiculous in both cases.<br><br>As far as my activity, I believe I told everyone I have freaking bronchitis.  I'm currently on my second round of antibiotics (which are approximately the size of a submarine) and I am not really in the mood to defend myself for crap I cannot help.<br><br>@Pegasus:  I have seen this before from SleepyKrew as both alignments.  Gun to head I would guess he's more likely scum for it, but I can't read him with any confidence at this point.  Also, the posts you are talking about (apart from DrDoolittle, who looks to me like an easy fall-back scumread) referred to a leading wagon.  If I were reading things the way you apparently are, I'd be arguing for a Quilford-Pegasus scumteam because you defended him.<br><br>@Quaroath:  I apologise if the way I framed my question offended you.  I was irritated (and still am) because I don't have any case to which to respond.  It's all nebulous and impossible to address.  It means that I can't pinpoint scum on my wagon and everyone is just adding me as their \"plus one\" for scum without reasons.  You don't like it when a question is framed to you that presupposes you are scum -- that is pretty much how I've felt from the start here."}

I don't think your actions there (speaking against the Quar wagon) were unlikely to come from scum. I also dislike the use of real life commitments to defend Quar. You say you can sympathize with him because of irl stuff and that's part of why you don't like the wagon but that has nothing to do with his alignment and is objectively a bad reason to defend someone. Your points about the supposed contradiction between Katsuki and AP thinking you were a threat as scum but also hunting for your buddies also aren't very strong. Defending partners isn't necessarily the mark of a poor scum player especially when done convincingly. You again comment on Yos and say that his reads are \"all over the place.\" I don't really understand your interactions with Yos. It seems like you spend a lot of time on him (more than you do on others) but don't have him as particularly scummy or vote him at any point. I'm guessing it could be based on past history (your opening posts suggest that). I'd like to hear a concrete opinion on him.<br><br>Overall thoughts:<br><br>Going through all of her posts makes me a less sure on Bookitty. I can reasonably follow most of her suspicions and by themselves, there are only a few posts that are troublesome. Most of her descriptions of me or the cases I made seem like misinterpretations or oversimplifications. They could come from lazy town potentially. I didn't like the responses to the suspicion on her from AP. It seemed like she was throwing shade more than addressing them but at least she admits it. The interactions with Yosarian look like they are steeped in past games and I can't decide what it says about either of their alignments just yet. The townread on AP doesn't seem very well thought-out.<br><br>My biggest problem initially with Bookitty was that it seemed like she was posting occasionally, making contributions but not really in a way that shakes things up and was relatively unremarkable. She seems fairly focused on a narrow selection of players (Yosarian, AP, Ax/Katsuki) and defends Quar for real life reasons - although the last had a defiant town feel to it. I don't know what to make of her at this point. Need to mull things over more."}

Here, however, my problem is Quil's voting pattern and - more importantly - his justification for his quick unvote.<br><br>Quil unvoted because he didn't want \"any derps\" giving AP the chance to self-hammer (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958035#p6958035\">Post 192</a>).  Quil reiterates that someone could have either missed AP's self-hammer claim or would have put AP at L-1 anyways (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958962#p6958962\">Post 203</a>).  I call shenanigans.  AP's self-hammer claim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> wasn't buried in some massive wall post.  It was clearly stated in the single line post - hard to miss, and so I find it suspicious that Quil was concerned that someone would have missed it.  The other fear that someone would have put AP at L-1 in any event is also pretty unjustified, seeing as how it was only Page 8; and, in any event, such a vote would have effectively been the hammer so that the person making such a vote would have come under appropriate suspicion.<br><br>Which is all to say, Quil's unvote justification looks artificial.  He voted AP for perfectly adequate reasons for a Page 8 vote, but the immediate jump off based on the reasons articulated looks like a calculated attempt to look town from a player who knows that the voted player (AP) is frustrated town.<br><br>Feeding into this is I also don't buy Quil's explanation of Quil's reading AP town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961567#p6961567\">Post 242</a>).  The timing doesn't really hold up:  Quil claims that he was starting to townread AP immediately after AP's claim of self-hammering (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958001#p6958001\">Post 187</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6958011#p6958011\">Post 188</a>), but that was never indicated in Quil's justifications for unvoting.  Also, the only thing that could justify Quil's AP town read from the time between Quil's AP vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6957965#p6957965\">Post 183</a>) and Quil's AP townread (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6961542#p6961542\">Post 241</a>) would be AP's self-hammer claim - which I guess is plausible, but I don't see how that caused a 180 degree spin in Quil's assessment of AP (as opposed to simply being the turning point of Quil's diminishing suspicions of AP).</div></blockquote><br>I get the first three paragraphs and I do think Quil's vote + unvote was pretty awkward. Personally, if someone claimed that they would self-hammer, I wouldn't mind putting them at L-1. That's such an anti-town play that they would deserve to be lynched so I disagree with both you and Quil here. But I see the scum motivation there. I disagree that \"missing APs self-hammer threat\" was an invalid reason to unvote.

If you need details or if I missed questions, please let me know and I'll do my best to deal with them tonight when I'm NOT at work.<br><br>I don't have a lot of experience with AP.  I don't think he's seen me as scum, which is why I asked -- alts exist, so maybe he has.  I don't have a great deal of self-awareness about my meta as either alignment; I can say I'm not much of a town leader because I'm not, but other than that I don't know what pings people.  I felt like AP needed to give some sort of support for his claimed meta read on me and I don't feel like he's really done that.<br><br>SK -- why do I think he is more likely scum than not?  In my experience with him, he's been more out there and \"IDGAF\" as town.  Here he's not exhibiting that combination of combative-cute that I associate with his town game -- I think he lurks tremendously as scum, but I don't remember from where I think that, so it's sort of a wash for me.<br><br>I thought Yos's interchange with GC was reachy and unconvincing.  I have a very strong townread on GC.  The fact that Yos backed off after a while looks more town than scum to me -- I think scum-Yos would have pushed that wagon with fervor because it's harder to start a new wagon than it is to continue pushing an existing one.  So I do think Yos is town, but I'm not ironclad like I am with GC and almost so with Chamber.  (Chamber is playing much like I recall from Oldy Mafia 2 -- I was scum in that game and I could give a link if it would be helpful, but it's crazy long.)<br><br>I still do not like Axxle/Katsuki but since Kat is having the issue with spam filters, I have no interest in pursuing that today.  Either she'll have to replace out or she'll resolve it and I can argue with her directly.<br><br>My townread on Quaroath, interestingly enough, derives from a post that I had real trouble finding but now I have.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6969119#p6969119\" class=\"postlink\">post 370</a>, Yosarian2 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6968992#p6968992\" class=\"postlink\">post 363</a>, Empire wrote:</cite>I just find that particular argument really weird because it suggests that Hamtaro is town and there is nothing on Yosarian's ISO that even implies a townread on that guy. </div></blockquote><br><br>Who's Hamtaro?  Is that Quaroath?<br><br>Anyway, I don't have a strong read on Quaroth at the moment, either way.   I will say that he's probably not scum with GC; if GC is scum, Quaroth is probably town, and vice versa.    <br><br>The main point of my post was that GC's behavior seems weird and internally inconsistent.  I don't inherently have a problem with his push on Quar in a vacuum, but the timing was weird.     <br><br>Unrelated note, I am going to be away for the weekend, going to leave in a few hours.</div></blockquote><br><br>This was still part of the ongoing battle between GC and Yos.  I don't like these dichotomies in general (and have had little fits about them before, because they're a hallmark of lining up lynches) and this one really pinged me because I was sure GC was town.  So setting up a \"if Quar flips town GC is scum and vice versa\" thing made me think both Quar and GC were town.  As I've gradually come to believe that Yos might be town, that isn't such good justification NOW I guess.  But I just don't feel like Quar is scum and I stand by that even if my initial reasons might not have been 100 percent correct.<br><br>Please pummel me with the questions I've missed.  I'm sure there are some!"}

It's a question that seemingly isn't prompted by anything Yos has said about AP or asked her, and she mentions she specifically wants his response before giving her opinion, noting that she's \"pretty sure they won't be the same thing.\" I mean, this reads to me like she's found something alignment-indicative about AP's early game shenanigans and she has some idea of what she thinks Yos will think about it, but she doesn't follow up on Yos's answer at all, and when she next mentions her read on AP it doesn't include anything specific about the \"meltdown.\" <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Bookitty: where were you going with that\u2014what's your opinion on what distinguishes AP!meltdown-town from AP!awkward-scum and why were you expecting Yos to have a different one to you?</span><br><br>It's odd that she does not respond to Yos after he replies to her massive attack on him / defense of GC in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969545#p6969545\">#372</a>.

But I think it's strange she didn't mention the problems she had with his initial comment in her first post about him.<br><br>Sigh, okay. I really think she is town for pursuing the fact that nobody's posting a case on her that she can defend herself from. The line to Quaroath in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6994171#p6994171\">#695</a> \"You don't like it when a question is framed to you that presupposes you are scum -- that is pretty much how I've felt from the start here\" reads as hella genuine too.

But, looking now, I buy into his explanations for voting new people and they look like they naturally arise as a result of his old scumreads fizzling out a bit. Furthermore, while I didn't agree with his case on Green Crayons it was at least internally consistent and well-argued and I really liked that he consciously made the decision in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6965784#p6965784\">#307</a> not to continue their back-and-forth because he felt it would clutter up the thread.

As I've already mentioned, I agree with Bookitty that his townmeta is considerably more combative. Additionally, he doesn't appear to have anything close to resembling a consistent train of thought (most of his posts have just been replies to the newest posts in the thread at the time). He voted and unvoted Pegasus, Katsuki and now has voted DrDolittle without mentioning any sort of suspicion of them in earlier posts. At all. .___.' His sudden push on me also strikes me as kiiiiiinda suspicious considering I've got the most votes and we're close to deadline. And I don't think it's consistent with him asking me why I haven't brought up my town meta, as I've explained. :I PEELY.<br><br>Empire / lalaladucks: I have consistently had no idea whatsoever about what to think of his much-discussed super weird posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953754#p6953754\">#36</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953754#p6953754\">#40</a>, except that I thought the lack of specificity in his reads in the latter felt a bit out of character. I did like how straightforward he was in his replies to people, though. I also super agreed with his #467 at the time he posted it, and since I was in a similar position with him re: having an \"extremely nebulous hold\" on the game, I felt like it pointed towards our thought patterns being similar. My assessment of Empire's scum meta is that he's not bad at it at all, and is capable of putting impressive amounts of effort into it, but that he just really hates playing it and the stress of deception really takes it out of him. To me, his overall pattern of play doesn't look like that. lalala's entrance is profoundly underwhelming though. The only thing that's stopping me from really having her as scum based on the shallowness of her catchup is that, for a time, my efforts at catching up were pretty surface-level too. :S"}

And even then, his reads on Sleepy and DrDo are pretty short... the Bookitty read is ok, but I think there's a bit too much bluster there for someone who doesn't appear to have any other strong reads. He's also thrown his vote around a fair bit recently in a way that makes me wonder how much continuity there is to his reads. AND YET, I'm not super comfortable with having him at scum right now? Maybe I should be? Call it gut.<br><br>UT / PZ: UT spends most of his posts doing what I'm pretty sure is his schtick of bouncing in and out and commenting on whatever gets his attention. When he brings up his reads, they usually look like they've come out of nowhere. I liked his interactions with me over the AP wagon, but otherwise I don't really know how to read him (having an irritating counterproductive playstyle is generally pretty good for maintaining hard-to-distinguish town and scum play). Zito pretty much picks up where he left off. I'm a bit suspicious that he's focusing so much on me and SleepyKrew, not giving me much confidence he's trying to gamesolve. I also don't like how he coasted by on my wagon without giving any reasoning (he also didn't elaborate on his Yos read. or any other read, basically) and will be interested to see what he does now that it doesn't really exist anymore. I DO like his interactions with Peg, they're like the only continuous scumhunty thing he's done yet"}

Re-reading some of Empire's posts, there were a bunch of town things - the way he changed his read on Yosarian  from scum to \"don't know what to do\" was one of them and it seemed like he was putting in effort to get a read there.

What makes me skeptical that he is simply a townie correctly reading AP are his reasons for his read: \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">why is ap scum? his posts seems perfectly fine to me. there is contributin factions as well as good logic.</span>\" - These feel like shallow reasons to townread someone who demonstrably showed that he was a strong, active player even as he was being wagoned. \"Good logic?\" What good logic?

How do you feel about being on the same wagon with Miss Kat now?<br><br>Katsuki, why are you voting Quaroath?

Maybe Yos doesn't care whether Bookitty agrees with the wagon as an alignment tell but what was so town about that Bookitty post anyways? She did call Yos town there so it makes sense that Yos would want to \"buddy back\" to her so to speak."}

I agree with you that SK isn't especially likely to be scum, he's basically null; I was actually hoping to pressure him into posting something, get him active, and then hopefully get someone better lynched, but I am willing to lynch him if he absolutely won't do anything at all.

I don't believe I was specifically sheeping on Pegasus here, but it wouldn't matter if I was; that's what townies are SUPPOSED to do.       <br><br><br>ANyway, I already demolished the whole silly \"Yos started attacking me\" thing in his next paragraph, not going to bother to repeat that again.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Lecturing me about how I shouldn't be townreading lurkers is bad because he doesn't really touch on my real basis for townreading SleepyKrew (drawing attention to himself) which is not a bad reason to townread someone. </div></blockquote><br><br>SK was only drawing attention to himself *for his lurking*.   I'm sorry, but you CAN NOT call that a town read, no matter how much you want to.

There are some townie pushes. Her questions to you looked town from an outside perspective but I'm not sure how much she's capable of when she's scum. She seems really low-key.

I'm trying to figure out if there's enough votes to lynch someone other then SK this day, because I don't think he's all that likely to be scum.   The reason I'm talking about lynching you, specifically, is because almost everyone who's posted (including me) suspects you.

I don't really think SK is that likely to flip scum (although I don't have a town read on him either) but I don't want a no lynch so I'm not going to leave his wagon unless we've got enough votes to lynch someone else.   What is \"fishy\" about that, exactly?  <br><br>Anyway, who do you think is scum?  Who do you want to lynch?

It was basically post #993, although that's toned down a little and has a \"I think you might not be scum\" disclaimer tacked onto the end of it.<br><br>But still, the right play is to defend yourself, see if a wagon on you is going to actually develop, and basically do everything you can short of claiming.  Only claim if you have to.<br><br>Masons claiming on day 2 don't do much for the town, in terms of win percentage.  So you should basically avoid doing that at almost any cost, short of actually being lynched.  A mason is only really useful if they can get to a 7 player or 5 player endgame and then claim, dramatically increasing the odds of the town lynching correctly at that point.   <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So by your logic I SHOULD hint at my role so you can sweep in and save me by saying omg she's suspicious </div></blockquote><br><br>No, you hinting at your role was an anti-town move.  Sorry, i get why you did it, but it was.   Also, it put me in a bad spot, where I basically had to cover up for you and not draw attention to it, while you were still demanding I lay out a case against you.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>and then you could somehow prevent me from being wagoned even though you haven't shown that kind of power when saving SK who you thought was less likely to be scum than me.</div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't \"use that power\" on SK; I was never that confident about his alignment.  I did use it on the Dr Doolittle wagon, though; I stuck my neck waaayy our towards the end of the day yesterday to stop him from getting lynched.  See my interactions with Pegasus towards the end of the day after Pegasus voted Dolittle, for example.    <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Either I needed to hint at my role to get you to back off (something you didn't do) or I would get wagoned and have to claim it anyway.  </div></blockquote><br><br>Or you don't do either, and just play the game out until you can see if you're actually in danger?  At least give us a chance to see how a Bookitty wagon come together first before you claim, since that would make it a lot easier to spot scum.    <br><br>Anyway, it's all water under the bridge at this point.  What's done is done.  <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Your arguments don't hold together and they don't make sense when you look at them rationally.  </div></blockquote><br><br>They do, acutally.    Although, again, I'm sorry I lost my temper with you when you claimed, I shouldn't take a game this seriously.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> If you'd gotten me lynched instead of SK yesterday, as you indicated you wanted, then what percent chance would we have to win today?</div></blockquote><br><br>About the same.   The fact that you're a mason doesn't do much to help the town's win percentage now that you're outed, unfortunately.   I guess we have about a 8% better chance of lynching scum today since we have one confirmed town, but the odds still aren't great, and if we don't then we're in real trouble.  <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You're part of the problem, not part of the solution.

I think the way he handled it was silly, but not really scummy at all.  Obviously the best thing to do would be to just drop it and move on (like PZ suggested).  Your attack on Yos for going after townies all Day (citing me, you GC) definitely read as if you knew GC was town before he flipped.  Otherwise your suspicion on Yos would be new and more forward whereas it was obviously just carried over here and GC's death just reinforced it.<br><br>IMO, GC's death implicates people at the fringe of his reads.  I find it relatively unlikely that people being townread by GC (chiefly DrD and Quar) are likely to kill him here.  Yosarian obviously has some motivation, but the kill really makes him look bad and I think Yos would be more interested in keeping GC alive since the two of them were kind of distracting and would periodically wall the thread up.  Also I don't think Yos was in ~that~ much danger of being lynched so a blatant GC kill would just draw attention to him by breaking up that dichotomy."}

Firstly, there isn't much to gain from the kill.  Yosarian wasn't under such pressure that offing GC was a notable benefit.  GC being alive formed a weird dichotomy with Yosarian in which they both went after each other and generated some apathy due to the nature of their arguments.  Purely the only reason for Yos to kill GC would be if he were truly afraid of GC getting him lynched which seems unlikely to me, especially given your point about Yos having an ego.  Secondly, the kill is going to make him look bad.  The first thing that crossed my mind on seeing the flip was \"oh ya Yosarian had a big fight with that guy\" and sure enough I look back and see that Quilford and Yos are the 2 biggest scumreads from GC.  Unless Yosarian is just having the time of his life and laughing his ass off at what he can get away with in this game, I don't see why its worth making the kill.  There would have been more subtle options (Boo?) or options that hit people largely considered town (Peg).<br><br>I think the GC kill was partial utility (why would scum leave him alive if his reads were all garbage when they could be killing someone like Pegasus).  So his reads likely have like 2 scum in them imo in the (Yos, Quilford, Chamber, Katsuki) grouping.  When I compare the motivation for Katsuki and Chamber to kill GC, I see a world of difference.  Remove a detractor without it being super obvious, remind everyone that Yosarian shoved this townie hard and vice versa, and distract from \"obvtown\" not getting killed by making a prominent kill."}

I'm still pretty confident that AP isn't scum because he was the first one to upset the status quo: he, Chamber, and Katsuki seemed to be generally townread with himself and Chamber being the most townread along with me. I think it would have been easy for AP as scum to use that towncred and influence to direct lynches amongst the less townread players away from his buddies - but instead he turns on Chamber and I have a hard time seeing that as a scum-move.

I can see his frustration as town potentially, but this read has been one of the more borderline/fluctuating reads for me. I wouldn't discount him killing Green hoping that town would dismiss night kill analysis or WIFOM themselves into reading him as town.

Most of his support has been coming from you, Chamber, and Bookitty. A few other things that concerned me were his reaction to me when I voted him immediately jumping to discrediting, as well his read on Bookitty not making that much sense. He's also been pretty low key unless he's brought into the spotlight. He shows up only occasionally and none of his analysis was impressive.

I read through all of Lalala's posts and there is a pretty consistent thread of attacking you because \"you don't feel the same\" (I'm assuming you've played before). She seemed like a new-ish, more casual player who isn't very articulate so I don't mind that much that she doesn't have amazing reasons to scumread you. It felt somewhat like Quilford's push on Untrod in that it is a push that town are more likely to do. I think scum would be either more hesitant or wait until they had more solid reasons before making a push like that and this one just seems off-the-cuff and town. I have a slight town-lean on Empire because the effort he put into trying to read Yos looked town and it is solidified with Duck's posting. I also think Ducks list of reads are likelier town - she has some unusual suspicions there i.e. not a \"safe\" list."}

However, he never actually successfully got you lynched (correct me if I'm wrong here and missed one).

Congrats.<br><br>That being said, there are a couple of big issues with that.  First of all, I didn't start off the day picking a fight with Bookitty, Bookitty started off the day picking a fight with me; she was on my suspect list, so I took the oppertunity to engange with her and repeat my questions, but I wasn't the one who started that in the first place.<br><br>Secondly, after Bookitty hinted at her role, if I was scum I would have done exactlaly what you're suggesting; back away suddenly, in a showy and dramatic way, and then someone else would have asked her if she was a mason.  All I had to do to out her as a mason at that point was to do literally nothing.   For that matter, after she had hinted, if I was scum I would have just shut the fuck up and then nightkilled her, not done...whatever it is you think I did.<br><br>Thirdly, your whole case seems to imply that I have literally superhuman powers of deduction; I could spot Boo was the mason based on nothing, and then I somehow knew I could make her claim by kind of attacking and kind of defending her while nobody was even voting for her?   I mean, I'm flattered, but nobody's that good.<br><br>And fourth of all, it probably didn't matter what I did.  If you look at the trajectory of Bookitty's posts, it's pretty obvious that she rolled into the day thinking \"I'm going to pick a fight with Yos, then I'm going to claim mason, and then BOOM he's going to be dead!  Yeeehaaaa!\"   I don't think it mattered how I reacted to anything, looks like she was planning on claiming from the start (or else she probably wouldn't have hinted like that anyway).    <br><br>So, yeah.  Your whole case doesn't really make sense.   Nobody could do what you're accusing me of doing, and even if I could I wouldn't anyway.   Ten stars for comedic value though.

Especially not on day 1, and especially not if the game is moving slowly and needs to be shaken up a bit.    These days I tend to think that townies need to be aggressive, on the attack, need to be risk-takers, and need to aggressively put pressure on people to get the game moving, and the earlier in the game it is and the less info the town has, the more true that is.   Townies are going to be wrong a lot, but it's still better to lead the town and risk being wrong then to sit back, let the scum take the lead, and guarantee it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I didn't agree 100 percent with GC's counterattacks, but I didn't understand why you were focusing so much attention on someone who hadn't done anything scummy that *I* had seen.

You had information I didn't have.  So you were able to just dismiss my whole case without really stopping and thinking about it first, and instead were more trying to look for ways to pick it apart right from the start.  Perfectly natural, but from my point of view, it felt like you were trying to pick me apart instead of trying to understand what I was thinking, and it just felt weird.  It felt even weirder because you weren't actually voting for me and didn't seem to be tunneling on me; I really wasn't sure what you were doing, and it was giving me a really weird gut read on you.<br><br>It's a pretty common problem; people with information like cops often tend to look like scum to the rest of the town because they know stuff that the rest of the town doesn't and it makes their reactions look off.   I remember one game I was a cop with a guilty on day 1, was trying to lynch the guy without claiming, and almost got ran up to a lynch myself because I was trying so hard to lynch him for reasons that weren't quite solid and it looked really scummy to the rest of the town.

I don't think anyone else thought so either.    Then again, I sometimes say stuff like \"you're not going to be able to lynch me today\" just basically as bravado and to project confidence, so I didn't think anything of your comment.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> I do not see how you could think that saving a non-active player who, by your own statements, you were not sure was town, was worth the risk of pushing through a lynch on someone who might have been a power role and might not have had the opportunity to claim.  </div></blockquote><br><br>Look at SK's posts for the last 24 hours or so of the day and tell me that you wouldn't start to feel really, really bad about being on his wagon.

Your push on  Yosarian is only making less convinced that he's scum and your tinfoil theory (if it was meant to be serious) doesn't actually work because it is a heck of a lot easier for scum to simply look at Green's list of reads, eliminate everyone not listed as town, eliminate everyone Green voted for or who suspected/voted for Green and then read their ISO's to see who had an unnaturally strong townread on Green. And even if Yos was scum, I doubt that's remotely the tactic he would take. What are your other reads? I'd also like a more in-depth read on Quar from you. You've gone after Quilford for coasting most of D1. Why does Quar escape your attention?"}

And even if Yos was scum, I doubt that's remotely the tactic he would take. What are your other reads? I'd also like a more in-depth read on Quar from you.

Can you see <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scum</span> doing this?  If the answer is \"well I don't think so?\" or anything along those lines, then why on earth are you only focusing on the town side of it?

But, as I said, you don't seem to be scumreading me over this and I actually thought you were pretty town up until now.  Well I still think you are town, but the business of asserting that there was no town motivation in what I'm doing implies you think it was scummy but perhaps you didn't really make that leap which means my whole rant about \"lack of town motivation\" does not equate to \"scummy\" was mostly irrelevant.

I also don't think she's the type of player to \"back up\" what she feels so you expecting her to doesn't jive with your being a player who can see town motivation in all sorts of weird things and doesn't really expect town to behave in a set way.<br><br>I do expect you to tell me to vote your scumreads because it is something you're capable of doing and if you were town, you'd know that that's the optimal play. Unless you are admitting to making a mistake/suboptimal play under duress but that doesn't make sense either because you don't admit to making a mistake - you just keep calling the points \"derp\" as if you are not at fault.<br><br>And I don't find it implausible for scum to whiteknight the biggest wagons.

I can maybe buy not going against the tide though. I did say you weren't pushing PZ. For most of the later part of D1, you talked about him being your biggest scumread but there was no real follow up there. I'll double-check to see what I'm missing in a bit.

Nearly the entire post is you pointing out that you were confused by Bookitty's questions, found them strange and noted that she doesn't follow up or engage with her scumreads. The only three town things you pointed out were a) Nailing AP on hypocrisy. b) Persuing the fact that nobody posted a case on her. c) Agreeing with her meta-assessment of SleepyKrew. Out of those, the only decent reason is the third one on SleepyKrew. The second one; being frustrated at the lack of a case on you is null as scum could easily be frustrated at not knowing why they are caught. Would like an elaboration on why you think this is a towntell. The first one - the hypocrisy point makes no sense to me. She <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956602#p6956602\" class=\"postlink\">asks</a> AP if he considers hypocrisy a scumtell and when he <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6956842#p6956842\" class=\"postlink\">says he doesn't</a>, she <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6969015#p6969015\" class=\"postlink\">townreads</a> him for it which strikes me as a really shallow read but it is far from \"nailing him\" on the hypocrisy point since she never actually scumreads him.<br><br>A few other reads I want elaborated on: <br>(1) What exactly about Yos's case on Green do you find \"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6999924#p6999924\" class=\"postlink\">internally consistent</a>\" and why is it townish on his part? I don't know what you mean by \"internally consistent\" and how it applies here so defining it and explaining it in context would help.<br>(2) You never talk about AP in your initial reads-list on D1. Explain your read and your reasons for them.<br>(3) What is it about PZ that caused a \"burgeoning\" townread in contrast to his D1 play where you didn't seem to like anything he posted in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7002137#p7002137\">Post 823</a>?<br>(4) When you get the chance, I'd like to see you talk about what caused the change in your read on DrDolittle from \"probably town\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7000005#p7000005\">Post 804</a> to nearly at the bottom of your scumlist in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7046831#p7046831\">Post 1214</a>."}

I'd normally be afraid that this is a 'shallow' read based on them both generating content and that its alignment neutral, but I am not really having a hard time identifying with their posts on an emotional level at all.  I especially think Yos's stance on my lynch is more likely to come from town...or at least the way he expressed it is, which is to say hes essentially ready to take any blame for lynching me.  He never outright said it- but it was somewhat implied and I overall don't really think he's faking anything.  GC....my points for Yos-town kind of rolled of my tongue and I'm having a bit more trouble expressing my feelings on GC.

He's going to almost absurd lengths to defend his town reads.   He goes from 100% confidence to changing his mind His reads in general make sense.   He seems to have absolutely no sense of self-preservation at all, and really never has; it doesn't look like he's picking who to attack and who to defend based on convenience or based on what's more likely to keep him alive.  I kind of like the way he's gone back and forth on Kat, because I feel the same way; from a logical/scumhunting point of view, Kat's posts and voting pattern looks like scum to me, but a lot of Kat's post have a pretty convincing \"townie\" tone and style to them.  (I think the way I described that earlier today was when I said \"I think Kat might be scum, but if so, he's really good at it.\")   <br><br>AP is just obvtown at this point.

I'm townread you before for your push on AP and now for your most recent set of posts. You can disagree if you want but based on what's been put in this thread so far, I deduced that most you vs AP battles will end with him winning. Regardless, it is mostly a moot point, my read only strenghthened based on the latest content. <br><br>@ Bookitty - While it may be fulfilling to lynch everyone whose playstyle varies from yours enough to be a frustration, we'll run out of mislynches pretty fast if we do that. SleepyKrew <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> town. And I'm relatively confident Katsuki is too. <br><br>A lot of your suspicion of him seems to be based on his push of you and his not giving reasons why he thought you were scum. I think reasons - or the lack of them - are primarily a playstyle thing. When people don't give reasons, I normally try and see if their positions make sense to me and I understand almost everything Katsuki posted in the thread. <br><br>He started off suspecting AP in his opening presumably because of AP's opening in the first few pages which many found scummy (including you).<br><br>He suspects you of being scum, potentially with Quar because you dismissed the Quar wagon. As someone who was pushing Quar at the same time, I had a similar reaction (that you were scum with Quar). While we know now that you are town, this wasn't information anyone had at that time and Katsuki's speculations matched mine pretty closely.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7003085#p7003085\">Post 833</a>, he cautions me about pushing a lynch on Lalala stating that she was town. I didn't initially get his reasoning but I assume it is because he thought (just like I do now) that Lalala's opening push on AP was town. It was based on reasoning similar to Katsuki's (AP's first few posts were scummy) and that got me reading her posts in more depth to see what I missed.<br><br>His D2 vote and push on AP was also based on reasoning I can relate to regardless of AP's alignment - and I still think your read on AP was weak - him saying that hypocrisy wasn't a scumtell as opposed to flailing is alignment null. Most people tend to tell the truth about game philosophies as scum. Katsuki's reaction to AP's readslist was fairly town where AP accused him and Lalaladucks of being scum - it makes sense because Lalaladucks seemed to have been a pretty strong townread for Katsuki and AP's posts were just re-inforcing his earlier scumread from when he entered the game.<br><br>Katsuki not answering your questions might be frustrating but you are confirmed town and if town, he doesn't gain as much by explaining himself to you as he would by pushing his scumreads.<br><br>He's one of my few solid townreads and in a game where half the players are disengaged and phoning it in, townreads have been hard to come by. I'd be very disappointed if we wind up lynching Katsuki. If I move my vote, it'd probably be to save Katsuki but at this point Quar is the biggest wagon <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> my biggest scumread so I want to stick with that."}

Soooooo forgive me if I'm really edgy about this softclaim and the whole situation in general despite my good senses telling me to just trust Katsuki's softclaim and burn the odd-claim-out with fire.<br><br>X-shot gunsmith claim is certainly odd.  Trying to argue whether or not it fits in the setup is just irrelevant mod-WIFOM.  \u00bfRobocopter? ran Futurama mafia which had a Gunsmith in it for no reason whatsoever just to fuck with the players.  There is no reason a mod can't just run a GS instead of a cop; it gives scum possible fake claims when they get investigated and is just weaker than a cop overall.  That said, the claim DOES look out of place a tad bit and the CC from Katsuki makes me want to lynch it.  I was thinking that with mason/mason there was likely one other weak role out there.  2 roles more would be a lot and probably not something I would peg Ether for including.  A 1-shot GS would make sense with 2 masons.  1-shot GS + something else really weak and a mafia Rolecop might make sense but ehhhhhhh, less likely.  Unfortunately, Katsuki could just be entirely full of shit because being entirely so is his schtick.<br><br>Ducks posts on the last page.....she singles out the one objectively correct and most alignment neutral post from me to call sketchy.  Terrible scumhunting or just scum?, find out tonight at 11pm on CNN!  Nothing from her on that page really makes me think she's town.  The lack of answering my question about what was different was still terrible and still a dodge of engaging me on the situation.  Hand waving her lack of response away with \"well you didn't say anything interesting\" is pretty unforgivable considering I followed up on her accusation and asked her to just tell me what she perceived was different.  Like.  ITs not like I was asking for an essay or a strong opinion, just a follow up clarification on her initial observation which she wouldn't even do but WHATEVER.  I'm perfectly willing to look like a moron when she flips town and I tunneled her over trivialities.<br><br>What else needs to be said....Yos and Pegasus are still hilariously town.  Quilford is making good posts which doesn't make him town, but makes me less inclined to lynch him for sure.  While I understand the arguments about DrD and Chamber not being on a scumteam together, I respectfully disagree that they should be given much weight.  I still think DrD and Ducks are scum, especially after the point regarding DrD not voting me.  In fact the vote on Chamber makes little sense to me at all which makes me think it could very well be a bus.  Quar might be scum and I wish I had a strong opinion on him right now.  Part of me is saying that the CC + Mason claims + weird claim = scum and the other part of me wants to believe that the claim is too out there to be scum and that Katsuki is too erratic to be a trustworthy source in this situation, alignment aside.  At this point, Katsuki should basically have just full claimed IMO.  If he's town and we lynch scum-Quar Today, then he's basically certain to be shot regardless of how much he claims and I kind of want the information just for my own curiosity and benefit.  Mmmmmmmm.  I will say 100% that if we lynch Quar and he flips town then I am voteparking Katsuki regardless of what he claims and how much evidence of being a VI he can muster up.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Chamber</span> although I will hammer if the alternative is NL or something."}

Two masons + a gunsmith is already arguably too much town power.    Any other strong town power role would almost certanly mean Quar is a liar.

I really think he's going to flip scum.  I was willing to wait a day just in case, but Kat's claim drops the odds of Quar being town below where that seems worthwhile to do, IMHO.  <br><br>If you really think Quar might be town here and you have a better idea of who to lynch, I'm willing to sheep on you here.

Earlier today, I thought Kat was probably scum, and I thought he was good at it.  (And, yes, of course I saw the \"most cunning manipulator\" tag, but I also remember how much it sucked when I was stuck with that tag and got mislynched over and over again that year because of it.)   I understood AP suddenly started reading Kat as town at one point, I just still was reading him as \"probably skilled scum\".   Right now, though, I'm thinking he's probably town.

If the town have, say, 4 townies confirmed on day 3, or something like that, town is almost guarenteed to win.

No follow-up on the meta-digging. His is the fourth vote on the wagon. I dislike the vote without checking what he said he would check and could potentially see this as scum wanting in on the bus so he doesn't look bad.

This sequence is likely town because scum motive to draw momentum from Quar to Quil is undermined by the quick unvote and vote of PapaZito who had no wagon on him. So here, he doesn't have the towncred of being on Quar. He doesn't achieve scum goals of pushing a counterwagon and saving Quar. It doesn't make sense at all from scum. He also committed to reading Quil as town which means he'd be expected to vote Quar if D1 had come down to Quil vs Quar.

It is the sort of post that obligates him to vote Quar if that wagon becomes viable but doesn't give him a lot of towncred because he was only a \"compromise\" vote.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7059853#p7059853\">Post 1299</a> - Says that Quar could be scum re-iterating his scumread from D1.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7065076#p7065076\">Post 1381</a> - Says that he doesn't think Quar is scum.

I want to know specifically what you've found off about Chamber and your reasons for scumreading him.<br>2) The dichotomy between your posts to AP and the refusal to vote him on D2 doesn't make sense to me.

The experiment he said he did of looking at random games to see if he could guess his alignment shows a lot of scumhunting effort and I find it unlikely that scum would do it for their partners. There is potential scum motivation in dismissing the scumreads on Quar as conf-bias but the way he approached it seemed more thoughtful than scum trying to sweep his partner's scumtells under the rug.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6983043#p6983043\">Post 528</a> - Says he doesn't like the Quar wagon. I lean town on this one as well. The scum motive is obvious - speak out against his partner's wagon hoping that it would dismantle. But the town motivation that he doesn't trust anything I'm doing, feels uneasy about a wagon he thinks is based on conf-bias and stopping it seems overwhelmingly more likely than the scum explanation. It also is fairly consistent with his earlier thought process and his later claims that my playstyle traits makes him distrust me.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6983431#p6983431\">Post 535</a> - This looks fairly reasonable as well as not a lot of people seemed like they had their own reasons for voting Quar and the wagon seemed to be built on a case he disagrees with.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6983640#p6983640\">Post 537</a> - The issue I have with this post is why he didn't say anything about me when I first made the case on AP. He only criticized AP for \"piling stuff on\" when AP responded to me but never made a mention that he found my side of my early argument with AP scummy.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7052506#p7052506\">Post 1261</a> - I don't like on hindsight that he got mad on behalf of scum. It could simply be an issue on ethics/principles though. I have a feeling that he was scum, he would say that in his private scum topic and vent there. I haven't discounted that it was meant to incite the town to rally for Quar or make town think that Quar was being unfairly treated to incite the mob. I'm going with principle as the most likely explanation.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063361#p7063361\">Post 1373</a> - Says he doesn't believe Katsuki but votes him in the next post although he says Katsuki could be town. It is at least consistent with his previous positions of not trusting Katsuki and feeling that the Quar wagon was unjustified.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063944#p7063944\">Post 1378</a> - Points out that Katsuki's claim feels fake from what he knows of Katsuki.

I don't think scum would post in quite this manner. The rest of his posts today saying that Katsuki is lying are fairly reasonable and explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7078654#p7078654\">Post 1534</a>.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7074375#p7074375\">Post 1464</a> - I find this to be a major towntell. If Chamber deduced that one of his scumbuddies are weak enough that they would eventually be lynched, I think it would make more sense to adopt a distance/bussing type strategy rather than defend them strongly.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Conclusions</span>:<br>A lot of what Chamber is doing fits with a town motive, is consistent and while he may have been wrong about Quar, the way he went about it fits more with town than a partner. For one, I think he would have distanced a partner who he thought may not make it to endgame, he wouldn't have been so blatant about pursuing Katsuki as opposed to Quar. The few concerns I had were that he was missing a lot of what made Quar scum and never really questioned Quar or considered him potential scum focusing more on defending him from the pushes and wagons made on him. The town motive for this can be explained by his distrust of the ones pushing Quar and I feel scum wouldn't be as blatant. <span class=\"noboldsig\">@ Quilford</span>, I haven't forgotten your promised case on Chamber at the end of D2. I'd like opinions/analysis on this post as well as your case if you still feel confident that Chamber is scum. I'm leaning town on him, wouldn't lynch him today but I'm not 100% positive I'm right."}

In this Quar post, he accuses Yos and Empire of distancing. He first takes issue with Yos saying that GC/Quar aren't scum together and interprets it as Yos saying that only one of them can be scum. Then he accuses Yos and Empire of distancing, and votes Yos as the likelier scum. I didn't like this accusation when he made it and it seemed like he was quickly rushing to post a counter-theory to Empire's tinfoil theory that he and Yos are scum together. <br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6973860#p6973860\">Post 417</a> - Yos's first post where he attacks Quar. He had no suspicion on Quar earlier. The response was overaggressive. Quar could easily have misinterpreted Yos's \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">if GC is scum, Quaroth is probably town, and vice versa</span>\" as saying that if GC is town, Quar is scum as the \"vice versa\" here isn't very clear as to what it refers to.

Apparently, the post from Quar convinced him that he was wrong on Green Crayons and now that he thinks Quar is scum, GC has to be town. The problem I have with this is that one post by Quar wasn't close to the amount of evidence he had against GC. Quar could have easily been town and misinterpreted what you meant by the GC/Quar dichotomy. It doesn't take away from the pile of evidence you had against GC and comes suspiciously after I voted Quar. <br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6974753#p6974753\">Post 422</a> - This Quar post is actually something that makes me doubt my Yos scumread.

This game, he's definitely been tending much more towards his scum play. I would have been more confident and vocal about it were it not for the fact that he has been disengaged from the game which could explain some of it from a Town POV.

Furthermore, the claim looks extremely convenient for mafia in this situation.  A kill goes missing which sucks for scum, but claiming commuter throws just enough doubt on the whole situation to invalidate an RB/Doc claim.

Of course if Chamber is scum then he would know Katsuki is lying and could just be defending me for credit.  Chamber's insistence that the Commute claim was legitimate before Quilford claimed despite Chamber's distrust of Katsuki is kind of weird....So the tracker claim was obviously a lie but the Commute claim wasn't?  The logic for that seems to be based on \"Well the tracker fake claim makes sense in the context of having commuted\" which..... is kind of like saying that Katsuki claimed to be a Square but later retracted and said hes just a Rectangle, which must be true since Katsuki wouldn't claim Square unless he were at least sort of a Square. :S<br><br>Right.

Its pretty clear that this setup is unbalanced as crap if Quilford is lying.  Mason/mason + 1x Commuter is pretty scum sided, so hes being honest.  Now its at least 2xMasons + RB.  This setup would mean there are no mafia PRs in the game.  Adding a 1x Commuter would pretty much not affect the balance (including presence of mafia PRs).

Yet, he defended Quar quite blatantly. He even went so far as to read Quar's past games using my case as a baseline so he could get a read on both Quar and me. When Quar wagon was its peak D1, he never caved but continued arguing against it despite how bad it might make him look on a surface level. I'm reaching and stretching to see how he fits with Quar as a scum partner.<br><br>And yet the town motives for all these actions are easy to see. He didn't agree with the case on Quar, he found it suspicious, he found the wagon development suspicious, he thought it unfair that Quar couldn't respond to activity elsewhere as a matter of principle. He was working against what he thought was a bad lynch.<br><br>Even though the evidence is pointing one way, I think a deeper look at his motives indicate he's far more likely town.

I also really don't like pegasus' method of presenting points. It annoyed me (and made me suspicious of him) when he did it to AP.

He's doing things like trying to undermine the cases made against them without really confronting them directly, and he's never willing to say he has a town read and Quar, but yet he's always there killing momentum on the Quar wagon, usually in an understated kind of way.<br><br>Overall, that's pretty much the pattern of chamber's day 1 Quar defense; effective, but always a little reserved, a little \"soft\", a little cautious.<br><br>Meanwhile, this is AP's day 1 Quar:<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6967506#p6967506\" class=\"postlink\">post 340</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite>Don't really want to lynch these people right now:<br>Yos/GC - The shouting match looks really town to me?

And there's certanly a lot of WIFOM here, from both sides.

You don't get to decline questions at this point since you are the most likely lynch. It was fine when you were considered universally town and the effect to the gamestate wasn't very high if you ignored them. If you are town, it is your responsibility to play to your wincon and find and lynch scum and not give up and allow your lynch bringing scum a step closer to a win. I'll post all of my questions here for convenience.<br><br>(1) If you found my push on AP scummy, why did you make no mention of it during the push and only focus on AP, pointing out flaws in his posts?<br>(2) What was your own read on Quar during D1 when the wagon was building?

No follow-up on the meta-digging. His is the fourth vote on the wagon. I dislike the vote without checking what he said he would check and could potentially see this as scum wanting in on the bus so he doesn't look bad. But this occured right after a votecount in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6982149#p6982149\">Post 526</a> and he could see that he can also vote Bookitty and tie up the wagons giving his partner Quar a greater chance of survival so I'm still conflicted on the motivation for his vote.

This sequence is likely town because scum motive to draw momentum from Quar to Quil is undermined by the quick unvote and vote of PapaZito who had no wagon on him. So here, he doesn't have the towncred of being on Quar. He doesn't achieve scum goals of pushing a counterwagon and saving Quar. It doesn't make sense at all from scum. He also committed to reading Quil as town which means he'd be expected to vote Quar if D1 had come down to Quil vs Quar.

Just a percentage, please don't say anything else."}

The argument between Yos and AP where Yos takes Kat's side and pushes Chamber and AP takes Chamber's side and pushes Kats thus setting up a dichotomy looks extremely contrived and overstated. My best guess for the scumteam is that they are it. <br><br>There are several things I want to re-assess though and I really hate PapaZito's recent posts where he goes on about setup-spec for several posts collecting a list of theories and making zero conclusions. DrDolittle's posts are no better and his interaction with and about AP feels very, very fake. I'll post a list of concerns I have on Yos/AP and then POE the game from scratch after that."}

You may call 3 votes a \"wagon\" but Chamber's vote was there before yours.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7088617#p7088617\" class=\"postlink\">post 1724</a>, Yosarian2 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">I really think that the Quar wagon on day 1 was primarily because of me.</span>  Yes, you voted him right before I did (although I didn't see your vote until after I made my case against him), but I was pretty clearly the most aggressive one in attacking him, my case against him quite strong and unrelated to anything you posted, and I think I am the reason the wagon took off the way it did.  (It's not the reason GC voted for him, since GC didn't trust me, but other then that.)

But note that the post you're attacking here was in response to Bookitty implying I hadn't done anything this game, so I was giving examples of all the big things I did on day 1.   That's the context here, which you seem to be missing.   I wasn't claiming \"credit\" for anything, I was explaining what I've done this game.

I naked-voted Quar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6973825#p6973825\">Post 412</a>.

No one else hopped onto the wagon and everyone just went about their own way. That was on page 17.

GC voted in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6980727#p6980727\">Post 513</a> based on my case.

The post is five words, none of which mention him distrusting you or thinking that the wagon is based on conf-bias at all. \"I don't like this wagon.\" You are inventing excuses for chamber and then calling them 'overwhelmingly more likely' when there's literally no evidence for them in his post at all."}

I also really don't like pegasus' method of presenting points. It annoyed me (and made me suspicious of him) when he did it to AP.

Then I unvoted AP and voted GC, at which point the AP wagon collapsed almost immediately, and the entire game was nothing but several pages of walls going back and forth between me and GC, and other people's reaction to the Yos v GC fight, with almost nothing else going on.

Every major event, every change of focus, that had happened up to that point seemed (from my perspective) to have been something initiated by me.   I was actually worried about that, because it felt like something like half the people in the game were lurking or hanging back, and I was worried that that might be because I was posting too much, and that was making it harder to get a read on a lot of other people.   So I made the deliberate decision at that point to start to hang back a little and let other people take the lead for a while.<br><br>I get that you think your day 1 contributions to the Quar wagon might have been even bigger then mine, and fine, objectively you may be right.

I wouldn't just claim and threaten to self hammer on P7. I'd do something (that I consider) disingenuous  like go through all the votes on me and decide on one or two to call flimsy.  I know how to pander, I just don't feel the need to do it as scum.  I'm more open as town and more likely to talk about how I feel.  My push on Katsuki actually is something  that is kind of neutral for me. When town,  I'm usually uncertain of who to lynch and try to get in quick off the cuff dialogues with people and get town reads based on who sounds genuine.  The biggest point I have for me being town this game is the  emotional attitude I've had around being willing to be lynched.  I'm always stubborn but my potshots comments that I somewhat regret and challenging aura that manifests in asking to be lynched is not the sort of bravado I have as scum.  As scum I'm totally capable of keeping a lid on it enough to do things that I know people will town read me for. As town I just don't care to.<br><br>This quick and dirty postv was done on the phone."}

I thought Yosarian's walls with GC looked town v town and his push on Bookitty was awkward in a probably town way.  Interactions with Pegasus including Pegasus doing a 180 and saying that the game suddenly makes sense now that Yos is town as if he were Jimmy Cliff is a little strange to be sure.  Still that is entirely paranoia, and most of the things Yos posts look town to me on an individual level.<br><br>Chamber: His comments on his own meta look town.  His play yesterday didn't feel like what I've seen of his scumgame and some of the sentiments have looked genuine.  The RB on him makes me willing to lynch him ultimately although I suspect he's town.<br><br>DrD: Meh?  Vote and quick unvote on Chamber showed a bit of transparency that I wouldn't expect to see from scum in most cases.  I still agree that the little bit he did with Quilford on D1 is more likely town than not.  This isn't a very strong read.<br><br>PZ: Replaced UT who was kind of gross.  Has spent the last several posts just listing possibilities that explain the lack of night kill without really coming to any conclusion.  Null-scummy I suppose.  -shrug-<br><br>Katsuki: Terrible.  Fakeclaiming guilties and making weird roleclaims that are pretty improbable.<br><br>Ducks: Pretty much what I've said.  Her push on me felt like an effort to appear town at the beginning of the game.  No follow up on most of her stuff and pandering to DrD.  Having a hard time seeing her town train of thought in this game."}
