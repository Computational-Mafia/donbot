(as I like to make this post as my second post and I have something to comment on so... wanna do my second post followed by the comment). So... here we go.<br><br>Hello Everyone!, For those who know my play style this will be my normal meta post so... feel free to skip. For everyone else... time to write <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> hiya, I'm naomi and I have a very strange play style. Starting with a quirk; I call town Green and Mafia Reds I've only recently started doing this and I do slip up on this from time to time. So... going forward bare this in mind. <br><br>Now. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br><br>The strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br><br>I do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing. But.... It sometimes leads me to just null conculsions or just leads no where... its kinda a thing.<br><br>I am also aware that people see these kinda posts and go; Self meta BS. when I've been doing them there are generally 3 pools of people. those who believe me, those who played with me, and those who don't. If your currently falling in the last group of players feel free to browse my wiki, I post every game I've completed in it and it can be a good source for you to confirm this information. of course most of you won't.. but that just tends to be how it is.<br><br>Finally though my account is an older one I have only played a small pool of games as I took around about a year and a half break between two of my games only starting steadily again this year. So.. though I'm an older account I lack the experience and skill of many of my contemporaries.<br><br>So.. yeah.. thats pretty much all you need to know to get a good read on myself and... yeah lets get to that post I wanted to make."}

I don't remember them so they can't be great... null<br><br>Drone - They are likely also green though I disagree with there reads. I just think the emotion they brought with the entrance was real and probs was the same kinda frustration I expressed when I gave my read on the old situation<br><br>copper223 - I think there Green. they give a little less than others but what they give is pretty good<br><br>Human Sequencer - Also think they are green. they are pretty much like Vert-slim.<br><br>MortFeld - Hmm.. I think they are red.. They antagonised both sides of the maria Creeps rather than going one or the other... which looks more like they are just trying to get a miss lynch rather than find reds..<br><br>Lil Uzi Vert - I think there green. good solid posting and looking at stuff<br><br>TwoFace - They read kinda greenish. I think i'm not a good judge here though.. So.. ima wait for more content<br><br>ChaosOmega - honestly. I don't remember them so they can't be great... null<br><br>Creeps20 - they are bad green... no way they are red... its just too bleh!<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: MortFeld</span>"}

Well, first I thought it was just semantic, but I did have an issue with specifically this - why would you pressure lynchbait, if you already know they'll react scummily (this is a misconception in retrospect - you pressure anyone acting scummy to see what they do)<br>     --Copper said that this was me coming up with a new reason to scumread him. I disagree - the reason is the same (parked vote), this new support for the reason was just something else I thought of while he was arguing with TwoFace about the definition of lynchbait.<br>-Copper said that any scum under pressure will react differently to the pressure than town will.<br>-I pointed out that while this is true, a weaker player like Creeps could mimic a scum reaction as town, and scum might pressure him in order to find something like this. I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> saying that Copper himself was doing this - the point was just to support the idea that pressuring lynchbait so described has no purpose.<br>-The remainder of the argument from Copper's side was under the impression that I was accusing him of this. This misconception (which was warranted honestly since my argument was wrong and my case on him weak to begin with) plus his abrasive tone made me not want to drop it.<br><br>Hope that explains it.

With that game state, how is it reasonable to expect people to commit fully to their vote? And how is it scummy if they don't?"}

I felt like his reaction to creepy being L-2 didn't make sense. If he was genuinely concerned he would have unvoted, not say he is keeping his vote but will unvote at L-1<br>2. He attempted to misrep me by saying my posts about him said 2 different things when they clearly didn't. Even when I point them out and show they say the exact same thing, he refuses to admit his mistake. I may be naive but I am of the belief that scum is less likely to admit their mistakes, town should have no problems admitting theirs.<br>3. The fact that he jumped on TB after TB voted him and went and lied about his activity. There is no evidence that supports Copper's claim and evidence that proves his claim was not true.<br><br>I just don't see a town player doing these things so this is why I think he is scum.<br><br><br>and since I am doing it, My scum read on HS is kind of harder to explain. What pinged me first was the weird drone comment. Drone hadn't even posted and he was asking drone if he agreed with him or something like that. Later HS claims he saw the mod post that drone had confirmed but somehow missed that he was on V/LA which I think is unlikely especially when HS said he wasn't skimming. Even if he were skimming, I doubt he would miss that but when HS said he wasn't skimming I just don't see how he misses it. The fact that he avoided my question about copper lying about TB and now actually sides with Copper about TB when the facts prove them both wrong, just points to scum to me.<br><br>I think Drone is scum only if HS is scum. Outside of that I don't have a read on drone<br><br>Misa - is scummy to me for the fake outrage post she made, her replacing out doesn't bode well but I don't have enough to lynch her which is why I am not trying to atm<br><br>Those are my reads, like them or not they are what they are. <br><br>ya'll want to policy lynch me for trying to lynch scum, go right ahead but i haven't done shit wrong except maybe be a little abrasive.

Don't we want to avoid policy lynches in general? Isn't the choice between policy lynching TwoFace and normal lynching someone else? Why say 'Let's not policy lynch TwoFace, instead let's policy lynch this other guy!' when nobody is discussing policy lynching Creeps? Wouldn't we rather have Creeps, who isn't being toxic and spewposting, live into day 2 than TwoFace who's going to have to be replaced? I don't know if it's red protecting red, I just don't understand your headspace when you made this post.<br><br>Null on Wobbu and other replacements atm, going to reread with attention to them."}

If this is the truth and TF is scum, then D2 I will be alive and TF will be alive.<br>scumTF claiming vig would be horrible for scumHS, because then scumHS would have to explain why they're still alive every single day with a supposed vigTF aiming at him, and if one of them is lynched from that then the other is immediately incredibly suspicious and must be lynched. Therefore it would be scumHS' highest priority to stop TF from claiming vig and ending his life if he does, which doesn't make sense because I unvote shortly after when I'm informed that TF is being replaced.<br>I think TF and my interaction is at the very least NAI considering that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8489968#p8489968\">this post</a> confirms that my problem was with TwoFace, not the slot.

I think he'd put even just a little more effort in as scum, as opposed to what he's doing in this game. VI read through and through. (I don't mean to offend)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Uzi</span> is reading very genuine to me, and every time he posts he has something valid to say. It reads to me as if he's really posting what he thinks and not holding anything back. It's worth noting he was the first one to pin Misa's ragepost as fake, though TF did recognise it as 'unnecessary'. Mostly it's just the fact that his reads just are how they are, and he doesn't window dress them.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mort</span>, again, genuine. I feel like the way his playstyle adapted after his conflict with Copper was very organic, and especially lately in the game he's been trying to gamesolve pretty much every post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TB</span> hasn't acted consistently. Her posts are very 'safe'. Her post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480385#p8480385\">169</a> is the first red flag for me, in which she sheeps Uzi's perspective after realizing that it's town accepted (Uzi sure didn't get any flak for that opinion) and then goes on to poke holes in a pincushion which town can and did all agree was playing scummy as hell. This is an easy way to look like you're gamesolving when you're not.<br><br>What really pricked me up is when Mort pointed out post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8483306#p8483306\">373</a>. Here, TB explains that she chose to vote Copper in her earlier post because copper 'Twisted the Lynchbait discussion'. Now what we've all established is that the lynchbait discussion actually happened about 15 posts after TB's vote, but what really struck me is that in that same post TB chooses to agree with Copper on the lynchbait discussion.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8483306#p8483306\" class=\"postlink\">post 373</a>, ThinkBig wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8481042#p8481042\" class=\"postlink\">post 217</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>Sorry copper. Scum can't be lynchbait cause the goal is to lynch scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is objectively false.</div></blockquote><br>There's also the inconsistencies between her vote and readslists, which has already been talked about. Again, I didn't come to this conclusion by myself, it was bought to my attention by Mort I think it was?<br>She then V/LAs for 300 posts.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Misa</span> is a new player-- She's only played two newbies before this one. The chance that new players replace out of scum slots is far higher than new players replacing out of town slots. Normally this wouldn't be enough for me, but she was town in both of those games and beyond that, she hasn't exactly acted completely cleanly in thread. A lot of her early posts read manufactured and fake to me, not only the allcaps one. Furthermore, her last post was on the 6th, so I don't think it's unlikely that she came back around about the time when we were all posting readslists, a lot of which she showed up red on. I think this would be enough to scare a budding scum away.<br><br>TB is far higher on the scumlist than Misa for me, though.</div></div></div><br><br>@Mort You're right, it is a completely different discussion, but in my mind it wasn't a discussion, it was just the smarter move. I thought that if I laid my logic bare, everybody else would agree with me that Creeps is the better policy lynch to make. Obviously it was dumb, but I didn't think through the mindset of everybody who was trying to PL twoface. I was playing fast and loose and now I'm paying the price.<br><br>I might go to sleep any time now, and I don't doubt there's at least one other person who suspects me enough to put me on L-1 and ask me to claim while I'm away.

Let me lay out what I'm saying:<br><br>-According to you, you pushed lynching Creeps as an alternative to lynching TF because you thought a policy lynch was inevitable and Creeps was more likely to be scum.<br>-This would be the town motivation for the push - there are numerous plausible scum motivations. If both sides are equally plausible the push was NAI.<br>-Your stated town motivation makes absolutely no sense. Even if a policy lynch was inevitable, it was a policy lynch <span style=\"font-style: italic\">of TF</span>. Introducing Creeps as an alternative does nothing about the TF policy lynch; it's a completely different discussion. You're not explaining this part. How does saying 'Policy lynch Creeps instead!' convince people not to PL TF?<br>-Granted, even if this is explained, there are a number of other issues with the play. Also, the scum case makes way more sense than the town still. Creeps had softclaimed (though you claim to not have noticed and I kind of believe you?), Creeps is nowhere near a reasonable PL in my mind (he's new and bad, but he's not ruining the game. There are 3 scum), and you then voted TF 'once a policy lynch became inevitable.' Huh? You thought TF was town. Why would you ever vote a townie? And your vote took it to L-2, I'd hardly call L-3 inevitable but L-2 is getting there.<br><br>This sums up why I think your part in the PL wagon was scummy.<br><br>Pedit: yeah I'm curious about anyone's reasoning for strongly TRing LUV at this point.</div></blockquote><br>You asked why this makes HS look town<br><br>For one its completely understandable to mix up a few things. namely that an alternative policy lynch somehow cancels out the first<br>This sort of illogical thinking is towny bc theres no scum motivation<br>UNLESS you made the case that HS was sort of losing footing and needed to explain himself offhand and made a mistake in doing so, but i dont see that happening and i dont think you see it either<br>So putting that aside, what does scum HS gain from proposing a different policy lynch?  And something like making a mistake in assuming a policy lynch is inevitable or not, thats not scummy thats just a mistake. Theres no attempt at subterfuge, manipulation, coasting, etc. theres just doing what he thinks is correct and making some errors<br><br>plus his claim post was super town :P"}

Let me lay out what I'm saying:<br><br>-According to you, you pushed lynching Creeps as an alternative to lynching TF because you thought a policy lynch was inevitable and Creeps was more likely to be scum.<br>-This would be the town motivation for the push - there are numerous plausible scum motivations. If both sides are equally plausible the push was NAI.<br>-Your stated town motivation makes absolutely no sense. Even if a policy lynch was inevitable, it was a policy lynch <span style=\"font-style: italic\">of TF</span>. Introducing Creeps as an alternative does nothing about the TF policy lynch; it's a completely different discussion. You're not explaining this part. How does saying 'Policy lynch Creeps instead!' convince people not to PL TF?<br>-Granted, even if this is explained, there are a number of other issues with the play. Also, the scum case makes way more sense than the town still. Creeps had softclaimed (though you claim to not have noticed and I kind of believe you?), Creeps is nowhere near a reasonable PL in my mind (he's new and bad, but he's not ruining the game. There are 3 scum), and you then voted TF 'once a policy lynch became inevitable.' Huh? You thought TF was town. Why would you ever vote a townie? And your vote took it to L-2, I'd hardly call L-3 inevitable but L-2 is getting there.<br><br>This sums up why I think your part in the PL wagon was scummy.<br><br>Pedit: yeah I'm curious about anyone's reasoning for strongly TRing LUV at this point.</div></blockquote><br>You asked why this makes HS look town<br><br>For one its completely understandable to mix up a few things. namely that an alternative policy lynch somehow cancels out the first<br>This sort of illogical thinking is towny bc theres no scum motivation<br>UNLESS you made the case that HS was sort of losing footing and needed to explain himself offhand and made a mistake in doing so, but i dont see that happening and i dont think you see it either<br>So putting that aside, what does scum HS gain from proposing a different policy lynch?  And something like making a mistake in assuming a policy lynch is inevitable or not, thats not scummy thats just a mistake. Theres no attempt at subterfuge, manipulation, coasting, etc. theres just doing what he thinks is correct and making some errors<br><br>plus his claim post was super town <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"></div></blockquote><br><br>Except there was motivation there for him to advocate that we should policy lynch Creeps because Creeps had soft claimed earlier. As Toto pointed out, HS looked like he was getting intimidated after the soft claims and since he assumed TF was claiming vigilante, I don't see why he wouldn't naturally try to shift the focus to Creeps since if I recall correctly, there was no little to no hints as to what power role Creeps may or may not have."}

Let's accept that not caring about looking town is a towntell. Scum know this and will try to imitate this behavior when possible. As the game goes on, this becomes more difficult as information grows.<br><br>Now, Nero has commented on a very small portion of the game timewise and has exclusively focused on 2/13 of the game's players. The question was: is not caring about looking town really such a strong town tell when the sample size is so small?

Mort - HS has been making posts that look obvtown. You see the difference? And you see how one is a read, and the other is an observation about recent post content? And you see how Road is absolutely either wrong or misrepping? And you see how one leads to a vote and one leads to questions (such as - Mort, how do you actually feel about HS. Too bad Road didn't ask this and didn't believe/even read my answer)? And you see why a Red player would pick up on little town inconsistencies and disguise them in theory as actual Red behavior? Why on Earth would a Green player refuse to read the thread and decide to vote for me over this, instead of any of the other actual Red candidates?

Road's sig has nothing to do with this situation. In the heat of passion I voted you and Red! read you. In the cold eye of logic, I Red! read you. The more recent struggle I am having was from your pre-Road posts and, while I said it was gut, it's actually logic. More accurate is that you did things that I think would more likely come from Green than Red. But post-Road I am quickly losing faith. It's also hilarious to say 'Of course Green! Road wouldn't understand your thing you said - even their sig explains why!' Why are you defending Road, who should be defending themselves, with reasoning that doesn't even come from the game?<br><br>Giving HS this last chance before I start looking at the game through a HS + Road = Red team lens.<br><br>Giving Road a chance to read the thread and come back with something that makes sense - if this happens I'll reconsider."}

Most of my scumread comes from Misa, though. Kamelot reads kinda green in how frank she is in putting her opinions forward-- which is why the argument reads TvT to me. Kamelot is more experienced than Misa though, which is why I'm still suspicious of the slot and wouldn't mind it gone if push comes to shove.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8510367#p8510367\" class=\"postlink\">post 1203</a>, MortFeld wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8510202#p8510202\" class=\"postlink\">post 1201</a>, Human Sequencer wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8507270#p8507270\" class=\"postlink\">post 1139</a>, MortFeld wrote:</cite>One of the few things I agree with you on is that HS has been obvtown posting.</div></blockquote><br>Read this from the perspective of another player.

The scum motivation is that this is an easy way for her to look like she's contributing information and scumhunting without actually doing either of those. She then makes an empty jab at Creeps, which I've already talked about. Creeps' posting was obviously a mess. Poking holes in it is what town had already been doing the entire time, again, TB knows that this won't draw suspicion because it's already been done before. This is an easy way for her to look like she's scumhunting, again, when really she's just poking holes in swiss cheese.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480618#p8480618\">180</a> TB does similar. They reflect upon to town something that is obviously correct and cannot be argued (Mislynches are bad) and mirrors the perspective Naomi took in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478884#p8478884\">134</a>, for which Naomi caught no flak. They then make an empty jab at Mort's preceding post, despite him explaining his reasoning in that very post. Something important here-- one of TB's reasonings for voting Misa is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478028#p8478028\">77</a>, on which she comments. But this post came from eons ago, from before TB was even in the game. They only decided to comment on it when they were asked to explain their vote, which came later. Translation: TB only formulated an opinion on why she votes Misa after she was asked to, and when she does, she mirrors the 'safe' perspective Naomi already mentioned. The scum motivation for voting Misa in the first place was that town viewed the slot as generally scummy, and it was a very safe vote to make, along with Creeps, who was her other target at the time.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480914#p8480914\">207</a> <br>Notice that TB townreads the two people whose perspective they pilfered before.<br>Beyond that, she mirrors the perspective of TwoFace and Mort before her, wondering about the Drone question. Again, a perspective that has shown to be non-combative in the thread. Then she calls for activity of people who have been inactive. Really safe play, nobody can argue that we want those people to post more.<br><br>They jumped on the Copper wagon without explaining why, only explaining later when they were asked to. As Copper has pointed out, one of the three people who opportunistically jumped on his wagon is very likely scum, and I'm willing to put a lot of faith int hat claim. Mort and TF both read obvtown to me, which leaves TB, whose vote is the least well justified anyway.<br><br>As I explained in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, TB agreed with Copper on the lynchbait discussion, and then later decided to vote Copper for his part in the lynchbait discussion. Furthermore, as Mort has pointed out, their reasoning to vote Copper came about 15 posts after they voted Copper. Translation: TB only had to decide on why they thought Copper was scum after they were asked to.<br><br>I only just realized this now, actually.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8503571#p8503571\" class=\"postlink\">post 982</a>, ThinkBig wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8503509#p8503509\" class=\"postlink\">post 979</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite>TB, if that game is becoming increasingly difficult for you by the day, replace out.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think that's only fair for you guys and for town. /replace requested as I really don't know how to play or what to do.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8503571#p8503571\" class=\"postlink\">post 982</a>, ThinkBig wrote:</cite>I think that's only fair for you guys | and for town.</div></blockquote><br>This could be a scumslip, but I'm not willing to put too much faith into it.<br><br>The final point is that, like I said in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, newbies replace out of scum slots more often because they get overwhelmed and don't know what to do.

The scum motivation is that this is an easy way for her to look like she's contributing information and scumhunting without actually doing either of those. She then makes an empty jab at Creeps, which I've already talked about. Creeps' posting was obviously a mess. Poking holes in it is what town had already been doing the entire time, again, TB knows that this won't draw suspicion because it's already been done before. This is an easy way for her to look like she's scumhunting, again, when really she's just poking holes in swiss cheese.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">TB says the same thing as Uzi in agreement, not realizing he can just say \"I agree with that thing Uzi said.\" Asking why Creeps was afraid of posting is not an empty jab, it is an honest question aimed at understanding why Creeps plays the way he does.</span></span><br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480618#p8480618\">180</a> TB does similar. They reflect upon to town something that is obviously correct and cannot be argued (Mislynches are bad) and mirrors the perspective Naomi took in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478884#p8478884\">134</a>, for which Naomi caught no flak. They then make an empty jab at Mort's preceding post, despite him explaining his reasoning in that very post. Something important here-- one of TB's reasonings for voting Misa is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478028#p8478028\">77</a>, on which she comments. But this post came from eons ago, from before TB was even in the game. They only decided to comment on it when they were asked to explain their vote, which came later. Translation: TB only formulated an opinion on why she votes Misa after she was asked to, and when she does, she mirrors the 'safe' perspective Naomi already mentioned. The scum motivation for voting Misa in the first place was that town viewed the slot as generally scummy, and it was a very safe vote to make, along with Creeps, who was her other target at the time.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Brand newbie TB believes a misrep of theory might be Red motivated, doesn't understand that neither Green nor Red will tend to misrep theory. Asking why I voted Copper is not an empty jab if TB doesn't think I gave a reason, so he must have not understood that I had given a reason already. When I said I already gave my reasoning, he asked for a reference post, showing he literally didn't understand what I said when I voted Copper. The Reddish parts of the Misa vote are 1. that it's safe and 2. that part of TB's reasoning was something that TB didn't comment on at the time it happened. 1. if TB is incapable of understanding what makes someone Red or Green, as TB professed to, TB cannot do anything but make safe plays by sheeping reasoning. 2. TB wanted their vote to look good so they came up with a reason after the fact. TB's in-game personality is wanting to please.</span></span><br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480914#p8480914\">207</a> <br>Notice that TB townreads the two people whose perspective they pilfered before.<br>Beyond that, she mirrors the perspective of TwoFace and Mort before her, wondering about the Drone question. Again, a perspective that has shown to be non-combative in the thread. Then she calls for activity of people who have been inactive. Really safe play, nobody can argue that we want those people to post more.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Already explained why Green!TB will mirror perspectives and play safe. Not having consistent internal reads is bad play but does TB really read like someone who is blas\u00e9 toward solving the game? Sounds more like TB feels bad they can't help. The only reason TB's reads list would be Red play is if it indicated that TB was not trying to game solve. Lack of knowledge how =/= lack of trying.</span></span><br><br>They jumped on the Copper wagon without explaining why, only explaining later when they were asked to. As Copper has pointed out, one of the three people who opportunistically jumped on his wagon is very likely scum, and I'm willing to put a lot of faith int hat claim. Mort and TF both read obvtown to me, which leaves TB, whose vote is the least well justified anyway.<br><br>As I explained in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, TB agreed with Copper on the lynchbait discussion, and then later decided to vote Copper for his part in the lynchbait discussion. Furthermore, as Mort has pointed out, their reasoning to vote Copper came about 15 posts after they voted Copper. Translation: TB only had to decide on why they thought Copper was scum after they were asked to.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Why should Copper's OMGUSing people on his wagon be reason for you to suspect TB? Is this really reasonable POE?<br>And Green!TB might have jumped on the wagon for the same reason as usual (it's a wagon that exists and other people vote in this game) and when pressed for a reason, gave one that made sense to him when asked, not the one he had when he voted, for the reason that other people give reasons in this game. He's trying to learn how to play.</span></span><br><br>The final point is that, like I said in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, newbies replace out of scum slots more often because they get overwhelmed and don't know what to do. What does it look like happened to TB?<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">It looks like he got overwhelmed and didn't know what to do, yes. Red players lynch Green players more often than the reverse. Does that mean that any time someone lynches a Green player, they are Red? This is the same form as your logic. There is another plausible explanation for TB replacing out, which is that he has no idea how to play the game and believed his continuing was casting a bad light on his slot, a town slot.</span></span><br><br>This is my logic laid bare. If you can't agree with me, help me understand why not.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>If you ignore everything else, two questions: Why should Copper's OMGUSing people on his wagon be reason for you to suspect TB? Is TF's and my townieness really reasonable POE? and: Not having consistent internal reads is bad play but does TB really read like someone who is blas\u00e9 toward solving the game? Sounds more like TB feels bad they can't help. The only reason TB's reads list would be Red play is if it indicated that TB was not trying to game solve. Lack of knowledge how =/= lack of trying."}

I felt like his reaction to creepy being L-2 didn't make sense. If he was genuinely concerned he would have unvoted, not say he is keeping his vote but will unvote at L-1<br>2. He attempted to misrep me by saying my posts about him said 2 different things when they clearly didn't. Even when I point them out and show they say the exact same thing, he refuses to admit his mistake. I may be naive but I am of the belief that scum is less likely to admit their mistakes, town should have no problems admitting theirs.<br>3. The fact that he jumped on TB after TB voted him and went and lied about his activity. There is no evidence that supports Copper's claim and evidence that proves his claim was not true.<br><br>I just don't see a town player doing these things so this is why I think he is scum.<br><br><br>and since I am doing it, My scum read on HS is kind of harder to explain. What pinged me first was the weird drone comment. Drone hadn't even posted and he was asking drone if he agreed with him or something like that. Later HS claims he saw the mod post that drone had confirmed but somehow missed that he was on V/LA which I think is unlikely especially when HS said he wasn't skimming. Even if he were skimming, I doubt he would miss that but when HS said he wasn't skimming I just don't see how he misses it. The fact that he avoided my question about copper lying about TB and now actually sides with Copper about TB when the facts prove them both wrong, just points to scum to me.<br><br>I think Drone is scum only if HS is scum. Outside of that I don't have a read on drone<br><br>Misa - is scummy to me for the fake outrage post she made, her replacing out doesn't bode well but I don't have enough to lynch her which is why I am not trying to atm<br><br>Those are my reads, like them or not they are what they are. <br><br>ya'll want to policy lynch me for trying to lynch scum, go right ahead but i haven't done shit wrong except maybe be a little abrasive.

I felt like his reaction to creepy being L-2 didn't make sense. If he was genuinely concerned he would have unvoted, not say he is keeping his vote but will unvote at L-1<br>2. He attempted to misrep me by saying my posts about him said 2 different things when they clearly didn't. Even when I point them out and show they say the exact same thing, he refuses to admit his mistake. I may be naive but I am of the belief that scum is less likely to admit their mistakes, town should have no problems admitting theirs.<br>3. The fact that he jumped on TB after TB voted him and went and lied about his activity. There is no evidence that supports Copper's claim and evidence that proves his claim was not true.<br><br>I just don't see a town player doing these things so this is why I think he is scum.<br><br><br>and since I am doing it, My scum read on HS is kind of harder to explain.

Even if he were skimming, I doubt he would miss that but when HS said he wasn't skimming I just don't see how he misses it. The fact that he avoided my question about copper lying about TB and now actually sides with Copper about TB when the facts prove them both wrong, just points to scum to me.<br><br>I think Drone is scum only if HS is scum.

When you don't have much choice you need to swing on to other possiblites. And on the other hand, Chaos has not done anything better than cooper and he more experienced than anyone here and I expect him either have good reasons to lurk or intentionally avoiding the game because he is scum.

If you know that I lurk as either alignment, and your vote reasoning was only for pressure, what are you hoping to accomplish? Also, your vote on me \"to make me post more\" was less than an hour after I posted, and not during the day and a half after my V/LA where I didn't post. Weird, like you needed approval in the form of Arc voting me before you felt comfortable doing it yourself.<br>----<br><br>TwoFace, I know how much you like talking about game-avoiding.

You're trying to portray it as a blatant contradiction, as if I pulled a massive 180 out of nowhere, and I assume it's to get the final few people on my wagon to tip it over into a mislynch. This isn't the case though. Inbetween those posts, my opinion notably changed in thread.

It reads to me like scum that planned that 'reaction test' excuse out in advance not due to how I'd react to 1479, but due to how others did. It gives him some wiggle room to claim reaction test or stick with his perspective. Town doesn't gain any information from that reaction test, what he claims he has is mostly due to the jump I did on his wagon after he heard my response to his 'reaction test'.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hey look, another person throwing shade at Toto without explaining it at all.

His conversations and fight between TF seem town to be because the arguments that were flowing between the two is something i can only see two townies behave. Scum usually would avoid being in limelight and wouldn't want further attention on them and the say HS was voted on him and open to see him lynched seems like a frustrated townie. I saw very similar arguments from TF as well. I concluded and changed my opinion towards both of them and also noticed that there are others players like Chaos who is only being opportunist in the game, came up with a lynch but only gave leads on Road but reject to explain in his reads on his remaining lynch pools looks like a setup and open options to hop his vote on day 1<br><br>Hence, I was trying to help HS and TF to see each other in a different perspective as TF was stuck in believing that HS reaction over his soft claim is not legitimate.

It slowly progressed from scum read to possibly town read after talking to them for quite some time.<br> We as townies always open to change our opinion based on player reactions and with the way they handle the pressure and this game i found both HS and TF doesn't seem scum to be at this point of time."}

His only scum read with some reasoning is Road. I am not even sure if anyone even focusing on Road at this point of the game. I want o Chaos come out here and say something about his wagon otherwise i am losing my patience here and hope over this game. Or maybe my instincts are correct.  He is blatantly scum and hoping that he will get escaped while we stuck at never ending crossfire between TF, HS, Me wagons to end this long lasting day 1"}

I'm having a hard time following your posts. Are you basically  saying that the main reason your scum read on HS changed is because you realized she was tunneling you for your predecessor's play and the main reason your scum read on TF changed is when you realized one of the reasons he was pushing HS was for PR fishing? If so, I can understand how your scum reads on both wouldn't be as strong after you realized things but I don't see how they completely went away or how you suddenly seem like you have strong town reads on them. They easily both could have been putting on scum theatre which is a term I'm sure you heard of before. Your only reason for strongly town reading them seems to be that you don't believe they could fake this as scum. Which means your reads are either very weak or fake. <br><br>I'm struggling as to whether I believe Omega's cop claim or not. His play sort of matches up with how a town PR should play it. Lay low just enough that you won't get lynched or night killed. Don't like his reaction to Mort doubting the claim though. It was a simple game balance question and he took it as Mort pushing him which makes me think he's faking and is hiding that he's scum. Also his odd vote on rb. <br><br>I don't feel Chaos needed to defend himself honestly, he's being SR for very flimsy reasons in my opinion. Look at how much of a show Arc is making to get him lynched. She's insulting him and screaming that she will quit if he flips town. Screams like fake outrage in an effort to get the last couple of votes on him for a lynch.<br><br>I'm with Toto here, things need to be sorted out more before I cast a vote again and it looks an HS lynch isn't happening today.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>"}

If TF is as insufferable as you seem to think can you please just ignore him for now</div></blockquote><br><br>Mort, I wanted this to work. Read all my posts again. How my emotions flowed throughout the game.  I understand that i can't expect people to see things from my point of view, But for once, put yourself in my shoes and tell me what options i have when i lost hope on this group.<br><br>I started off the game thinking that HS is scum and TF is probably scum due to his insensitive options to hop into my wagon. After the endless conversations with both HS and TF, I changed my mind, I empathized with TF to understand his point of view better. I changed my read from possible scum to possible town because I felt that they are genuinely investing in-game unlike other players. I started re-looking other players to see If I can find good leads, I read as much as i could and I only end up finding a lot of newbie players who are appear to be scum only because of their poor play. Chaos is the only player who i found it odd in the rest of players, He is an experienced player, He knows to mafiascum as one of the pro-town players and also awarded as BEST TOWN PERFORMACE. I was taken back by his play in this game, this isn't how a pro-town player play, His lynch pool without leads further even pointed that he is possible scum. I started off cornering him to get responses from him, I gave him every opportunity to defend himself, He came back with reasons that he is not around yet making few posts only indicating that he is quietly lurking the game.  As the wagon is building on him and he knew that he has to do something to take off the wagon on him and he doesn't want to invest time in defending himself, so he came back with a fake claim. A claim he knows that people buy it on day 1 without twisting it back thus can buy him more time in the game without being called out until day 2 or more. He hasn't expected that i come back strongly on him, if he is really the town-cop, he would have defended himself to prove me wrong but he rather choose to avoid me time and again, He not only hasn't responded a single question i have asked but continue not to focus on me, because he knows that he retaliate, he will have to answer to me which is ready to do it because that only will make him look suspicious. <br><br>With a lot of VI's in the game who don't understand the site meta end up twisting the wagon on me, this isn't scum expected but they don't care who we lynch today because the remaining is happily under shadow and not wanted to get in between this argument.  I was dragged to a point that i was tired of arguing and was forced to claim myself as i am being lynched just in a day.  <br><br>I never wanted people to lynch Cop0-claim. I was pushing everyone to see how has played the game so far. Its not his claim, its how he claimed and his motive for not being questioned. Everyone doing things as exactly Chaos wanted,  He knows that town wont risk lynching claimed PR on day 1. Chaos was in no danger when he claimed, he only claimed because he doesn't want to answer or defend himself. All I wanted for this group to see his motive. <br><br>I went back and forth and i am really tired physically and emotionally. So, No I dont see a point in debating anyfurther when we have players with 4 year old child mentatlity who is gunning me back because i asked them to see things from my logical perspective <br><br>I know myself that i did everything i could to save the day and unfortunately i am stuck with kind of people who are acting like dog with bone. they don't want to let go of their perspective at any cost.  The truth will be out now or later. And I will wait and let it happen as i lost my patience at this point."}

I am not only saying this i have a gut or hunch. I am speaking out of my experience, I have played with almost all kind of players on this site. I been through, been there done that. I fake claimed myself when i was scum. Check my wiki page. I claimed roles that you cant possibly dream off that a town can handle. I single handily managed my scum team to the victory with my fake claim. I know how this thing works. Have you ever heard of beloved princess role?

There is no other jail keeper to jail me because i am jail keeper and what i did last night was something different and it worked in town's advantage. I now have one less person to worry from my scum list. This is good news for town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Its called basic Game Theory.<br><br>We have a X-Shot Cop, A Jailer and a Vig. Reds have a Shotgun user, and a Goon and one unknown. They also don't have day talk. Unless the last Red is another goon we should have at least 1 more PR. but that doesn't matter, beacuse the point was he didn't know that information.<br><br>My logic being; <br>These people have been confirmed by power role usage finding red and shouldn't be looked at when there is 9 alive. <br>then these people have been extremely townie and been helping find reds<br>then these people was pushed strongly but reds more than what can be considered distancing leaving<br>These people might be red. however, that list is 1 person long Nero. <br><br>And to flip this on you. Why did Red!chaos shoot TF rather than yourself as the only person in the game paranoid enough to think there red. Your a power role thats prevented a kill and confirmed Green and the biggest pusher for your lynch. why would you as Red!chaos not shoot yourself. There is no reason to not.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>Basic game theory?  where did you pick up your basics from?  Show it to me that you know for sure what you're talking about. <br><br>Because I can show you examples on the things that I am referring.<br><br>Naiomi - you're not using your head.  Chaos can't kill me because the moment he does, this group will lynch him with fire because a scum team will always kill COP first.  Giving more nights to cop is more risking than killing me."}

Nero responds with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8515750#p8515750\">1382</a>. Essentially:<br>TF - you are not catching up.<br>Nero - I am active.<br><br>Let's ignore for a second that this is moving the goalposts, and pretend that Nero said \"I have caught up and I've shown it.\" How accurate is this? Has Nero actually caught up? The latest post he explicitly caught up on before his replacement at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8488489#p8488489\">580</a> is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8486621#p8486621\">526</a>. Before that he focuses on stuff around post 100. So there is a 400-post gap, still not sure if he read those. Then for stuff that happens after he replaces in, he is nearly mute! He makes no overt attempt to read or comment on anything between post 580 and post 1382. This is quite odd for a townie, even rb made an attempt to read ISOs and he had more than double the pages to read that Nero had. This is the majority of my case. Not just moving the goalposts and thereby not answering the question, but also the content, which is that Nero was participating and voting yet hadn't made an overt attempt to catch up, or to tell town he didn't intend to catch up. -2<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8515841#p8515841\">1387</a> is a weird question because TF had already made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8514606#p8514606\">1350</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8514078#p8514078\">1332</a> which both show intent to lynch.

The issue from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8516037#p8516037\">1408</a> wasn't that Arc was lurky, the issue was that she made a poor excuse for her being lurky. TF might be wrong that this is a scumtell (I think he most definitely is), but saying 'Arc is always lurky' is not interacting with TF's point. Also is making excuses for Arc again. -1<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4)</span> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519712#p8519712\">1586</a> gross. Also has the side effect of excusing a real justification for the vote. The only reason I can see people doing this as town is to make it seem reasonable when they do it as scum. Nero has zero town cred at this point, no scum is going to jump on the Arc wagon merely given Nero's blessing. I have yet to see a successful reaction test of this sort in any of my games or games I've read. -1<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519750#p8519750\">1589</a> justifying Arc townread based on meta. I have no issue with meta reads in general, but meta reads of this sort... if you are going to justify a townread, do so in a way that isn't circular. \"Arc is town because she looks town\" is not logical.

You're right that neither pushed Nero though but I don't think it's that simple. <br><br>As for my theory, yeah scum could choose to no kill but that doesn't really help them in the long run as that's just giving town more time and chances to weed the last scum out.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8548531#p8548531\" class=\"postlink\">post 2800</a>, MortFeld wrote:</cite>Besides, the gimmick isn't even detracting from gameplay.

The thing I'm hung up on is actually something you brought up - scum can no kill to make us think that the person we jailed is scum.<br><br>The solution Shadow suggested is that if there is no nightkill, we no lynch the following day and jail the same person. If they are town, scum will either nightkill and confirm a townie or continue to no kill. If they are scum, scum will continue to no kill. I am trying to figure out what happens if we have, say, 10 nights of no lynches and no nightkills. I actually believe this is optimal from both sides, given the situation. Another confirmed townie is very bad for scum. If they can, they should do everything in their power to avoid confirming someone.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod, if you can answer this. Is there a set number of days in a row with no kills that results in a win for either side? If so, which side wins, and after how many days? If you can't answer this, can you say explicitly that you can't?</span>"}

I wished my SR on him from earlier had grew and not just simply evaporated because Naomi made a interesting point about his play but it was sort of activity related and I don't like scum reading people for that. I think he also even attempted to buddy me at one point when he wanted people to ask me if his game had improved but for some reason I disregarded that due to not seeing the scum intent at the time. Basically, looking back, I see the signs but he just played very well and a lot better than Drone in my opinion.<br><br>As for assuming we had won, well it had been a long game and I'm in a ton games at the moment so I was just glad that we were at the finish line.<br><br>I'm not opppsed to a Nero lynch, I just can't shake the feeling that RK is scum based on how she described Nero's play."}

So if by \"Scum literally do not have a reason to not kill the cop\" you mean that scum have equivalent reasons to kill the Cop, and to not kill the Cop, then sure I agree. How does this mean that scum would never no kill?"}

Here are my thoughts...<br><br>I understand that you are all angry that i made you wait but i didn't want to end the day before i share my point of view. I could have finished this before my vacation but i was caught up with my work and didn't really had a chance.  With that said, Sorry for keeping you all wait but thanks anyway.<br><br>With 8 alive it is 1:7 for scum. So I can pretty much say that it is impossible for scum to win.  However, we should be careful and definitely more cautious with day lynches because I believe that last night strategy of no night kill from scum is probably to frame Nero. <br><br>Scum realized that if they use their night actions, they will likely get caught so I won't be surprised if they won't make a kill on night 4 as well.  <br><br>No-lynch is something i preferred on Day 3, because I didn't want to mislynch a townie for no reason and we had an odd night cop who could give us information but Chaos result surprised me.  Mort is one last person in the group who may not be get lynched. and it is really making me doubt Chaos again and this time harder than ever.   <br><br>So forget about the No-lynch.  We should lynch Chaos today. And I really need all of you think through this.  There are so many reasons why I think Chaos is scum and done making cases over him again and again and confirming MORT made me think him more scum than town.   <br><br>I dont believe that jailing will help us anymore as scum decided to play hide and seek with us. He will not make a kill and he rather want us to lynch to week and then poor and take his chances to survive till lylo.   Giving the number of VI's in this group, i vision a derp hammer and easy scum win if scum manages to survive till lylo. <br><br>I know that some of you don't even listen to my opinions. In case if we are not lynching chaos today. I choice is to jail-keep him. Since already scum is fool playing us, this wont make any major difference.<br><br><br>Confirm town list :<br><br>Arc is confirmed town (Town Jail Keeper)<br>RB is confirmed town ( I Jailed him)<br>Mort is confirmed town (Chaos confirmed him)<br><br>Nero is probably town (Since Scum knows who we are jail keeping, They wanted us to believe that Nero is scum)<br><br>Chaos is leaning Scum<br><br>Naomi, Shadow &amp; Liz alignments are unknown atm."}

All 3 of you had your lynch preferences, and I wasn't listening to anyone else in the game because I didn't have strong TR's on anyone else. It was a 4-person town block and whatever we decided was going to be the lynch.

That's some bullshit.</div></blockquote><br>I would actually disagree on this front.  There are many times as town where it's better to step back and avoid posting basically the same thing repeatedly, avoid getting into a needless fight, etc.  Games with too much overposting can be unpleasant to slog through and make it difficult for people to especially care about what is happening.  FWIW, I am sometimes an overposter myself, so I freely admit that I can at times be part of this very problem."}

Jailkeeper and cop (even if odd night) are VERY strong roles, and scum has no power to block their actions.  The game going scum-sided would have required either heavy luck (like the scum hitting town's power very early) or the 1-shot vig really blowing a shot and hitting a town PR (objectively, a 1-shot vig should more or less never be shooting night 1 barring just flagrant obvscum or a mechanically locked day 1 dipole where town picked the wrong side).<br><br><br>For comparisons, some other mini normal 10v3 JK/Cop games:<br><br>1445 scum win<br>cop/jk vs goon/goon/tracker<br><br>1559 town win<br>cop/jk/2-shot day gun inventor vs 2-shot strongman/role cop/goon<br><br>1589 scum win<br>cop/jk/1-shot day vig vs role cop/goon/goon<br><br>1707 town win<br>ascetic odd night cop/even night gunsmith/jk/backup role cop vs encryptor/goon/goon<br><br>1708 scum win<br>1-shot gunsmith/even night cop/jk/backup vs goon/1-shot tracker/goon<br><br>1715 town win<br>cop/doc/jk/role cop vs godfather/role cop/roleblocker<br><br>1796 scum win<br>cop/jk/1-shot bp vs 1-shot strongman/JOAT/goon<br><br>1838 town win<br>Cop/JK/2xAscetic vs Neapolitan/Goon/Goon<br><br>this one, town win<br>odd night cop/jk/1-shot vig vs neapolitan/1-shot strongman/goon<br><br>I'd consider this a bit more scum-favored than most of the cop/jk setups, but I'm not sure it needed all that much help.  probably would be fine just by chucking the strongman or nerfing the neapolitan by making it odd night, but even as is I think it's pretty reasonably within the bounds of normal variation in balance."}
