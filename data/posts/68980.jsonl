(as I like to make this post as my second post and I have something to comment on so... wanna do my second post followed by the comment). So... here we go.<br>\n<br>\nHello Everyone!, For those who know my play style this will be my normal meta post so... feel free to skip. For everyone else... time to write <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> hiya, I'm naomi and I have a very strange play style. Starting with a quirk; I call town Green and Mafia Reds I've only recently started doing this and I do slip up on this from time to time. So... going forward bare this in mind. <br>\n<br>\nNow. my Green play style is what I was talking about when I said I have a strange style. I tend to do smaller posts throughout with bigger posts on occasion day 1 I like to do bigger read lists and iso's and stuff but it normally becomes unsustainable. This alone isn't strange<br>\n<br>\nThe strangeness starts now. I also fear death, So.. It warps my views and sometimes I do things just to get people off me. This can easily be miss read as a Red!tell but Thats just kinda how I am. It also leads me to have a LAMIST kinda playstyle pointing things out and I'm also not very good at the game and sometimes when I notice something that looks sorta suspicious but I dunno what to do with it I'll just kinda draw attention to it and flag people into examining it on my behalf as I couldn't draw a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nI do try to be fair and try to think about things from others points of views simulating in my head if something is more likely to be a Green move or a Red move and I tend to post that kinda thing.

Voting for someone that you are overall not confident is scum isn't to me but if I recall correctly, I think Cooper said at the time he'd only move his vote if Creeps reached L-1 before everyone has chimed in and/or posted. That to me reads like aware and cautious considering the current game state, which is fine as well. Feels like only a quarter of the town is playing. With that being said I still have a null read on him because I think the way he's defending his definition on what is or isn't lynch bait could potentially be town with just a different take on the term.

But I don't see a hugely convincing case on Copper from this.</div></blockquote>\nWell that depends on creeps alignment I guess.<br>\n<br>\nif copper/creeps are scum, obviously he's protecting his buddy<br>\n<br>\nif copper is scum/creep is stown - he could be doing that to make him appear like a cautious townie to earn some brownie points. <br>\n<br>\nif copper is town/regardless what creep is - I don't know. <br>\n<br>\nIf I were uncomfortable with somebody being at L-2, I wouldn't wait until he got to L-1 because to unvote.

He could have stolen it, but it doesn't feel that way to me.<br>\n<br>\nThere was also the lynchbait discussion that you were a part of right before his vote from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480793#p8480793\">200</a>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480817#p8480817\">202</a>. Again, this leads to the point of, did he just steal the reasoning? Maybe. I'm more likely to believe he stole it here, since he pairs it with a weird unvote without explanation as you mention. If this was all his thought process, he should have reasoning why he unvotes after considering the information. Could be that he saw TwoFace was the only person left with him and he didn't like how the wagon looked.<br>\n<br>\nThe point on Misa being excluded from the list in 207 is a good point.

As i explain in a post with mort later in the day, if he is actually concerned with the way the wagon is progressing why wait until L-1? why not unvote now. A townie who is uneasy imo would unvote.<br>\n<br>\nargument ensues, his arguments fall flat and don't help change my opinion of him at all.<br>\n<br>\nhere is more from me why copper is scum to me -<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8483290#p8483290\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 0#p8483290</a><br>\n<br>\nposts 383/383 contain me restating why I think he is scum, which again proves I haven't refused to do anything like scum copper replacement has accused me of<br>\n<br>\n387 - me explaining how copper basically tried to twist my posts<br>\n<br>\nHere is the conversation with Mort.

I felt like his reaction to creepy being L-2 didn't make sense. If he was genuinely concerned he would have unvoted, not say he is keeping his vote but will unvote at L-1<br>\n2. He attempted to misrep me by saying my posts about him said 2 different things when they clearly didn't. Even when I point them out and show they say the exact same thing, he refuses to admit his mistake. I may be naive but I am of the belief that scum is less likely to admit their mistakes, town should have no problems admitting theirs.<br>\n3. The fact that he jumped on TB after TB voted him and went and lied about his activity. There is no evidence that supports Copper's claim and evidence that proves his claim was not true.<br>\n<br>\nI just don't see a town player doing these things so this is why I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nand since I am doing it, My scum read on HS is kind of harder to explain. What pinged me first was the weird drone comment. Drone hadn't even posted and he was asking drone if he agreed with him or something like that. Later HS claims he saw the mod post that drone had confirmed but somehow missed that he was on V/LA which I think is unlikely especially when HS said he wasn't skimming. Even if he were skimming, I doubt he would miss that but when HS said he wasn't skimming I just don't see how he misses it. The fact that he avoided my question about copper lying about TB and now actually sides with Copper about TB when the facts prove them both wrong, just points to scum to me.<br>\n<br>\nI think Drone is scum only if HS is scum. Outside of that I don't have a read on drone<br>\n<br>\nMisa - is scummy to me for the fake outrage post she made, her replacing out doesn't bode well but I don't have enough to lynch her which is why I am not trying to atm<br>\n<br>\nThose are my reads, like them or not they are what they are. <br>\n<br>\nya'll want to policy lynch me for trying to lynch scum, go right ahead but i haven't done shit wrong except maybe be a little abrasive.

Can you explain your reads?</div></blockquote>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TF</div> is just too flippant and noncaring to be scum. I think he'd put even just a little more effort in as scum, as opposed to what he's doing in this game. VI read through and through. (I don't mean to offend)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Uzi</div> is reading very genuine to me, and every time he posts he has something valid to say. It reads to me as if he's really posting what he thinks and not holding anything back. It's worth noting he was the first one to pin Misa's ragepost as fake, though TF did recognise it as 'unnecessary'. Mostly it's just the fact that his reads just are how they are, and he doesn't window dress them.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mort</div>, again, genuine. I feel like the way his playstyle adapted after his conflict with Copper was very organic, and especially lately in the game he's been trying to gamesolve pretty much every post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TB</div> hasn't acted consistently. Her posts are very 'safe'. Her post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480385#p8480385\">169</a> is the first red flag for me, in which she sheeps Uzi's perspective after realizing that it's town accepted (Uzi sure didn't get any flak for that opinion) and then goes on to poke holes in a pincushion which town can and did all agree was playing scummy as hell. This is an easy way to look like you're gamesolving when you're not.<br>\n<br>\nWhat really pricked me up is when Mort pointed out post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8483306#p8483306\">373</a>. Here, TB explains that she chose to vote Copper in her earlier post because copper 'Twisted the Lynchbait discussion'. Now what we've all established is that the lynchbait discussion actually happened about 15 posts after TB's vote, but what really struck me is that in that same post TB chooses to agree with Copper on the lynchbait discussion.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8483306#p8483306\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8483306#p8483306\" data-post-id=\"8483306\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 373</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28548\">ThinkBig</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8481042#p8481042\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8481042#p8481042\" data-post-id=\"8481042\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 217</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>Sorry copper.

Again, I didn't come to this conclusion by myself, it was bought to my attention by Mort I think it was?<br>\nShe then V/LAs for 300 posts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Misa</div> is a new player-- She's only played two newbies before this one. The chance that new players replace out of scum slots is far higher than new players replacing out of town slots. Normally this wouldn't be enough for me, but she was town in both of those games and beyond that, she hasn't exactly acted completely cleanly in thread. A lot of her early posts read manufactured and fake to me, not only the allcaps one. Furthermore, her last post was on the 6th, so I don't think it's unlikely that she came back around about the time when we were all posting readslists, a lot of which she showed up red on. I think this would be enough to scare a budding scum away.<br>\n<br>\nTB is far higher on the scumlist than Misa for me, though.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n@Mort You're right, it is a completely different discussion, but in my mind it wasn't a discussion, it was just the smarter move. I thought that if I laid my logic bare, everybody else would agree with me that Creeps is the better policy lynch to make. Obviously it was dumb, but I didn't think through the mindset of everybody who was trying to PL twoface. I was playing fast and loose and now I'm paying the price.<br>\n<br>\nI might go to sleep any time now, and I don't doubt there's at least one other person who suspects me enough to put me on L-1 and ask me to claim while I'm away.

Let me lay out what I'm saying:<br>\n<br>\n-According to you, you pushed lynching Creeps as an alternative to lynching TF because you thought a policy lynch was inevitable and Creeps was more likely to be scum.<br>\n-This would be the town motivation for the push - there are numerous plausible scum motivations. If both sides are equally plausible the push was NAI.<br>\n-Your stated town motivation makes absolutely no sense. Even if a policy lynch was inevitable, it was a policy lynch <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">of TF</div>. Introducing Creeps as an alternative does nothing about the TF policy lynch; it's a completely different discussion. You're not explaining this part. How does saying 'Policy lynch Creeps instead!' convince people not to PL TF?<br>\n-Granted, even if this is explained, there are a number of other issues with the play. Also, the scum case makes way more sense than the town still. Creeps had softclaimed (though you claim to not have noticed and I kind of believe you?), Creeps is nowhere near a reasonable PL in my mind (he's new and bad, but he's not ruining the game. There are 3 scum), and you then voted TF 'once a policy lynch became inevitable.' Huh? You thought TF was town. Why would you ever vote a townie? And your vote took it to L-2, I'd hardly call L-3 inevitable but L-2 is getting there.<br>\n<br>\nThis sums up why I think your part in the PL wagon was scummy.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: yeah I'm curious about anyone's reasoning for strongly TRing LUV at this point.</div></blockquote>\nYou asked why this makes HS look town<br>\n<br>\nFor one its completely understandable to mix up a few things. namely that an alternative policy lynch somehow cancels out the first<br>\nThis sort of illogical thinking is towny bc theres no scum motivation<br>\nUNLESS you made the case that HS was sort of losing footing and needed to explain himself offhand and made a mistake in doing so, but i dont see that happening and i dont think you see it either<br>\nSo putting that aside, what does scum HS gain from proposing a different policy lynch?  And something like making a mistake in assuming a policy lynch is inevitable or not, thats not scummy thats just a mistake. Theres no attempt at subterfuge, manipulation, coasting, etc. theres just doing what he thinks is correct and making some errors<br>\n<br>\nplus his claim post was super town :P", "time": "Thu Nov 10, 2016 3:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68980&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "68980"}

Let me lay out what I'm saying:<br>\n<br>\n-According to you, you pushed lynching Creeps as an alternative to lynching TF because you thought a policy lynch was inevitable and Creeps was more likely to be scum.<br>\n-This would be the town motivation for the push - there are numerous plausible scum motivations. If both sides are equally plausible the push was NAI.<br>\n-Your stated town motivation makes absolutely no sense. Even if a policy lynch was inevitable, it was a policy lynch <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">of TF</div>. Introducing Creeps as an alternative does nothing about the TF policy lynch; it's a completely different discussion. You're not explaining this part. How does saying 'Policy lynch Creeps instead!' convince people not to PL TF?<br>\n-Granted, even if this is explained, there are a number of other issues with the play. Also, the scum case makes way more sense than the town still. Creeps had softclaimed (though you claim to not have noticed and I kind of believe you?), Creeps is nowhere near a reasonable PL in my mind (he's new and bad, but he's not ruining the game. There are 3 scum), and you then voted TF 'once a policy lynch became inevitable.' Huh? You thought TF was town. Why would you ever vote a townie? And your vote took it to L-2, I'd hardly call L-3 inevitable but L-2 is getting there.<br>\n<br>\nThis sums up why I think your part in the PL wagon was scummy.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: yeah I'm curious about anyone's reasoning for strongly TRing LUV at this point.</div></blockquote>\nYou asked why this makes HS look town<br>\n<br>\nFor one its completely understandable to mix up a few things. namely that an alternative policy lynch somehow cancels out the first<br>\nThis sort of illogical thinking is towny bc theres no scum motivation<br>\nUNLESS you made the case that HS was sort of losing footing and needed to explain himself offhand and made a mistake in doing so, but i dont see that happening and i dont think you see it either<br>\nSo putting that aside, what does scum HS gain from proposing a different policy lynch?  And something like making a mistake in assuming a policy lynch is inevitable or not, thats not scummy thats just a mistake. Theres no attempt at subterfuge, manipulation, coasting, etc. theres just doing what he thinks is correct and making some errors<br>\n<br>\nplus his claim post was super town <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"></div></blockquote>\n\nExcept there was motivation there for him to advocate that we should policy lynch Creeps because Creeps had soft claimed earlier. As Toto pointed out, HS looked like he was getting intimidated after the soft claims and since he assumed TF was claiming vigilante, I don't see why he wouldn't naturally try to shift the focus to Creeps since if I recall correctly, there was no little to no hints as to what power role Creeps may or may not have.", "time": "Thu Nov 10, 2016 6:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68980&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "68980"}

Let's accept that not caring about looking town is a towntell. Scum know this and will try to imitate this behavior when possible. As the game goes on, this becomes more difficult as information grows.<br>\n<br>\nNow, Nero has commented on a very small portion of the game timewise and has exclusively focused on 2/13 of the game's players. The question was: is not caring about looking town really such a strong town tell when the sample size is so small?

I assumed you were doing a readthrough and pointing out things that stood out.<br>\n<br>\nYeah, Road's saying you're town with such little information pinged me as Road maybe having prior information. If Road was Green they'd be willing to examine their logic for the read with me; instead, they accused me of misrepping and didn't answer my questions.<br>\n<br>\nHS also called me vs Copper TvT, so the idea that they might just always say arguments are TvT is reasonable. What Copper and I had was an argument. What Road and I had was not - I questioned Road on certain things, and Road acted extremely defensive, answered what they could, avoided what they could not, and then attacked me. Arguments require reasoning aimed at a conclusion, traits that Road's posts lack unless their reasoning is 'heebie jeebys' and their conclusion is 'Mort is Red'. HS, if you're Green please reread the interaction, and if you still think Road is Green please explain.", "time": "Sun Nov 13, 2016 6:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68980&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "68980"}

His opinions logically changed when he found reason to (see post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8479915#p8479915\">159</a>) and in his argument with you and TwoFace, he picked his side and stuck with it.<br>\nHis analysis of scum likely opportunistically jumping on his wagon is very credible, and my read of his argument with you and TF screams TvTT to me.<br>\nPosts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8483828#p8483828\">429</a> and [post]463] just don't come from scum in my eyes, especially the latter which is filled with logically consistent reads that coincide with what he's expressed recently.</div></blockquote>\nThanks for this assessment. I really don't see Red playing the way you are, especially when you've been at L-2 for such a long time. Earlier I said that I don't see Green!HS as likely, I do think that you've done certain things that logically should not come from town.<br>\n<br>\nDrone, your vote of HS is basically because of this. What do you think of the idea that, judging from HS' more recent posts, they are actually VT and were fumbling with theory with all that PR hunting?<br>\n<br>\nPedit: it's not important, but it seems like you're saying you won't be able to catch up and post until Monday.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8506072#p8506072\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8506072#p8506072\" data-post-id=\"8506072\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1122</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8506043#p8506043\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8506043#p8506043\" data-post-id=\"8506043\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1119</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27041\">MortFeld</a> wrote:</cite>@TF - You think no lynch benefits town here?

{"number": 1327, "id": "8513906", "user": "Human Sequencer", "user_id": "28580", "content": "The way TB posts early in the game reads manufactured to me. Dishonest. This is a gut feel, but it's definitely enforcing my reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480385#p8480385\">169</a> echoes what Uzi had already said and gotten away with, without actually adding anything to the table. The scum motivation is that this is an easy way for her to look like she's contributing information and scumhunting without actually doing either of those. She then makes an empty jab at Creeps, which I've already talked about. Creeps' posting was obviously a mess. Poking holes in it is what town had already been doing the entire time, again, TB knows that this won't draw suspicion because it's already been done before. This is an easy way for her to look like she's scumhunting, again, when really she's just poking holes in swiss cheese.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480618#p8480618\">180</a> TB does similar. They reflect upon to town something that is obviously correct and cannot be argued (Mislynches are bad) and mirrors the perspective Naomi took in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478884#p8478884\">134</a>, for which Naomi caught no flak. They then make an empty jab at Mort's preceding post, despite him explaining his reasoning in that very post. Something important here-- one of TB's reasonings for voting Misa is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478028#p8478028\">77</a>, on which she comments. But this post came from eons ago, from before TB was even in the game. They only decided to comment on it when they were asked to explain their vote, which came later. Translation: TB only formulated an opinion on why she votes Misa after she was asked to, and when she does, she mirrors the 'safe' perspective Naomi already mentioned. The scum motivation for voting Misa in the first place was that town viewed the slot as generally scummy, and it was a very safe vote to make, along with Creeps, who was her other target at the time.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480914#p8480914\">207</a> <br>\nNotice that TB townreads the two people whose perspective they pilfered before.<br>\nBeyond that, she mirrors the perspective of TwoFace and Mort before her, wondering about the Drone question. Again, a perspective that has shown to be non-combative in the thread. Then she calls for activity of people who have been inactive. Really safe play, nobody can argue that we want those people to post more.<br>\n<br>\nThey jumped on the Copper wagon without explaining why, only explaining later when they were asked to. As Copper has pointed out, one of the three people who opportunistically jumped on his wagon is very likely scum, and I'm willing to put a lot of faith int hat claim. Mort and TF both read obvtown to me, which leaves TB, whose vote is the least well justified anyway.<br>\n<br>\nAs I explained in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, TB agreed with Copper on the lynchbait discussion, and then later decided to vote Copper for his part in the lynchbait discussion. Furthermore, as Mort has pointed out, their reasoning to vote Copper came about 15 posts after they voted Copper. Translation: TB only had to decide on why they thought Copper was scum after they were asked to.<br>\n<br>\nI only just realized this now, actually.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8503571#p8503571\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8503571#p8503571\" data-post-id=\"8503571\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 982</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28548\">ThinkBig</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8503509#p8503509\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8503509#p8503509\" data-post-id=\"8503509\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 979</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28406\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> wrote:</cite>TB, if that game is becoming increasingly difficult for you by the day, replace out.</div></blockquote>\n\nI think that's only fair for you guys and for town. /replace requested as I really don't know how to play or what to do.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8503571#p8503571\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8503571#p8503571\" data-post-id=\"8503571\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 982</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28548\">ThinkBig</a> wrote:</cite>I think that's only fair for you guys | and for town.</div></blockquote>\nThis could be a scumslip, but I'm not willing to put too much faith into it.<br>\n<br>\nThe final point is that, like I said in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, newbies replace out of scum slots more often because they get overwhelmed and don't know what to do.

The scum motivation is that this is an easy way for her to look like she's contributing information and scumhunting without actually doing either of those. She then makes an empty jab at Creeps, which I've already talked about. Creeps' posting was obviously a mess. Poking holes in it is what town had already been doing the entire time, again, TB knows that this won't draw suspicion because it's already been done before. This is an easy way for her to look like she's scumhunting, again, when really she's just poking holes in swiss cheese.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">TB says the same thing as Uzi in agreement, not realizing he can just say \"I agree with that thing Uzi said.\" Asking why Creeps was afraid of posting is not an empty jab, it is an honest question aimed at understanding why Creeps plays the way he does.</div><br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480618#p8480618\">180</a> TB does similar. They reflect upon to town something that is obviously correct and cannot be argued (Mislynches are bad) and mirrors the perspective Naomi took in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478884#p8478884\">134</a>, for which Naomi caught no flak. They then make an empty jab at Mort's preceding post, despite him explaining his reasoning in that very post. Something important here-- one of TB's reasonings for voting Misa is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478028#p8478028\">77</a>, on which she comments. But this post came from eons ago, from before TB was even in the game. They only decided to comment on it when they were asked to explain their vote, which came later. Translation: TB only formulated an opinion on why she votes Misa after she was asked to, and when she does, she mirrors the 'safe' perspective Naomi already mentioned. The scum motivation for voting Misa in the first place was that town viewed the slot as generally scummy, and it was a very safe vote to make, along with Creeps, who was her other target at the time.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Brand newbie TB believes a misrep of theory might be Red motivated, doesn't understand that neither Green nor Red will tend to misrep theory. Asking why I voted Copper is not an empty jab if TB doesn't think I gave a reason, so he must have not understood that I had given a reason already. When I said I already gave my reasoning, he asked for a reference post, showing he literally didn't understand what I said when I voted Copper. The Reddish parts of the Misa vote are 1. that it's safe and 2. that part of TB's reasoning was something that TB didn't comment on at the time it happened. 1. if TB is incapable of understanding what makes someone Red or Green, as TB professed to, TB cannot do anything but make safe plays by sheeping reasoning. 2. TB wanted their vote to look good so they came up with a reason after the fact. TB's in-game personality is wanting to please.</div><br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8480914#p8480914\">207</a> <br>\nNotice that TB townreads the two people whose perspective they pilfered before.<br>\nBeyond that, she mirrors the perspective of TwoFace and Mort before her, wondering about the Drone question. Again, a perspective that has shown to be non-combative in the thread. Then she calls for activity of people who have been inactive. Really safe play, nobody can argue that we want those people to post more.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Already explained why Green!TB will mirror perspectives and play safe. Not having consistent internal reads is bad play but does TB really read like someone who is blas&#233; toward solving the game? Sounds more like TB feels bad they can't help. The only reason TB's reads list would be Red play is if it indicated that TB was not trying to game solve. Lack of knowledge how =/= lack of trying.</div><br>\n<br>\nThey jumped on the Copper wagon without explaining why, only explaining later when they were asked to. As Copper has pointed out, one of the three people who opportunistically jumped on his wagon is very likely scum, and I'm willing to put a lot of faith int hat claim. Mort and TF both read obvtown to me, which leaves TB, whose vote is the least well justified anyway.<br>\n<br>\nAs I explained in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, TB agreed with Copper on the lynchbait discussion, and then later decided to vote Copper for his part in the lynchbait discussion. Furthermore, as Mort has pointed out, their reasoning to vote Copper came about 15 posts after they voted Copper. Translation: TB only had to decide on why they thought Copper was scum after they were asked to.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Why should Copper's OMGUSing people on his wagon be reason for you to suspect TB? Is this really reasonable POE?<br>\nAnd Green!TB might have jumped on the wagon for the same reason as usual (it's a wagon that exists and other people vote in this game) and when pressed for a reason, gave one that made sense to him when asked, not the one he had when he voted, for the reason that other people give reasons in this game. He's trying to learn how to play.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe final point is that, like I said in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495541#p8495541\">845</a>, newbies replace out of scum slots more often because they get overwhelmed and don't know what to do. What does it look like happened to TB?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">It looks like he got overwhelmed and didn't know what to do, yes. Red players lynch Green players more often than the reverse. Does that mean that any time someone lynches a Green player, they are Red? This is the same form as your logic. There is another plausible explanation for TB replacing out, which is that he has no idea how to play the game and believed his continuing was casting a bad light on his slot, a town slot.</div><br>\n<br>\nThis is my logic laid bare. If you can't agree with me, help me understand why not.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nIf you ignore everything else, two questions: Why should Copper's OMGUSing people on his wagon be reason for you to suspect TB?

I felt like his reaction to creepy being L-2 didn't make sense. If he was genuinely concerned he would have unvoted, not say he is keeping his vote but will unvote at L-1<br>\n2. He attempted to misrep me by saying my posts about him said 2 different things when they clearly didn't. Even when I point them out and show they say the exact same thing, he refuses to admit his mistake. I may be naive but I am of the belief that scum is less likely to admit their mistakes, town should have no problems admitting theirs.<br>\n3. The fact that he jumped on TB after TB voted him and went and lied about his activity. There is no evidence that supports Copper's claim and evidence that proves his claim was not true.<br>\n<br>\nI just don't see a town player doing these things so this is why I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nand since I am doing it, My scum read on HS is kind of harder to explain. What pinged me first was the weird drone comment. Drone hadn't even posted and he was asking drone if he agreed with him or something like that. Later HS claims he saw the mod post that drone had confirmed but somehow missed that he was on V/LA which I think is unlikely especially when HS said he wasn't skimming. Even if he were skimming, I doubt he would miss that but when HS said he wasn't skimming I just don't see how he misses it. The fact that he avoided my question about copper lying about TB and now actually sides with Copper about TB when the facts prove them both wrong, just points to scum to me.<br>\n<br>\nI think Drone is scum only if HS is scum. Outside of that I don't have a read on drone<br>\n<br>\nMisa - is scummy to me for the fake outrage post she made, her replacing out doesn't bode well but I don't have enough to lynch her which is why I am not trying to atm<br>\n<br>\nThose are my reads, like them or not they are what they are. <br>\n<br>\nya'll want to policy lynch me for trying to lynch scum, go right ahead but i haven't done shit wrong except maybe be a little abrasive.

I felt like his reaction to creepy being L-2 didn't make sense. If he was genuinely concerned he would have unvoted, not say he is keeping his vote but will unvote at L-1<br>\n2. He attempted to misrep me by saying my posts about him said 2 different things when they clearly didn't. Even when I point them out and show they say the exact same thing, he refuses to admit his mistake. I may be naive but I am of the belief that scum is less likely to admit their mistakes, town should have no problems admitting theirs.<br>\n3. The fact that he jumped on TB after TB voted him and went and lied about his activity. There is no evidence that supports Copper's claim and evidence that proves his claim was not true.<br>\n<br>\nI just don't see a town player doing these things so this is why I think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nand since I am doing it, My scum read on HS is kind of harder to explain. What pinged me first was the weird drone comment. Drone hadn't even posted and he was asking drone if he agreed with him or something like that. Later HS claims he saw the mod post that drone had confirmed but somehow missed that he was on V/LA which I think is unlikely especially when HS said he wasn't skimming. Even if he were skimming, I doubt he would miss that but when HS said he wasn't skimming I just don't see how he misses it. The fact that he avoided my question about copper lying about TB and now actually sides with Copper about TB when the facts prove them both wrong, just points to scum to me.<br>\n<br>\nI think Drone is scum only if HS is scum.

Look, I see your point and i have been myself a victim of being policy lynch for a very long time.  Any old players in the site would empathize me on this.<br>\n<br>\nPolicy lynch is usually recommend by a lot of town players to remove the players that don't help the game or on the players who they know would troll the game which is why ms.net has WOTC to avoid such players in games. And some wannabe pro-town players play around with policy lynch to get the game move forward from day 1 because everybody hates day 1. Day 1 is bad and they usually go long and they test patience when they go for weeks like this one.", "time": "Wed Nov 16, 2016 5:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68980&start=1525", "forum": "53", "thread": "68980"}

This is hard to read because they are both bad at representing their respective viewpoints. So it's objectively true that Arc misrepped TF jumping on wagons willy nilly, since TF didn't do that.

Could you maybe go into your Toto read a bit?<br>\nAnd if you're gonna steal people's reads, you should probably go further back than 2 posts. Your Mort read is pretty much verbatim from Drone's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8521629#p8521629\">1632</a>.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Chaos looks suss as hell though.

It's pretty much nothing like this one, other than post frequency. You had scumreads, made cases.

Would me putting together a big grandiose case against you make me a town read for you? Especially considering last game, where my first post as scum was a big effort-filled case to lynch Gideon. Looks like you're grasping for straws.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Before I was just getting a wagon going to make an inactive player post more, but now I truly think Chaos is a valid candidate for scum.</div></blockquote>\nWell that's convenient. If you know that I lurk as either alignment, and your vote reasoning was only for pressure, what are you hoping to accomplish? Also, your vote on me \"to make me post more\" was less than an hour after I posted, and not during the day and a half after my V/LA where I didn't post. Weird, like you needed approval in the form of Arc voting me before you felt comfortable doing it yourself.<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace, I know how much you like talking about game-avoiding.

That's just silly. Almost like you're avoiding making scumreads to stay friendly to everyone, hmm.....</div></blockquote>\nThis is either a misunderstanding or a lie. You're trying to portray it as a blatant contradiction, as if I pulled a massive 180 out of nowhere, and I assume it's to get the final few people on my wagon to tip it over into a mislynch. This isn't the case though. Inbetween those posts, my opinion notably changed in thread. I think it's incredibly scummy that you would portray my actions in that way, and I assume it's because scumChaos was sure that nobody would factcheck it either today or later, and that I'd be lynched before I could bring it up.<br>\n<br>\nThe other reason this pinged me was his justification for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8518351#p8518351\">1479</a>. It reads to me like scum that planned that 'reaction test' excuse out in advance not due to how I'd react to 1479, but due to how others did. It gives him some wiggle room to claim reaction test or stick with his perspective. Town doesn't gain any information from that reaction test, what he claims he has is mostly due to the jump I did on his wagon after he heard my response to his 'reaction test'.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hey look, another person throwing shade at Toto without explaining it at all.

I concluded and changed my opinion towards both of them and also noticed that there are others players like Chaos who is only being opportunist in the game, came up with a lynch but only gave leads on Road but reject to explain in his reads on his remaining lynch pools looks like a setup and open options to hop his vote on day 1<br>\n<br>\nHence, I was trying to help HS and TF to see each other in a different perspective as TF was stuck in believing that HS reaction over his soft claim is not legitimate.

Are you basically  saying that the main reason your scum read on HS changed is because you realized she was tunneling you for your predecessor's play and the main reason your scum read on TF changed is when you realized one of the reasons he was pushing HS was for PR fishing? If so, I can understand how your scum reads on both wouldn't be as strong after you realized things but I don't see how they completely went away or how you suddenly seem like you have strong town reads on them. They easily both could have been putting on scum theatre which is a term I'm sure you heard of before. Your only reason for strongly town reading them seems to be that you don't believe they could fake this as scum. Which means your reads are either very weak or fake. <br>\n<br>\nI'm struggling as to whether I believe Omega's cop claim or not. His play sort of matches up with how a town PR should play it. Lay low just enough that you won't get lynched or night killed. Don't like his reaction to Mort doubting the claim though. It was a simple game balance question and he took it as Mort pushing him which makes me think he's faking and is hiding that he's scum. Also his odd vote on rb. <br>\n<br>\nI don't feel Chaos needed to defend himself honestly, he's being SR for very flimsy reasons in my opinion. Look at how much of a show Arc is making to get him lynched. She's insulting him and screaming that she will quit if he flips town.

If TF is as insufferable as you seem to think can you please just ignore him for now</div></blockquote>\n\nMort, I wanted this to work. Read all my posts again. How my emotions flowed throughout the game.  I understand that i can't expect people to see things from my point of view, But for once, put yourself in my shoes and tell me what options i have when i lost hope on this group.<br>\n<br>\nI started off the game thinking that HS is scum and TF is probably scum due to his insensitive options to hop into my wagon. After the endless conversations with both HS and TF, I changed my mind, I empathized with TF to understand his point of view better. I changed my read from possible scum to possible town because I felt that they are genuinely investing in-game unlike other players. I started re-looking other players to see If I can find good leads, I read as much as i could and I only end up finding a lot of newbie players who are appear to be scum only because of their poor play. Chaos is the only player who i found it odd in the rest of players, He is an experienced player, He knows to mafiascum as one of the pro-town players and also awarded as BEST TOWN PERFORMACE. I was taken back by his play in this game, this isn't how a pro-town player play, His lynch pool without leads further even pointed that he is possible scum. I started off cornering him to get responses from him, I gave him every opportunity to defend himself, He came back with reasons that he is not around yet making few posts only indicating that he is quietly lurking the game.  As the wagon is building on him and he knew that he has to do something to take off the wagon on him and he doesn't want to invest time in defending himself, so he came back with a fake claim. A claim he knows that people buy it on day 1 without twisting it back thus can buy him more time in the game without being called out until day 2 or more. He hasn't expected that i come back strongly on him, if he is really the town-cop, he would have defended himself to prove me wrong but he rather choose to avoid me time and again, He not only hasn't responded a single question i have asked but continue not to focus on me, because he knows that he retaliate, he will have to answer to me which is ready to do it because that only will make him look suspicious. <br>\n<br>\nWith a lot of VI's in the game who don't understand the site meta end up twisting the wagon on me, this isn't scum expected but they don't care who we lynch today because the remaining is happily under shadow and not wanted to get in between this argument.  I was dragged to a point that i was tired of arguing and was forced to claim myself as i am being lynched just in a day.  <br>\n<br>\nI never wanted people to lynch Cop0-claim. I was pushing everyone to see how has played the game so far. Its not his claim, its how he claimed and his motive for not being questioned. Everyone doing things as exactly Chaos wanted,  He knows that town wont risk lynching claimed PR on day 1. Chaos was in no danger when he claimed, he only claimed because he doesn't want to answer or defend himself. All I wanted for this group to see his motive. <br>\n<br>\nI went back and forth and i am really tired physically and emotionally. So, No I dont see a point in debating anyfurther when we have players with 4 year old child mentatlity who is gunning me back because i asked them to see things from my logical perspective <br>\n<br>\nI know myself that i did everything i could to save the day and unfortunately i am stuck with kind of people who are acting like dog with bone. they don't want to let go of their perspective at any cost.  The truth will be out now or later. And I will wait and let it happen as i lost my patience at this point.", "time": "Sat Nov 19, 2016 10:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68980&start=2125", "forum": "53", "thread": "68980"}

Inconsistency. Might be explained by Nero's being scum - knows Arc is town, doesn't see a case, wants town cred because Arc may eventually flip. Then he sees a valid case and jumps on. Could also be town. -.5<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2)</div> So at this point TF makes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8515473#p8515473\">1379</a>. Nero responds with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8515750#p8515750\">1382</a>. Essentially:<br>\nTF - you are not catching up.<br>\nNero - I am active.<br>\n<br>\nLet's ignore for a second that this is moving the goalposts, and pretend that Nero said \"I have caught up and I've shown it.\" How accurate is this? Has Nero actually caught up? The latest post he explicitly caught up on before his replacement at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8488489#p8488489\">580</a> is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8486621#p8486621\">526</a>. Before that he focuses on stuff around post 100. So there is a 400-post gap, still not sure if he read those. Then for stuff that happens after he replaces in, he is nearly mute! He makes no overt attempt to read or comment on anything between post 580 and post 1382. This is quite odd for a townie, even rb made an attempt to read ISOs and he had more than double the pages to read that Nero had. This is the majority of my case. Not just moving the goalposts and thereby not answering the question, but also the content, which is that Nero was participating and voting yet hadn't made an overt attempt to catch up, or to tell town he didn't intend to catch up. -2<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8515841#p8515841\">1387</a> is a weird question because TF had already made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8514606#p8514606\">1350</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8514078#p8514078\">1332</a> which both show intent to lynch. Why ask TF specifically? -.5<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3)</div> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8516064#p8516064\">1410</a> moving the goalpost again. The issue from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8516037#p8516037\">1408</a> wasn't that Arc was lurky, the issue was that she made a poor excuse for her being lurky. TF might be wrong that this is a scumtell (I think he most definitely is), but saying 'Arc is always lurky' is not interacting with TF's point. Also is making excuses for Arc again. -1<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4)</div> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519712#p8519712\">1586</a> gross. Also has the side effect of excusing a real justification for the vote. The only reason I can see people doing this as town is to make it seem reasonable when they do it as scum. Nero has zero town cred at this point, no scum is going to jump on the Arc wagon merely given Nero's blessing. I have yet to see a successful reaction test of this sort in any of my games or games I've read. -1<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519750#p8519750\">1589</a> justifying Arc townread based on meta. I have no issue with meta reads in general, but meta reads of this sort... if you are going to justify a townread, do so in a way that isn't circular. \"Arc is town because she looks town\" is not logical. But this is a disagreement about playstyle more than anything. +0<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519768#p8519768\">1592</a> reduces my PBPA to 'Arc throwing a hissy fit,' which makes sense in hindsight if you know Arc is town!

The thing I'm hung up on is actually something you brought up - scum can no kill to make us think that the person we jailed is scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe solution Shadow suggested is that if there is no nightkill, we no lynch the following day and jail the same person. If they are town, scum will either nightkill and confirm a townie or continue to no kill. If they are scum, scum will continue to no kill. I am trying to figure out what happens if we have, say, 10 nights of no lynches and no nightkills. I actually believe this is optimal from both sides, given the situation. Another confirmed townie is very bad for scum. If they can, they should do everything in their power to avoid confirming someone.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod, if you can answer this.

Here are my thoughts...<br>\n<br>\nI understand that you are all angry that i made you wait but i didn't want to end the day before i share my point of view. I could have finished this before my vacation but i was caught up with my work and didn't really had a chance.  With that said, Sorry for keeping you all wait but thanks anyway.<br>\n<br>\nWith 8 alive it is 1:7 for scum. So I can pretty much say that it is impossible for scum to win.  However, we should be careful and definitely more cautious with day lynches because I believe that last night strategy of no night kill from scum is probably to frame Nero. <br>\n<br>\nScum realized that if they use their night actions, they will likely get caught so I won't be surprised if they won't make a kill on night 4 as well.  <br>\n<br>\nNo-lynch is something i preferred on Day 3, because I didn't want to mislynch a townie for no reason and we had an odd night cop who could give us information but Chaos result surprised me.  Mort is one last person in the group who may not be get lynched. and it is really making me doubt Chaos again and this time harder than ever.   <br>\n<br>\nSo forget about the No-lynch.  We should lynch Chaos today. And I really need all of you think through this.  There are so many reasons why I think Chaos is scum and done making cases over him again and again and confirming MORT made me think him more scum than town.   <br>\n<br>\nI dont believe that jailing will help us anymore as scum decided to play hide and seek with us. He will not make a kill and he rather want us to lynch to week and then poor and take his chances to survive till lylo.   Giving the number of VI's in this group, i vision a derp hammer and easy scum win if scum manages to survive till lylo. <br>\n<br>\nI know that some of you don't even listen to my opinions. In case if we are not lynching chaos today. I choice is to jail-keep him. Since already scum is fool playing us, this wont make any major difference.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConfirm town list :<br>\n<br>\nArc is confirmed town (Town Jail Keeper)<br>\nRB is confirmed town ( I Jailed him)<br>\nMort is confirmed town (Chaos confirmed him)<br>\n<br>\nNero is probably town (Since Scum knows who we are jail keeping, They wanted us to believe that Nero is scum)<br>\n<br>\nChaos is leaning Scum<br>\n<br>\nNaomi, Shadow &amp; Liz alignments are unknown atm.", "time": "Fri Dec 09, 2016 3:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68980&start=3150", "forum": "53", "thread": "68980"}
