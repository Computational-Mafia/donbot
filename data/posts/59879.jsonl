If you can, you may only discuss at the quicktopic listed to in your PM.  You may have a 'rant buddy' who is outside the game, but I wish to be informed of their identity for replacement purposes.  Don't abuse this.<br>\n5)  I am not responsible for your mistakes.  If you screw up a tag or something, I will not edit it for you.  If you have the ability to edit posts, please do not do so.  I will not edit your posts for you.<br>\n6)  Avatars, titles, signatures, and your location are out-of-game areas.<br>\n7)  Please do not quote out-of-thread communications.

You got frustrated with him for unvoting from a wagon you were supporting, yet boon skies says he prefers the wagon you support but does not actually vote it and you don't peep at all?  You're not wondering why he unvoted and didn't vote the wagon he says he prefers at the moment?<br>\n<br>\nI do not believe you are town spewing anything you have posted thus far.  I do not believe for one second you think the posts made before I replaced in should be so important that they should be termed \"brutal skimming\".  I do not believe for one second that you did not notice that I was making comments while reading along therefore I could not have known that Varsoon already asked the questions I did.  I do not believe for one second you think that my words were more twisty than boon skies (this, incidentally, is where you became obvious scum.)<br>\n<br>\nI do not believe that as pedantic as you are when you see that someone gave a scum read on someone for town reading both the top wagons, \"and scum do that all the time\", you don't inquire.  I do not believe that you don't ask him where he's seen scum do that all the time.  Then when his reasoning for said scum read is proven false and he makes up another reason (that I'm town reading someone he is town reading), you don't find that odd.  For the record, his original reasoning is even more woefully incorrect than I originally pointed out.  I was wondering if anyone, or hey even he, would realize that is was completely false.  In fact, I said I didn't like the largest wagon which was random midget.  I did not town read him; I scum read him.  So, not only was his first impulse wrong.  I did not town read both of the largest wagons, which he was voting me for based on \"scum doing that all the time\", but I, at that point, had similar reads as him.  The new reason for the scum read was calling varsoon town was opportunistic.  This makes no literal sense whatsoever, and someone as pedantic as you would have picked up on that, and commented on it if you were town.  If he's your partner, you would not.  You say my words are more twisty than his, but he's literally voting me for having similar reads as he has.

What you will see from here on out is him quoting sentence by sentence my points against him and going derp derp derp, or using semantic bullshit (which he employs regardless of alignment), and trying to tear me down.

I'm not defensive about it at all.  In fact, if someone else had asked that question I probably wouldn't still be on about it.  But is it or isn't it your habit to NOT read the prior pages upon replace in?  Do you or do you not find them irrelevant to the way you garner reads?  I mean correct me if I'm wrong and I'll go full mea culpa here, but if you don't find previous pages of a game worthy of reading upon replace in then why would you be concerned that I seem to have missed some things in those pages so much that you'd oh so smarmily point out that how can I expect to have an understanding of the game with such brutal skimming?</div></blockquote><br>\nBecause if I choose not to read - I specifically state that I didn't read.<br>\nYou acted like you read yet missed swathes.<br>\nOne of those is inherently less honest as a stance - smarmy or no.<br>\nAnd, yes, you are being defensive about it - you opened with acting like it wwasn't even a thing, now you're attacking me for questioning you about it - that is defense 101.[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nIt's okay when I do it, but not when you do it.  Also, notice the hyperbole.  He says I missed \"swathes\"  There were five pages when I replaced in.  It is impossible for me to miss \"swathes.\"  Also, what I did miss where questions Varsoon posted past the point I had read by.  So, basically I'm getting chided here for not having esp.<br>\n<br>\nSomeone who would chide someone for their behavior should at least be up to snuff with the thread enough that they would recognize I was commenting as I was going along; therefore, I could not have \"missed\" Varsoon's questions because <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I had nnot gotten to them yet</div><br>\n<br>\nBut, something that he keeps sidestepping because it should be part of his logic, is that he does not consider posts made before his replace in as relevant to reads he makes so he just does not read them.  I do not believe for one second that town Thor who has this replace in procedure makes this post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>@Allyra - why are you skimming the game so brutally? Why should we pay attention to your reads if you don't read, and how do you expect to catch scum by doing this?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI repeat again, Thor does not read one post prior to his replace in when he replaces in to games.  I do not believe for one second he A)misses that I was commenting on things while reading along so would not have known that Varsoon asked questions later.  B) would care one tiny bit if I did skim the game.  <br>\n<br>\nI fully admit I might have missed some things.  Thor should not give two shits if I did skim or skip the posts prior to my replace in BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE DOES ON REPLACING IN TO GAMES.  He would not get after me for skimming previous posts, and literally not acknowledging that I interacted with people from the point I replaced in.<br>\n<br>\nTown Thor would not.  Scum Thor needs to construct a narrative and did so.<br>\n<br>\nI do not know who much to emphasize the fact that Thor does not read posts prior to his replace in, so him getting after me for missing something or skimming and applying it to the rest of the game and distrusting any reads I might have AFTER my replace in point is scummy as fuck.  It betrays a level of cognitive dissonance I have no seen in along fucking time.<br>\n<br>\nHe called my response to him defensive.  It wasn't anything of the like.  I could not care less if someone thought I skimmed or missed anything.  I miss shit all the time!  I couldn't really care less about the first few pages of the game and find interaction with people with a gut general read more important, but I was trying to get Thor to lay down his position on that because I do not believe for one second he makes the argument he makes as town.<br>\n<br>\n~~~<br>\n<br>\nI've said this before and I will repeat it again.  I do not think that town thor with as pedantic as he is ignores that boonskies unvoted the wagon he was on, said he preferred randommidget over varsoon and does not vote randommidget, but gets after drake crusader for unvoting a wagon and saying he was going to read.<br>\n<br>\nI do not think for one second that town Thor sees boon skies get his scum read on me wrong (I town read the two largest wagons) and then when it's pointed out to him changes his reasoning for the scum read (I have a town read before page six that's opportunistic somehow) then later (it's the strength of the town read).  No, hell no, this is something Thor would be all over.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, if you will notice Thor literally voted me as I responded that his posts to me did not make sense because he does not read previous posts in a game.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>I actually focused on both your take on the past posts and also your take on current matters - so this is just straight up a strange thing to say. How do you think I avoided your 'current' stuff?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe claims he responded to my current stuff but the only thing he did respond to was me not knowing ahead of time that Varsoon asked questions I asked before I actually read the pages that Varsoon asked them.  I interacted with Varsoon, xia long and Boonskies.  He didn't make a peep about that.  he's lying.  Why would he have a reason to lie as town?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>thor wrote:</cite>I found his reasoning to be fine and thought you were looking more word twisty than him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is in reference to boon skies vote on me.  Now, I'll have to repeat again because he didn't bother to respond before when I spelled it out, but you might remember that boon skies voted me for \"town reading the top two wagons and scum do that all the time\".  I did not town read the top two wagons.  I town read Varsoon, and scum read the actual top wagon.

I agree that the sooner we can get out of RVS, the better it is for town. However, I find that the person who accuses someone first is usually scum.

The problem I'm facing is that of those who were on the wagon (Thor665, BlueBloodedToffee, Zebulin, randomidget, acryon), I don't have a strong town read on any of them. I find random most likely to be the scum of this bunch while acryon to most likely be town.

I fully expect o get lynched here because no one knows me and I know how much you tunnel and harangue about being sheeped.<br>\n<br>\nMy job is not to entertain some silly debate with you, my job is to show everyone why you're scum, which I will do until in dead.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis basically amounts to \"Debating you is pointless, I will try to get you lynched until I die.\" This is TERRIBLE. Why would you do this? Debating gives town info, info gives town viable scumreads, viable scumreads kill scum and make us all happy. I gt it if you don't want to spend your time arguing with Thor (most people don't), but I wouldn't recommend replacing into a game with him in it if you were so dreading that so much.

If Thor is the player described in 1., wouldn't it make sense for him to make some questionable decisions and comments for the sake of pushing a wagon he believes to be holding scum?</div></blockquote><br>\n1. i mean ok but the problem i have is that he isn't exhibiting a \"way of thinking\". he's not trying to figure stuff out. he's used his posts as a pivot to transition into \"scumread orc\" or \"get orc to unvote\" and i just don't see why someone who talks a lot about engagement would do that<br>\n2. not trying to figure stuff out is scum<br>\n3. yeah which is why i said \"added bonus\". it's a weak point<br>\n4. i don't think so because it doesn't fit in with the \"allyra's replacement rang to me as town\" narrative he's tried to tell. so just to be clear the story right now is a) thor unvoted allyra because he thought replacement was townish b) thor (from my POV) questioned me in order to get me to unvote him or create a point by which he could scumread me c) i express my explicit desire to lynch thor in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6417042#p6417042\">300</a> and he scumreads and votes me in the next post, an hour later. so alongside the fact that the aggression began before c) (ergo, thor was doing this BEFORE he developed a \"strong personal belief that i am scum\"), i just don't think this trajectory makes sense.<br>\n<br>\ni mean i conjecture that thor thought he'd get townpoints for the unvote on the very townish meltdown and then set up the pivot as described above to scumread me if i scumread him, which is what ended up happening. but that's just narrative spinning", "time": "Mon Dec 01, 2014 6:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59879&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "59879"}

Your initial response of how terrible his reads list was could easily be taken personally, especially since it wasn't initially accompanied by any questions or real comments.  Even that comment alone wasn't out of line, but I can see how it could be taken worse than it actually is, especially with no indication of your intention.  I think that first thing set it off, because it just seemed like you were insulting him without going anywhere with it.

{"number": 800, "id": "6433957", "user": "Formerfish", "user_id": "21997", "content": "BBT- bad form for voting the largest wagon and then going lva. And then you try to pacify your target by insinuating that he is worried about being voted. You don&#8217;t see any reason why scum would quick vote their buddy for a lynch? Especially when said person, Boon, has made a habit of playing like a complete and utter jackass and would probably get away with it on those merits alone? You think that the idea of you sheeping Thor was a flat out lie? Didn&#8217;t you sheep Thor onto Varsoon and then go lva? Let me look back towards the beginning of this paragraph&#8230; yup. Why are you assuming the Thor wagon was all town? How often do you see no scum on a successful lynch? #539, start believing in the ability of scum to stop situations from getting out of hand quickly. You won&#8217;t have to worry about this slot for lurking anymore, I don&#8217;t think im active anywhere else, and I have plenty of time to devote. Townies most def self vote at certain times. What you need to figure out is if this is one of those times?<br>\n<br>\nGams- post #63 you say you see Thor as town, but really don&#8217;t say why. You explain your Varsoon read though, why only explain one? Why does town want to be out of RVS ASAP? Your read on Boon is bad, and you should feel bad. I literally can&#8217;t even follow the logic you are trying to use here.<br>\n<br>\nAcryon- I like the questions you are asking, shows you seeking to understand motivations and whatnot. I don&#8217;t like your idea that we need to get out of RVS as fast as possible though. Do you not see any point to RVS? #362 you say that we as town shouldn&#8217;t be trying to get others to agree with our town reads. Have you ever played a game where a townbloc formed? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This question comes from something you said, but I want everyone to answer it as well, a few people have mentioned that saying someone is scummy off of one thing is scummy, so what is an acceptable threshold to have suspicions of someone?</div> And how do you not have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">any</div> comments on the Thor/All/Kono shitfest? Re: #369 private topics are a fairly new thing for this site, and a lot of mods still prefer to use qts because there is less that could go wrong with them. I once had to recreate a scum thread in a game I ran because it wouldn&#8217;t let me edit the player list to add on a replacement. What made you so sure Thor v Orc was tvt? You are the second person to lay out the theory that scum was not on the wagon. I don&#8217;t like this. Saying that scum wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get on to vote totally ignores the possibility that scum were among those who voted. #536 struck me as a little off because you are arguing with Varsoon over having a town pile, which seems off given your comment earlier about townhunting (which is a totally legit style), I can&#8217;t put my finger on why it bugs me, but it does. I didn&#8217;t like it when you unvoted Boon before intent was given to see how he would react, and now I am seeing you advocate the same thing with the Konowa wagon. What is the point of driving these guys to l-1 and then back off before a claim? It&#8217;s like deep thrusting without any intention of finishing, what is it going to take to get one of these fuckers into the vinegar strokes?<br>\n<br>\nZeb- How often do you get scum reads off page 1? How often are those reads accurate? And do you give the benefit of the doubt on d1 or scumread people? #335 is a <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> Debating is inherently fine, but when it starts to become an argument over semantics who gives a fucking shit. I think I hate everything you said in that post. Konowa didn&#8217;t sound town at all in his interactions with All, and even just hearing it leaves a dirty feeling on my eyes.<br>\n<br>\nBoonskiies- its post #84 and I see a level headed player with sane play, what have you done with the Boonskiies I know and slightly dislike? In #127 you vote Allyra for town reading Varsoon and Thor, which of those shouldn&#8217;t have been a town read and why didn&#8217;t you have your vote on them at that point. I have a big issue with this statement : &#8220;We're on page 6, so you have no reason you should be so strong on a town read already.&#8221; I have people I can read in one post, your idea that in 6 pages a town read can&#8217;t be attained is asinine. #134 is pretty bad as well, you are finding All scummy for townreading people that you are also townreading. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> In #166 you claim to be a troll, which you normally are, when you are town. I don&#8217;t see you as town here. #229 is an attempt to blatantly discredit Alls read. Reason for Rando vote is #247 was&#8230;? #389, god I wish people knew how much of a shit you were to not put anyone near l-1 without you already on the wagon. You really should be lynched for this alone. And yes I do realize that you hammered on scum, but you failed to give him time to make a claim which if you remember from earlier is pretty fucking important. It could also be seen as trying to end the day early so that your scumbuddy doesn&#8217;t have the opportunity to do/say anything that could hurt the endgame. <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6420922#p6420922\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6420922#p6420922\" data-post-id=\"6420922\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 421</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24184\">Boonskiies</a> wrote:</cite>I troll hammer all the time.

I saw you do this in the game I modded, and you were town, but I would have killed the shit out of you if I had been playing. &#8220;Ever think I might have a fucking role that causes me to auto hammer?&#8221; We are playing a mini normal game. You show me one fucking instance where there is a compulsive hammer role in a normal game and my vote doesn&#8217;t go on you when I am done with my read through. Your #626 is hella funny. &#8220;hey guyz, can some1 unvt pleaz, I don&#8217;t wnt some1 to lolhammer me while I&#8217;m doing my chores. Parents!&#8221; You didn&#8217;t care enough d1 to let Thor participate before his lynch and we could have gotten something good from him. A reads list, a claim, misinformation, fucking anything. &#8220;uhm....scum replacing out? or just doesn't want to deal with defending himself?&#8221; What pressure was he escaping? <br>\n<br>\nAllyra- you replace in on page 4 and can&#8217;t be fucked to read the game before asking questions. Why? I think you and I saw the same thing re: Gams 63. I&#8217;d like you to elaborate on what you saw. What didn&#8217;t you like about Konowas entrance? I like your tet-a-tet with Thorella a lot, like a lot a lot. I don&#8217;t see this as scum theater, you brought up too many good points that really hit Thor in the magical hammer. (Are you an alt?) Fuck, just hit #238&#8230;<br>\nOrcinus-  you pick up right where All left off, it&#8217;s not often that I get to see Thor on the backpedal.  Why did you vote Varsoon start of d2? &#8220;do you think survivalism is a scum marker?&#8221; I kinda do.<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon- Thor was scummy as shit with everything he did, what did you need to step back to see? Do you still have a Gams town read, if so why? You think that All/Orc v Thor was all scum theater? Ok, next post whew, I was going to have to roll with a vote on you at some point for that bussing comment, jesus that would have made no sense.<br>\n<br>\nKonowa- I don&#8217;t think we have the same definition of circular logic. Scum does x, Y did x, therefore y could be scum is not circular logic, that is linear logic. #198 is bad, this game is built upon people interpreting peoples words to find scum. We use our past experiences to figure that out the best we can and put pressure where we see things out of place. You are scum reading All for saying that something you did was scummy, and then vote based off that weak reasoning. In #226 you accuse Allyra of making shitty statements without backing them up, which were? Only reason I ask is because last I saw you said you were happy without reading what happened previously because you were happy with your vote. So did you read and come to that conclusion on All, or just speaking out of your ass? I really don&#8217;t like the way you were teaming up with Thor on All. It&#8217;s the kind of self-righteous bullshit that infuriates me in games too. The idea that your reads are infallible, but everyone else&#8217;s that you don&#8217;t agree with are easily seen to be false. And then you wonder why people lose their shit when trying to deal with you.<br>\n<br>\nXiao- nothing from you has stood out one way or the other, until this <br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6420624#p6420624\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6420624#p6420624\" data-post-id=\"6420624\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 396</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21051\">Xiao Long</a> wrote:</cite>It might depending on how fast mod locks this thread, after that it's pointless.<br>\nMy biggest thing on Konowa is how he came into the game saying he would tell us who scum was, but then did zero scum hunting whatsoever.

IMO, if scum were not on the wagon they would most definitely be pushing to say that scum were on the wagon. The lynch pool for scum becomes worryingly small if we assume Thor was an all-town wagon.</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, I even said that someone was the second to make mention of it. And you could make the same argument for scum on the wagon, it would behoove them to make a case for scum being off it. This point is actually pretty weak of you to make because it assumes evidence that we don&#8217;t have with conclusions based on that absent evidence.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Fish, do you think both scum(?) bussed?</div></blockquote><br>\nI think the likely hood that there is one scum is fairly high, I would doubt both were though.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Could you sum your read up on Acryon in a sentence or two please.

The questions he was asking seemed pointed and related to finding scum, but then during one of the more information dense times he goes dark, and then stated that he didn&#8217;t have much to say about the Kono/All/Thor fiasco. He then pops back up during your face off with Xiao to play referee. So yeah, null read there.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Same for Boon.</div></blockquote><br>\nIs this why am I scum reading Boon? Cause that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing. I have played with Boon many times and I have modded a game he was in. This isn&#8217;t the same Boon that I know and loath. His game here is more reserved and actually seemed normal until that shit hammer. The hammer is a big part of where my scum read comes from because that seems like an example of where too scummy to be scummy is probably actually scum at work. I have seen scum buddies quick hammer like that before when they think that a situation has the ability to get out of control. I see no town motivation at all within Boons actions because he deprived the town from information that we could have gained from pressing Thor a little.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Your notes on Varsoon are worringly thin given the amount of posts he has.

I feel like reading his posts this game that I see the exact same thing I did that game. If it makes a difference, he was even getting scum reads in that game for his play.

If you actually looked closely you would see that they are separated into categories and listed in order of how they are on the player list. He became a town read because he was the only one to call out Konowa on never following through with his promise of scum hunting in post #396.

At the very least you have to have some people who are more town and some who are less town. If you don't have this then you're not making an impact on the game, which is really really bad for town, great for scum, and makes you a easy lynch because someone will notice (one reason Xiao dropped from town to neutral on general reads). I know my Page 1 scumreads are probably wrong, but it's better than random chance.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's the problem over #335? If you're talking about the semantics issue, Orc calmly explained that to me earlier.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, why am I 2nd to last in your scumread/die in a fire pile, when you have more bad things to say about someone like Varsoon (who was in your town pile)? And could you point out who's scum for you and who's die in a fire for you?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Orc, if you want stupid nwebies IC or SE a newbie game. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">", "time": "Sun Dec 07, 2014 9:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59879&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "59879"}

This decision is based mostly on gut. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">orcinus_theoriginal</div> null - Kinda scum like. Kinda town like. He dances between the stances with his posts and is not afraid to push or turtle up. He is and will most likely be a hard read I will have to come up with a spot for him aswell but, for now he is on the radar.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Varsoon</div>  town - An angry townie actually. He just rages and then goes back to playing with his toys again. A lot of posts with a lot of content. After rereading his stuff I have concluded that he is not the scum I thought he was and instead has been moved to town for now. Posted some helpful advice in between his outbursts.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Xiao Long</div> null to scum -  The self vote on himself is something that I view as a scum tell. Salty as can be and a touch rash. He just appears to have blinders on this game and looks like it will continue throughout. Kinda reminds me of a toned down Varsoon.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Zebulin</div> town - Helpful, appears to be honest and on point.

Townblocs are fine if they are organic.  <br>\nRe: Suspicion.  I think being suspicious of someone over one thing is generally fine, but your level of confidence in the scum-read should be correlated with the level of realistic possibility that action has of being attached to scum (of course in the context of this game).<br>\nRe: RVS.  RVS can, and does provide useful information.  Getting out of it quickly is good though, because there are many many players that are fine just joking around for longer than I like.  That's not my style, so I'd prefer to push us out of it sooner rather than later.  It gives us more real content to go off of D1, where real content is often lacking.<br>\nRe: Orc vs Thor.  Orc seemed extremely town.  I had played with Thor once before and he was scum.  I was the only person that believed it and saw it at the time, but in this game, it didn't feel quite the same.  The reasons many were scum-reading him initially didn't ping me the same way he pinged me that last game with him.<br>\n<br>\n@KillerJester:<br>\nRe: Switch on Boonskies lynch.  Just like in the last game I played with Boonskies, I was back and forth in my mind on lynching him many many times.  Players that seem to be trolling/VI's do that to me, and I'm still working on figuring those types of players out more reliably.  The vote came for two reasons.  1) To provide some pressure for Boon to come back to, so I could hopefully have more to truly work out that read, and 2) The vote came on the scum end of the town-scum Boon pendulum that seemed to exist in my mind.  Because of his style, he's a tough player to read, as he is someone who I think could easily be town or scum in any given game, as his actions don't seem to align to one or the other.<br>\n<br>\nI'll do some more reading when I have a little time tomorrow, and will specifically look a little more at what Konowa and Varsoon have done since I've been gone.

It felt like he was talking out of both sides of his mouth. I felt like his interpretation of the Thor/All debate was off, like he was trying to twist it to fit a different narrative. Voting All for showing frustration when dealing with Thor was uberbad. Same thing with the Kono/All spat. Maybe it was being able to look back at it and take it all in at once, but I saw what All was saying about Konos play before it was even brought up in thread. The fact that she was basically getting attacked by two players and no one gave a shit that her points were being ignored is something I can understand very well. Scum tends to avoid rational discussions and debates because they can get trapped. They prefer to keep people at arms length and argue semantics and minute points in such length that towns eyes glaze over when trying to decipher the walls upon walls of shit posting.

As boon stated he was on both wagons (thor and my own) along with the fact that killing off his partner would buy him town cred for the rest of the game. This would also assist him in the smoothing out of any mistakes he would make during the game itself.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FormerFish</div>  town ( I left out the others in his slot.)

Seems town in nature as well. Don't really see any points to latch on to and dissect.  <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Konowa</div> scum - Very aggressive and appears to be vengeful his posts don't sit well and I could see him easily wanting distance from thor. He is a player who seems to go independently with winning this for mafia. This decision is based mostly on gut. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">orcinus_theoriginal</div> null - Kinda scum like. Kinda town like. He dances between the stances with his posts and is not afraid to push or turtle up. He is and will most likely be a hard read I will have to come up with a spot for him aswell but, for now he is on the radar.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Varsoon</div>  town - An angry townie actually. He just rages and then goes back to playing with his toys again. A lot of posts with a lot of content. After rereading his stuff I have concluded that he is not the scum I thought he was and instead has been moved to town for now. Posted some helpful advice in between his outbursts.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Xiao Long</div> null to scum -  The self vote on himself is something that I view as a scum tell.

On the other hand, if scum-Thor is going to create a pseudo hard-push on someone D1 that in reality has zero chance of going all the way, then it would make sense for it to be on a scum-buddy.  This early distance is very important.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the critical points to look at is the opposing wagon situation. <br>\nInitially, the primary wagon opposite Thor&#8217;s was Allyra&#8217;s.  Boonskies, Thor, and Konowa all resided on this wagon, and all seemed quite confident on it.  When Allyra replaced out, Thor unvoted and switched to randommidget.  A handful of posts later, Boonskies follows suit, and all of a sudden Thor has a new counter-wagon.  <br>\n<br>\nZeb voting Allyra in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6417510#p6417510\">335</a> is weird, but it also doesn&#8217;t seem scummy to me at all.  It doesn&#8217;t make sense from a scum-perspective to vote for someone like Allyra who most people seemed to be town-reading at the time, especially after the rage-quit.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6418730#p6418730\">343</a> has Boonskies trying to call out a scum-slip (this is a theme for him this game).  In post]344[/post], Boonskies says he will be ok lynching Allyra (town), after Randommidget (town), and Orc (town).  Not long before this, Boonskies mentioned in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6416429#p6416429\">254</a> that he would be ok lynching Thor.  In the 344 post, we don&#8217;t see Thor mentioned, but instead he is standing in agreement with him.  <br>\n<br>\nNow that Zeb came in and voted for Allyra, Boonskies decides to switch away from voting with Thor to working on another alternate wagon &#8211; Allyra.  <br>\nXiao in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6420583#p6420583\">387</a> mentions 3 people and comments on their potential alignment.

I don&#8217;t see him voting his one scum-buddy and calling out his other for weirdness here at the same time, so this makes Varsoon look better.   <br>\n<br>\nBoonskies then hammers, presumably for town-cred as he knows that Thor is scum.  There isn&#8217;t a reason to hammer there as town, and as Orc pointed out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6420662#p6420662\">403</a>, Boonskies trajectory on Thor was anything but natural.  <br>\n<br>\nNever mind <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6414850#p6414850\">166</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6420922#p6420922\">421</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6428168#p6428168\">564</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6428185#p6428185\">570</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6435086#p6435086\">881</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6435092#p6435092\">883</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6435159#p6435159\">904</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6448936#p6448936\">1193</a>, in which Boonskies talks about \"I would have/wouldn't have X if I were scum.\"  He says this an absolutely unnatural amount if he's town.<br>\n<br>\n*Sigh*  I hate to say this, but I don't think we can leave Boonskies alive.

Zebulin actually had a bunch of huge advantages over killerjester in the finale; namely, that acryon trusted him over the only other possible lynch that day and the fact that he revealed the information he had as soon as he had it.  I do feel like he got frustrated with being universally scumread for so long, and this is probably why he lost sight of the things that kept him in the game up to that point.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.3in\"></span>Associative reads do not make a good case.  There are very few instances where one can link parts of a scumteam together, and voting together is certainly not among them, especially when two players are voting together on town when no mafiosos are up for lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.3in\"></span>The trust-telling issue was being handled during Day 4.  The listmods were getting involved by the time you guys lynched Boon, which actually made everyone's lives way easier.

How often does that happen though?<br>\n<br>\nIt's not just the person being wagoned who we're looking for reactions from though.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt doesn't happen very often, but I also don't think that means we should just write it off as something we can't get, especially in a mini.  Some may disagree, but I'd rather take 15 pages for a 30% chance of scum than 5 pages for a 10% chance (arbitrary numbers, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> think our lynch even on D1 should have a better chance of hitting scum than lynching at random).", "time": "Thu Jan 15, 2015 7:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59879&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "59879"}

You seem to be of the opinion that some time is \"too short\" to get a claim and some time is \"too long\" my stance is that the time element is a mental lie - the only negatives to short is 'getting everyone involved/commenting' and the only negatives to long is 'diminishing interest/activity'.<br>\n<br>\nSo, basically, what I want is for everyone to come in, RVS, and then in another page or 2 get an aggressive wagon push - this gets everyone commenting, gives you feedback, and avoids grind.<br>\n<br>\nWhat middle ground do you support and on what basis?", "time": "Thu Jan 15, 2015 11:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59879&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "59879"}
