I will not count any attempts to vote that are not in one of those two formats.

Once that event has happened, all votes are locked and twilight ensues.<br>4)  Once you're dead, you're dead.  Please do not post anymore.  If you were replaced out for whatever reason, please do not post in thread.<br>5)  If a majority is not reached at the end of the day, a no-lynch will be achieved.  You have been warned.<br>6)  All night actions will be covered in your role pms.  If you have questions in regards to your role, do not hesitate to ask me in private and I will resolve it ASAP.<br>7)  I will attempt to keep track of the deadline as often as I can.  I will attempt to post the time in every votecount I give you.

If a player accumulates three prods during a day or fails to respond to a prod in 72 hours, I will replace that player.  Lurking is an acceptable tactic; it is up to the town to put a stop to it.  If I get the feeling that you're simply not playing or are prod-dodging to waste a slot, I reserve the right to force-replace you.<br>2)  Prods will only be handed out starting 2 days from day start.  If I feel you haven't responded to prods given earlier in a satisfactory way, I reserve the right to force replace you.<br>3)  If you need to go on V/LA for whatever reason, post in the thread in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold text</span>.  State the length of your V/LA; otherwise, it will be assumed that you will only be gone for 24 hours.  <br>4)  You may not discuss the game outside this thread with other players involved in the game unless your role specifically says so. If you can, you may only discuss at the quicktopic listed to in your PM.  You may have a 'rant buddy' who is outside the game, but I wish to be informed of their identity for replacement purposes.  Don't abuse this.<br>5)  I am not responsible for your mistakes.  If you screw up a tag or something, I will not edit it for you.  If you have the ability to edit posts, please do not do so.  I will not edit your posts for you.<br>6)  Avatars, titles, signatures, and your location are out-of-game areas.<br>7)  Please do not quote out-of-thread communications.  Modkilling is something that I would prefer to avoid.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Do not tempt my wrath.</span><br>8)  Although somewhat divine, I am prone to mistakes.

I will notify the thread if/when I do so.<br>11)  Don't make encrypted posts and don't try to pull the wool over my eyes.

I was suspicious about Varsoon's decision not to place a random vote, but I don't think a scum player would start the game doing something anti-town.

And while I don't agree that putting someone on L-1 at the beginning stages of the game is ideal strategy for town, I find Thor as town as well. <br><br>And yeah, randomidget hasn't done anything to convince me that he's town.

You got frustrated with him for unvoting from a wagon you were supporting, yet boon skies says he prefers the wagon you support but does not actually vote it and you don't peep at all?  You're not wondering why he unvoted and didn't vote the wagon he says he prefers at the moment?<br><br>I do not believe you are town spewing anything you have posted thus far.  I do not believe for one second you think the posts made before I replaced in should be so important that they should be termed \"brutal skimming\".  I do not believe for one second that you did not notice that I was making comments while reading along therefore I could not have known that Varsoon already asked the questions I did.  I do not believe for one second you think that my words were more twisty than boon skies (this, incidentally, is where you became obvious scum.)<br><br>I do not believe that as pedantic as you are when you see that someone gave a scum read on someone for town reading both the top wagons, \"and scum do that all the time\", you don't inquire.  I do not believe that you don't ask him where he's seen scum do that all the time.  Then when his reasoning for said scum read is proven false and he makes up another reason (that I'm town reading someone he is town reading), you don't find that odd.  For the record, his original reasoning is even more woefully incorrect than I originally pointed out.  I was wondering if anyone, or hey even he, would realize that is was completely false.  In fact, I said I didn't like the largest wagon which was random midget.  I did not town read him; I scum read him.  So, not only was his first impulse wrong.  I did not town read both of the largest wagons, which he was voting me for based on \"scum doing that all the time\", but I, at that point, had similar reads as him.  The new reason for the scum read was calling varsoon town was opportunistic.  This makes no literal sense whatsoever, and someone as pedantic as you would have picked up on that, and commented on it if you were town.  If he's your partner, you would not.  You say my words are more twisty than his, but he's literally voting me for having similar reads as he has.  You're protecting your partner, plain and simple."}

What you will see from here on out is him quoting sentence by sentence my points against him and going derp derp derp, or using semantic bullshit (which he employs regardless of alignment), and trying to tear me down.  Quite frankly the best way to lynch Thor scum is to just repeat that he's scum over and over again.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6414358#p6414358\" class=\"postlink\">post 151</a>, Allyra wrote:</cite>1.

I'm not defensive about it at all.  In fact, if someone else had asked that question I probably wouldn't still be on about it.  But is it or isn't it your habit to NOT read the prior pages upon replace in?  Do you or do you not find them irrelevant to the way you garner reads?  I mean correct me if I'm wrong and I'll go full mea culpa here, but if you don't find previous pages of a game worthy of reading upon replace in then why would you be concerned that I seem to have missed some things in those pages so much that you'd oh so smarmily point out that how can I expect to have an understanding of the game with such brutal skimming?</div></blockquote><br>Because if I choose not to read - I specifically state that I didn't read.<br>You acted like you read yet missed swathes.<br>One of those is inherently less honest as a stance - smarmy or no.<br>And, yes, you are being defensive about it - you opened with acting like it wwasn't even a thing, now you're attacking me for questioning you about it - that is defense 101.[/quote]<br><br>It's okay when I do it, but not when you do it.  Also, notice the hyperbole.  He says I missed \"swathes\"  There were five pages when I replaced in.  It is impossible for me to miss \"swathes.\"  Also, what I did miss where questions Varsoon posted past the point I had read by.  So, basically I'm getting chided here for not having esp.<br><br>Someone who would chide someone for their behavior should at least be up to snuff with the thread enough that they would recognize I was commenting as I was going along; therefore, I could not have \"missed\" Varsoon's questions because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I had nnot gotten to them yet</span><br><br>But, something that he keeps sidestepping because it should be part of his logic, is that he does not consider posts made before his replace in as relevant to reads he makes so he just does not read them.  I do not believe for one second that town Thor who has this replace in procedure makes this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>@Allyra - why are you skimming the game so brutally? Why should we pay attention to your reads if you don't read, and how do you expect to catch scum by doing this?</div></blockquote><br><br>I repeat again, Thor does not read one post prior to his replace in when he replaces in to games.  I do not believe for one second he A)misses that I was commenting on things while reading along so would not have known that Varsoon asked questions later.  B) would care one tiny bit if I did skim the game.  <br><br>I fully admit I might have missed some things.  Thor should not give two shits if I did skim or skip the posts prior to my replace in BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE DOES ON REPLACING IN TO GAMES.  He would not get after me for skimming previous posts, and literally not acknowledging that I interacted with people from the point I replaced in.<br><br>Town Thor would not.  Scum Thor needs to construct a narrative and did so.<br><br>I do not know who much to emphasize the fact that Thor does not read posts prior to his replace in, so him getting after me for missing something or skimming and applying it to the rest of the game and distrusting any reads I might have AFTER my replace in point is scummy as fuck.  It betrays a level of cognitive dissonance I have no seen in along fucking time.<br><br>He called my response to him defensive.  It wasn't anything of the like.  I could not care less if someone thought I skimmed or missed anything.  I miss shit all the time!  I couldn't really care less about the first few pages of the game and find interaction with people with a gut general read more important, but I was trying to get Thor to lay down his position on that because I do not believe for one second he makes the argument he makes as town.<br><br>~~~<br><br>I've said this before and I will repeat it again.  I do not think that town thor with as pedantic as he is ignores that boonskies unvoted the wagon he was on, said he preferred randommidget over varsoon and does not vote randommidget, but gets after drake crusader for unvoting a wagon and saying he was going to read.<br><br>I do not think for one second that town Thor sees boon skies get his scum read on me wrong (I town read the two largest wagons) and then when it's pointed out to him changes his reasoning for the scum read (I have a town read before page six that's opportunistic somehow) then later (it's the strength of the town read).  No, hell no, this is something Thor would be all over.<br><br>Also, if you will notice Thor literally voted me as I responded that his posts to me did not make sense because he does not read previous posts in a game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Thor wrote:</cite>I actually focused on both your take on the past posts and also your take on current matters - so this is just straight up a strange thing to say. How do you think I avoided your 'current' stuff?</div></blockquote><br><br>He claims he responded to my current stuff but the only thing he did respond to was me not knowing ahead of time that Varsoon asked questions I asked before I actually read the pages that Varsoon asked them.  I interacted with Varsoon, xia long and Boonskies.  He didn't make a peep about that.  he's lying.  Why would he have a reason to lie as town?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>thor wrote:</cite>I found his reasoning to be fine and thought you were looking more word twisty than him.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is in reference to boon skies vote on me.  Now, I'll have to repeat again because he didn't bother to respond before when I spelled it out, but you might remember that boon skies voted me for \"town reading the top two wagons and scum do that all the time\".  I did not town read the top two wagons.  I town read Varsoon, and scum read the actual top wagon.  After I pointed out that his reason was factually wrong (but left out the random midge thing) he claimed <br><br>____<br><br>My case to this point, I'm not finishing it because fuck you."}

It's never too early to throw something serious around.  The quicker we leave RVS and D1 fluff, the better.  If someone dropping an accusation like that gets us there, then great.  Not only does it get us out of RVS, but it draws reactions that RVS votes probably wouldn't.  <br><br>Your post seems to imply that it is bad for us to leave RVS and that people should only be screwing around and random-voting up until a certain point, which is actually not a town mindset.</div></blockquote><br><br>This got me thinking a little. I agree that the sooner we can get out of RVS, the better it is for town. However, I find that the person who accuses someone first is usually scum. In this case, I would argue that the first person to accuse someone was Thor, when he said his vote on Varsoon was serious which I think he was. I don't think I have as much experience compared to other (maybe just 7 games played) so I have to ask - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Thor, was your vote on Varsoon on the first page serious?</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6408980#p6408980\" class=\"postlink\">post 81</a>, Varsoon wrote:</cite>I'm suspicious of how fast my wagon was to grow and I'd say there was scum there, but I'm super biased about this.<br>Does anyone else think so?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, I find it hard to believe that everyone on that wagon was all town. The problem I'm facing is that of those who were on the wagon (Thor665, BlueBloodedToffee, Zebulin, randomidget, acryon), I don't have a strong town read on any of them. I find random most likely to be the scum of this bunch while acryon to most likely be town. BlueBlood and Zebulin are completely null reads, and I've downgraded Thor as town a bit from what I said above. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6409573#p6409573\" class=\"postlink\">post 84</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>I like the midget vote much better than the Var.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Again, he says that he likes the midget vote better than Var's, yet he still doesn't vote for him.

For instance if I were town and in thor's position i would ask the replacement for stances on certain cases, which to thor's credit he did, but i just think the line of questioning is really really off.<br>-this also ties in with the fact that coincidentally there seems to be some element of OMGUS and i don't think that's an element of thor's townplay<br>2 seems like a strange thing to say but i have an issue with how thor basically ignores my accusations of him. i don't like how he doesn't reply to the bit where i accuse him of misrepresenting his own question <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6416789#p6416789\">288</a> and i don't like the sort of condescending brush-off attitude he's taken the entire game against ppl who are scumreading him. so yeah he'll reply in the interest of upholding a facade of replying to accusations but he'll drop a lot of meaningless buzzwords and spin false narratives and it won't seem like he's actually interested in figuring stuff out, just in accusing his own accusers of being scummy in some way"}

And because this stuff from him seems so different in tone from the rest of his game, I'm inclined to believe it is him being genuinely annoyed by a perceived attack from you and not some weird scum flail.  It doesn't make sense like the other stuff he is done, which seem far more characteristic of someone acting out of emotion that someone acting as scum."}

Your initial response of how terrible his reads list was could easily be taken personally, especially since it wasn't initially accompanied by any questions or real comments.  Even that comment alone wasn't out of line, but I can see how it could be taken worse than it actually is, especially with no indication of your intention.  I think that first thing set it off, because it just seemed like you were insulting him without going anywhere with it.  While I get where he is coming from, it was obviously a misunderstanding of the situation, and I think it was much more him continuing to respond out of emotion rather than melting specifically under questioning."}

After Allyra told me to fuck off and called me a fucking prick I decided to take a step back from the game, which coincidentally coincides with Xiao scumreading me because \"I said I was going to do stuff and never did stuff\".  Since then it's been hard to get back into the flow of the game.  I feel like I'm starting to get more into the swing of things, but am disappointed in people scumreading me for something silly.  I guess I understand the timing of my vote on Allyra combined with Thor's flip might indicate that I am Scum with Thor but that doesn't take into account the dialogue I had with Allyra where it should be clear that I was trying to figure out her alignment and that I would probably ignore Thor altogether if I was Scum with him, wifom but whatever."}

Have you ever played a game where a townbloc formed? <span class=\"noboldsig\">This question comes from something you said, but I want everyone to answer it as well, a few people have mentioned that saying someone is scummy off of one thing is scummy, so what is an acceptable threshold to have suspicions of someone?</span> And how do you not have <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any</span> comments on the Thor/All/Kono shitfest? Re: #369 private topics are a fairly new thing for this site, and a lot of mods still prefer to use qts because there is less that could go wrong with them. I once had to recreate a scum thread in a game I ran because it wouldn\u2019t let me edit the player list to add on a replacement. What made you so sure Thor v Orc was tvt? You are the second person to lay out the theory that scum was not on the wagon. I don\u2019t like this. Saying that scum wouldn\u2019t have been able to get on to vote totally ignores the possibility that scum were among those who voted. #536 struck me as a little off because you are arguing with Varsoon over having a town pile, which seems off given your comment earlier about townhunting (which is a totally legit style), I can\u2019t put my finger on why it bugs me, but it does. I didn\u2019t like it when you unvoted Boon before intent was given to see how he would react, and now I am seeing you advocate the same thing with the Konowa wagon. What is the point of driving these guys to l-1 and then back off before a claim? It\u2019s like deep thrusting without any intention of finishing, what is it going to take to get one of these fuckers into the vinegar strokes?<br><br>Zeb- How often do you get scum reads off page 1? How often are those reads accurate? And do you give the benefit of the doubt on d1 or scumread people? #335 is a <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> Debating is inherently fine, but when it starts to become an argument over semantics who gives a fucking shit. I think I hate everything you said in that post. Konowa didn\u2019t sound town at all in his interactions with All, and even just hearing it leaves a dirty feeling on my eyes.<br><br>Boonskiies- its post #84 and I see a level headed player with sane play, what have you done with the Boonskiies I know and slightly dislike? In #127 you vote Allyra for town reading Varsoon and Thor, which of those shouldn\u2019t have been a town read and why didn\u2019t you have your vote on them at that point. I have a big issue with this statement : \u201cWe're on page 6, so you have no reason you should be so strong on a town read already.\u201d I have people I can read in one post, your idea that in 6 pages a town read can\u2019t be attained is asinine. #134 is pretty bad as well, you are finding All scummy for townreading people that you are also townreading. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> In #166 you claim to be a troll, which you normally are, when you are town. I don\u2019t see you as town here. #229 is an attempt to blatantly discredit Alls read. Reason for Rando vote is #247 was\u2026? #389, god I wish people knew how much of a shit you were to not put anyone near l-1 without you already on the wagon. You really should be lynched for this alone. And yes I do realize that you hammered on scum, but you failed to give him time to make a claim which if you remember from earlier is pretty fucking important. It could also be seen as trying to end the day early so that your scumbuddy doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to do/say anything that could hurt the endgame. <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6420922#p6420922\" class=\"postlink\">post 421</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>I troll hammer all the time.

I saw you do this in the game I modded, and you were town, but I would have killed the shit out of you if I had been playing. \u201cEver think I might have a fucking role that causes me to auto hammer?\u201d We are playing a mini normal game. You show me one fucking instance where there is a compulsive hammer role in a normal game and my vote doesn\u2019t go on you when I am done with my read through. Your #626 is hella funny. \u201chey guyz, can some1 unvt pleaz, I don\u2019t wnt some1 to lolhammer me while I\u2019m doing my chores. Parents!\u201d You didn\u2019t care enough d1 to let Thor participate before his lynch and we could have gotten something good from him. A reads list, a claim, misinformation, fucking anything. \u201cuhm....scum replacing out? or just doesn't want to deal with defending himself?\u201d What pressure was he escaping? <br><br>Allyra- you replace in on page 4 and can\u2019t be fucked to read the game before asking questions. Why? I think you and I saw the same thing re: Gams 63. I\u2019d like you to elaborate on what you saw. What didn\u2019t you like about Konowas entrance? I like your tet-a-tet with Thorella a lot, like a lot a lot. I don\u2019t see this as scum theater, you brought up too many good points that really hit Thor in the magical hammer. (Are you an alt?) Fuck, just hit #238\u2026<br>Orcinus-  you pick up right where All left off, it\u2019s not often that I get to see Thor on the backpedal.  Why did you vote Varsoon start of d2? \u201cdo you think survivalism is a scum marker?\u201d I kinda do.<br><br>Varsoon- Thor was scummy as shit with everything he did, what did you need to step back to see? Do you still have a Gams town read, if so why? You think that All/Orc v Thor was all scum theater? Ok, next post whew, I was going to have to roll with a vote on you at some point for that bussing comment, jesus that would have made no sense.<br><br>Konowa- I don\u2019t think we have the same definition of circular logic. Scum does x, Y did x, therefore y could be scum is not circular logic, that is linear logic. #198 is bad, this game is built upon people interpreting peoples words to find scum. We use our past experiences to figure that out the best we can and put pressure where we see things out of place. You are scum reading All for saying that something you did was scummy, and then vote based off that weak reasoning. In #226 you accuse Allyra of making shitty statements without backing them up, which were? Only reason I ask is because last I saw you said you were happy without reading what happened previously because you were happy with your vote. So did you read and come to that conclusion on All, or just speaking out of your ass? I really don\u2019t like the way you were teaming up with Thor on All. It\u2019s the kind of self-righteous bullshit that infuriates me in games too. The idea that your reads are infallible, but everyone else\u2019s that you don\u2019t agree with are easily seen to be false. And then you wonder why people lose their shit when trying to deal with you.<br><br>Xiao- nothing from you has stood out one way or the other, until this <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6420624#p6420624\" class=\"postlink\">post 396</a>, Xiao Long wrote:</cite>It might depending on how fast mod locks this thread, after that it's pointless.<br>My biggest thing on Konowa is how he came into the game saying he would tell us who scum was, but then did zero scum hunting whatsoever.

When I got home from work I made myself a nice bowl of soup and some buttered bread. I began drinking beer and started the thread. This was about 12:30amish. For the next 6 hours or so I read the thread, made notes and started to form reads as I went. I also watched the last 5 episodes of The Shield as I went. Somewhere around 4-4:30 am I saw that the post count was growing so I made a comment that I was getting drunk and marathoning the thread to get current. I finished reading, and then posted my findings. Looking for something more?"}

You really should be lynched for this alone. And yes I do realize that you hammered on scum, but you failed to give him time to make a claim which if you remember from earlier is pretty fucking important.

It was early game. My reads are weak at that point. I can never read someone for sure by page 6. I don't think it necessarily works like that. I know I can imitate easy town posts as scum, much townier sounding posts than my actual town play. It's not enough time/posts to truly be able to so strongly read someone by page 6 bar a scum slip, and I stand by that point. <br><br>Before Allyra, my main scum read was Rando. You even mentioned post #84 where I said I liked the Rando vote. I just finally decided to actually go ahead and vote.<br><br>I hammered because I began to realize that me town reading Thor was solely based on the fact that I didn't like how Allyra came in all over Thor. I reread the thread, initially lost my reads on both of them, and came to the realization one of them had to be scum, and I couldn't tell which one would be scummier than the other. I hate Day 1's. I chose to end it. I don't regret that decision. I wasn't surprised when he flipped scum either, and now I have a strong town read on Orc.<br><br>My lynch would have given no information at all.

Seems incredibly contrived with no clear intent to scum-hunt.  The follow-up reads-list doesn't necessarily make me feel any better, although I'm not confident that it is coming from scum vs. someone that isn't interested in the game.  <br>-Jester is town.  No fence-sitting.  Original comments.  Specifically <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6437598#p6437598\">988</a> just doesn't seem like it would come from scum at all.  Saying Thor was a scum-read definitely felt like a genuine town-slip, especially given the rest of the content of the post.<br><br>I also went through and looked for questions asked of me so I could at least answer those.<br><br>@Formerfish:<br>Re: Townblocs.  Townblocs are fine if they are organic.  <br>Re: Suspicion.  I think being suspicious of someone over one thing is generally fine, but your level of confidence in the scum-read should be correlated with the level of realistic possibility that action has of being attached to scum (of course in the context of this game).<br>Re: RVS.  RVS can, and does provide useful information.  Getting out of it quickly is good though, because there are many many players that are fine just joking around for longer than I like.  That's not my style, so I'd prefer to push us out of it sooner rather than later.  It gives us more real content to go off of D1, where real content is often lacking.<br>Re: Orc vs Thor.  Orc seemed extremely town.  I had played with Thor once before and he was scum.  I was the only person that believed it and saw it at the time, but in this game, it didn't feel quite the same.  The reasons many were scum-reading him initially didn't ping me the same way he pinged me that last game with him.<br><br>@KillerJester:<br>Re: Switch on Boonskies lynch.  Just like in the last game I played with Boonskies, I was back and forth in my mind on lynching him many many times.  Players that seem to be trolling/VI's do that to me, and I'm still working on figuring those types of players out more reliably.  The vote came for two reasons.  1) To provide some pressure for Boon to come back to, so I could hopefully have more to truly work out that read, and 2) The vote came on the scum end of the town-scum Boon pendulum that seemed to exist in my mind.  Because of his style, he's a tough player to read, as he is someone who I think could easily be town or scum in any given game, as his actions don't seem to align to one or the other.<br><br>I'll do some more reading when I have a little time tomorrow, and will specifically look a little more at what Konowa and Varsoon have done since I've been gone.  I'll also have a vote then."}

Orc is most likely town as well as Fish so in all they are both town reads section. The reason why I put orc down as scum/town is that  Orc keeps flopping back and forth for me by his posts.

It felt like he was talking out of both sides of his mouth. I felt like his interpretation of the Thor/All debate was off, like he was trying to twist it to fit a different narrative. Voting All for showing frustration when dealing with Thor was uberbad. Same thing with the Kono/All spat. Maybe it was being able to look back at it and take it all in at once, but I saw what All was saying about Konos play before it was even brought up in thread. The fact that she was basically getting attacked by two players and no one gave a shit that her points were being ignored is something I can understand very well. Scum tends to avoid rational discussions and debates because they can get trapped. They prefer to keep people at arms length and argue semantics and minute points in such length that towns eyes glaze over when trying to decipher the walls upon walls of shit posting. My read on Zeb comes down to a difference in opinion about how things are taken.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6434558#p6434558\" class=\"postlink\">post 816</a>, Formerfish wrote:</cite>You don\u2019t get to not answer questions either:<br>Why do you assume that the Thor wagon was all town?<br>Do you see many all town lynches?<br>Have you ever seen a townie self vote?</div></blockquote><br>See above.<br>I have seen them, yes.

The only issue I have is the beginning of the game when he focuses Thor with vicious intent. Could be a case where he turned in his scum buddy for ult town cred. That and the feeling that he is holding quite a bit back earns him the null scum on my list.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Boon</span> scum - The hammer! The self vote. The way he tries to appeal to the town to make them feel bad for his mistakes. Good chance for him to flip scum in this game. I know im not the only one seeing this connection. <br>He is now my official top read. I only wanted to play with the Konowa wagon for a little bit. Still feel he is scummy but, Boon has more chance of flipping then Konowa will. <br>These two posts are also reasoning for why im against him.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6435159#p6435159\" class=\"postlink\">post 904</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite>I've never self-voted as scum before.</div></blockquote><br>Using meta as a defense is honestly stupid anymore.

As boon stated he was on both wagons (thor and my own) along with the fact that killing off his partner would buy him town cred for the rest of the game. This would also assist him in the smoothing out of any mistakes he would make during the game itself.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FormerFish</span>  town ( I left out the others in his slot.)  He appears town in nature and wants to go out and scum hunt. Kinda like him and I believe what he says. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">KillerJester</span> null town - Haven't really found a home for him let. I shall later on. Seems town in nature as well. Don't really see any points to latch on to and dissect.  <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Konowa</span> scum - Very aggressive and appears to be vengeful his posts don't sit well and I could see him easily wanting distance from thor. He is a player who seems to go independently with winning this for mafia. This decision is based mostly on gut. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">orcinus_theoriginal</span> null - Kinda scum like. Kinda town like. He dances between the stances with his posts and is not afraid to push or turtle up. He is and will most likely be a hard read I will have to come up with a spot for him aswell but, for now he is on the radar.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Varsoon</span>  town - An angry townie actually. He just rages and then goes back to playing with his toys again. A lot of posts with a lot of content. After rereading his stuff I have concluded that he is not the scum I thought he was and instead has been moved to town for now. Posted some helpful advice in between his outbursts.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Xiao Long</span> null to scum -  The self vote on himself is something that I view as a scum tell. Salty as can be and a touch rash. He just appears to have blinders on this game and looks like it will continue throughout. Kinda reminds me of a toned down Varsoon.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zebulin</span> town - Helpful, appears to be honest and on point. Feel very good he will flip town at endgame.</div></blockquote><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 300%; line-height: 116%;\">I near enough disagree with every single read here.

Konowa shows up with his crusade post.<br>p7 allyra and thor talk a little about how thor is acting scummy. She ends up painting thor with scum stick an boon as partner. <br>in post 154 it is interesting to note that up to that point they haven't talk to each other yet. Other than one post.. they communicate with likes of a partnership. <br>boon makes comment on midget wagon then thor votes midget. thor attracts more attention of himself. the Killer for me is the hammer on his partner they seem to hunt together and then to save himself the reaction when <br>thor flips scum he votes off his partner. You know what is funny tho. The person they both wanted gone in several posts dies that night thor and boon both go back on random before the day ends and such he is dead d2. <br>Back to the page by page. <br>p8 allyra and konowa cluster**** starts here. They come off as just general fighting. Thor makes comment for konowa to join up on the allyra wagon.<br>p9 konowa defends the idea that thor is not scum and also continues to bicker with allyra. I find that this situation doesn't really provide anything useful. the only stand point is when boon comes out with post 224 <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> \"All, what would you do if I became somehow confirmed town? What would your reads look like? \" </div></blockquote> this makes me feel like he is scum and is seeing how his claim now would fix his position. <br>p10 3 people voting on allyra 1 confirmed scum and the others one I have as a scum read and one I am feeling to flip scum. allyra leaves in a explosion and konowa is smugly savoring his victory. <br>p11 <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> \"Also, I don't like joining new wagons so early in the game. If the lynch goes through, we don't get much information for the next day, and if I wait a little longer before cementing my read </div></blockquote> <br>BBT seems to use knowledge of a previous game to poke thor with scum stick.

I think most people agreed Thor was scum, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were more than one scum on that wagon. And Drake is a pretty popular candidate for D2. However, D2 it seems like all of us are being pussies when it comes to actually lynching someone. Drake, Konowa and you have all had big wagons on you and no one's been lynched. I guess Drake has come the closest since Zeb declared intent? Scum could easily have been on any of those wagons.

Leaving and then coming back to 2 dead PRs and a dead VT that was one of the town's primary suspects is certainly pretty game-changing.

The game changed completely, and so should the way the town approaches it.  What comes out today is going to be pretty important, and I think this discussion over you and Zeb is certainly a good start."}

If you don't explain your cases, you are scum and won't be listened to by anyone except Boonskiies, who seems to be mindlessly sheeping you. ScumFish, keep doing what you're doing. It's not helping town at all, so you're doing great! YOu know, I'm not even going to edit this post so you can get the full emotion of frustration with you two that is going through me right now, and I want you to feel sad that you're making a stranger on the Internet bash his head against the wall.

Now it could have gone a different way, the push could be for me to be scum just as easy. Scum would have seen an opportunity to cast suspicions on two people and not really care which way it went. And I do believe that scum would sit back and let the situation unfold organically. Coming out of the gate pointing a finger at the most obvious suspect is not exactly subtle. I mean let's think this through for a second. Scum comes out and says it must have been Xiao, it makes perfect sense. We lynch Xiao and he flips town.

The Varsoon/Thor interaction didn\u2019t really read MvM.  On the other hand, if scum-Thor is going to create a pseudo hard-push on someone D1 that in reality has zero chance of going all the way, then it would make sense for it to be on a scum-buddy.  This early distance is very important.<br><br>One of the critical points to look at is the opposing wagon situation. <br>Initially, the primary wagon opposite Thor\u2019s was Allyra\u2019s.  Boonskies, Thor, and Konowa all resided on this wagon, and all seemed quite confident on it.  When Allyra replaced out, Thor unvoted and switched to randommidget.  A handful of posts later, Boonskies follows suit, and all of a sudden Thor has a new counter-wagon.  <br><br>Zeb voting Allyra in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6417510#p6417510\">335</a> is weird, but it also doesn\u2019t seem scummy to me at all.  It doesn\u2019t make sense from a scum-perspective to vote for someone like Allyra who most people seemed to be town-reading at the time, especially after the rage-quit.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6418730#p6418730\">343</a> has Boonskies trying to call out a scum-slip (this is a theme for him this game).  In post]344[/post], Boonskies says he will be ok lynching Allyra (town), after Randommidget (town), and Orc (town).  Not long before this, Boonskies mentioned in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6416429#p6416429\">254</a> that he would be ok lynching Thor.  In the 344 post, we don\u2019t see Thor mentioned, but instead he is standing in agreement with him.  <br><br>Now that Zeb came in and voted for Allyra, Boonskies decides to switch away from voting with Thor to working on another alternate wagon \u2013 Allyra.  <br>Xiao in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6420583#p6420583\">387</a> mentions 3 people and comments on their potential alignment. Zebulin \u2013 Town.  Me \u2013 Town.  Varsoon \u2013 Unsure, but not playing typically.   I don\u2019t see him voting his one scum-buddy and calling out his other for weirdness here at the same time, so this makes Varsoon look better.   <br><br>Boonskies then hammers, presumably for town-cred as he knows that Thor is scum.  There isn\u2019t a reason to hammer there as town, and as Orc pointed out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6420662#p6420662\">403</a>, Boonskies trajectory on Thor was anything but natural.  <br><br>Never mind <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6414850#p6414850\">166</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6420922#p6420922\">421</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6428168#p6428168\">564</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6428185#p6428185\">570</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6435086#p6435086\">881</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6435092#p6435092\">883</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6435159#p6435159\">904</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6448936#p6448936\">1193</a>, in which Boonskies talks about \"I would have/wouldn't have X if I were scum.\"  He says this an absolutely unnatural amount if he's town.<br><br>*Sigh*  I hate to say this, but I don't think we can leave Boonskies alive.

I can point at the Varsoon tunneling and putting his vote on Xiao D3 while talking very little about Xiao, with all his posts after voting Xiao having to do with Varsoon, me, or Orc. He was going for early towncred on Xiao if Xiao went down without really wanting Xiao to go down, hence the lack of discussion about Xiao.

A couple of things to note:<br><br><span style=\"padding-left:0.3in\"></span>Just because you think things aren't going your way, doesn't mean that the game is over when thread sentiment is against you.  Zebulin actually had a bunch of huge advantages over killerjester in the finale; namely, that acryon trusted him over the only other possible lynch that day and the fact that he revealed the information he had as soon as he had it.  I do feel like he got frustrated with being universally scumread for so long, and this is probably why he lost sight of the things that kept him in the game up to that point.<br><br><span style=\"padding-left:0.3in\"></span>Associative reads do not make a good case.  There are very few instances where one can link parts of a scumteam together, and voting together is certainly not among them, especially when two players are voting together on town when no mafiosos are up for lynch.<br><br><span style=\"padding-left:0.3in\"></span>The trust-telling issue was being handled during Day 4.  The listmods were getting involved by the time you guys lynched Boon, which actually made everyone's lives way easier.  So there's a silver-lining, because we're not sure what the alternative would have been.  The game being abandoned/cancelled was a real possibility.<br><br>It was a fun game to read through and I'm glad people enjoyed it.  I'm going to start creating another setup, just in case anyone is interested."}

Usually the slow start of Day 1 is predicated on people not manning up and committing to a wagon.<br><br>Honestly, if I could have my way, I'd want to be able to replace into every game I play at the point that an L-1 wagon has formed - because at that point I can start scumhunting.<br>Prior to that, it's waiting for an L-1 wagon to be formed - because until that point you've got very little to go on."}

I imagine the same could happen in regards to really any strategy.<br>Honestly, D1, wouldn't the strongest play be to make a lottery, where a random player is chosen for lynch (after claim)? Hell, I'd go so far as to say that in closed setups to just do an absolutely random D1 lynch. The info from the flip and the NK seem more valuable than the content posted, most the time.<br>But, eh, I like the game of rhetoric. It's why I play forum mafia."}

What I want is a lynch (And, I'll actually agree that I think the accuracy of a Day 1 lynch *is* lottery like) but that said, I want to see people either support or oppose the wagon, and hear thoughts as to why prior to seeing the flip. Reactions to a wagon are as (and, in my opinion, more) useful than the flip info itself.<br><br>@Orc - d'awwww, I lurvs you too."}
