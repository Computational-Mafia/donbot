They make their way to it with haste. <br><br>As they burst through the doorway the warmth that hits them is immediately soothing, but at the same time the energy in the room gets immediately tense and cold. The newcomers stare at those already here, and those already here stare back at the newcomers, their stinging cold glares like that of the stinging cold rain the comers-in just left, and those who just came in can't tell if everyone is just startled, or if they interrupted something nefarious. <br><br>Suddenly, there is a simultaneous flash of lightning and crash of thunder, and a veil of darkness is upon them all as the shoddy electrics cut out. Everyone is silent. After what seems like an hour but could only be a few seconds, someone in the darkness lights a match. It is a male figure and he walks slowly to a table and lights a lantern. He puts out the first match and lights another and moves around the room and lights a few other lanterns and candles that are placed on tables across the room and before long the room is re-illuminated and people begin to murmur among themselves and then...<br><br>There is a loud scream. Everyone looks at the person screaming, and follow their eyes...to see...a woman dressed in silky slinky clothes on the floor near the eastern wall, a bullet has gone through her chest and killed her instantly.  A hole clear through and blood so red in this light it looks more like oil than blood.  <br><br>There is a gasp and groan from a man in the group.  \"Justina?!!!\"  A man's voice startles you all.  He gasps again.  \"No!\"  He begins to weep but then holds it back as he makes his way to her.  Shock and anger permeate from every pore on his face.  He kneels to examine her and then turns his head and back and yells at everyone staring on at him and the dead woman. <br><br>\"Which of you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> this?!  You will pay with your lives!  She was a top trick!  A great earner!\"  He glares around the room.  \"<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">No </span></span>one is leaving here until you all figure out who did this!  You have one hour!\"  He goes to the door and locks it then makes his way, glaring at everyone as he does so, to the stairs.  He stomps up the stairs and enters a room at the top and shuts the door.  <br><br>You all hear it lock."}

It doesn't seem to be passing nearly as quickly as it came.  The group stands around in uncomfortable relative silence, for what silence there can be in such a storm; on the whole, uncertain how to proceed.<br><br>One of the waitstaff goes behind the bar and grabs a bottle of whiskey from the top shelf.  The reality of the situation has begun to sink in and everything, even the grabbing of a bottle of booze, seems to mean all that much more to each of you now.  That movement, while familiar to you all to varying degrees, is eerily surreal in the aftermath of the shooting and in the midst of the loud storm.  All of the sounds blend into the sounds of storm, all becoming one, and the mix puts you all on edge as to what your ears might be hearing, each sound causing a turn of the head to make sure someone isn't drawing a gun.<br><br>\"Free shots for now.\"  The waitperson breaks the uncomfortable silence with a startling phrase.  \"Come get one, or two, or a few,\" their voice also becoming one with all the other sounds and everyone is hesitant to make a move.  \"I know I'm having at least two on the house - right now.\"  With that they pull out a bunch of shot glasses and uncaringly plop them on the bar, the all familiar sound of the glass on wood is comforting, somewhat.  They fill one shakily and take the shot just as shakily.  Then they fill it again and take another shot.  Then they proceed to fill the rest of the shot glasses at indiscriminate depths for the rest of you.<br><br>As they do this those who want a shot make your way to that area of the bar and take one, and those that want a refill quietly ask for one, or two, and all of you mull around dodging each other for several minutes while you focus on your drinks and let reality sink in a bit more while you simultaneously down the alcohol that helps numb your mind to that same reality.<br><br>A few more minutes pass and a good portion of the group has loosened from their shots and you all relax, at least slightly, and with that the overall tension in the room relaxes, at least slightly.  No matter how inebriated any of you were before, you're all still a good deal more sober than you were a half-hour ago.<br><br>A deep voice speaks \"I hate to inform you all of this, but, we have less than a half hour until he comes back out here wanting to know what we've decided.\"<br><br>\"He doesn't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> expect us all to figure out which of you did this, does he?\"  The desperation in the voice is clear.<br><br>\"I think he does.\"  Responds another of you.<br><br>\"Oh, gods!  What are we going to do?!\"  One of you exclaims.<br><br>\"Well, I guess we do what he said and try and figure out who killed...what was her name?\"  Another of you asks.<br><br>\"Justina!  My GOODNESS, pay attention!  Get your wits about you!  We're all going to need to do just that if we want to figure this out!\"  chimes in another.<br><br>\"Figure <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what </span>out?  Just find out whoever here has a gun!\"  Suggests one of you.<br><br>\"Wait, just having a gun doesn't mean you shot her!\"<br><br>\"I agree\" -  another of you in the crowd lets your voices be heard -  \"with both of you, really - but no one can force any of us to do anything and I'd think trying to force a killer to reveal their gun is rather foolish, so, let's make sure we all remain calm while we go about this, whatever we do, shall we?  That is going to be crucial.\"<br><br>\"Yes, agreed!\"  says another of you.  \"Now, who did this?!\"   Whether the person speaking now is one of the several who has spoken yet or not at this point none of you can tell, and soon another voice,<br><br>\"Yes, who?  Tell us!  Geez, I'm sure asking just like that is going to get us an answer!\"   Someone says sarcastically.<br><br>\"Come on!  It could have been any of us, quit acting like it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">couldn't</span> have been you.\"<br><br>\"Oh sure!!!  Like that's even what I was doing!  Of course that's what <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you'd</span> say!\"<br><br>\"Oh sure!  And YOU kno---\"<br><br>\"Hey hey hey!!!  Calm down!  We're going to get no where fast being like that, and then who knows what the guy upstairs is going to do to us if we don't decide!  He could just kill us all!  So let's try and stay reasonable, shall we?\"<br><br>You all stare blankly at the person who said that for a moment and then look around at each other.  Almost in unison you all step towards the bar to refill for another shot.<br><br>A minute or two passes and then one of you speaks, again.<br><br>\"Okay, which of us knew her?  On any level, personal or professional?  Let's start there, shall we?\"<br><br>\"Wait, what is that going to tell us?\"<br><br>\"We don't know unless we ask, do we?  Why?  Did you know her?\"  The starter of this portion of the conversation responds.<br><br>\"Ummm...\"<br><br>\"I'll take that as a yes!  I bet you did it!  Look at the guilt on your face!  Quick!  Grab them and check for a gun!\"  Says someone else.<br><br>\"Hey!  Let's at least agree on it as a majority, shall we?\"  Objects one of you.<br><br>\"Let's just tell him we refuse to this and see what happens, he's not going to kill us for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span>!  Then maybe we can get out of here if we just wait it out?\"  The voice is desperately hopeful."}

I am surprised that people are not seeing this honestly.<br><br>So I will conclude that either Hans is Town or Hans is only Scum if Fart is. <br><br>My reason for this read is as follows (cracks knuckles):<br><br>Hans was the first person to ask about how day chat can effect a read on a Scum player. I initially thought he was BSing, but then another person who seems to be an alt who knows enough about Mafia to have an opinion on the way the OP and subsequent opening posts are \"bad.\" The fact that this second person whom I presume has much more experience than Hans, asks is evidence that either A) Hans didn't understand what I was saying, and if so he would not be coerced by his partner to change the way he was coming across which would make him Town because then there would be reasonable doubt that Hans is Lying and does actually know how Day chat effects reads OR B) Hans is Teamed with Fart and they both asked the same question as a front to provide evidence of point A. This read hinges on my comment when I said Hans was acting Townie. Keep in mind this has nothing to do with my read on Fart because Fart can say this as either alignment."}

I initially thought he was BSing, but then another person who seems to be an alt who knows enough about Mafia to have an opinion on the way the OP and subsequent opening posts are \"bad.\" The fact that this second person whom I presume has much more experience than Hans, asks is evidence that either A) Hans didn't understand what I was saying, and if so he would not be coerced by his partner to change the way he was coming across which would make him Town because then there would be reasonable doubt that Hans is Lying and does actually know how Day chat effects reads OR B) Hans is Teamed with Fart and they both asked the same question as a front to provide evidence of point A. This read hinges on my comment when I said Hans was acting Townie.

I initially thought he was BSing, but then another person who seems to be an alt who knows enough about Mafia to have an opinion on the way the OP and subsequent opening posts are \"bad.\" The fact that this second person whom I presume has much more experience than Hans, asks is evidence that either A) Hans didn't understand what I was saying, and if so he would not be coerced by his partner to change the way he was coming across which would make him Town because then there would be reasonable doubt that Hans is Lying and does actually know how Day chat effects reads OR B) Hans is Teamed with Fart and they both asked the same question as a front to provide evidence of point A. This read hinges on my comment when I said Hans was acting Townie. Keep in mind this has nothing to do with my read on Fart because Fart can say this as either alignment.</div></blockquote><br>Really feeling LQ is paranoid towny."}

Saying Town would do it 1000 times before Scum doesn't really explain much, but its a lot better than saying I am Town because of effort. As we've seen in this game, its been argued that my effort is AI as both Scum and Town, neither of which is correct."}

RVS is like a natural growth stage for the game, it's where people first start getting a feel for the playerlist and lets the game get into a flow based on that. Interactions are stunted without it. RVS is one of my favorite phases of the game, people are most at ease in RVS, something you can't replicate except in twilight situations, and it's extremely useful for getting early reads. You pulling the game out of this is just selfish and the fact that your case on hans didn't even lead anywhere doesn't do it any favors.</div></blockquote><br><br>That has not been my experience.

The vets are vying for Town leader status and newish people are trying to get their thoughts out there. I feel like the vets are just kinda pushing stuff without explaining much, which if they are Town and wrong is going to hurt Town quite a bit. The newer people like frank, are getting attacked for (possibly) not getting their thoughts out in the right light. I'm in the same category as Frank here, but there is also bj in this group as well as Uzi. The vets I am talking about are yourself, Nero and Horror to some degree. Ms Colombo seems to be somewhere in between. I prolly missed a few people, but that's prolly OK since I am just trying to give you an image of where I am at."}

His playstyle was similar at a shallow level, such as lengthy and analytical posts etc. If you went a lil deeper, they seem different. In that game he was much more patronising (than here), more interested in putting forth his opinions than knowing others opinions, and equally aggressive but with less of a reason and more as a strategy. He is also coming across as leading the pack this game as compared to then when he was behaving like a lone wolf. All these are qualitative impressions, but still distinct from that game, for me to believe that he is less likely to be a scum."}

Some years ago\u2014never mind how long precisely\u2014having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\u2019s hats off\u2014then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs\u2014commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster\u2014tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here? But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand\u2014miles of them\u2014leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues\u2014north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither? Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries\u2014stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever. But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\u2019s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\u2019s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies\u2014what is the one charm wanting?\u2014Water\u2014there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick\u2014grow quarrelsome\u2014don\u2019t sleep of nights\u2014do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;\u2014no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;\u2014though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids. No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one\u2019s sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time. What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain\u2019t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about\u2014however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way\u2014either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other\u2019s shoulder-blades, and be content. Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,\u2014what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition! Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way\u2014he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this: \u201cGrand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. \u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. \u201cBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\u201d Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces\u2014though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, Requesting a prod on conmanmick I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment. Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it\u2014would they let me\u2014since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in. By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air."}

He questions Nero on his reaction to the mod explaining the preferred way to vote. I found his question a classic example of posturing. It seemed like he was trying to purposefully be cute in a sort of macho like way by implying that Nero's reaction was kiddish. This however isn't obvious and I don't see a reason to not be straightforward here instead of hiding behind the tone and wording of the question. When asked about it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970653#p8970653\">12</a>, he follows it up with the same tone but here, it is more apparent that he is trying to hide behind this tone in order to prevent others from realizing his responses are very unlikely to come from town. Why would LQ respond by asking if Nero wants his vote instead of clarifying what he meant? <br><br>I became more confident in my read after seeing his response to Han's entrance. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970685#p8970685\">23</a>, he tries to distort it by claiming that Hans is trying to take it easy and is afraid of being scum read based on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970675#p8970675\">19</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970676#p8970676\">20</a>. He also finds it likely that Hans read all of the posts in the thread and voted for Mo in order to deflect attention away from yourself. I find this leap very illogically due to Hans content at the time not being significant enough to make such conclusions and due to what it implies. It implies that Hans was receiving a significant amount of pressure and was self conscious. It also implies that Hans had a reason to be concerned with LQ's voting for him when there wasn't a clear and logically reason to be. LQ didn't appear to be widely town read and I'm pretty sure the experience between these two doesn't go far back. The last part of this post is also very odd. He is suspicious of Hans for not following the tone he set. Since when does town look to set tones in RVS if they don't want to lead? Why isn't following this tone alignment indicative? Why isn't LQ more suspicious of people following this tone? What even is this tone? <br><br>The sense of entitlement continues in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971232#p8971232\">41</a> when he decides to justify himself. He sort of mocks BJ by stating how he got us out of RVS and that he shouldn't be voted for his actions during that stage. I find this response indicative of scum because he is essentially revealing that he didn't pressure Hans because he thought town should know he thinks he's scum but to just get town read.<br><br>I made a note of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971545#p8971545\">69</a> because it's just strange. The use of the word acting. If someone is acting, as in, trying to  behave in a way townie would, how can they be town? I find his questioning of it posturing and a subtle way to plant paranoia. Only scum have motivation to be actors, not town. <br><br>The last thing that sealed it for me was his labeling of my vote for him. Most players usually place an RVS vote in there first or second post of the game. I did neither. I'm sure he knows why I didn't due to two ongoing games. I simply don't RVS vote. I found his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8975980#p8975980\">317</a> for thinking so weak because of my experience with him. I also found his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8985657#p8985657\">475</a> a way to discredit me by essentially calling the basis of my scum read trivial. The blatant misrepresentation as well disgusts me since I hadn't given reasons up until this point on why I'm scum reading him.<br><br>In short, I think LQ is scum based on my experiences with him, his constant posturing, the subtle planting of paranoia, and his odd early fascination with jumping to conclusions that are either very unlikely or just don't make sense."}

I was going to post my Sus of that person and you just happen to post yours before I showed mine. I can't prove it, but that is why I showed that i was surprised, because that has never happened to me before. I am not stupid enough to just blindly agree with that post if I am Scum, I had my own reasons which I touched on.

Yes, I am Town reading the clow, but its because they have been making solid post after solid post. The timing of his posts are also AI as Town I think. But Fart doesn't explain any of this and just says \"the clown is Town\" which seems like white knitting to me all the while not giving me a Town read and lets face it, I've been the most pro-active, pro-town player in the whole game.

He questions Nero on his reaction to the mod explaining the preferred way to vote. I found his question a classic example of posturing. It seemed like he was trying to purposefully be cute in a sort of macho like way by implying that Nero's reaction was kiddish. This however isn't obvious and I don't see a reason to not be straightforward here instead of hiding behind the tone and wording of the question. When asked about it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970653#p8970653\">12</a>, he follows it up with the same tone but here, it is more apparent that he is trying to hide behind this tone in order to prevent others from realizing his responses are very unlikely to come from town. Why would LQ respond by asking if Nero wants his vote instead of clarifying what he meant? <br><br>I became more confident in my read after seeing his response to Han's entrance. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970685#p8970685\">23</a>, he tries to distort it by claiming that Hans is trying to take it easy and is afraid of being scum read based on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970675#p8970675\">19</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970676#p8970676\">20</a>. He also finds it likely that Hans read all of the posts in the thread and voted for Mo in order to deflect attention away from yourself. I find this leap very illogically due to Hans content at the time not being significant enough to make such conclusions and due to what it implies. It implies that Hans was receiving a significant amount of pressure and was self conscious. It also implies that Hans had a reason to be concerned with LQ's voting for him when there wasn't a clear and logically reason to be. LQ didn't appear to be widely town read and I'm pretty sure the experience between these two doesn't go far back. The last part of this post is also very odd. He is suspicious of Hans for not following the tone he set. Since when does town look to set tones in RVS if they don't want to lead? Why isn't following this tone alignment indicative? Why isn't LQ more suspicious of people following this tone? What even is this tone? <br><br>The sense of entitlement continues in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971232#p8971232\">41</a> when he decides to justify himself. He sort of mocks BJ by stating how he got us out of RVS and that he shouldn't be voted for his actions during that stage. I find this response indicative of scum because he is essentially revealing that he didn't pressure Hans because he thought town should know he thinks he's scum but to just get town read.<br><br>I made a note of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971545#p8971545\">69</a> because it's just strange. The use of the word acting. If someone is acting, as in, trying to  behave in a way townie would, how can they be town? I find his questioning of it posturing and a subtle way to plant paranoia. Only scum have motivation to be actors, not town. <br><br>The last thing that sealed it for me was his labeling of my vote for him. Most players usually place an RVS vote in there first or second post of the game. I did neither. I'm sure he knows why I didn't due to two ongoing games. I simply don't RVS vote. I found his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8975980#p8975980\">317</a> for thinking so weak because of my experience with him. I also found his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8985657#p8985657\">475</a> a way to discredit me by essentially calling the basis of my scum read trivial. The blatant misrepresentation as well disgusts me since I hadn't given reasons up until this point on why I'm scum reading him.<br><br>In short, I think LQ is scum based on my experiences with him, his constant posturing, the subtle planting of paranoia, and his odd early fascination with jumping to conclusions that are either very unlikely or just don't make sense.</div></blockquote><br><br>11 is not AI. Reasons for 12 are complete BS. Your reasons for why I am Scum in 23 are actually very similar to the kind of reasoning I gave in 23 so I don't see how it is illogical. You're reasons for thinking I am Scum in 41 are NOT AI. Its not AI to say I got us out of RVS, please what is this shit. For 69, why is acting strange AI? I see you're willing to spin a story of motivation for other things that are NAI, so why not this one as well? I wasn't acting and have no idea where you got this \"postering\" idea you seem to be so fond of so explain where you found that was a Scum tell please. You made a vote without a reason on the second page and I thought it was an RVS vote, so how does that mean I am Scum? 475 was pointing out that the only reason you had given for voting me at that point was \"to pay me back\" for nacy leaving the game. Now you come up with these reasons way later in the game and I am not buying it. And LOL at me planting paranoia when you literally said nothing about me doing that in your case against me."}

Its such a BS claim there is no way its true. He's trying to get me lynched by any means necessary. Body guard is a safe claim, yeah, but that's why its easy to CC as Scum as well. bjc basically sorts itself at this point when mass claim happens and I think its just too convenient that he CC's me here without even considering that I could be telling the truth about my claim. He hasn't considered that I am Town and made a strong push on me after I claimed. Those are the facts. The facts are bjc is an experienced player who knows he can try and get away with a CC like that. I see absolutely no reason to town read him outside his claim.

Next in line would prolly be a tie between sans, Nero and Desully. sans because he really should know my meta better and his arguments for why I am Scum are kinda weak. Nero because he's been really low key through all of this and hasn't really had many reasons why I am Scum and his case why I am Scum is basically that I am playing weird which is NAI for me (I will link games if you want). And Desully because he was trying to get me to self hammer and has been saying \"Sorry, you have to die\" without explaining why that is. When I asked him to come up with reasons why I should self hammer as Town, he completely shut down. I also hated his unvote on me to vote Frank, who I am Town reading. It was a vote that came out of no where and is completely bonkers when looking at the context of what was happening in the thread at the time."}

I think the vote on Frank from Desully is going to be telling in the coming days. I know I hate these arguments usually, but I feel Desully's vote on Frank says one of them is Scum. The vote comes completely out of left field so either Desully caught something Frank did from earlier itt upon catching up, or Desully is Scum and thought the wagon might turn onto Frank in the near future. I say this because Frank wasn't within a mile of the thread at that point in time. So my Town read on Frank isn't really that strong. Its mostly gut, but I feel like Frank is just kinda lynchbait. Why are you Scum reading him?"}

You call what we're doing here 'civil'?\"<br><br>\"It's more civil than us going in to a battle royale!\"  Says another.<br><br>\"HEY!\"  One of you shouts to break-up the pointless bickering.  \"We've got less than 10 minutes until he comes back here wanting an answer, can we focus on the task at hand?\"  He turns to the handful that were most recently bickering, \"Now, are you ready to commit your word to who you think did it?  Will you cast a vote?\"  There is a pause while everyone waits to see who responds and how.<br><br>Reservedly and with his head cast down.  \"Yeah, all right, that guy\" he points to someone in the group \"he probably did do it.  He's been really hyper this whole time and just seems 'off', let's go with him.\"  There's a quick murmur of voices and a few groans among the group.<br><br>\"Oh, c'mon, man!  I can tell that you don't believe that!  You've got to be the real killer going along with this.\"  Says someone, was it the current guy?<br><br>\"No, you can't tell that, and, it's not that I don't believe it, I just don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span>, you know?  You're asking me to help send someone to their likely death, I'm just not fully comfortable.\"<br><br>\"Well <span style=\"font-style: italic\">get </span>comfortable!\"<br><br>\"I don't have to be comfortable with this!  Go away!\"<br><br>The group breaks into a flurry of productive discussions and back-and-forths about this and that, some people cast there votes one way, some another, votes change and people waffle and it happens so fast all in a handful of minutes and then:<br><br>One of you speaks over the rest of you who are in conversation, \"Okay, this is it, everyone!  Last chance and I am going up those steps and knocking on his door and telling him we've decided on this guy.\"  He clasps the shoulder of one of the men standing in the middle of the heat of the conversation who has been arguing for his life, the man who they are seemingly about to decide on as a majority.<br><br>\"Wait!  Shouldn't we just give him the whole 30 minutes?  He's got 5 left!\"  Says one of you, pleading for his exit from this room to not be so swift.<br><br>Calmly another of you says, \"No, unless anyone wants to change their minds, there's no point in making the guy wait, I mean, look at him, he's practically accepted his fate as it is, making him wait would just be torture to his mind, and to ours, it's best to just get it over with.  So...\"  He pauses and looks around at everyone, no one says anything \"off we go.\"  He gestures for the chosen man to head up the stairs and the man resolvedly goes up them.<br><br>Halfway up the stairs the condemned man turns and looks down at you all, then speaks.  \"You're all taking hand in a terrible mistake, and a crime.  I don't know what is about to come of me, but I do not think this man's anger will be satiated by my death, for I am innocent and he will see it in my eyes before I'm gone, I'm sure.  Even if you didn't think I should be the one, the guilt is on you all and may the Lord have Mercy upon your souls.\"  He turns back and continues walking up the steps, the one who sealed his fate close behind him making sure he goes the whole way.  They reach the top and the door is within an arm's reach, and the man knocks.<br><br>\"Sir?  We've decided.\"<br><br>The door quickly swings open, the owner eyes the two of them just as quickly then grabs the obviously chosen man by the arm and yanks him inside and slams the door giving only a grunt.  Immediately, before the escorting man can even turn, the sound of a strike of a fist upon a face is heard.  And again.  And again.<br><br>Finally you all hear the owner yell:  \"Why did you do it?  WHY?\"  And another strike is heard.<br><br>\"I didn't, I swear!\"  The condemned mine cries out.<br><br>\"Lies!  Tell me the TRUTH!\"  The owner must have switched to using an instrument because no more strikes are heard, yet there is an awful and loud scream, and you can all only imagine what is being done to the man.  After a moment the scream ceases and again, \"Tell me!\"<br><br>Obviously panting \"I didn't, I swear, it wasn't me, I swear, I swear.\"  With each word his voice becomes more faint, and then finally, a death scream and gasp.<br><br>You all stare at each other, some of you feel kind of sick.<br><br>The owner bursts out of his room.  He's sweating and disheveled and his left hand holds a knife that is extremely bloody, and his hand is bloody up past his wrist.  He shouts down at all of you.  \"He didn't do it!  I could see it in his eyes, he was innocent!  You all have failed.  But you get to try again.\"  With his clean right hand he pulls out his pocket watch and looks at it.  \"I'm going to give you all a respite.  Get some food from the cellars, have some drinks on the house, take a minute to think about what you've done, and I'll be back out in a little bit, after I've cleaned myself up a bit, to tell you all to get back to it, because none of you are going anywhere until I'm satisfied.  Don't even try to leave, I'll be listening, and that door is solid, the windows are barred, and there is no escape until I say so.\"  He turns to go back into his room..."}

Everyone appears to be frozen in place, nervously looking around at each other, uncertain what to do next, nothing seeming right.<br><br>After some moments one of the waitstaff goes back behind the bar and grabs a bottle from the shelf, the rest of you watching their every move since they're the only one who has moved and everyone is on edge.  They look up at you all looking at them.  \"This one's mine.  Get your own,\" and they step out from behind the bar, walk over to a table, sit down, pop open the bottle, and take a swig, and another.<br><br>A few of you follow suit and grab some bottles for comfort.  Some of you who are a bit more familiar with each other grab each other for comfort.  A couple others of you, workers here, grab a couple of others that you feel comfortable enough to grab for comfort, whether you know them from previous engagements or from getting to know them through the short yet impactful exchanges that have gone on here in the past half-hour.<br><br>One of you asks \"you mind if I put out a few of these candles and lantern over here?  They're...illuminating...\" they trail off as they look onto the now-cold corpse.  Without waiting for consent they quickly go and snuff out the 3 candles and 1 lantern along the wall where Justina's body rests (not in peace.)<br><br>None of you notice, but at the same time another of you puts out a couple more candles, fast, in another part of the room while the light-change in the room is already occurring as to not draw attention to the fact that it just got darker than it should have.<br><br>\"Wow the light really bounced off that wall.  Putting those out made it pretty dark in here.\"  One of you says.<br><br>\"Uhh, yeah, can we get some more lights on the bar and on some of these tables over here?  I don't like it so dark right now.\"<br><br>\"I'm finding it comforting myself.  I'm so exhausted, I feel like I could sleep.\"<br><br>\"SLEEP?!\"<br><br>\"I think she took some laudanum for her comforts, I don't think her wanting to sleep means anything.\"<br><br>\"We're adding more candles and lanterns, it's too dark in here.\"  Someone grabs the lantern and candles that were just snuffed, walks over to a corner table where there is an unlit lantern and grabs it, then they begin to make their way to the bar.  They set it all down and go towards one of the lit candles to use it as an ignition source.<br><br>\"Not so fast.\"  One of you that is near it grabs it and snuffs it.  Suddenly somehow the few remaining candles and single lantern that were lit are out.<br><br>Darkness.<br><br>\"Oh, God!\"<br><br>\"What the? -\"<br><br>and then<br><br>*BANG**BANG**BANG*<br><br>Three shots in the dark, each one lighting up the room in a fast strobe, and then the room is nothing but darkness again.  In a fast moment the man upstairs bursts through his door and yells out as he comes through it, before his brain even assesses the darkness, \"HEY!\"  As he shouts one of you lights a match, and quickly after, a candle.  The man begins to make his way down the stairs.  Another candle is lit, and then a lantern, and another, the room quickly is re-illuminated to a level of visibility.  \"What just happened down here?\"<br><br>Three bodies are laying on the floor, blood spills from each.<br><br>\"Oh, my - \" one of you gasps and faints."}

He questions Nero on his reaction to the mod explaining the preferred way to vote. I found his question a classic example of posturing. It seemed like he was trying to purposefully be cute in a sort of macho like way by implying that Nero's reaction was kiddish. This however isn't obvious and I don't see a reason to not be straightforward here instead of hiding behind the tone and wording of the question. When asked about it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970653#p8970653\">12</a>, he follows it up with the same tone but here, it is more apparent that he is trying to hide behind this tone in order to prevent others from realizing his responses are very unlikely to come from town. Why would LQ respond by asking if Nero wants his vote instead of clarifying what he meant? <br><br>I became more confident in my read after seeing his response to Han's entrance. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970685#p8970685\">23</a>, he tries to distort it by claiming that Hans is trying to take it easy and is afraid of being scum read based on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970675#p8970675\">19</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970676#p8970676\">20</a>. He also finds it likely that Hans read all of the posts in the thread and voted for Mo in order to deflect attention away from yourself. I find this leap very illogically due to Hans content at the time not being significant enough to make such conclusions and due to what it implies. It implies that Hans was receiving a significant amount of pressure and was self conscious. It also implies that Hans had a reason to be concerned with LQ's voting for him when there wasn't a clear and logically reason to be. LQ didn't appear to be widely town read and I'm pretty sure the experience between these two doesn't go far back. The last part of this post is also very odd. He is suspicious of Hans for not following the tone he set. Since when does town look to set tones in RVS if they don't want to lead? Why isn't following this tone alignment indicative? Why isn't LQ more suspicious of people following this tone? What even is this tone? <br><br>The sense of entitlement continues in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971232#p8971232\">41</a> when he decides to justify himself. He sort of mocks BJ by stating how he got us out of RVS and that he shouldn't be voted for his actions during that stage. I find this response indicative of scum because he is essentially revealing that he didn't pressure Hans because he thought town should know he thinks he's scum but to just get town read.<br><br>I made a note of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971545#p8971545\">69</a> because it's just strange. The use of the word acting. If someone is acting, as in, trying to  behave in a way townie would, how can they be town? I find his questioning of it posturing and a subtle way to plant paranoia. Only scum have motivation to be actors, not town. <br><br>The last thing that sealed it for me was his labeling of my vote for him. Most players usually place an RVS vote in there first or second post of the game. I did neither. I'm sure he knows why I didn't due to two ongoing games. I simply don't RVS vote. I found his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8975980#p8975980\">317</a> for thinking so weak because of my experience with him. I also found his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8985657#p8985657\">475</a> a way to discredit me by essentially calling the basis of my scum read trivial. The blatant misrepresentation as well disgusts me since I hadn't given reasons up until this point on why I'm scum reading him.<br><br>In short, I think LQ is scum based on my experiences with him, his constant posturing, the subtle planting of paranoia, and his odd early fascination with jumping to conclusions that are either very unlikely or just don't make sense.</div></blockquote><br><br>I haven't seen him ever make this type of post as town."}

He questions Nero on his reaction to the mod explaining the preferred way to vote. I found his question a classic example of posturing. It seemed like he was trying to purposefully be cute in a sort of macho like way by implying that Nero's reaction was kiddish. This however isn't obvious and I don't see a reason to not be straightforward here instead of hiding behind the tone and wording of the question. When asked about it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970653#p8970653\">12</a>, he follows it up with the same tone but here, it is more apparent that he is trying to hide behind this tone in order to prevent others from realizing his responses are very unlikely to come from town. Why would LQ respond by asking if Nero wants his vote instead of clarifying what he meant? <br><br>I became more confident in my read after seeing his response to Han's entrance. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970685#p8970685\">23</a>, he tries to distort it by claiming that Hans is trying to take it easy and is afraid of being scum read based on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970675#p8970675\">19</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8970676#p8970676\">20</a>. He also finds it likely that Hans read all of the posts in the thread and voted for Mo in order to deflect attention away from yourself. I find this leap very illogically due to Hans content at the time not being significant enough to make such conclusions and due to what it implies. It implies that Hans was receiving a significant amount of pressure and was self conscious. It also implies that Hans had a reason to be concerned with LQ's voting for him when there wasn't a clear and logically reason to be. LQ didn't appear to be widely town read and I'm pretty sure the experience between these two doesn't go far back. The last part of this post is also very odd. He is suspicious of Hans for not following the tone he set. Since when does town look to set tones in RVS if they don't want to lead? Why isn't following this tone alignment indicative? Why isn't LQ more suspicious of people following this tone? What even is this tone? <br><br>The sense of entitlement continues in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971232#p8971232\">41</a> when he decides to justify himself. He sort of mocks BJ by stating how he got us out of RVS and that he shouldn't be voted for his actions during that stage. I find this response indicative of scum because he is essentially revealing that he didn't pressure Hans because he thought town should know he thinks he's scum but to just get town read.<br><br>I made a note of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971545#p8971545\">69</a> because it's just strange. The use of the word acting. If someone is acting, as in, trying to  behave in a way townie would, how can they be town? I find his questioning of it posturing and a subtle way to plant paranoia. Only scum have motivation to be actors, not town. <br><br>The last thing that sealed it for me was his labeling of my vote for him. Most players usually place an RVS vote in there first or second post of the game. I did neither. I'm sure he knows why I didn't due to two ongoing games. I simply don't RVS vote. I found his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8975980#p8975980\">317</a> for thinking so weak because of my experience with him. I also found his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8985657#p8985657\">475</a> a way to discredit me by essentially calling the basis of my scum read trivial. The blatant misrepresentation as well disgusts me since I hadn't given reasons up until this point on why I'm scum reading him.<br><br>In short, I think LQ is scum based on my experiences with him, his constant posturing, the subtle planting of paranoia, and his odd early fascination with jumping to conclusions that are either very unlikely or just don't make sense.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>I haven't seen him ever make this type of post as town.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9023108#p9023108\" class=\"postlink\">post 1168</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite>For some people the tryharding is AI and I think that's the case with LUV cuz I usually see him being kind of coasty without making a case.

LQ didn't appear to be widely town read and I'm pretty sure the experience between these two doesn't go far back. The last part of this post is also very odd. He is suspicious of Hans for not following the tone he set. Since when does town look to set tones in RVS if they don't want to lead? Why isn't following this tone alignment indicative? Why isn't LQ more suspicious of people following this tone? What even is this tone? <br><br>The sense of entitlement continues in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971232#p8971232\">41</a> when he decides to justify himself. He sort of mocks BJ by stating how he got us out of RVS and that he shouldn't be voted for his actions during that stage. I find this response indicative of scum because he is essentially revealing that he didn't pressure Hans because he thought town should know he thinks he's scum but to just get town read.<br><br>I made a note of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8971545#p8971545\">69</a> because it's just strange. The use of the word acting. If someone is acting, as in, trying to  behave in a way townie would, how can they be town? I find his questioning of it posturing and a subtle way to plant paranoia. Only scum have motivation to be actors, not town. <br><br>The last thing that sealed it for me was his labeling of my vote for him. Most players usually place an RVS vote in there first or second post of the game. I did neither. I'm sure he knows why I didn't due to two ongoing games. I simply don't RVS vote. I found his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8975980#p8975980\">317</a> for thinking so weak because of my experience with him. I also found his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8985657#p8985657\">475</a> a way to discredit me by essentially calling the basis of my scum read trivial. The blatant misrepresentation as well disgusts me since I hadn't given reasons up until this point on why I'm scum reading him.<br><br>In short, I think LQ is scum based on my experiences with him, his constant posturing, the subtle planting of paranoia, and his odd early fascination with jumping to conclusions that are either very unlikely or just don't make sense.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>I haven't seen him ever make this type of post as town.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9023108#p9023108\" class=\"postlink\">post 1168</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite>For some people the tryharding is AI and I think that's the case with LUV cuz I usually see him being kind of coasty without making a case.

I just need one to be able to sort it as largely NAI if that's the case, and I really don't want to have to slog through your ISOs in every game to find a town game you've done it when you can probably give one off the top of your head. #lazy<br><br>I'll be honest I don't really care about this game rn because I feel like LQ shouldn't have been lynched, especially after I pointed out that we should give the bg claims time to potentially get themselves killed instead. I rarely forget I managed to replace in to a game and yet I did with this one. If you guys want me to replace out I understand, since you deserve someone better in the slot, but if not I'll try to put more effort in, I'm just not sure I have the drive. Like, LQ was kinda obvtown to anyone with more than one game's experience with the dude, and I guess that makes momo's slot sus because he was the one who said he knew LQ and it was his town game then 180'd on that from what I can tell? TB not doing anything at all really has me kinda leery still, but like, neither have I so that's hugely hypocritical of me so I feel like bringing that up is meh.<br><br>I think with bjc we give him another night at least to try and stop a kill if he is the bg. He seemed a lot like badtown early game to me when I was following along and I thought scum would love to push that angle. On the flip side of that people are now saying there's no scum motivation in cc'ing there and I don't think that's entirely true. LQ as town could have been scumreading scum and so you cc to get rid of him then you being alive is explained by 1) scum won't shoot a bg and 2) your protect target didn't die. 3 would be a bonus if alban flipped 2 nights after and the claim could be he had a chance to roleblock him twice. I still think bj is just town tho, but I don't like the surface level thinking. I've been told I overthink things tho so meh."}

Horrordude stepped it up towards the end, but, it wasn't enough.  Town had a claimed JK on D1 and the compulsive BG did not guard him, bad move.  Then creature replaced in and, kind of anti-wincon didn't really read the game and protected FrankJaeger.  Please don't replace in to my games unless you're going to take it seriously.<br><br>A meh performance by mafia.  Just okay/slightly less than okay Day play, combined with some not-so-great NA decisions. <br><br>Which ultimately led to the SK just being able to skirt by and win, which I think is highly appropriate and I'm satisfied with that.<br><br>I hope you all enjoyed it, and look forward to hearing any criticisms about the setup and whatever else.  When creating the setup the main thing I wanted to do was have both the Compulsive Bodyguard and Bodyguard roles.  I think waaayyyyyy too often do players depend on claims and roles directing play, they use it as a crutch instead of focus on scum-hunting, so putting them both in the game was my way of being like \"HEY!  It doesn't matter what claims or counterclaims are made, what matters is how you play!\"  and I'm satisfied with the result.  I pretty much knew that the whole BG/CBG thing was going to go down, and even imagined it happening on D1 pretty much exactly as it did."}

Sus acompa\u00f1antes, sin bajarse, le gritaban que rompiera una de las ventanas del Impala. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no acelera?, pens\u00e9. El padrote de Lupe empez\u00f3 a patear las puertas. Vi a Mar\u00eda que avanzaba por el jard\u00edn hacia m\u00ed. Vi las caras de los matones en el interior del Camaro. Uno de ellos fumaba un puro. Vi el rostro de Ulises y sus manos que se mov\u00edan por el tablero de mandos del coche de Quim. Vi la cara de Belano que miraba impasible al padrote, como si la cosa no fuera con \u00e9l. Vi a Lupe que se tapaba la cara en el asiento trasero. Pens\u00e9 que el vidrio de la puerta no iba a resistir otra patada y de un salto me vi junto a Alberto. Luego vi que Alberto se tambaleaba. Ol\u00eda a alcohol, seguramente ellos tambi\u00e9n hab\u00edan estado celebrando el fin de a\u00f1o. Vi mi pu\u00f1o derecho (el \u00fanico libre pues en la otra mano llevaba mis libros) que se proyectaba otra vez sobre el cuerpo del padrote y en esta ocasi\u00f3n lo vi caer. Sent\u00ed que me llamaban de la casa y no me volv\u00ed. Pate\u00e9 el cuerpo que estaba a mis pies y vi el Impala que por fin se mov\u00eda. Vi salir a los dos matones del Camaro y los vi dirigirse hacia m\u00ed. Vi que Lupe me miraba desde el interior del coche y que abr\u00eda la puerta. Supe que siempre hab\u00eda querido marcharme. Entr\u00e9 y antes de que pudiera cerrar Ulises aceler\u00f3 de golpe. O\u00ed un disparo o algo que parec\u00eda un disparo. Nos han disparado, hijos de la chingada, dijo Lupe. Me volv\u00ed y a trav\u00e9s de la ventana trasera vi una sombra en medio de la calle. En esa sombra, enmarcada por la ventana estrictamente rectangular del Impala, se concentraba toda la tristeza del mundo. Son fuegos artificiales, o\u00ed que dec\u00eda Belano mientras nuestro coche daba un salto y dejaba atr\u00e1s la casa de las hermanas Font, el Camaro de los matones, la calle Colima y en menos de dos segundos ya est\u00e1bamos en la avenida Oaxaca y nos perd\u00edamos en direcci\u00f3n al norte del DF."}
