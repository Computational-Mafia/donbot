Time flows, memories pass, people die, and history is made. <br>\n<br>\nWe rely on that which we have no control of to keep carrying its weight, to keep moving, and with that keeping us alive.<br>\n<br>\nBut what if that were no longer the case? <br>\n<br>\nWhat if time...were to disappear? Would things cease to exist?<br>\n<br>\nEnter Zeno of Elea, who has the courage to break time, and with his Theroms of Motion, has caught time in a bitter struggle of reason and reality. He has unlocked the Secret of Time, one which was never meant to be realized...<br>\n<br>\nTime has thus played a funny trick on us all, and has decided to inverse itself in its flow, memories, death, birth, and history.<br>\n<br>\nMen and women who have less than half their life span left begin to degenerate, in both mind and body at a rapid pace. The young regenerate too fast for their bodies to cope, and are inheriting memories at an unhealthy sprint. <br>\n<br>\nIf this goes on for much longer, the world will surely go rotten. Amongst the nine of Elea, there are Agents of Zeno who hold the Paradox Paradigm, split into equal pieces of proportional power. Find them amongst yourselves, slay them, and bring order and peace to The World.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Still Alive (3/9)</div></div>:<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#804040\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1.

Why call out others for something you were guilty of (still are)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m going to answer these in the reverse order.  The reason I was asking for more content for other players is because at that point, the game more or less consisted of petty arguments between two or three people, and these felt like they were not, ultimately, relevant but were acting as a smokescreen.  I accept that I haven&#8217;t posted much, and I know that that&#8217;s not good, but I&#8217;ve found it difficult to get a grasp on this game due to these arguments.  I was hoping that contributions from others would make it easier for me.<br>\n<br>\nAs for why I asked in particular for McStab&#8217;s contribution, I did not (and do not) feel his contribution was more relevant than the others.  However, at that point, I felt McStab&#8217;s posts were very short and made his opinions clear without explaining the reasoning behind them.  I wanted to hear more in-depth reasoning. <br>\n<br>\nMcStab:  Even now, you&#8217;ve basically only explained your reasoning in one of your posts (post 72) and I would like to hear more explanation of your thoughts.  Based on your last post, I&#8217;m hoping that we may get some more information on your thoughts on Robbnva.  Despite the lack of reasoning, however, overall I get a townie vibe from you.<br>\n<br>\nN and Slandaar:  You two seem way too interested in each other compared to the rest of the players.  At present, both of you are voting Guppy and both of you seem to be insisting that the scum team is Guppy with the other one.  This screams to me of distancing.  I think that if Guppy is town, there&#8217;s a very good chance that the two of you are scum together.<br>\n<br>\nProf. Guppy:  I think there&#8217;s a pretty good chance overall that you&#8217;re scum.  You were definitely taking jokes way too seriously at the beginning of the day yesterday, and you&#8217;re making a lot of dumb statements.  This could be just plain stupidity, but it also feels like you&#8217;re considering your posts carefully before posting them.  In general, I&#8217;m much more willing to trust idiots who don&#8217;t think about what they say than idiots who do.<br>\n<br>\nDunhamganger:  I get a strong pro-town vibe from you.  I can&#8217;t place any craplogic and none of your posts feel off to me, so for the time being I&#8217;m happy to focus elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\nTo summarise:<br>\n<br>\nRobbnva: Hard to read because of his attitude.  Overall scummy.<br>\nMcStab:  Generally town but needs to post reasoning behind his reasoning.<br>\nN and Slandaar:  If scum, probably scum together.<br>\nProf. Guppy:  Dumbscum, emphasis on the dumb.<br>\nDunhamganger:  Town.<br>\n<br>\nAt the moment, I think a Robb / Guppy pairing is most likely, then N / Slandaar, then McStab / Guppy.  It&#8217;s also possible that only one of N and Slandaar are scum; in this case I would think the most likely partner is Robb.  <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Prof. Guppy</span>", "time": "Sun Sep 16, 2012 5:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23234&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "23234"}

My reasoning is as follows:<br>\n<br>\na) Taking jokes seriously and making dumb posts are examples of bad play.<br>\nb) Bad play is most likely to come about in three scenarios - where the player doesn't think, where the poster is stupid, and where the poster is scum.<br>\nc) If a player isn't thinking, they won't consider their posts carefully.<br>\nd) Stupid players are less likely to think about their posts if they are town than if they're scum.<br>\nTherefore e) If someone is considering their posts carefully and are still making repeated bad plays, this is scummy.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason I described you as strawmanning me is because you ignored the bits of my post which showed that I was thinking beyond step (a).  Without the rest of the steps - which I admit I glossed over at first, figuring that the reasoning was fairly obvious - of course my argument will seem bad.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4338335#p4338335\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4338335#p4338335\" data-post-id=\"4338335\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 175</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite>Why was sable's vote town motivated?

N starts looking at Robb, pointing out a reason why McStab might have been killed (albeit one which I disagree with)<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, Slandaar looks at exactly one person &#8211; N.  This does not surprise me at all.  <br>\n<br>\nRobbnva seems surprised that Slandaar doesn&#8217;t suspect him, which again looks odd to me.  In my experience, when someone&#8217;s protown and doesn&#8217;t have any hard evidence on them (such as a cop claim), they generally don&#8217;t act surprised when someone else says they don't look scummy.<br>\n<br>\nThen, out of nowhere, Slandaar asks for a mascclaim.

When considering that as an option, your posts interacting with each other read like sloppy distancing.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4403255#p4403255\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4403255#p4403255\" data-post-id=\"4403255\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 496</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16634\">Slandaar</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4337714#p4337714\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4337714#p4337714\" data-post-id=\"4337714\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 166</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19456\">Sable Tip</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Prof. Guppy</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4337714#p4337714\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4337714#p4337714\" data-post-id=\"4337714\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 166</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19456\">Sable Tip</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nProf. Guppy:  Dumbscum, emphasis on the dumb.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nCombine this with the fact Sable thinks Guppy is scum (see the vote and the read) it makes the pairing look even more nonsensical.

I thought Guppy and Robb were easily the scummiest, and I thought that it was probably Robb/Guppy.  I then thought &#8220;What are the possible pairings without it being both of them,&#8221; and based on the interactions up to that point I thought that the possible pairing of you and N screamed out as a possibility.  I thought it was unlikely to be Guppy with Sland / N because, again, of the interactions; it felt far more likely that if exactly one of you were scum, it would be with someone with whom you had basically not had any interaction; Robb fit that bill well and was high on my list of scumspects anyways, so I put Robb &amp; (N/Sland) as a possibility.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4403255#p4403255\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4403255#p4403255\" data-post-id=\"4403255\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 496</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16634\">Slandaar</a> wrote:</cite> <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4337714#p4337714\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4337714#p4337714\" data-post-id=\"4337714\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 166</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19456\">Sable Tip</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> you&#8217;re making a lot of dumb statements.

This was the first time that he had voted Guppy all game.<br>\n<br>\nDunham&#8217;s been trying to guide the lynches all game.  He was one of the strongest proponents of Fourseen&#8217;s lynch and Robb&#8217;s lynch, but kept the back foot on Guppy &#8211; pointing out scumminess when it was obvious while trying to draw attention elsewhere &#8211; until it was obvious that Guppy wasn&#8217;t getting out of there alive. <br>\n<br>\nDunham also was the first to direct my JK.  He also deemed it obvious that after I jailed him, the fact there was no kill meant that I was &#8220;obviously&#8221; the scum.  I think that&#8217;s because he realised that if Slandaar was the lynch, I would just jail Dunham again and I would be confirmed town, so I was the only possible lynch from his perspective.  <br>\n<br>\nHe then decides to focus all his energy on me, giving spurious reasons for me being scum (posting my thoughts in great detail is scummy why?) and completely discounts the possibility of Slandaar choosing to no-kill as being &#8220;infinitesimally small&#8221; despite it actually being a pretty sensible play from scum!Slandaar&#8217;s perspective.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, he realises that he can&#8217;t actually make good arguments against me anymore, so decides to disappear entirely and let me into the spotlight for a bit while Slandaar and N confirm one another as town.  When challenged on his not posting, he decides to act like my guilt is confirmed already and that there&#8217;s nothing more for him to say, and hasn't actually contributed since despite posting three times.", "time": "Wed Oct 17, 2012 8:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23234&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "23234"}
