Frankly, the reason I haven\u2019t posted is that a large amount of the game so far feels like just random arguments which don\u2019t really make me feel one person is more or less scummy than the other \u2013 I\u2019d go so far as to say that the entirety of day one is pretty null reads to me.  I\u2019ll try to re-read it properly again to see if I\u2019m missing anything major\u2026<br><br>As for today:<br><br>Robbnva seems very blas\u00e9 to me.  Going on gut more than analysis, his posts feel very surface-level and it feels like he\u2019s trying to figure out how a pro-town player should be feeling, then figuring out what he can say to make it look like he feels that way.  I especially don\u2019t like posts 132 and 133.

Why call out others for something you were guilty of (still are)</div></blockquote><br><br>I\u2019m going to answer these in the reverse order.  The reason I was asking for more content for other players is because at that point, the game more or less consisted of petty arguments between two or three people, and these felt like they were not, ultimately, relevant but were acting as a smokescreen.  I accept that I haven\u2019t posted much, and I know that that\u2019s not good, but I\u2019ve found it difficult to get a grasp on this game due to these arguments.  I was hoping that contributions from others would make it easier for me.<br><br>As for why I asked in particular for McStab\u2019s contribution, I did not (and do not) feel his contribution was more relevant than the others.  However, at that point, I felt McStab\u2019s posts were very short and made his opinions clear without explaining the reasoning behind them.  I wanted to hear more in-depth reasoning. <br><br>McStab:  Even now, you\u2019ve basically only explained your reasoning in one of your posts (post 72) and I would like to hear more explanation of your thoughts.  Based on your last post, I\u2019m hoping that we may get some more information on your thoughts on Robbnva.  Despite the lack of reasoning, however, overall I get a townie vibe from you.<br><br>N and Slandaar:  You two seem way too interested in each other compared to the rest of the players.  At present, both of you are voting Guppy and both of you seem to be insisting that the scum team is Guppy with the other one.  This screams to me of distancing.  I think that if Guppy is town, there\u2019s a very good chance that the two of you are scum together.<br><br>Prof. Guppy:  I think there\u2019s a pretty good chance overall that you\u2019re scum.  You were definitely taking jokes way too seriously at the beginning of the day yesterday, and you\u2019re making a lot of dumb statements.  This could be just plain stupidity, but it also feels like you\u2019re considering your posts carefully before posting them.  In general, I\u2019m much more willing to trust idiots who don\u2019t think about what they say than idiots who do.<br><br>Dunhamganger:  I get a strong pro-town vibe from you.  I can\u2019t place any craplogic and none of your posts feel off to me, so for the time being I\u2019m happy to focus elsewhere.<br><br>To summarise:<br><br>Robbnva: Hard to read because of his attitude.  Overall scummy.<br>McStab:  Generally town but needs to post reasoning behind his reasoning.<br>N and Slandaar:  If scum, probably scum together.<br>Prof. Guppy:  Dumbscum, emphasis on the dumb.<br>Dunhamganger:  Town.<br><br>At the moment, I think a Robb / Guppy pairing is most likely, then N / Slandaar, then McStab / Guppy.  It\u2019s also possible that only one of N and Slandaar are scum; in this case I would think the most likely partner is Robb.  <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Prof. Guppy</span>"}

It seems off to me that you would post both of these perspectives within 24 hours, with nothing obvious in the thread that would make you change your position so rapidly. Townies are more likely to maintain the same perspective whereas scum are more likely to say whatever is necessary to appear pro-town, so these two posts taken together trip my scumdar pretty badly. Combine that with the craplogic, your blas\u00e9 attitude at the start of the day, and your play day one..</div></blockquote><br><br>YOu are completely wrong in this quote.<br><br>the first quote was in response to the self hammer the day before, it had nothing to do with wanting action today.<br><br>the other is a cautionary post because I am most people haven't realized that we are approaching in mylo. <br><br>They aren't contradictory at all and they certainly don't offer 2 different stances.</div></blockquote><br><br>I disagree.  Besides, I was pointing out what these two posts were making me think.  It seems off to me, so I mention that it seems off to me.

I don't even know anymore.)</div></blockquote><br><br>Robbnva said that he expects Guppy to flip town, and implies that no-one else has done anything pro-town all game?  Interesting.  N and Robbnva then have a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">discussion</span> about the Guppy lynch, during which N states that he was on a scum lynch before the flip.  This is worth noting.<br><br>Slandaar says that N is Guppy\u2019s buddy, again.<br><br>Guppy flips scum, no surprises there, then McStab gets killed overnight.<br><br>Dunham now says that he will be \u201cpleased to no possible end\u201d if Robbnva is scum.<br><br>Robbnva says it\u2019s probably best to lynch him today!  This feels very bad to me \u2013 townies should never feel that they\u2019re the correct lynch unless it\u2019s part of a gambit or otherwise narrows down the scum suspects to one.  However, scum may say they are \u201cprobably\u201d the best lynch in order to look like they\u2019re thinking about the town as a whole rather than their own survival, as a gambit.<br><br>Robbnva now starts saying that N is the obvlynch and that he\u2019s \u201conly\u201d obvious because of his quickhammer \u2013 not because he was the only person not interested in a Guppy lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4357383#p4357383\" class=\"postlink\">post 295</a>, Robbnva wrote:</cite>I never ever defend my scum buddies when I'm scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh, that\u2019s alright then.  I always trust scummy players when they explain that their scum play is nothing like their current play <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"><br><br>After saying that N was the obvious lynch, Robbnva now switches his vote to Dunham \u2013 the person most strongly attacking him.  Nowhere does he say what Dunham\u2019s done that\u2019s actually scummy (apart from an implication that Dunham may have been putting attention on Guppy before voting him)<br><br>Robbnva and Dunham now step back and allow the other odd couple, N and Slandaar, the floor.  N starts looking at Robb, pointing out a reason why McStab might have been killed (albeit one which I disagree with)<br><br>On the other hand, Slandaar looks at exactly one person \u2013 N.  This does not surprise me at all.  <br><br>Robbnva seems surprised that Slandaar doesn\u2019t suspect him, which again looks odd to me.  In my experience, when someone\u2019s protown and doesn\u2019t have any hard evidence on them (such as a cop claim), they generally don\u2019t act surprised when someone else says they don't look scummy.<br><br>Then, out of nowhere, Slandaar asks for a mascclaim.  Rather than suggesting popcorning (which is generally the preferred method of massclaim as far as I know) he suggests a specific order.  Slandaar, is there any specific reason for this?<br><br>N makes a pretty obvious VT claim, which neither Slandaar nor Robbnva seem to pick up on.<br><br>Robb starts trying to interrogate N, who pointedly ignores it.<br><br>Right now, I am seriously tempted to vote Robbnva.  I want more discussion before that, though \u2013 in particular, I want more from Slandaar on a subject other than N.  You\u2019ve posted almost nothing about anyone other than N or Guppy all game (excepting your vote analysis on day 2)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Strong FOS: Robbnva</span> \u2013 I want to hear you claim."}

(Because if he was town, why would he lie about who he jailkept, and if he was scum he's the last one left.)<br><br>If Sable is night killed and flips jailkeeper, both whoever he jails tonight and myself will be confirmed town, making lylo really fucking easy.<br><br>If you or Dun gets killed tonight, it points straight to Sable being the last scum - because I'm pretty much confirmed town now (see above: if he's town why would he lie and if he's scum then good) and whoever was \"jailkept\" couldn't have performed the kill (unless Sable is lying, which see above again).<br><br>I think the most likely thing to happen is a no-kill tonight, which would not point to anything and we'll be going around in circles again."}

(Clearing Robb, for instance, doesn't necessarily lead to N's lynch the way that clearing N more or less directly led to Robb's.)</div></blockquote><br><br>This is false.  I did not actually accuse Slandaar of being scummier than you; I made my reason for wanting Slandaar to claim first perfectly clear:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4359469#p4359469\" class=\"postlink\">post 344</a>, Sable Tip wrote:</cite>I don't like it when people ask for a massclaim and put themselves at the bottom of the list unless they're effectively confirmed innocent.</div></blockquote><br><br>My logic for jailkeeping you instead of Slandaar is equivalent \u2013 at that point, N was cleared, so it came down to you or Slandaar to jail.  You wanted me to jail Slandaar:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4359905#p4359905\" class=\"postlink\">post 354</a>, Dunhamganger wrote:</cite>If he flips town jail Sland.

Both want me to jail Slandaar.  If I do, I am doing what the scum wants, and presumably there is a reason they want that, so I should go against the scum\u2019s wishes and jail Dunham instead.\u201d<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4359905#p4359905\" class=\"postlink\">post 354</a>, Dunhamganger wrote:</cite>I would still no-lynch for a night to see what kind of staring contest we could get in to.

He also deemed it obvious that after I jailed him, the fact there was no kill meant that I was \u201cobviously\u201d the scum.  I think that\u2019s because he realised that if Slandaar was the lynch, I would just jail Dunham again and I would be confirmed town, so I was the only possible lynch from his perspective.  <br><br>He then decides to focus all his energy on me, giving spurious reasons for me being scum (posting my thoughts in great detail is scummy why?) and completely discounts the possibility of Slandaar choosing to no-kill as being \u201cinfinitesimally small\u201d despite it actually being a pretty sensible play from scum!Slandaar\u2019s perspective.<br><br>Finally, he realises that he can\u2019t actually make good arguments against me anymore, so decides to disappear entirely and let me into the spotlight for a bit while Slandaar and N confirm one another as town.
