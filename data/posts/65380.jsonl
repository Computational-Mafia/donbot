Do not edit/delete your posts.<br>\n4. To vote somebody, either bold your vote, such as <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: ChaosOmega</div>, or use vote tags, such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ChaosOmega</span>. If your vote isn't bolded or vote tagged, it will not count. Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>\n5. During the day, a player will be lynched when they have more than 50% of the players currently alive voting for them. Once that amount has been reached, they're dead; no unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>\n6. Once it has been posted by me that you are dead, you're dead. Do not post any more, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not even a bah post</div>.<br>\n7. Every day will have a deadline of 2 weeks. Extensions will be given for extreme circumstances.<br>\n8. Nights will have a deadline of 2 days. If you have a night action and do not send one, you will do nothing.<br>\n9. If you're going to be gone for longer than a 48-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long. If 48 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them. For the purposes of this rule, the weekend counts as 24 hours.<br>\n10. If a player would receive a fourth prod (unless it is their first prod of the day) or they have not responded to a prod within 24 hours, I will search for a replacement for them.<br>\n11. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\">#0040FF is my color.

That is just a phrase I used to mean that someone comes in and lynches you before you get the chance to defend yourself.  Honestly I really should not have used that exact phrase as \"quick hammer\" is more accurate.  How this usually works here is people will present a case on a player that they think is scum and convince others to join the \"wagon\" (vote that player).  Once that player reaches \"L-1\" (requires one more player to be lynched) they will normally claim or someone will ask for a \"claim\" (reveal their role and any information that they might have garnered from it).  Before casting the last vote that will lynch a player the person casting it will \"announce intent to hammer within XX hours\" (meaning they will cast the last vote that results in a lynch - normally 24 hours from intent).  Then that player will have one last chance to defend themselves.  Once the time is up the final vote is cast and the player is lynched.  This is a typical course of events here however, as already stated, it is not a hard set of rules and sometimes someone will quick hammer and end the day prematurely.  That is not all that common though because it is normally punished here by lynching the quick hammer vote the next day.  It is anti town to hammer before the rest of town is ready for it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MOD With all this voting can we get a quick VC</div>. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEven then you only reveal your role IF you think that it is beneficial for town.

If it went another way, like I told you, people probably would've believed your fake claim. Then I would've probably been mislynched - to which meant I'd flip that PR role in that game.

At the least, I can make this assumption: Kein is not reading: if he read how long we have til deadline and the fact that no one has even provided any real evidence for their votes yet, he would realize that no one is trying to lynch him, yet. Also, lynching a person then giving defense, then choosing inno/guilty seems rather inefficient.

Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later.

I mean, even if mechanics were different elsewhere, why in the world do you think everyone is trying to lynch you barely 24 hrs(?) into the day? At the least, I can make this assumption: Kein is not reading: if he read how long we have til deadline and the fact that no one has even provided any real evidence for their votes yet, he would realize that no one is trying to lynch him, yet. Also, lynching a person then giving defense, then choosing inno/guilty seems rather inefficient.

Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later.

Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later.

I mean, even if mechanics were different elsewhere, why in the world do you think everyone is trying to lynch you barely 24 hrs(?) into the day? At the least, I can make this assumption: Kein is not reading: if he read how long we have til deadline and the fact that no one has even provided any real evidence for their votes yet, he would realize that no one is trying to lynch him, yet. Also, lynching a person then giving defense, then choosing inno/guilty seems rather inefficient.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7683067#p7683067\">260</a> by Iran, Iran finds Garn scummy for making posts that feel \"forced and scummy\". He goes on to question Gamr's strong townread of Kein, saying it is poorly backed up &amp; overall, attempt to get towncred by buddying. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I completely disagree. Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later. Anyway, back on topic, there are quite a few good reasons to think Kein istown by this point, so it seems it's you who is trying to mislead players. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Very Scum Indicative</div></div><br>\n<br>\n18.

I agree with your reads overall, and there are 2 parts I haven't thought of so your perspective is very helpful here - especially toward Gar/droog. For instance, droog - from my memory, his towngame  showed him being more engaged. In this game, he replaced in, posted, then has disappeared. I remember reading Insidious, his predecessor, as town  based on ISO.  I need to ISO droog and review his posts.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the 2 null folks in your reads - in my experience and from advice for town play, null slots should typically not be trusted. Doesn't mean we can't work with them or have them work with us, but null slots are there for a reason...whether they're being consistently vague, too brief, lurking, contradictory, misrepresenting, etc.<br>\n<br>\nI'm at a different place toward Garmr than you. I have him as null as you may have seen from my previous post. Makes me rather other uncomfortable as I may have read him wrong on d1. <br>\n<br>\nI definitely appreciate the reads list , as I haven't thought of droog and Garmr in those ways.", "time": "Sat Mar 12, 2016 9:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65380&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "65380"}
