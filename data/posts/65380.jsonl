No outside communication about this game unless your role permits it.<br>2. Don't quote your Role PM or any out-of-thread communications. Don't fake-quote it, either. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>3. Do not edit/delete your posts.<br>4. To vote somebody, either bold your vote, such as <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: ChaosOmega</span>, or use vote tags, such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ChaosOmega</span>. If your vote isn't bolded or vote tagged, it will not count. Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>5. During the day, a player will be lynched when they have more than 50% of the players currently alive voting for them. Once that amount has been reached, they're dead; no unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>6. Once it has been posted by me that you are dead, you're dead. Do not post any more, <span class=\"noboldsig\">not even a bah post</span>.<br>7. Every day will have a deadline of 2 weeks. Extensions will be given for extreme circumstances.<br>8. Nights will have a deadline of 2 days. If you have a night action and do not send one, you will do nothing.<br>9. If you're going to be gone for longer than a 48-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long. If 48 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them. For the purposes of this rule, the weekend counts as 24 hours.<br>10. If a player would receive a fourth prod (unless it is their first prod of the day) or they have not responded to a prod within 24 hours, I will search for a replacement for them.<br>11. <span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">#0040FF is my color. Don't use it.</span></span> Also, no small or invisible text or cryptography.<br>12. Please PM me if you have any questions about the game.<br>13. Have fun.<br>14. If anyone breaks any of the aforementioned rules, I have complete control over the actions that will be taken.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Sample Townie Role PM</span></span></span></span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Townie</span>.

It really is not an official phase here as once another vote is in that ends the day and starts twilight but most players will give you the chance to present your case at that time.

That does not mean you are 'in turbo lynch.'  That is just a phrase I used to mean that someone comes in and lynches you before you get the chance to defend yourself.  Honestly I really should not have used that exact phrase as \"quick hammer\" is more accurate.  How this usually works here is people will present a case on a player that they think is scum and convince others to join the \"wagon\" (vote that player).  Once that player reaches \"L-1\" (requires one more player to be lynched) they will normally claim or someone will ask for a \"claim\" (reveal their role and any information that they might have garnered from it).  Before casting the last vote that will lynch a player the person casting it will \"announce intent to hammer within XX hours\" (meaning they will cast the last vote that results in a lynch - normally 24 hours from intent).  Then that player will have one last chance to defend themselves.  Once the time is up the final vote is cast and the player is lynched.  This is a typical course of events here however, as already stated, it is not a hard set of rules and sometimes someone will quick hammer and end the day prematurely.  That is not all that common though because it is normally punished here by lynching the quick hammer vote the next day.  It is anti town to hammer before the rest of town is ready for it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@MOD With all this voting can we get a quick VC</span>. <br><br><br>Even then you only reveal your role IF you think that it is beneficial for town.  This is not always the case."}

People think things out here. Set up spec is unknown so fake claims become viable here and scum can always claim vanilla town and no one will question it because it's a legit possibility that all that are left is vanilla. In town of salem you can just all claim roles day 1 and lynch the people that conflict have conflicting roles you can break it in 100s of way as town.

Plus, this is the only post that Soapbar made before actual cases started being built. I'm not saying I think he's scum, he posted like this in his town games too, just that you can't base a town read in RVS off of something like this, especially when it's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">also something he does as scum.</span></div></blockquote><br>The rest of Soapbar's play in that game felt rather stiff (see the very next post in his 1747 ISO!), but here he's engaging in conversation in a way that feels markedly more fluid.<br><br>And there's still a gut-ish aspect of how I'm reading Soapbar as confirmed town-aligned which I haven't adequately expressed, so it's not like that's the only reason.<br><br>Is there something wrong here, though?

Plus, this is the only post that Soapbar made before actual cases started being built.

People think things out here.

He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later.

I mean, even if mechanics were different elsewhere, why in the world do you think everyone is trying to lynch you barely 24 hrs(?) into the day? At the least, I can make this assumption: Kein is not reading: if he read how long we have til deadline and the fact that no one has even provided any real evidence for their votes yet, he would realize that no one is trying to lynch him, yet. Also, lynching a person then giving defense, then choosing inno/guilty seems rather inefficient.

Lapsa decides to fencesit Perf. on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7678084#p7678084\">227</a> - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Normally, wouldn't strike me as scummy. But, combined with Lapsa's behavior so far, I kinda do.

He goes on to question Gamr's strong townread of Kein, saying it is poorly backed up &amp; overall, attempt to get towncred by buddying. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I completely disagree. Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later. Anyway, back on topic, there are quite a few good reasons to think Kein istown by this point, so it seems it's you who is trying to mislead players. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Very Scum Indicative</span></span><br><br>18.

Kein thinks everyone is trying to lynch him. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">For one who claims to have played a 1000 games of FM, he seems rather noobish. I mean, even if mechanics were different elsewhere, why in the world do you think everyone is trying to lynch you barely 24 hrs(?) into the day? At the least, I can make this assumption: Kein is not reading: if he read how long we have til deadline and the fact that no one has even provided any real evidence for their votes yet, he would realize that no one is trying to lynch him, yet. Also, lynching a person then giving defense, then choosing inno/guilty seems rather inefficient.

Soap states \"their all cult\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7676747#p7676747\">196</a> - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">First of all, where did the idea of cult come from?

Lapsa decides to fencesit Perf. on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7678084#p7678084\">227</a> - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Normally, wouldn't strike me as scummy. But, combined with Lapsa's behavior so far, I kinda do. Seems the motive is not confusion/weak reads, but rather, scum trying to conform and who knows Perf. is town, so is trying to distance himself from the wagon. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Very Scum-Indicative</span></span><br><br>15.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7683067#p7683067\">260</a> by Iran, Iran finds Garn scummy for making posts that feel \"forced and scummy\". He goes on to question Gamr's strong townread of Kein, saying it is poorly backed up &amp; overall, attempt to get towncred by buddying. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I completely disagree. Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later. Anyway, back on topic, there are quite a few good reasons to think Kein istown by this point, so it seems it's you who is trying to mislead players. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Very Scum Indicative</span></span><br><br>18.

Anyway, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7684154#p7684154\">275</a>, Mario says he's against the Perf wagon and against all the wagons in general. He also says he'll just crit. wagons til he or someone else finds something scummy. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">This post strikes me in a way, but I'm not sure if I think town or I think scum with this post. I think I'll go with town -- he's right, most of the wagons, esp. the Perf wagon have been pretty poorly supported. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-Town-Indicative</span></span><br><br>21.

I mean, even if mechanics were different elsewhere, why in the world do you think everyone is trying to lynch you barely 24 hrs(?) into the day? At the least, I can make this assumption: Kein is not reading: if he read how long we have til deadline and the fact that no one has even provided any real evidence for their votes yet, he would realize that no one is trying to lynch him, yet. Also, lynching a person then giving defense, then choosing inno/guilty seems rather inefficient.

He goes on to question Gamr's strong townread of Kein, saying it is poorly backed up &amp; overall, attempt to get towncred by buddying. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I completely disagree. Quite the opposite of forced, Garn's posts have seen thought out and logical this game, even if I don't always concur with them. Furthermore, your argument about Kein and buddying is rather invalid. While Kein could be very clever scum, it's way more likely he's noobtown or even VI town. He is engaged and trying to solve the game; while he can be obnoxious with his caps at times, I no longer get scum vibes from his posts. Kein is the kind of person who'll prob. last to LyLo cuz of his inexperience at mafiascum. While he seems a bit of a VI as I stated earlier, we are in no rush to \"policy\" lynch him yet (so we have better shots at LyLo); I could be wrong --&gt; We may see his potential later. Anyway, back on topic, there are quite a few good reasons to think Kein istown by this point, so it seems it's you who is trying to mislead players. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Very Scum Indicative</span></span><br><br>18.

I agree with your reads overall, and there are 2 parts I haven't thought of so your perspective is very helpful here - especially toward Gar/droog. For instance, droog - from my memory, his towngame  showed him being more engaged. In this game, he replaced in, posted, then has disappeared. I remember reading Insidious, his predecessor, as town  based on ISO.  I need to ISO droog and review his posts.<br><br>As for the 2 null folks in your reads - in my experience and from advice for town play, null slots should typically not be trusted. Doesn't mean we can't work with them or have them work with us, but null slots are there for a reason...whether they're being consistently vague, too brief, lurking, contradictory, misrepresenting, etc.<br><br>I'm at a different place toward Garmr than you. I have him as null as you may have seen from my previous post. Makes me rather other uncomfortable as I may have read him wrong on d1. <br><br>I definitely appreciate the reads list , as I haven't thought of droog and Garmr in those ways."}

I don't want to waste mine or anyone else's time. I have a higher respect for high-performing players and will unashamedly coach others if I think they're town (based on the situation of course).
