You may request a deadline extension, but it is up to my final decision whether or not I grant the extension based on what I've seen. There will not be a lynch if the game goes to night due to this deadline--someone has to consciously place a hammer vote.<br>\n    </li><li>You may choose to go to night without a lynch before then, by having at least half of the players vote: No Lynch. (That's half, not a full majority.)<br>\n    </li><li>Votes should be posted in the format 'vote: Barack Obama.' I expect them to be entirely bold, but don't try to exploit this to trick someone. I'll count what I damn well want to count. I will register misspellings and nicknames if I can figure out who you're referring to. You do not have to unvote, but you're welcome to do so anyway.<br>\n    </li><li>When a player has the majority of the votes at a single point, they are dead and the game goes to twilight. You may post in twilight until I get a lynch scene up.<br>\n    </li><li>Night deadlines are usually going to be 72-hours, or whenever I receive all actions. If you have a role but don't want to perform a night action, just PM me with the phrase No Night Action so I know you've made your choice.<br>\n    </li><li>If any anti-town faction does not submit a kill at night, they will no kill and the day phase will continue.</li></ul><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">&#8232;&#8232;What is and isn't allowed:</div></div><br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Unless otherwise specified, living players can't communicate with each other out of the thread.

(I am of course available, sympathetic and discrete.) Regardless of where you found them, rantbuddies may not reveal their own opinions on the game.<br>\n    </li><li>\"Dead\" means \"dead.\" You can have one \"Bah! I'm dead! Go town!\" post afterwards, but if it contains any game relevant information, I will delete it, bring you back from the dead, and modkill you just to prove a point.<br>\n    </li><li>Read your role PM and summarize it in your confirmation PM response to me. Unless I've posted it publicly, you may not reference its wording in-thread. You can paraphrase if you must claim, but any direct quotation of any PMs will result in a modkill.

I will make all prods public in the thread.<br>\n    </li><li>If you don't post in-thread in response to a prod within 24 hours, I will seek a replacement to take over your role. I may seek replacement for a player who lurks consistently without breaking this rule, but you'll have some sort of warning first.<br>\n    </li><li>If you receive three prods in a row without much contribution to the game, you will automatically be replaced.<br>\n    </li><li>I'll try to post votecounts regularly. If you feel it has been too long since the last one, request one. If I make errors, please correct me.<br>\n    </li><li>I'm one of those \"spirit-of-the-game\"-type hippies.

Lets look at the knuckleheads voting for me:<br>\n<br>\n1) Wasabi: Case made. Saying \"This isnt an OMGUS vote\" isnt enough to hide the fact you fucking planted an OMGUS vote. Claiming some bullshit sheeping isnt enough to hide the fact that its a shitty OMGUS vote. You havent presented a case on me. In fact, you were happy to discuss voting anxiety or Fenix, to paraphrase: \"Just to get rid of the fake claimers\". Then in an OMGUSfest, you suddenly switch the vote with no explanation. Could you bandwagon hop any harder?<br>\n<br>\n2) Anxiety: Mr Rebel without a clue. \"Im going to channel Johnny Badass and make up some fake claim bullshit because its the cool thing to do, maaaan. I dont need to play by your rulez, im anxiety, I do whatever the fuck I want. Anarchy man!\" Then rides off on a skateboard. King of one liners, he is only lazy because he is too cool to deal with you square cats. Agreed with the [L] lynch, but now wants to deny all of that business. When shit gets real, he just doesnt care.<br>\n<br>\nIm still waiting on that Charter/IS conspiracy theory, Anxiety.<br>\n<br>\n3) ChkFlip: Before I ISO'd Chkflip, I was thinking that he was going to be the most likely to play the jackass White KNight role in this game. Yet, looking through his content, I dont see much of anything from him. Some argument with the fake claimers Day 1,  A couple sheep posts about [L] day 1, now on Day 2 a bunch of skimming and asking obvious questions. Thats usually a sign of scum treading water waiting to see what develops.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd since apparently I have to so this, <br>\n<br>\nCharter:  Well shit Anxiety, nevermind, Charter is the true King of All One Liners. A bunch of hemming and hawing Day 1 just to swoop in with an oopshammer on [L]. Ooops! Now on Day 2 he is just on anti-Fenix mode. Going all kung fu and deflecting everything Fenix says. He isnt really looking for any scum, the case on Fenix is pretty fucking weak. If its all about the fakeclaims, I dismissed Fenix and Anxiety at being the equivalent of mafia 15yr olds trying to be cool and hoping to be \"edgy\". Its not worth discussing since better reasons can come up of their scummyness if their general ineptness is left alone.<br>\n<br>\nAnd since Charter is about the Fenix:<br>\n<br>\nFenix: ::facepalm:: on the retardedass fakeclaim. Its aggravating and annoying. Congrats of being the equivalent of some shitty ass skateboarder punk. Anarchy man! Yea! That being said, So far it looks like Fenix is the only one actually trying here. His arguments are clear and concise. He is calling out the right people and seems to actually be genuinely scumhunting. The case on Charter is a little light. Yea, Charter isnt saying much. Charter is still on and on over the fakeclaim shit (Seriously Fenix, dont do that shit ever again. Not cool). If Fenix is scum, he is being marvelous at it at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding RBT, she needs to play the invisible game she is playing while im around because I blow her up everytime she is scum. She is simply trying something different in order to get off my radar. Aint that right, darlin'?<br>\n<br>\nEven so, this game needs a swift kick in the ass.

Lets look at the knuckleheads voting for me:<br>\n<br>\n1) Wasabi: Case made. Saying \"This isnt an OMGUS vote\" isnt enough to hide the fact you fucking planted an OMGUS vote. Claiming some bullshit sheeping isnt enough to hide the fact that its a shitty OMGUS vote. You havent presented a case on me. In fact, you were happy to discuss voting anxiety or Fenix, to paraphrase: \"Just to get rid of the fake claimers\". Then in an OMGUSfest, you suddenly switch the vote with no explanation. Could you bandwagon hop any harder?<br>\n<br>\n2) Anxiety: Mr Rebel without a clue. \"Im going to channel Johnny Badass and make up some fake claim bullshit because its the cool thing to do, maaaan. I dont need to play by your rulez, im anxiety, I do whatever the fuck I want. Anarchy man!\" Then rides off on a skateboard. King of one liners, he is only lazy because he is too cool to deal with you square cats. Agreed with the [L] lynch, but now wants to deny all of that business. When shit gets real, he just doesnt care.<br>\n<br>\nIm still waiting on that Charter/IS conspiracy theory, Anxiety.<br>\n<br>\n3) ChkFlip: Before I ISO'd Chkflip, I was thinking that he was going to be the most likely to play the jackass White KNight role in this game. Yet, looking through his content, I dont see much of anything from him. Some argument with the fake claimers Day 1,  A couple sheep posts about [L] day 1, now on Day 2 a bunch of skimming and asking obvious questions. Thats usually a sign of scum treading water waiting to see what develops.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd since apparently I have to so this, <br>\n<br>\nCharter:  Well shit Anxiety, nevermind, Charter is the true King of All One Liners. A bunch of hemming and hawing Day 1 just to swoop in with an oopshammer on [L]. Ooops! Now on Day 2 he is just on anti-Fenix mode. Going all kung fu and deflecting everything Fenix says. He isnt really looking for any scum, the case on Fenix is pretty fucking weak. If its all about the fakeclaims, I dismissed Fenix and Anxiety at being the equivalent of mafia 15yr olds trying to be cool and hoping to be \"edgy\". Its not worth discussing since better reasons can come up of their scummyness if their general ineptness is left alone.<br>\n<br>\nAnd since Charter is about the Fenix:<br>\n<br>\nFenix: ::facepalm:: on the retardedass fakeclaim. Its aggravating and annoying. Congrats of being the equivalent of some shitty ass skateboarder punk. Anarchy man! Yea! That being said, So far it looks like Fenix is the only one actually trying here. His arguments are clear and concise. He is calling out the right people and seems to actually be genuinely scumhunting. The case on Charter is a little light. Yea, Charter isnt saying much. Charter is still on and on over the fakeclaim shit (Seriously Fenix, dont do that shit ever again. Not cool). If Fenix is scum, he is being marvelous at it at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding RBT, she needs to play the invisible game she is playing while im around because I blow her up everytime she is scum. She is simply trying something different in order to get off my radar. Aint that right, darlin'?<br>\n<br>\nEven so, this game needs a swift kick in the ass.

The difference is, RBT tried directly to secure herself as confirmed town when she wasn't, and I took the risk of not looking town for a gambit. The two are distinctly different, however, and I have never once said \"I took the risk of not looking town, therefore I am town\".
