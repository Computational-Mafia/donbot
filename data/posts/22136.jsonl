If there is no majority at deadline, there will be no lynch for that day.<br>\n5.) game days have a deadline of 7 days.<br>\n6.) nights will be 24 hours maximum. Any night actions not submitted will simply not happen, although night actions may be submitted ahead of time.<br>\n7.) Do not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows you to.<br>\n8.) When you die, you are dead. Stay that way.<br>\n9.) Do not edit posts. Do not use invisible text. Do not use small text.<br>\n10.) Do not quote any communication from the mod (that includes PMs) in the game thread.<br>\n11.) If you are going to be gone for an extended period of time, please let me know. See rule 12.<br>\n12) prods will be issued after 36 hours of inactivity. upon the 3rd prod your slot will be force replaced. failure to respond to a prod within 24 hours will result in being force replaced<br>\n13.)

The first is that &#8220;a vig is one of the possible role PMs.&#8221; Would you expect him to have claimed something that wasn&#8217;t a possible role PM?  His next reason is that no one CC&#8217;d but (1) its possible there is no vig (2) its possible someone is not willing to expose themself as the vig (Notice there are still a lot of votes on Monkey) and (3) we hadn&#8217;t heard from everyone yet so he couldn&#8217;t be sure there would not be a CC<br>\n<br>\nNext he says that I am trying to lynch Monkey or himself and not considering anyone else &#8211; do you want me to try to lynch someone I don&#8217;t have a scum-read on?

Seeing as he mentioned it twice, he really expresses his concern for people knowing. Secondly, if he really is the 2-shot vig, we should let him decide on his own shot for the night. (I have already expressed that I dislike a N1 vig shot, but he should be deciding this on his own.) If we try directing his kill, the mafia can use that to their advantage and direct their kill to be the same. Leaving us with no vig kill and believing he is lying. If he decides it on his own, then we'll know. Thirdly, because of the controversy behind what Monkey actually is, there is a good chance mafia will leave Monkey alive (whether he is town or scum) meaning we can use his shots on N2 when we have a lot more information, which will then confirm his role. Fourthly, if Monkey is scum and he left this as a breadcrumb (which doesn't make any sense... why would you plan on claiming vig) then he would have definitely brought up these posts by now, knowing that he left them behind.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSecond note, in TheTrollie's post:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4083501#p4083501\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4083501#p4083501\" data-post-id=\"4083501\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 319</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18443\">TheTrollie</a> wrote:</cite>U know what though.

Isn't that obvious? A scum would never CC a vig claim. There would be no benefit. If anything they would want to keep the vig around to shoot another overzealous townie. So what was it for? Seems like he was just trying to cover his tracks.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThirdly, TheTrollie's comment on neither Arugula nor Monkey going after each other is interesting. Although it seems they may have been doing that because they were too busy defending themselves/going after a more scummy player.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFourthly, SC has been the only other person to call Arugula, Veggie. In 314:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4083481#p4083481\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4083481#p4083481\" data-post-id=\"4083481\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 314</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15064\">Smooth Criminal</a> wrote:</cite>Until it's proven or disproven that he is the vig, I think we should move to lynch the next scummiest, which at this point is obviously veggie, or should I say Arugula.</div></blockquote><br>\nArugula was only called veggie once before, by TheTrollie. Could SC be more willing to call Arugula, Veggie, because that is what TheTrollie has been referring to him as in the QT?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYeah, these may be small things... but in Mafia, the details are a pretty big deal.

He has been agreeing with everybody and not really forming any opinion of his own. Someone brings up new information, and he changes his mind to agree with them. Not really scumhunting.

{"number": 716, "id": "4114734", "user": "Internet Stranger", "user_id": "77", "content": "The main points that I can find on Code:<br>\n<br>\n1) Picks me as his random vote (coincidence?)<br>\n2) Notice Code_X's posts. He hasnt been really hunting or looking for scum. He was clearly treading water on day one looking to see which way the wind blows and seeing which way the mislynch was going. This is what scum do to look useful while attempting to not provide any useless information for ISO's later.<br>\n<br>\nIts all in the vote counts. He is purposely parking votes in places where they wont do anything as an attempt to hide. They arent any sort of crusade against the people he votes for, that can clearly be read from his comments and useless, banal questions.<br>\n<br>\nDay 1 he is vote hopping all over the place. He is determined to avoid voting monkey when his wagon quickly swelled because his partners are probably already in the wagon (SC being one of them). He also certainly doesnt want to hammer or come close to it by this point and draw himself the extra attention, he is still trying to ride down the middle here. <br>\n<br>\nIts all right there in vote counts #8, #9, and #10. With #10 jumping onto the Trollie wagon at the #2 spot, which appears to be his favorite hiding spot after the Monkeyman claim was believed.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere is still no conviction or strong reason or case for switching to Trollie. He just found a good spot to park in and his buddy SC was planting the seed on trollie as a salvage operation. Of course after that Jee broke things wide open by putting down a proper case on Criminal (The only case seen in this game so far). By then there was no going back, Criminal had to die, so Code jumped on the wagon to avoid blatant distancing issues.<br>\n<br>\nDay 2, Code, using the seeds planted by Criminal the day before, conveniently has an excuse to park a vote on Trollie in his favorite hiding spot yet again, #2 on the wagon. This time he got to ride the express train to lynchville without having to do much work thanks to one diatribe and quick lynchy fingers by everyone else.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3, Same garbage again. No case, nothing to go on, but yet Code is AGAIN the #2 person on the wagon. This si far from a coincidence and appears to be heavily calculated. When pressed for a case on what I have supposedly done, he falters and breaks and starts backing down instead of presenting a case. He even backpedaled into defense mode, trying to put the burden of proof on me. Im kinda glad he did because these items convince me that Code absolutely HAS to be a scumbag.<br>\n<br>\nSo the connection between Code and Criminal lies with the now very dead Trollie.<br>\n<br>\nLooking at Dann's voting<br>\n<br>\nDay 1: he is riding Criminal's coattails onto Monkeyman the entire time. Once the claim happened, he jumps off, then sits back and joins Code to bus Criminal once Jee broke it open and the jig was up.<br>\n<br>\nDay 2: Day went so fast that apparently Dann didnt even get to participate in it. So nothing to go on there on Dann.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3: Seeing how Dann behaves all game (Day 1 and Day 3), Dann is clearly a follower taking the lead from his scum buddies. Hence his alignment with Criminal Day 1 and his alignment with Code on Day 3.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI like what im seeing here. Im definitely all for lynching Code now and Dann tomorrow.", "time": "Tue Jun 12, 2012 8:30 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22136&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "22136"}

This didn't convince me back then and still doesn't convince me now. Kondi/Dann is a very possible scumteam. Dann/Code on the other hand wouldn't be as likely, but Dann's last post feels like he's more defending Code than attacking IS. And then we have the unknown factor Iknal who could fit in any scumteam, although I kinda feel like if he would be scum, his scumbud would've made sure he would be replaced by now. IS is also not cleared, although I wouldn't know at all who his scumbud would be. (It would be hilarious if it was Iknal).</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nDetermined Dann?
