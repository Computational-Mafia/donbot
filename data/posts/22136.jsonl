If there is no majority at deadline, there will be no lynch for that day.<br>5.) game days have a deadline of 7 days.<br>6.) nights will be 24 hours maximum. Any night actions not submitted will simply not happen, although night actions may be submitted ahead of time.<br>7.) Do not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows you to.<br>8.) When you die, you are dead. Stay that way.<br>9.) Do not edit posts. Do not use invisible text. Do not use small text.<br>10.) Do not quote any communication from the mod (that includes PMs) in the game thread.<br>11.) If you are going to be gone for an extended period of time, please let me know.

There have been no mafia kills, no claims, no counterclaims that can help a vig decision.  At this point in the game, you have the worst possibility of hitting mafia. It's much more beneficial to use vig kills later in a game when there is more info and less people.

What would a Monkey flip tell us what others wouldn't?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4078357#p4078357\" class=\"postlink\">post 81</a>, TheTrollie wrote:</cite>RE:Post 26<br>Over-explaining.  Dann was being silly, his statement about bias was meaningless but monkey responded with a just as meaningless plug for himself as pro-town</div></blockquote>If it's meaningless, it's meaningless. You point out he was replying to a joke with a joke.<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RE:Post 39<br>Vague as to what he thinks would be dumb but as others said this sounds like Monkey\u2019s defense against dann bussing.  Even if dann isn\u2019t scum, if monkey were scum he would not want to be attached to any bussing claims.</div></blockquote>The bussing accusation was dumb. Accusing him of not wanting to be seen as bussed is dumb. What's his town motivation for wanting to be attached to bussing claims?<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RE:Post 41<br>When jee brings this up, calls monkey scum, monkey gets aggressive for the first time in the game.  His other posts are lighthearted and silly, but now he gets super defensive.</div></blockquote>He switched his playstyle and that was scummy? But not when you do it? Cool story, bro.<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RE:Post 46<br>Kondi references the reaction, monkey says don\u2019t PL me.  Very random, trying to cloud the reasoning against him and let it slide as a dumb PL decision when the scumread was well warranted.  <br><br>RE:Post 50<br>Again, now monkey jumps to self-voting as the reason kondi thinks he is scum.  Kondi referenced MM\u2019s reaction, not his stance on self-votes</div></blockquote>How was that even random? Monkey voted Smooth for self voting and interacted with a couple others. Kondi comes in and says \"Monkey's reaction was horrible.\" He doesn't specify if it had to do with the self-vote or something else, so it's interesting that considering how much you dislike vagueness, you're all over Monkey and not Kondi for failing to spell it out. Never mind Kondi later saying he could policy lynch Monkey, Monkey is the one clouding things by bringing up policy lynching.<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RE:Post 66<br>All of the sudden he states his support for the unvote argument.  Prior to this he posted that he thought the idea of bussing like that on D1 was dumb,  but he doesn\u2019t label dann scum for it until this post, after many other people started voting dann</div></blockquote>The fucking post you quoted here has Monkey saying the unvote argument indicates scumminess on Dann's part. \"All of the sudden he states his support?\" Christ, you're seriously just pulling it out your ass here."}

The first is that \u201ca vig is one of the possible role PMs.\u201d Would you expect him to have claimed something that wasn\u2019t a possible role PM?  His next reason is that no one CC\u2019d but (1) its possible there is no vig (2) its possible someone is not willing to expose themself as the vig (Notice there are still a lot of votes on Monkey) and (3) we hadn\u2019t heard from everyone yet so he couldn\u2019t be sure there would not be a CC<br><br>Next he says that I am trying to lynch Monkey or himself and not considering anyone else \u2013 do you want me to try to lynch someone I don\u2019t have a scum-read on?

I kept some notes along the way so I wouldn't forget. Here they are:<br>-----------<br>First of all, I believe Monkey's vig claim. After reading the thread knowing Monkey has claimed vig, I noticed this little interaction:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4081492#p4081492\" class=\"postlink\">post 160</a>, kondi2424 wrote:</cite>Vig kills are basically a second town-directed kill and should be treated as a second lynch.

Seeing as he mentioned it twice, he really expresses his concern for people knowing. Secondly, if he really is the 2-shot vig, we should let him decide on his own shot for the night. (I have already expressed that I dislike a N1 vig shot, but he should be deciding this on his own.) If we try directing his kill, the mafia can use that to their advantage and direct their kill to be the same. Leaving us with no vig kill and believing he is lying. If he decides it on his own, then we'll know. Thirdly, because of the controversy behind what Monkey actually is, there is a good chance mafia will leave Monkey alive (whether he is town or scum) meaning we can use his shots on N2 when we have a lot more information, which will then confirm his role. Fourthly, if Monkey is scum and he left this as a breadcrumb (which doesn't make any sense... why would you plan on claiming vig) then he would have definitely brought up these posts by now, knowing that he left them behind.<br><br><br><br>Second note, in TheTrollie's post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4083501#p4083501\" class=\"postlink\">post 319</a>, TheTrollie wrote:</cite>U know what though.

Isn't that obvious? A scum would never CC a vig claim. There would be no benefit. If anything they would want to keep the vig around to shoot another overzealous townie. So what was it for? Seems like he was just trying to cover his tracks.<br><br><br>Thirdly, TheTrollie's comment on neither Arugula nor Monkey going after each other is interesting. Although it seems they may have been doing that because they were too busy defending themselves/going after a more scummy player.<br><br><br>Fourthly, SC has been the only other person to call Arugula, Veggie. In 314:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4083481#p4083481\" class=\"postlink\">post 314</a>, Smooth Criminal wrote:</cite>Until it's proven or disproven that he is the vig, I think we should move to lynch the next scummiest, which at this point is obviously veggie, or should I say Arugula.</div></blockquote><br>Arugula was only called veggie once before, by TheTrollie. Could SC be more willing to call Arugula, Veggie, because that is what TheTrollie has been referring to him as in the QT?<br><br><br>Yeah, these may be small things... but in Mafia, the details are a pretty big deal. I'm just throwing these out there to create discussion/make some other people think.<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Now for people reads:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Smooth Criminal</span> - Super scummy. He has been agreeing with everybody and not really forming any opinion of his own. Someone brings up new information, and he changes his mind to agree with them. Not really scumhunting. Most recently in post 354, he sees my explanation of what could possibly happen if we directed a N1 vig shot, and instantly changes his mind.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">dicknose</span> - I like his posts. Seem to be overall town. Pointing out TvK for not hammering even though he said it would be an inevitable lynch was good, although TvK has a good response with 'he hasnt posted anything since his claim'.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">TvK</span> - Not sure. In post 403 he said:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4084609#p4084609\" class=\"postlink\">post 403</a>, TvK wrote:</cite>For Trollie and Arugula, and feeling more and more like you two are both town, even though desperately convinced that the other is scum.

Even if he did want to keep his role hidden, he should have kept his vote there.  I was looking out for people who could have been doing that (counterclaiming without claiming).

On the other hand, I do not think he is scum.<br><br>Possible reasons for his actions as I can see it:<br><br>(1) there has been a lot of talk about buddying and why that is scummy.  He may be worried about being accused of buddying like kondi was on me and thus wants to distance himself to show he isn\u2019t buddying hard. <br><br>I would like to note that I do not agree with the idea of buddying being inherently scummy.  I at least do not agree with it when the way we define budying is really just \u201cagreeing.\u201d  There are a lot of other reasons people might buddy.  They might be familiar with eachother from other games, they may have a strong townread on the person and therefore trust them, etc.  A voting bloc, for example, is a codified version of town buddying.  <br><br>(2) he feels I am likely to be lynched but he doesn\u2019t want to be lynched so he doesn\u2019t want our names to be associated. <br><br>(3) he is town, and is worried I might flip scum if I am lynched<br><br>If he is scum, he knows my alignment, and from my perspective would not want to distance himself from me.  He would likely want to be buddying up with me more in that case so that if he gets lynched and flips scum, I would be under a lot of heat the next day, and if I get lynched and flip town, he would not be under so much scrutiny (besides the possible WIFOM arguments).<br><br>I realize this logic doesn\u2019t work for anyone besides myself since it is contingent on you knowing my alignment.

IS is also not cleared, although I wouldn't know at all who his scumbud would be.

He hasnt been really hunting or looking for scum. He was clearly treading water on day one looking to see which way the wind blows and seeing which way the mislynch was going. This is what scum do to look useful while attempting to not provide any useless information for ISO's later.<br><br>Its all in the vote counts. He is purposely parking votes in places where they wont do anything as an attempt to hide. They arent any sort of crusade against the people he votes for, that can clearly be read from his comments and useless, banal questions.<br><br>Day 1 he is vote hopping all over the place. He is determined to avoid voting monkey when his wagon quickly swelled because his partners are probably already in the wagon (SC being one of them). He also certainly doesnt want to hammer or come close to it by this point and draw himself the extra attention, he is still trying to ride down the middle here. <br><br>Its all right there in vote counts #8, #9, and #10. With #10 jumping onto the Trollie wagon at the #2 spot, which appears to be his favorite hiding spot after the Monkeyman claim was believed.<br><br><br>There is still no conviction or strong reason or case for switching to Trollie. He just found a good spot to park in and his buddy SC was planting the seed on trollie as a salvage operation. Of course after that Jee broke things wide open by putting down a proper case on Criminal (The only case seen in this game so far). By then there was no going back, Criminal had to die, so Code jumped on the wagon to avoid blatant distancing issues.<br><br>Day 2, Code, using the seeds planted by Criminal the day before, conveniently has an excuse to park a vote on Trollie in his favorite hiding spot yet again, #2 on the wagon. This time he got to ride the express train to lynchville without having to do much work thanks to one diatribe and quick lynchy fingers by everyone else.<br><br>Day 3, Same garbage again. No case, nothing to go on, but yet Code is AGAIN the #2 person on the wagon. This si far from a coincidence and appears to be heavily calculated. When pressed for a case on what I have supposedly done, he falters and breaks and starts backing down instead of presenting a case. He even backpedaled into defense mode, trying to put the burden of proof on me. Im kinda glad he did because these items convince me that Code absolutely HAS to be a scumbag.<br><br>So the connection between Code and Criminal lies with the now very dead Trollie.<br><br>Looking at Dann's voting<br><br>Day 1: he is riding Criminal's coattails onto Monkeyman the entire time. Once the claim happened, he jumps off, then sits back and joins Code to bus Criminal once Jee broke it open and the jig was up.<br><br>Day 2: Day went so fast that apparently Dann didnt even get to participate in it. So nothing to go on there on Dann.<br><br>Day 3: Seeing how Dann behaves all game (Day 1 and Day 3), Dann is clearly a follower taking the lead from his scum buddies. Hence his alignment with Criminal Day 1 and his alignment with Code on Day 3.<br><br><br>I like what im seeing here. Im definitely all for lynching Code now and Dann tomorrow."}

This didn't convince me back then and still doesn't convince me now. Kondi/Dann is a very possible scumteam. Dann/Code on the other hand wouldn't be as likely, but Dann's last post feels like he's more defending Code than attacking IS. And then we have the unknown factor Iknal who could fit in any scumteam, although I kinda feel like if he would be scum, his scumbud would've made sure he would be replaced by now. IS is also not cleared, although I wouldn't know at all who his scumbud would be. (It would be hilarious if it was Iknal).</div></blockquote><br><br>Determined Dann? Are people's moods that important? I noticed that Arugula was acting agressive rather like I was/am now and nobody thought that was unusual. That was because people didn't like the way he was playing and thought him scummy (namely trollie), people don't seem to be going after scum like they should be, and I'm trying to figure out who is scum and prove it. <br><br>As far as I see, you're saying that I'm scummy because I'm \"Determined Dann\", funny, that never came up with \"Aggressive Arugula\".<br><br>Now for IS.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Looking at Dann's voting<br><br>Day 1: he is riding Criminal's coattails onto Monkeyman the entire time.

So nothing to go on there on Dann.<br><br>Day 3: Seeing how Dann behaves all game (Day 1 and Day 3), Dann is clearly a follower taking the lead from his scum buddies. Hence his alignment with Criminal Day 1 and his alignment with Code on Day 3.</div></blockquote><br><br>Day 1: In post #116 you voted Monkeyman and had the exact same views on the subject as SC, the EXACT same view. That both Monkey and I were scum, and then later SC flipped scum. In #259 you still believe that Monkey is scum all the way. In #448, IS claims that he doesn't has time to catch up right then, perhaps because he doesn't want to get involved with SC, his scum buddy? IS never gets the chance to talk about SC's lynch.<br><br>Day 2: Too fast.<br><br>Day 3: Er, all I've done on Day 3 is vote for IS, you are very quick to defend yourself.<br><br>My vote on IS stays."}
