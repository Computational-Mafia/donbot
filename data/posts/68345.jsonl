All rules from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> apply here too.<br>2. Don't directly quote any game-related PMs I've sent you. Paraphrasing is OK.<br>3. Don't intentionally obfuscate your messages; cryptography, tiny text, and the like are not allowed.<br>4. Provable randomness, such as dice tags, is banned.<br>5. Treat your fellow users with respect. As a cool guy on this site once said, \"Attack the play, not the player\".<br>6. Don't pretend to be the mod. <span style=\"color: purple\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Purple</span></span> is my color. Please don't use it.<br>7. Each in-game day will last 14 days and each in-game night will last 2 days.<br>8. Players that haven't posted with game-advancing content for 48 hours will be prodded. If a player is prodded and doesn't post within 24 hours of the prod, I will look for a replacement for that slot. If a player receives three prods, they will be replaced. If you're in V/LA, you are exempt from the above rules for the duration of your V/LA. You must announce the V/LA either in-thread or in a PM to me.<br>9. If a player is voted for by a majority (1/2 of the living players, rounded up), they are lynched and removed from the game. After a lynch, all living players may post until the thread is locked: this time is called Twilight.<br>10. Votes will be counted if they are placed by the vote tag or in bold, and are recognizable as votes. Don't abuse this rule for vote trickery. Examples of these votes:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Eggman</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Eggman</span><br>11. If a player wants to end the day without a lynch, they may vote for \"No Lynch\". If a majority votes for No Lynch, the night will start early. If there is no majority vote by the deadline, no lynch will take place that Day.<br>12. Every player will have a Role, dictating what they can do during the night, if anything. Here's a sample PM for the role \"Vanilla Townie\".<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">\"Role PM\"</legend>Welcome, Eggman!

Players with roles and factional abilities, if any, may use both at the same time.<br>14. If you die, you are allowed one \"Bah\" post. You may not say anything game-related in it.<br>15. If you have any questions about these rules, PM me and I'll answer them. <br>And last but not least, don't forget to have fun!"}

They tend to more so piggy-back off others and they much more prefer to subtly swing momentum towards a town lynch without having to make any personal statements as of why they think that player is scum.

Whenever I try something unconventional there is usually a bit of a stir. And what is left after a topic that people have taken stances on? Things to analyze of course!<br><br>What I normally see are people who:<br><br>1) try to convince me I'm misguided<br><br>2) White knight me<br><br>3) scum read me<br><br>4) Play along with me<br><br>5) Ignore me<br><br>Usually one member of the scum will take option 3 or option 2. The rest of the scum team will ignore me (5), or play along (4) depending on whether town had a positive or negative opinions on my opening. Alone I consider  (1), (4), and (5) to be null reads, but sometimes (1) is used in conjunction with 3 by a stronger scum player to try and get some sweet town cred for being a voice of skepticism, and getting the game moving via opposing stance. In the instance this happens though scum only created a light push on me, ultimately dropping me for somebody else. Scum who take option (2) are gonna town read me hard, and be staunchly against people who are throwing shade, also are ballzy scum players. This usually happens when one or more of their scum buddies choose option (4).  Scum who jump solely on option (3) are usually the more\u2026 let\u2019s say impulsive players that play largely on gut reads. Lastly I do take interest in players who start off doing (4), or (5), then switch with no rhyme or reason to the other. I don\u2019t have the experience data to tell if this is a scummy action, but my gut thinks it is.  <br><br>Looking over the roster I see CCC, Gamma, The Jester, Eagersnake and Manuel all voiced opinions. There is going to be one scum amongst them, possibly two if I\u2019m lucky. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">CCC </span>threw a piecemeal statement of encouragement, which is null. He could do that with either town or maf intent, and is not enough to speculate on. <br> <br>Out of all of them <span class=\"noboldsig\">Gamma</span> is easily the most scummy. How he offered to buddy somebody, then once my day start method came under fire he backs off making no mention of it again. So he in effect shifts from (4) to (5) with no explanation. Except that he, as scum, realized that what I was doing wasn\u2019t picking up, and The_Jester was vocally against it. So Gamma\u2019s reaction looks like scum realizing he isn\u2019t in popular opinion and trying to keep that he supported an unconventional idea out of public view. If Gamma is scum then Garry is town, scum don\u2019t buddy each other like that.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The Jester</span> is interesting. At first I thought that he could be scum, pulling the \u201c1\u201d and \u201c3\u201d. But once I asked him he said he wasn\u2019t actually scum reading me. So I feel pretty null about his slot. I do think it\u2019s interesting though that he didn\u2019t call out Gamma for trying to mimic a opening that he consider \u201cawful\u201d. Then again, I liked that Jester seemed willing to 1vs1 me, don\u2019t think scum would have done that. In the event that Jester is scum Manual is probably town, their interactions early don\u2019t look like scum + scum thread proper discussion. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">EagerSnake</span> is town. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">He filled out the correct documents, and has no felonies on his record. <br></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Manuel</span> looked like he might be a white knight at first, but he didn\u2019t keep the discussion going, and ultimately agreed that Jester had valid points. I think that in this instance him dropping it was more likely town then scum. Unlike Gamma Manuel didn\u2019t try to hide or ignore what he said. Of course The Jester questioned Manuel, and didn\u2019t pay attention to Gamma.  Which is why I have this vuage feeling that GammaxJester could be a thing. Also didn\u2019t see any ham fisted town reads being thrown my direction by Manuel. Light town read here. <br><br>Quick reads list for my Day start reaction analysis: <br><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Snake</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #80BF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">The_Jester, Manuel,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #FFBF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Gamma<br></span></span><br>Everybody else opted to not weigh in."}

And I pretty much know there are 3 mafia, because it's a 11 person game. Having a Serial Killer is like having an Independent Vigilante who has to eliminate everyone, not just the mafia. I also assume that because I don't want to have to worry about thinking we're safe to mislynch and then whoops, one extra mafia then I thought, we lose!

His responses, therefore, did not manage to alleviate even my original suspicions.<br><br>My perspective: Scum do scummy things more often than town do scummy things. Thus scummy things are scummy, even if townies do them too. People who deliberately play in a way that is scummy hurts the town should be lynched for it, repeatedly, until they stop.<br><br>Posting your honest opinions of things only helps the town. Partly because it helps us not misread you, partly because we can check for changes in opinion,  and partly so we can check for people who are avoiding expressing concrete suspicions. The only other side of this is when town hides their thoughts because they have the ulterior motive of gauging a reaction. This is sometimes useful, but should be retroactively explained."}

If the game needs more 'spice', as they claim, it would be lovely if they were to introduce that. Random reads with no explanations, an unwillingness to explain any of them at all on post #108, followed by a deflection towards the inactives in #130. If he is, as he claims, a man of few words, this makes sense. I might read a previous game or two to get a better read.<br><br>I like JaeReed's first few posts, although as others have pointed out the reaction tests had been exposed well before he entered the game properly. Engages well to make up for the relative lateness, and asks perceptive questions. This continues for the rest of the game up to this point. Leaning town.<br><br>I don't like the way Parama enters the game. Maybe that's just because their first few posts look far too serious for the RVS/immediately post-RVS stage, and their serious interpretation of posts made early in the game, but something about it rubs me up the wrong way. Remark on post #141 is particularly annoying ('why do you care about jaereed's post 8 townreads') since they're happy enough to read into something as early as post #2. Reading later into the game, however, I'm beginning to like the content of their posts a little more, if not their tone.<br><br>Dunnstral I'm null-leaning-town on. Early game comments are useful, but then there's a fairly confusing mess about misinterpretations with KittenLicks later on. This reads as town on town to me, not least because they both seem to be working in the same direction and some of the disagreement is about theory rather than just comments. Later posts clear up confusion and serve to focus the conversation where it might otherwise have gone somewhere less promising. <br><br>BDT6_Maker we have almost nothing on. Half of their posts are excuses for not posting. I don't like this. Seconding calls for a replacement if they can't give the game the attention it deserves. I don't like post #325, however. Nothing about the post he's quoting demands a response calling attention to roles.<br><br>GreyIce and thenewearth are both recent entrants and I have little on them as of right now, although I'm not a fan of the latter's attacks on KittenLicks. P-EDIT: really not a fan.<br><br>I'm not all that convinced by the case on Kitten. The discussion of the circle mechanic is null, especially since it occupied other players such as Dunnstral and Creature, the former of whom doesn't appear in thenewearth's suspect list. I don't think post #26 is rolefishing either, since Kitten attempted to shut down discussion before (and does it again in this post). If anything, this exchange just reflects badly on GuiltyLion, who not only keeps asking about something it's clear might be damaging, but then goes on to talk about potential PR claims in post #23, which is far more rolefish-y. I generally like Kitten's posts, so I'm leaning town here too.<br><br>I do, however, agree with Dunnstral's assessment of Clumsy Phoenix's early posts. Post #45 is a little scummy; it seems needlessly preoccupied, given there's only a couple of votes on Clumsy Phoenix, with proving their own innocence, and it isn't actually doing anything. It takes until post #81 for them to start being proactive (and even then there's a reference to them being not scum), and then in their next post, #83, we return to the introspection. Incidentally, the first time I read the whole 'any response I make will look scummy' thing, I thought it could be frustrated town, but the reiteration in their most recent post gives me the opposite impression.<br><br>Here's the problem with your statement: you're not playing to it. I agree with the sentiment, explaining yourself clearly and moving on is a good thing to do, but you keep returning to the issue (and there have been several issues) all the while reminding us of what you're (not) doing and how it's actually town behaviour (or, at least, how any behaviour you could engage in is scummy, so you're not scum).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Clumsy Phoenix</span><br><br>There was unsurprisingly a lot to read, so if anyone wants clarification or more detail, just ask.</div></blockquote>"}

I was leaning town on Jester at that time.<br><br>Finally caught up ill give a readlist and explain later what i think about House vs. CCC<br><br>Town:<br>Grendel: His posts feel honest and he is actively scumhunting. He is pushing his scumread and trys to convince others while not making up things.<br>House: He explained his scumread on CCC very well and started pushing him. He wasnt scared of changing his read on me when confronted. Also liked how he questioned Gamma.<br>Victor: Leaning town on him. I liked his reaction to Squares posts. I think he misunderstood my post about Square. I dont remember seeing something that felt scummy from him.<br>Huntress: Also townleaning. She replaced and didnt have much content since then but i liked her questions and reads. <br><br>Null:<br>Gerry: Still have no real read on Gerry but i am leaning more town then scum. I would like to see more from him a readlsit would be nice.<br>Square: As i said i dont like his playstyle mainly because its easy to play the same way as scum. His argument against Eager was good but as i said before it was awkward that he only referred to the Rhazh analysis.<br>Gamma: Didnt like his early game but he was pushed and probably got very defensive because of that. His read on Square is bad but i can understand why he feels that way. The situation with Huntress and House could have been him trying to buddy Huntress. Not reading him town but i wouldnt lynch him today.<br><br>Scum:<br>CCC: Leaning slight Scum here. Most of Houses arguments were true but looking at each of them individually they seem rather minor and most of them can be explained with a lot of self doubt which he showed right from the start. Also his discussion with House felt better towards the end.<br>Jester: His only real content was the explanation why he doesnt like Grendels play. He said all his scumreads are lynchbait but couldnt explain why when asked. On top of that he only scumread players that were talked about being scummy. For me this is scum trying to get on a lynchtrain from someone else while not confronting anyone himself. His townread on Square feels fake.<br>Eager: His vote on square was very bad with an even worse argument about his meta were he didnt mention that square always playes that way.<br>After that it felt like he was scared of backing down and pushed it further with silly reasoning like in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8323778#p8323778\">279 </a>where he mentions Square using his meta as a defense when eager himself was the one bringing up his meta.<br><br>House vs. CCC:<br>I dont want to talk to much about this because its already a lot to read for everyone.<br>House has good points some i noticed but and some i missed like the argument about the readslist. I only disagree with the one about conflicts beeing good.<br>As long as both sides still consider the other one might be town and listen to their arguments open minded even a TvT conflict can help town.<br><br>For now i am happy with my vote where it is.<br>@House what are your thoughts on The_Jester? and would you consider lynching Eager or him today instead of CCC?"}

I don\u2019t see as much of that here. He doesn\u2019t seem nearly as interested in catching scum. Typically players that use analytical means of finding scum make it apparent that their really into the game even if their methods are questionable. CCC hasn\u2019t done much statistical break downs on players this game like he had in 1727. Many of his posts this game are him defending himself, and while he had some early game passive scum hunting going on he hasn\u2019t been hunting lately. The best he has done was dropping an occasional reads list. I\u2019m bothered that CCC referenced Arctic, which is a lot more reflective of this game here then 1727, 1727 showed me that CCC, sans his speech, isn\u2019t a bad player.<br><br> So CCC referencing the lesser of his two games first and foremost as what to meta him by, and the other as an afterthought is\u2026 not what I was hoping to find.

I found he was lying about how quickly he gains reads, so I brought it up.

Getting yourself lynched as town cannot possibly help the town more than staying alive and trying to contribute would.<br>The latter is better because... <br>(a) If the town thinks you're scummy, you get lynched anyways, but you contributed more and more importantly you made the scum work harder to get you lynched, which gives the town extra information. <br>(b) If the town doesn't think you're scummy, you're much better off staying alive.

Lynching them is good for the town. <br>2) They are town. <br>- 2a) They have a protown reason for being lynched. Lynching them is good for the town. <br>- 2b) They don't have a protown reason for being lynched, and so are playing against their own win condition.<br><br>4. Asking to be lynched/killed.(Seen VT do this. Sorry.) See above.<br><br>5. Censoring their own posts.(Clarify please) \"I was gonna do/say X but I thought it might look scummy, so I didn't do it.\" Intentionally trying to avoid scum tells as town usually just ends up making you look scummier. Usually, though, people trying to avoid scum tells (censoring their own posts) are just scum.<br><br>6. Changing role claim.(I thought of claiming tracker when I was cop in Matrix6 to fish a mafia Roleblocker. Nope) There are occasions that town do this as a gambit, like you did, but scum will do it more often if their claim ends up not fitting with the setup and they catch scrutiny for it. I've seen scum change their claim much more often than town, and I think it's horrible that people let them get away with it.<br><br>Obviously nothing is \"only scum do X,\" but rather, \"scum do X more often than town do.\"</div></div></div>"}

I could assume that you think Gerry is Null and Rhazh is slight scumlean but you never said that.<br><br>Why do you like that he isnt pushing his read on Rhazh?</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>Manuel says that he dislikes Squares play style, but doesn\u2019t see it as a reason to lynch him. Then directly after throws out a line about how weird it was that Square criticized Eager for his analysis on Razh but not on Eager\u2019s other analysis. It looked like he might have been trying to tie Square and Rhazbash together for some reason. Then in his next post it looked like pairing Rhaz and Eager together. Looking at it now it may have been some scum team pairing, and POE, but at the time reading through the lines made it look more like he is tying Rhaz to people. I also thought that that line about Eager being vague about his reads was weird when Square wasn't explaining his  scum reads and Manuel said that shouldn't be a reason to lynch someone. <br><br>In later posts he acts suspicious of Jester in 314 for town reading Square while ignoring Victor\u2019s town read on Square. He so he seemed to have more of an opinion on the alignment of the people town reading Square then scum reading Square. IMO if Manuel thought that Square was possible mislynch he\u2019d have been more concerned about those scum reading Square then those town reading him. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8338576#p8338576\" class=\"postlink\">post 189</a>, Manuel87 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8337592#p8337592\" class=\"postlink\">post 160</a>, Grendel wrote:</cite>Do you like/dislike anything else in 102?</div></blockquote><br>I generally dont like when ppl say \"there are 1-2 scum in this group of people\" when the group they are talking about is exactly 50% of the players (self not included)<br>Which in return means he also thinks there are 1-2 scum in the other group.<br><br>@RhazhBashu: would you mind answering my question in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8331074#p8331074\">92</a></div></blockquote><br><br>I forgot to mention this one, but yeah I didn\u2019t like it either.

You make it seem like I was about to hammer him. <br>3.4) So you're pretty much blamining me for you changing your vote from eager to square????? WHen You fos'd him too? THAT is your argument? That I made you change YOUR vote, so I am scum. Even though I appealed to EVERYONE to vote square?? That's such bad logic, which is why I am pretty sure you have to be mafia. How would town have shit logic like that?? <br><br>Also, I fos'd House's slot, before he switched in, and then house was more townie than Rzarh or w/e his name was. Which is why I tr him.

I did say I liked the case on CCC, but I also said I liked the responses that CCC gave, so you blatantly just lied and left that part out to try and make me look scummy.<br>2.)Like I said, I was thinking about hammering Manuel, but I never did because I wanted square instead, so that logic is bad by you. You make it seem like I was about to hammer him. <br>3.4) So you're pretty much blamining me for you changing your vote from eager to square????? WHen You fos'd him too? THAT is your argument? That I made you change YOUR vote, so I am scum. Even though I appealed to EVERYONE to vote square?? That's such bad logic, which is why I am pretty sure you have to be mafia. How would town have shit logic like that?? </div></blockquote><br><br>1) You liked the case and responses. I saw that but I don't see why that's relevent. Fencesit is fencesit. If you liked the case you should have been prepared to vote him. Did you try to derail, no. I don't see it. If you want to quote where you fought the CCC wagon (beyond meekly saying let's lynch Square World) show me?<br><br>2) Alright on closer reflection perhaps your right. One question though, why do you assume this is bad logic rather than me being scummy? You think I'm scum so why not accuse me of lying. A slip perhaps?<br><br>3) ?????<br><br>4) We already discussed this. Eager was the likely wagon going to completion. I'll admit I shouldn't have changed but I hold my hands up to that. There is a lot of scum value in splitting the wagons at that point and getting split if you thought you could get a Manuel lynch instead and still get towncred of not being the wagon. If you had a second buddy on the Manuel wagon it's also likely you would want to stay off rather than hammer yourself.

In particular how he refuses to consider anything before the fifth page as helpful in finding peoples alignments. He went on the restate this when I posted my analysis, (47 and 109). Then when I pointed out that me pulling reads out of what he called \u201cnullness\u201d would in fact be reason to suspect me. (167) He didn\u2019t disagree, he even said that somebody posting in-depth reads using the first three pages of a mafia game is suspect, but he avoided calling me scummy for it. Instead he opted to stay on Rhazhbash because he was, \u201cmuch worse\u201d. <br><br>He then goes on to town read me while giving little back bone as to why. I later asked for more elaboration to this and his response was that he town read me because of what I had done up to that point. He does this without actually saying what I done that is townie. His town read on me is vague. Keeping me as his top town read most of D1 without directly saying what about me is town, (and no I\u2019m not counting the\u201d everything about you is town\u201d thing), making that read look really contrived. It wasn\u2019t until his read list at post 679 that he said it was mainly that my scum hunting looked genuine. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\u2026 BUT </span>I actually didn\u2019t find his suspsions of Square to be bad though. Gerry could definite have been pushing that wagon with town intentions. Square read\u2019s were riddled with contradictions. Which many people see as scummy, and can be scummy. (828 &amp; 888). His scum read on victor today looks good too. <br><br>Looking into other games Gerry had played on site I think that he is likely town here. Looking at Machiavellian mafia I saw that Gerry is crazy good at distancing his scum buddies. TO the point that it looked like he was getting into a personal affront with his scum buddy Maria. The back an forth between Gerry and Victor at the start of the day look way too weak to be scum Gerry, and Victor. Gerry also doesn\u2019t make sense with Gamma\u2019s buddying yesterday.

Also Why is Victor trying to shift blame away from himself? As town I typically acknowledge once I realize I made a bad choice instead of projecting my decisions onto another player. :/ <br><br>Side note, I don\u2019t think Victor and CCC would be scum together. Looking at 1086 Victor lays a town read at CCC\u2019s feet right after CCC names him off as probscum.

Prior probabilities I can estimate (if we assume two remaining scum, out of nine players, then 22.22% is a good guess for prior probability), but the others are harder."}

In particular how he refuses to consider anything before the fifth page as helpful in finding peoples alignments. He went on the restate this when I posted my analysis, (47 and 109). Then when I pointed out that me pulling reads out of what he called \u201cnullness\u201d would in fact be reason to suspect me. (167) He didn\u2019t disagree, he even said that somebody posting in-depth reads using the first three pages of a mafia game is suspect, but he avoided calling me scummy for it. Instead he opted to stay on Rhazhbash because he was, \u201cmuch worse\u201d. <br><br>He then goes on to town read me while giving little back bone as to why. I later asked for more elaboration to this and his response was that he town read me because of what I had done up to that point. He does this without actually saying what I done that is townie. His town read on me is vague. Keeping me as his top town read most of D1 without directly saying what about me is town, (and no I\u2019m not counting the\u201d everything about you is town\u201d thing), making that read look really contrived. It wasn\u2019t until his read list at post 679 that he said it was mainly that my scum hunting looked genuine. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\u2026 BUT </span>I actually didn\u2019t find his suspsions of Square to be bad though. Gerry could definite have been pushing that wagon with town intentions. Square read\u2019s were riddled with contradictions. Which many people see as scummy, and can be scummy. (828 &amp; 888). His scum read on victor today looks good too. <br><br>Looking into other games Gerry had played on site I think that he is likely town here. Looking at Machiavellian mafia I saw that Gerry is crazy good at distancing his scum buddies. TO the point that it looked like he was getting into a personal affront with his scum buddy Maria. The back an forth between Gerry and Victor at the start of the day look way too weak to be scum Gerry, and Victor. Gerry also doesn\u2019t make sense with Gamma\u2019s buddying yesterday. With Gerry not matching either proposed scum team I\u2019d say he is town.</div></div></div> </div></blockquote><br><br>thank you for the compliment on my scum game, i'm flattered lol. But, thank you for finally realizing my reasons. This is why I don't think victor is town because my reasons for pushing on square were legit (and he did too) yet now he's trying to say that my vote on him is now the reason?? even though he voted me before i voted him lol"}

I'm still baffled by the fuss House made over my not voting him when I finished my original catch up. From the rest of Day one I did get the feeling that he wasn't quite so interested in lynching CCC as he made out to be, but that's a bit subjective. He didn't use the role he claimed to have to protect Square, so we didn't get the benefit of at least one action from the JOAT.  In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375905#p8375905\">1431</a> he renewed the briefly stalled lynch against the uncounterclaimed watcher instead of waiting for an explanation re: the use of the word \"blue\" (and was promptly sheeped by Gamma and Jester).<br><br>The only sticking point is the push on eager but I guess it boils down to this: I don't believe House's bodyguard claim. I don't like the way he was calling for a doctor to claim, or suggesting there might be another protective role, and I think if he was really town with that role he would have waited until the game was over before making an MD thread about it. There was no reason for him to claim when he did (shortly after making that thread), and risk attracting the nk, when his whole reason for not protecting Square was that he thought he was more valuable than him, in which case it would have been better to keep silent about any role.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: House</span>"}
