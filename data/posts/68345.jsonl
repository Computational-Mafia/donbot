All rules from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> apply here too.<br>\n2. Don't directly quote any game-related PMs I've sent you. Paraphrasing is OK.<br>\n3. Don't intentionally obfuscate your messages; cryptography, tiny text, and the like are not allowed.<br>\n4. Provable randomness, such as dice tags, is banned.<br>\n5. Treat your fellow users with respect. As a cool guy on this site once said, \"Attack the play, not the player\".<br>\n6. Don't pretend to be the mod. <div style=\"display:inline;color:purple\">Purple</div> is my color. Please don't use it.<br>\n7. Each in-game day will last 14 days and each in-game night will last 2 days.<br>\n8. Players that haven't posted with game-advancing content for 48 hours will be prodded. If a player is prodded and doesn't post within 24 hours of the prod, I will look for a replacement for that slot. If a player receives three prods, they will be replaced. If you're in V/LA, you are exempt from the above rules for the duration of your V/LA. You must announce the V/LA either in-thread or in a PM to me.<br>\n9. If a player is voted for by a majority (1/2 of the living players, rounded up), they are lynched and removed from the game. After a lynch, all living players may post until the thread is locked: this time is called Twilight.<br>\n10. Votes will be counted if they are placed by the vote tag or in bold, and are recognizable as votes. Don't abuse this rule for vote trickery. Examples of these votes:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Eggman</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Eggman</div><br>\n11. If a player wants to end the day without a lynch, they may vote for \"No Lynch\". If a majority votes for No Lynch, the night will start early. If there is no majority vote by the deadline, no lynch will take place that Day.<br>\n12. Every player will have a Role, dictating what they can do during the night, if anything. Here's a sample PM for the role \"Vanilla Townie\".<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Role PM</legend>Welcome, Eggman!

Players with roles and factional abilities, if any, may use both at the same time.<br>\n14. If you die, you are allowed one \"Bah\" post. You may not say anything game-related in it.<br>\n15. If you have any questions about these rules, PM me and I'll answer them. <br>\nAnd last but not least, don't forget to have fun!", "time": "Sun Sep 11, 2016 2:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}

Do you know how when you start up a conversation with someone or call them out for something (something weak, not something that's damning) and you are trying to determine if it came from scum or town? Well when conversing with him I got this strong feeling I was engaged in a TvT and I didn't peg a scum, so I decided to end it before it blew up. I was hoping I pegged a scum but I don't think I did..

Whenever I try something unconventional there is usually a bit of a stir. And what is left after a topic that people have taken stances on? Things to analyze of course!<br>\n<br>\nWhat I normally see are people who:<br>\n<br>\n1) try to convince me I'm misguided<br>\n<br>\n2) White knight me<br>\n<br>\n3) scum read me<br>\n<br>\n4) Play along with me<br>\n<br>\n5) Ignore me<br>\n<br>\nUsually one member of the scum will take option 3 or option 2. The rest of the scum team will ignore me (5), or play along (4) depending on whether town had a positive or negative opinions on my opening. Alone I consider  (1), (4), and (5) to be null reads, but sometimes (1) is used in conjunction with 3 by a stronger scum player to try and get some sweet town cred for being a voice of skepticism, and getting the game moving via opposing stance. In the instance this happens though scum only created a light push on me, ultimately dropping me for somebody else. Scum who take option (2) are gonna town read me hard, and be staunchly against people who are throwing shade, also are ballzy scum players. This usually happens when one or more of their scum buddies choose option (4).  Scum who jump solely on option (3) are usually the more&#8230; let&#8217;s say impulsive players that play largely on gut reads. Lastly I do take interest in players who start off doing (4), or (5), then switch with no rhyme or reason to the other. I don&#8217;t have the experience data to tell if this is a scummy action, but my gut thinks it is.  <br>\n<br>\nLooking over the roster I see CCC, Gamma, The Jester, Eagersnake and Manuel all voiced opinions. There is going to be one scum amongst them, possibly two if I&#8217;m lucky. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">CCC </div>threw a piecemeal statement of encouragement, which is null. He could do that with either town or maf intent, and is not enough to speculate on. <br>\n <br>\nOut of all of them <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gamma</div> is easily the most scummy. How he offered to buddy somebody, then once my day start method came under fire he backs off making no mention of it again. So he in effect shifts from (4) to (5) with no explanation. Except that he, as scum, realized that what I was doing wasn&#8217;t picking up, and The_Jester was vocally against it. So Gamma&#8217;s reaction looks like scum realizing he isn&#8217;t in popular opinion and trying to keep that he supported an unconventional idea out of public view. If Gamma is scum then Garry is town, scum don&#8217;t buddy each other like that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The Jester</div> is interesting. At first I thought that he could be scum, pulling the &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;3&#8221;. But once I asked him he said he wasn&#8217;t actually scum reading me. So I feel pretty null about his slot. I do think it&#8217;s interesting though that he didn&#8217;t call out Gamma for trying to mimic a opening that he consider &#8220;awful&#8221;. Then again, I liked that Jester seemed willing to 1vs1 me, don&#8217;t think scum would have done that. In the event that Jester is scum Manual is probably town, their interactions early don&#8217;t look like scum + scum thread proper discussion. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">EagerSnake</div> is town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">He filled out the correct documents, and has no felonies on his record. <br>\n</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Manuel</div> looked like he might be a white knight at first, but he didn&#8217;t keep the discussion going, and ultimately agreed that Jester had valid points. I think that in this instance him dropping it was more likely town then scum. Unlike Gamma Manuel didn&#8217;t try to hide or ignore what he said. Of course The Jester questioned Manuel, and didn&#8217;t pay attention to Gamma.  Which is why I have this vuage feeling that GammaxJester could be a thing.

I expect to find that, of newbie games (with two scum out of nine players), less than two in nine games have scum lynched on day one. (If the lynches were random, it would be two in nine, but by and large scum will usually try to get town lynched, and on day one I expect that to skew the ratio against Town).<br>\n<br>\nI guess I am pessimistic about day one.

That said games aren't won on day 1. What's important on day 1 is getting that everyone contributes to that all important first lynch. It doesn't have to be well informed (as town's don't have a lot of info) but it in itself provides info in later days.<br>\n<br>\nIf we get a scumflip today that's great. But if we get a townflip, oh well. You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. As long as players were some actively involved in said flips (i.e. who pushed, who defended etc) we can move forward. <br>\n<br>\nHowever if we all sit around saying, day 1 is random, everything is null etc then we don't have anything to work off on Day 2. In fact I'd say that we simply quickly scum we no real discussion it would put us in a worse position that if we had a long day of arguments and competing wagons which resulted in a townflip.", "time": "Fri Sep 16, 2016 8:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}

Like I said, I have a policy of not accepting metagame defenses that allow people to get away with always being scummy. His responses, therefore, did not manage to alleviate even my original suspicions.<br>\n<br>\nMy perspective: Scum do scummy things more often than town do scummy things. Thus scummy things are scummy, even if townies do them too. People who deliberately play in a way that is scummy hurts the town should be lynched for it, repeatedly, until they stop.<br>\n<br>\nPosting your honest opinions of things only helps the town. Partly because it helps us not misread you, partly because we can check for changes in opinion,  and partly so we can check for people who are avoiding expressing concrete suspicions. The only other side of this is when town hides their thoughts because they have the ulterior motive of gauging a reaction.

Remark on post #141 is particularly annoying ('why do you care about jaereed's post 8 townreads') since they're happy enough to read into something as early as post #2. Reading later into the game, however, I'm beginning to like the content of their posts a little more, if not their tone.<br>\n<br>\nDunnstral I'm null-leaning-town on. Early game comments are useful, but then there's a fairly confusing mess about misinterpretations with KittenLicks later on. This reads as town on town to me, not least because they both seem to be working in the same direction and some of the disagreement is about theory rather than just comments. Later posts clear up confusion and serve to focus the conversation where it might otherwise have gone somewhere less promising. <br>\n<br>\nBDT6_Maker we have almost nothing on. Half of their posts are excuses for not posting. I don't like this. Seconding calls for a replacement if they can't give the game the attention it deserves. I don't like post #325, however. Nothing about the post he's quoting demands a response calling attention to roles.<br>\n<br>\nGreyIce and thenewearth are both recent entrants and I have little on them as of right now, although I'm not a fan of the latter's attacks on KittenLicks. P-EDIT: really not a fan.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not all that convinced by the case on Kitten. The discussion of the circle mechanic is null, especially since it occupied other players such as Dunnstral and Creature, the former of whom doesn't appear in thenewearth's suspect list. I don't think post #26 is rolefishing either, since Kitten attempted to shut down discussion before (and does it again in this post). If anything, this exchange just reflects badly on GuiltyLion, who not only keeps asking about something it's clear might be damaging, but then goes on to talk about potential PR claims in post #23, which is far more rolefish-y. I generally like Kitten's posts, so I'm leaning town here too.<br>\n<br>\nI do, however, agree with Dunnstral's assessment of Clumsy Phoenix's early posts. Post #45 is a little scummy; it seems needlessly preoccupied, given there's only a couple of votes on Clumsy Phoenix, with proving their own innocence, and it isn't actually doing anything. It takes until post #81 for them to start being proactive (and even then there's a reference to them being not scum), and then in their next post, #83, we return to the introspection. Incidentally, the first time I read the whole 'any response I make will look scummy' thing, I thought it could be frustrated town, but the reiteration in their most recent post gives me the opposite impression.<br>\n<br>\nHere's the problem with your statement: you're not playing to it. I agree with the sentiment, explaining yourself clearly and moving on is a good thing to do, but you keep returning to the issue (and there have been several issues) all the while reminding us of what you're (not) doing and how it's actually town behaviour (or, at least, how any behaviour you could engage in is scummy, so you're not scum).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Clumsy Phoenix</div><br>\n<br>\nThere was unsurprisingly a lot to read, so if anyone wants clarification or more detail, just ask.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Sun Sep 18, 2016 7:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}

He wasnt scared of changing his read on me when confronted. Also liked how he questioned Gamma.<br>\nVictor: Leaning town on him. I liked his reaction to Squares posts. I think he misunderstood my post about Square. I dont remember seeing something that felt scummy from him.<br>\nHuntress: Also townleaning. She replaced and didnt have much content since then but i liked her questions and reads. <br>\n<br>\nNull:<br>\nGerry: Still have no real read on Gerry but i am leaning more town then scum. I would like to see more from him a readlsit would be nice.<br>\nSquare: As i said i dont like his playstyle mainly because its easy to play the same way as scum. His argument against Eager was good but as i said before it was awkward that he only referred to the Rhazh analysis.<br>\nGamma: Didnt like his early game but he was pushed and probably got very defensive because of that. His read on Square is bad but i can understand why he feels that way. The situation with Huntress and House could have been him trying to buddy Huntress. Not reading him town but i wouldnt lynch him today.<br>\n<br>\nScum:<br>\nCCC: Leaning slight Scum here. Most of Houses arguments were true but looking at each of them individually they seem rather minor and most of them can be explained with a lot of self doubt which he showed right from the start. Also his discussion with House felt better towards the end.<br>\nJester: His only real content was the explanation why he doesnt like Grendels play. He said all his scumreads are lynchbait but couldnt explain why when asked. On top of that he only scumread players that were talked about being scummy. For me this is scum trying to get on a lynchtrain from someone else while not confronting anyone himself. His townread on Square feels fake.<br>\nEager: His vote on square was very bad with an even worse argument about his meta were he didnt mention that square always playes that way.<br>\nAfter that it felt like he was scared of backing down and pushed it further with silly reasoning like in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8323778#p8323778\">279 </a>where he mentions Square using his meta as a defense when eager himself was the one bringing up his meta.<br>\n<br>\nHouse vs. CCC:<br>\nI dont want to talk to much about this because its already a lot to read for everyone.<br>\nHouse has good points some i noticed but and some i missed like the argument about the readslist. I only disagree with the one about conflicts beeing good.<br>\nAs long as both sides still consider the other one might be town and listen to their arguments open minded even a TvT conflict can help town.<br>\n<br>\nFor now i am happy with my vote where it is.<br>\n@House what are your thoughts on The_Jester? and would you consider lynching Eager or him today instead of CCC?", "time": "Thu Sep 22, 2016 1:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}

Making judgements about how you yourself would play as scum. This is WIFOM. When you make judgements about how someone else would play as scum, that's scumhunting. When you make judgements about how you yourself would play as scum, that's WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\n2. Aggressively defending themselves. An aggressive defense says that you're more worried about not being lynched than about finding scum.<br>\n<br>\n3. Lying. Comes from scum more often than town. Town have exceptions for doing it, but usually they don't do it right and end up getting lynched for it. Scum have more motive to lie than town, usually.<br>\n<br>\n4. Stating will post later. This is in reference to when they are close to being lynched but they state something like \"Oh wait I have a awesome post I'm making but it will have to come later.\" This comes from scum more often than town, but town does it on occasion. It's stalling.<br>\n<br>\n5. Expressing confusion. Expression confusion is scummy. Townies are normally confused at the start of the game, scum are more surprised when they're confused. If townies are normally confused at the start of the game, then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">they will find that unremarkable</div> and not mention it. Whereas scum will find it unusual, and they'll want to emphasize it to seem more town, so they point it out.<br>\n<br>\n6. Why me? This comes from scum more often than town.

I hardly ever see townies do that. <br>\nTown Thought Process: \"Hey, it would be really funny if I said I'm a cop as a joke here. Wait, someone might think I'm serious.

Self-voting.(Self hammering, sure.) This one deserves it's own post. Getting yourself lynched as town cannot possibly help the town more than staying alive and trying to contribute would.<br>\nThe latter is better because... <br>\n(a) If the town thinks you're scummy, you get lynched anyways, but you contributed more and more importantly you made the scum work harder to get you lynched, which gives the town extra information. <br>\n(b) If the town doesn't think you're scummy, you're much better off staying alive. Dying not only deprives the town of one pro-town voice, it also takes the scum one step closer to their win condition. Getting yourself lynched when you wouldn't have been otherwise is an \"own goal.\"<br>\n(c) Even if you think you're going to be lynched, you can't be certain until the actual lynch, so you should keep playing to give the town a chance to come to its senses and decide not to lynch you. <br>\n<br>\nGiven the above, there are only three reasons someone could want to actually self-hammer: <br>\n(a) They are scum trying to cut off discussion or support a bus. <br>\n(b) They are a noob who doesn't know any better. <br>\n(c) They are a self-centered jerk who thinks that if the game isn't going the way they want, they should just take their ball and go home.<br>\n<br>\nIf someone asks to be lynched, there are a few possibilities: <br>\n1) They are scum. Lynching them is good for the town. <br>\n2) They are town. <br>\n- 2a) They have a protown reason for being lynched. Lynching them is good for the town. <br>\n- 2b) They don't have a protown reason for being lynched, and so are playing against their own win condition.<br>\n<br>\n4. Asking to be lynched/killed.(Seen VT do this. Sorry.) See above.<br>\n<br>\n5. Censoring their own posts.(Clarify please) \"I was gonna do/say X but I thought it might look scummy, so I didn't do it.\" Intentionally trying to avoid scum tells as town usually just ends up making you look scummier. Usually, though, people trying to avoid scum tells (censoring their own posts) are just scum.<br>\n<br>\n6. Changing role claim.(I thought of claiming tracker when I was cop in Matrix6 to fish a mafia Roleblocker. Nope) There are occasions that town do this as a gambit, like you did, but scum will do it more often if their claim ends up not fitting with the setup and they catch scrutiny for it. I've seen scum change their claim much more often than town, and I think it's horrible that people let them get away with it.<br>\n<br>\nObviously nothing is \"only scum do X,\" but rather, \"scum do X more often than town do.\"</div></div></div>", "time": "Fri Sep 23, 2016 2:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}

This is obvious if you are reading the post. Some people do it different, where they link the post number and then put their thoughts on that post next to the number. I could do that, but that's not the way I did it that time.</div></blockquote>\nYes but why bother to summarise what he posted when you dont tell us your thoughts on those posts but only your over all read on him?<br>\nAlso your post summary on Victor has only on short comment on you liking him not pushing his scumread on Rhazh.<br>\nBut in all 3 i see no real read from you. I could assume that you think Gerry is Null and Rhazh is slight scumlean but you never said that.<br>\n<br>\nWhy do you like that he isnt pushing his read on Rhazh?</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nManuel says that he dislikes Squares play style, but doesn&#8217;t see it as a reason to lynch him. Then directly after throws out a line about how weird it was that Square criticized Eager for his analysis on Razh but not on Eager&#8217;s other analysis. It looked like he might have been trying to tie Square and Rhazbash together for some reason. Then in his next post it looked like pairing Rhaz and Eager together. Looking at it now it may have been some scum team pairing, and POE, but at the time reading through the lines made it look more like he is tying Rhaz to people. I also thought that that line about Eager being vague about his reads was weird when Square wasn't explaining his  scum reads and Manuel said that shouldn't be a reason to lynch someone. <br>\n<br>\nIn later posts he acts suspicious of Jester in 314 for town reading Square while ignoring Victor&#8217;s town read on Square. He so he seemed to have more of an opinion on the alignment of the people town reading Square then scum reading Square. IMO if Manuel thought that Square was possible mislynch he&#8217;d have been more concerned about those scum reading Square then those town reading him. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8338576#p8338576\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8338576#p8338576\" data-post-id=\"8338576\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 189</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27851\">Manuel87</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8337592#p8337592\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8337592#p8337592\" data-post-id=\"8337592\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 160</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27626\">Grendel</a> wrote:</cite>\nDo you like/dislike anything else in 102?</div></blockquote>\nI generally dont like when ppl say \"there are 1-2 scum in this group of people\" when the group they are talking about is exactly 50% of the players (self not included)<br>\nWhich in return means he also thinks there are 1-2 scum in the other group.<br>\n<br>\n@RhazhBashu: would you mind answering my question in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8331074#p8331074\">92</a></div></blockquote>\n\nI forgot to mention this one, but yeah I didn&#8217;t like it either.

There is a lot of scum value in splitting the wagons at that point and getting split if you thought you could get a Manuel lynch instead and still get towncred of not being the wagon.

In my experience, that tends to come from town. And as I said before I omitted a lot of explanations from the early game to see what reactions I get. Players asking me about my read, leads to dialogue, which leads to more interactions, etc and the game starts flowing naturally.

In particular how he refuses to consider anything before the fifth page as helpful in finding peoples alignments. He went on the restate this when I posted my analysis, (47 and 109). Then when I pointed out that me pulling reads out of what he called &#8220;nullness&#8221; would in fact be reason to suspect me. (167) He didn&#8217;t disagree, he even said that somebody posting in-depth reads using the first three pages of a mafia game is suspect, but he avoided calling me scummy for it. Instead he opted to stay on Rhazhbash because he was, &#8220;much worse&#8221;. <br>\n<br>\nHe then goes on to town read me while giving little back bone as to why. I later asked for more elaboration to this and his response was that he town read me because of what I had done up to that point. He does this without actually saying what I done that is townie. His town read on me is vague. Keeping me as his top town read most of D1 without directly saying what about me is town, (and no I&#8217;m not counting the&#8221; everything about you is town&#8221; thing), making that read look really contrived. It wasn&#8217;t until his read list at post 679 that he said it was mainly that my scum hunting looked genuine. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&#8230; BUT </div>I actually didn&#8217;t find his suspsions of Square to be bad though. Gerry could definite have been pushing that wagon with town intentions. Square read&#8217;s were riddled with contradictions. Which many people see as scummy, and can be scummy. (828 &amp; 888). His scum read on victor today looks good too. <br>\n<br>\nLooking into other games Gerry had played on site I think that he is likely town here. Looking at Machiavellian mafia I saw that Gerry is crazy good at distancing his scum buddies. TO the point that it looked like he was getting into a personal affront with his scum buddy Maria. The back an forth between Gerry and Victor at the start of the day look way too weak to be scum Gerry, and Victor. Gerry also doesn&#8217;t make sense with Gamma&#8217;s buddying yesterday. With Gerry not matching either proposed scum team I&#8217;d say he is town.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: House</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">House: I wasn&#8217;t sure how I felt about widely scum read, lynch baity, Rhazhbash. <br>\n<br>\nHouse looks pretty town. He is much more&#8230; crass in his interactions with people as town then as scum. Some of his interactions with Eager and Gamma look a lot like how House reacts to being scum read as town. Though I will admit that I'm operating off a small sample size, and I'm frankly nervous about trying to meta him like ever.<br>\n<br>\nAlso his reads are lining up a lot like mine are.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: VictorDeAngelo</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Glancing through Victor&#8217;s interactions with Eager yesterday-- Victor looks&#8230; like he is pulling Scum Theater with Eager. I mean he pushes Eager off and on throughout most of D1 then leaves the snake wagon for Square. If Victor is scum it would also explain why he would see his scum buddy making suspect posts way back at day start where others see derpy town, or non-AI derp play, given Victor would be in an informed position. <br>\n<br>\nI also think that his would vote list in post 900 is bad in that none of those players have scum team chemistry together. Meanwhile he kept layers he seems to think is scummy on his &#8220;Not today&#8221; list, first one comes to mind is Gerry, but he didn&#8217;t seem to like Manuel much either looking back at (340). <br>\n<br>\nHim blaming Gerry for the rivaling square wagon when Victor himself said he would prefer a Square lynch over Snake doesn&#8217;t make me feel any better about this slot. Why was Victor so happy to be on a wagon started by somebody he said was, &#8220;gives next to nothing on his scum reads&#8230; someone trying to not rock the boat.&#8221; (post 900 about Gerry). Also Why is Victor trying to shift blame away from himself? As town I typically acknowledge once I realize I made a bad choice instead of projecting my decisions onto another player. :/ <br>\n<br>\nSide note, I don&#8217;t think Victor and CCC would be scum together. Looking at 1086 Victor lays a town read at CCC&#8217;s feet right after CCC names him off as probscum. That plus the defenses of CCC earlier this game looks a bit like Victor is hoping to garner CCC&#8217;s trust. Which he wouldn&#8217;t need to do if they were both scum. <br>\n<br>\nCan&#8217;t help but feel like this guy has been flying under my radar this game.

In particular how he refuses to consider anything before the fifth page as helpful in finding peoples alignments. He went on the restate this when I posted my analysis, (47 and 109). Then when I pointed out that me pulling reads out of what he called &#8220;nullness&#8221; would in fact be reason to suspect me. (167) He didn&#8217;t disagree, he even said that somebody posting in-depth reads using the first three pages of a mafia game is suspect, but he avoided calling me scummy for it. Instead he opted to stay on Rhazhbash because he was, &#8220;much worse&#8221;. <br>\n<br>\nHe then goes on to town read me while giving little back bone as to why. I later asked for more elaboration to this and his response was that he town read me because of what I had done up to that point. He does this without actually saying what I done that is townie. His town read on me is vague. Keeping me as his top town read most of D1 without directly saying what about me is town, (and no I&#8217;m not counting the&#8221; everything about you is town&#8221; thing), making that read look really contrived. It wasn&#8217;t until his read list at post 679 that he said it was mainly that my scum hunting looked genuine. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&#8230; BUT </div>I actually didn&#8217;t find his suspsions of Square to be bad though. Gerry could definite have been pushing that wagon with town intentions. Square read&#8217;s were riddled with contradictions. Which many people see as scummy, and can be scummy. (828 &amp; 888). His scum read on victor today looks good too. <br>\n<br>\nLooking into other games Gerry had played on site I think that he is likely town here. Looking at Machiavellian mafia I saw that Gerry is crazy good at distancing his scum buddies. TO the point that it looked like he was getting into a personal affront with his scum buddy Maria. The back an forth between Gerry and Victor at the start of the day look way too weak to be scum Gerry, and Victor. Gerry also doesn&#8217;t make sense with Gamma&#8217;s buddying yesterday. With Gerry not matching either proposed scum team I&#8217;d say he is town.</div></div></div> </div></blockquote>\n\nthank you for the compliment on my scum game, i'm flattered lol. But, thank you for finally realizing my reasons. This is why I don't think victor is town because my reasons for pushing on square were legit (and he did too) yet now he's trying to say that my vote on him is now the reason?? even though he voted me before i voted him lol", "time": "Fri Sep 30, 2016 10:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}

Players asking me about my read, leads to dialogue, which leads to more interactions, etc and the game starts flowing naturally.

I'm still baffled by the fuss House made over my not voting him when I finished my original catch up. From the rest of Day one I did get the feeling that he wasn't quite so interested in lynching CCC as he made out to be, but that's a bit subjective. He didn't use the role he claimed to have to protect Square, so we didn't get the benefit of at least one action from the JOAT.  In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375905#p8375905\">1431</a> he renewed the briefly stalled lynch against the uncounterclaimed watcher instead of waiting for an explanation re: the use of the word \"blue\" (and was promptly sheeped by Gamma and Jester).<br>\n<br>\nThe only sticking point is the push on eager but I guess it boils down to this: I don't believe House's bodyguard claim. I don't like the way he was calling for a doctor to claim, or suggesting there might be another protective role, and I think if he was really town with that role he would have waited until the game was over before making an MD thread about it. There was no reason for him to claim when he did (shortly after making that thread), and risk attracting the nk, when his whole reason for not protecting Square was that he thought he was more valuable than him, in which case it would have been better to keep silent about any role.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: House</div>", "time": "Sat Oct 08, 2016 2:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68345&start=1800", "forum": "53", "thread": "68345"}
