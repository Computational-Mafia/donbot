I will lock the thread during the night, but it case I forget to, you may not post. Any posts during the night will be deleted.<br>\n6) You may not use any small or invisible text.

They may still talk during &#8216;twilight&#8217;, but no amount of unvoting, pleading, or divine intervention will save them.<br>\n6) Players may vote for a no-lynch, and a no-lynch will occur if half of the remaining players do so.<br>\n7) Each day has a deadline of 3 weeks.

This was just the threat of an early daykill, rather than a (fake) submitted kill, but still, I think the situations are comparable.<br>\n<br>\nGuess what alignment the people going \"what the fuck! what are you thinking!\" etc. are? I'll give you a clue; it's not scum. Scum are the ones who weren't sure how to react, and so kept on posting normally as if nothing had happened. Which, in this game, would be equivalent to not posting at all, because the game hadn't officially started. <br>\n<br>\nWhiskers' pregame behaviour is entirely consistent with someone who is used to playing on a site where people actually would make daykills on the first page for the lulz, and I know these sites exist. His behaviour is not consistent with someone trying to score town points by affecting outrage at a premature kill on a possible townie.<br>\n<br>\nIn particular, this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Because of I'm upset about Substrike22's softclaim?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nreads strongly as a town reaction to me. I think scum faking the outrage would focus entirely on shouting \"that could be a townie you just killed!\" and not even consider any other possible downsides to the town, because that's where the 'reward' would come; the townflip of poor dead daykilled Scumhunter, vindicating Whiskers and showing his fake outrage to be 'justified'.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3301847#p3301847\" class=\"postlink\">Post #102</a> is the further posting that has me convinced that Whiskers is town - specifically, his responses to my unexplained town read on him, which are clearly paranoid about my motives. <br>\n<br>\nIf you call scum town, and don't explain why, they tend not to question it. They're just happy to have fooled someone. If you call town town, and don't explain why, especially when everybody else is calling them scum, they tend to think \"What makes this guy different? Does he know something the others don't?\" and they'll probably suspect that you are scum looking for town cred by defending them without actually stopping their lynch.", "time": "Tue Aug 02, 2011 11:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

I am willing to give it a bit of a pass because a lot of that was pre-game, and at the time I wasn't sure we were supposed to be posting, either. While I didn't like the way he came in later and said \"I didn't know which game this was,\" I do believe it was at least genuine: Bobscum could have easily lurked a few pages, come in, said \"I wasn't sure if I could post,\" and that would have been the end of it, I think.<br>\n<br>\nHis vote on Whiskers in #160 doesn't feel too horribly off to me: presumably the straw that broke the camel's back for him was Whiskers's \"I was going to vote later,\" statement, which struck me wrong, too.<br>\n<br>\nBy this point in the game (around page 8), I  wasn't too sold on a Bob lynch. One-liners with this tone are part of his playstyle. However, his leap onto the Musicninja wagon was way too opportunistic for me, and way less supported than I would have preferred.<br>\n<br>\nHuh. I had thought there were a lot more Bob posts than there actually are. My conclusion on Bob is that he would be a better lynch candidate close to deadline than Whiskers. Is there a term for those players who are scummy early on, survive, and preoccupy a lot of attention for a good portion of the game thereafter? The ones that when their role is finally confirmed, when town annoy you because you spent so much time chasing town, and when scum annoy you because they shouldn't have lived so long. If not there should be. At least with Whiskers, I'm fairly confident we could catch him Tomorrow if he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nOn Musicninja, his first non-confirm post rubbed me the wrong way. I think someone else mentioned it, too. I don't like how he came in talking about what happened \"IF,\" (suspicious level of emphasis on the \"if.\") we lynched Whiskers and he flipped Town. I have a habit of making the same sorts of posts when I'm scum trying to get townie points.<br>\n<br>\nI disagreed with his second post, wherein he called Whiskers mafia for trying to stop defending himself with his every post. There is a point where you have to just accept that people aren't going to change their minds on something you did and move on.

The clincher for me came near the end though- I've always been wary of players who do scummy things and announce that they're scummy as a means of hiding in plain sight, that's one of the biggest tells I've come across. You've done this with your self announced OMGUS. <br>\n<br>\nThe real clincher, however, was your attacks on MusicNinja (whose wagon I really don't understand) that were quickly abandoned as soon as a rather expedient wagon on bobsnox came up.

And, rather shockingly you're back on him now that there's another convenient wagon. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI see your concerns here, I just don't see Whiskers as the type of player to think it through that much. I think you are overanalyzing it a bit here. I think while its certainly possible for scum to hide between the guise of blatant anti-townishness, I think stubborn townies are actually way more likely to do self-proclaimed scummy things because they are not as concerned with appearing scummy as scum are. They think \"I have nothing to hide I'm going to do what I want to do\". That attitude can extend into making careless votes etc. Not to say that we should give people who display these things a free pass, but I'm not really seeing Whiskers attention-drawing actions as having much of a scum-driven agenda to be honest.

Perhaps its due to me not liking either of his votes (Whiskers/Panacea) or lack of content due to V/LA, but I think he is a potential scumlord as well.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still fine with the vote on bob. Nothing has happened to make me change my mind on him. I don't mind Panacea's vote on LTP. In fact, I'm considering doing the same.

The person that accused him of scum for flip lfopping his votes on an \"opportunistic hammer\"? No.  She switched her vote back to her main suspect after ir being on her secondary suspect.  She wanted musicninja lynched and only voted bob when she felt no possible chance for a nusicninja lynch.  When musicninja becomes a viable option again, shed rather lynch her number one suspect than her number 2.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI hope any of this makes sense and isn't too misspelt.

I'm not counter claiming, I'm not claiming a PR or survivor, I'm claiming that I want very hard not to die. I am fully capable of taking my death with grace, I have learned reasons not to be emo and hammer myself, and I would die if it wins us the game. However, I want very much Not To Die. <br>\n2) I did no rolefishing. Where's the rolefishing? I suggested that in THAT game, the OPEN one with all UNIQUE ROLES that massclaiming was an excellent town idea. In this one where we have likely more than one of some roles, Massclaiming would not be great. What you think is \"suggesting massclaiming\" is me giving a little bit of background. The arguments against massclaiming in that game were that \"Oh, but if scum claims cop and our cop counter claims, then we might lose our cop! D:\" And the reply is that \"Yeah, we MIGHT lose our cop, except that we'd catch a Mafia and if we lynch the right one our Doc could protect the realcop at night!\" <br>\nIn this case, how many mafia do we have? Two? Three? Even so, cutting down the mafia by 33% in exchange for one power role is not bad. <blockquote><div><cite>Substrike22 wrote:</cite>Furthermore how the hell are we gaining a confirmed scum in exchange for Bob's claim 2 pages ago?  As far as I can tell he didn't investigate anyone on N0 and I missed the jump there.</div></blockquote>ALSO, the way we could catch a confscum this way if is somepony counter claims bobsnox. Then we'd lynch either the CC cop or bobsnox, and they would either be a cop or scum. If we lynch the cop, we lynch the confirmed scum the next day. If we lynch the scum, we protect the cop during the night, forcing the Mafia to use their NK on somepony else. <br>\nI thought of a way that might not work in this game, and will bring it up in <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">a second</div>now. I'll just keep it organized by #: It may not work in this game because it is not an open game, and ther may be more than one cop. However, I will stress that in THAT game, where ALL THE ROLES ARE UNIQUE and there is ONLY ONE COP, this tactic works perfectly. <br>\n3) I Do find his play style scummy-- or rather, I find it clean, and \"smart\" and it pisses me off and I don't like it. I want it to not be scummy because if he's scum I'll never catch him. I'll ISO him at somepoint maybe, and see if I can find scum tells or something in it, but My real problem with him is that he looks too good and it is making my gut ache. <br>\n<br>\n[preedit]: Personal survival beyond Day 1 as town is a personal goal.", "time": "Sun Aug 07, 2011 1:24 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

After that, you can lynch me all you want.<br>\nalso as per your finally quoted posts.<br>\n<br>\nSO you're basing your entire scum feeling on Whiskers, who you have been pushing for SINCE BEFORE THE GAME STARTED, based on two posts she made, WITHIN THE PAST THREE DAYS?!?!?<br>\n<br>\nuhm no.  Post what had your vote on her early on in the game, and any other scum reads you have.  if you can't then why have you been gunning for her so hard for so long?<br>\n<br>\nAs per your points listed, 1. Idgaf if you're town or scum, you don't want to die.  Dying as scum means you're probably more likely to lose.  Dying as town means you're out of the game and no longer get to enjoy the experience.  If someone ISN'T scared shitless when they're getting lynched, I'd be worried.  That means they are up to something, and they WANT to die.  It usually means their partner is bussing them, or they have some role whose action takes place upon their death.  So you do have a point.  She did have a rather high sense of self-preservation.  I find that a null read.  if she hadn't had a high sense of preservation, I would have found it scummy. Also you're whole pr/scum theory.  How do you know she isn't PR?  Is there some rule that says there is one town-aligned player that isn't Vanilla Townie?  I must have missed the memo, as I have played many games with multiple PRs.<br>\n<br>\nYour second point, she already cleared up with saying that she was quoting her attitude from a previous game.  I believe this is the one you said you conceded on?  And you're whole \"not trade cop for scum d1\" is complete personal opinion.  If I was in a game, where there was guaranteed no more than 1 cop, no bastard modding, and no fake role PMs were given, and two people claimed cop seriously Day 1, I would be gunning for lynching one of them.  If you hit the mafia, you can have a doctor on the real cop, or if you hit the real cop, any interactions the fake one made the day before with other players can be carefully scrutinized to find their partners.  Personal preference of play style does not a scum-tell make.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 3, I already clarified this.", "time": "Mon Aug 08, 2011 10:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

Its like the point I made with substrike.  I can say he claimed scum and he told us his partners name all I want, but none of you should BELIEVE me unless I provide proof that he has done so.  You should ALL go to his defense and say \"Where does he say that?\".<br>\n<br>\nIts not that I am trying to rush a lynch, I truly think musicninja is scummy.  I think scummy people deserve to be lynched. IE: I think we should lynch this spot.  So yes I will be advocating a lynch for him. Thats what I do when I see someone scummy.  I advocate to get them lynched.  THe reason I don't want to wait for a replacement?  I HONESTLY BELIEVE that that slot is scummy, therefore I don't see a possible way for that slot to remove its scummieness.  Anyone who thinks a replacement can fix the scummieness, must not believe the slot is scum, in which case why would you want them lynched?  And if the spot IS scummy then a replacement coming in for a week won't change that, and it would suck for the replacement to repalce into a game, re-read 485 posts, then immediately get lynched out due to his predecessor's play.", "time": "Wed Aug 10, 2011 1:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

He'll vote one person based on a single post, then drop that entirely to vote someone else based on a single post, and so on. He's making it up as he goes along; this is not town behaviour. <br>\n<br>\nI think I may have persuaded myself into changing my vote.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MusicNinja</div><br>\n<br>\nWell, you already know where I stand with this one.

But the fact that he picks out Scumhunter's town read on monk, which was one of a number of reads Scumhunter gave without explanation, and asks for reasoning, that doesn't seem like scum behaviour to me. I'd expect scum to demand reasons for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">all</div> of Scumhunter's reads, whereas it makes a lot more sense that for a town player, the one that they disagree with would stand out. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3327100#p3327100\" class=\"postlink\">Post #327</a>: I guess it was Noramp that said this, not Scumhunter.

It's totally possible to go from everypony on one wagon and thinking one player is scum to lynching a formerly radar-bottomed coasting player. One week is a lot of time, that's why every day is THREE weeks long, so that confused newbies can let their ideas and stuff stew. <br>\n<br>\nInteresting that you want to push a lynch. I'd like to have the day over too, but activity has suddenly picked up. If it can KEEP up until a replacement, then I am so down for it. <br>\n<br>\nYou make a lot of jokes and stuff, have you done any scumhunting?

Its like the point I made with substrike.  I can say he claimed scum and he told us his partners name all I want, but none of you should BELIEVE me unless I provide proof that he has done so.  You should ALL go to his defense and say \"Where does he say that?\".<br>\n<br>\nIts not that I am trying to rush a lynch, I truly think musicninja is scummy.  I think scummy people deserve to be lynched. IE: I think we should lynch this spot.  So yes I will be advocating a lynch for him. Thats what I do when I see someone scummy.  I advocate to get them lynched.  THe reason I don't want to wait for a replacement?  I HONESTLY BELIEVE that that slot is scummy, therefore I don't see a possible way for that slot to remove its scummieness.  Anyone who thinks a replacement can fix the scummieness, must not believe the slot is scum, in which case why would you want them lynched?  And if the spot IS scummy then a replacement coming in for a week won't change that, and it would suck for the replacement to repalce into a game, re-read 485 posts, then immediately get lynched out due to his predecessor's play.</div></blockquote><br>\nI'm bored. <br>\nUsachan, can you make a vote and write up a case on somepony?", "time": "Thu Aug 11, 2011 8:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

The first post was pretty close to my reads at the time, regarding the probability of scum on the Whiskers wagon, with the obvious exception of LTP. The second one brought the strong defense to Whiskers that I was thinking of myself. Scum simply aren't likely to look a gift horse (or pony, in this case) in the mouth like Whiskers did. The third one just showed a lot of thought. I didn't agree with all of it, but it definitely showed that you were putting the effort in.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Maruchan</div>: You kind of try to get in well with Panacea and Whiskers the entire time, but as I read you, I sort of just got a town feel. Despite this feeling, it seems like you've done little more than defend Whiskers, soft-claim, and push for a MusicNinja lynch, despite your post count. As a result, your only about null, leaning town for me. Seems like scum would have supported a Whiskers lynch, considering how easy it would have been.<br>\n<br>\nIn regard to the soft-claim, I really don't see why you are deciding not just claim in this situation. What about tomorrow makes it so that you have to wait until then to claim? It's looking kind of suspicious to me. But if nothing else, I think it's still reason enough not to lynch you today.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Monk</div>: He starts out by assaulting Panacea for not having a vote down, which I don't see as a scumtell at all that early on. There's really no need to start a potential bandwagon that could get out of contol so early on. Bad enough it almost happened with Whiskers, MusicNinja, and bobsnox as early in the day as those wagons nearly came into fruition. There's nothing wrong with a little caution.<br>\n<br>\nThe lack of content from him also has me keeping my eye on him. Also, post such as <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328363#p3328363\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3330381#p3330381\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> really don't do a lot for you. It's been covered why it's suspicious by others, so in the interest of time, I'm going to leave it at that. <br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, you've said a few pretty townie things, such as <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3330439#p3330439\" class=\"postlink\">attemptng to hold off on a MusicNinja lynch until he is replaced</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3317716#p3317716\" class=\"postlink\">telling off Friend for needing to be prompted to discuss his suspects</a>.<br>\n<br>\nDue to the conflicting nature of these, I've got only a slight scum read on you.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">MusicNinja</div>: From the one game I've played with him, I definitely think he should be more active than this, but he was the Doc then, so he could have been more into it as a result. What I find particularly interesting is that he is in no other games right now, yet is not posting here, even though he's been online just the other day to celebrate the town vctory in the game we were in together. I feel that either he is a bored Vanilla or overwhelmed scum. But given his posts, I'm somehow inclined towards the former. I could totally see him saying the stuff he said town. I mean, the guy did soft-claim Doctor in our last game at the mere mention of the role, so I kind of see him as down for some questionable shit. At the same time, I don't want to rule out the scum possibility though. He's pretty null for me right now and I'd rather wait for his replacement to decide for sure one way or the other.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">noramp</div>: Putting bob at L-2 and not jumping on the Whiskers wagon early on seem like pretty town moves to me. Ditto for taking MusicNinja off L-1. If you were scum together, you probably would not have let it go on as long as it did. Same would probably been done by any scum if MusicNinja were scum, in all likelihood. Town read for you.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Panacea</div>: Well you certainly do use your vote sparingly, don't you? I can't help but think it's a bit suspicious that your only two votes have been on people that have next to no chance to being lynched. At the same time, this is a plus from you, since scum usually try for a mislynch. You've had considerable opportunity to jump on MusicNinja, yet you haven't. This pleases me. Particulary <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3335812#p3335812\" class=\"postlink\">this one.</a><br>\n<br>\nStill, I could definitely stand to see more of you. You question a lot of people's moves in a good way, but lack of activity and lack of general pressure certainly aren't helping. Having a vote on someone isn't a great deal of pressure isn't a great way to put pressure on people when wagons are forming all around. I'd think your vote would be better-used placed on one of your suspects. I doubt very much we'll see any sort of quickhammering this early on, since it can be kind of suspicious in general and I imagine most wagons won't get higher than L-2 until we can come to a better consensus anyway.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Scumhunter</div>: This motherfucker right here seems pretty legit. From his first real post, I was pretty much on board with everything he said. I get the feeling that he thinks very similarly to me. One of my favorite things from him was easily <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328390#p3328390\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, because not long before it, I was thinking \"Why the fuck do I think that Substrike is town? He doesn't really do shit, he's just kind of there.\" His scumhunting seems really solid, which is extremely fitting, give his name.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Substrike22</div>: First of all, I disagree with every vote he's made in the game. Granted, he hasn't hopped on the MusicNinja wagon, but he's been riding Whiskers so fucking hard that it's barely even relevant and at this point would probably just look more suspicious than anything. I've seen little of value from him and I get the feeling that he's scum. <br>\n<br>\nOh, and saying that defending yourself as town is a scumtell is total fucking bullshit. I fucking do it all the time. There's no reason a townie should want a lynch wasted on the only person they can confirm for themselves is town. I fucking do it all the time. Letting yourelf die needlessly is just fucking dumb.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Tovarish</div>: His entire case against Whiskers never really felt that great and the best he seems to bring against anyone is some petty shit that's barely even evidence, as seen in posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3316662#p3316662\" class=\"postlink\">#232</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328751#p3328751\" class=\"postlink\">#384</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Whiskers</div>:First off, are you a fucking dude or a chick?

Believe me when I say the last person you want in a MyLo situation is an unconfirmed Hikari Link. Scum love to use the \"too town\" scumtell against me. At least, that's what I wanted to say to that, but it would have been too risky, as I will soon get into. <br>\n<br>\nIn reality, I just really wish you guys hadn't believed in me so hard, not that I hold it against you, because I have to claim cop right now. I was really hoping I could hold off on it for a while, but I'm just too damn good at coming off town and while there is next to no chance of me being lynched today, I can't take the chance that I will get killed during the night. The truth is I basically jumped out of my seat the moment bobsnox claimed cop. While I admit that there could be two Cops, I'm very much willing to bet otherwise. <br>\n<br>\nI really wanted to save my claim until tomorrow to see if we got a fake read from bobsnox so that we'd have another confirmed townie, but there are just too many factors that could make that gambit useless. I could die during the night and you might immediately call for his blood, or worse, you could keep him alive on the off-chance that he is a Cop. You guys could call bullshit tomorrow under the belief that I should have claimed today. He could claim he got roleblocked, making my wait useless. There could be a Framer and he could be a real fucking Cop. Or any number of other things. <br>\n<br>\nIt's far less risky to claim now and hope I can garner some sort of protection from a Doc or Jailkeeper or someone. Even if I get roleblocked, I can assure you I'm still extremely useful to have around alive. Not to toot my own horn, but I am rather good at scumhunting, considering all of my experience until now has come as a vanilla townie.

If we lynch bobsnox and he turns up cop, it does not mean that Link is NOT a cop. It is entierly possible that they are BOTH cops. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, iamusername, if a non-sane cop isn't a variant, what is? The list contains pretty much every role in the game. All the ones on the \"normal\" list are regular and can be used freely. What does that leave? the ones on the \"non-normal\" list.

IF we DID lynch the bomb, then we'd be sad, but it would not do anypony any harm-- the hammerer does not explode a bomb, only a nightkiller. <br>\n<br>\nFourthly, bobsnox, It  may not be as valuable or trustworthy in a closed-role game like this, but trading a PR for a scum would be FANTASTIC. There are more townies than scum, and likely more PRs than scum, and if we could trade them off at a 1-for-1 basis until we ran out of power roles, and THEN have to rely only on scumhunting, the Town with power roles would win every time.  <br>\n<br>\nFifthly, bobsnox, his counterclaim COULD make sense, and is not necessarily a scum gambit or trade. You really could both be cops. <br>\n<br>\nSixthly, bobsnox, I'm going to hammer you because you suck. If you were town, you'd play the game. I will not play with you again, given the choice.

I completely forgot about that (like i said when he told me monk was inno)</div></blockquote>Or, as has been pointed out maybe you guys have a Godfather or maybe you weren't under any suspicion from the cop player slot and decided to risk not being investigated for a night. Maybe you were afraid of a watcher. Maybe a thousand things that are all perfectly reasonable. Just because there is a claimed cop doesn't mean they will die the next night. WIFOM night actions, which is exactly why we should not be directing night kills as much as you are trying to do so.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 797 wrote:</cite>Wasn't OMGUS? One of you're biggest defenses here, in fact your only defense by monk's post, is that you were the scum kill target. That means I am still town-jailkeeper.  Therefore, yes voting me is OMGUS, as I guarantee no doctor would have been on you last night. As for my saying I only claimed due to your not being waggoned, go read D1 please.  I told everyone, multiple times, I would claim today, already breadcrumb claimed as jailer, and called sbustrike scum myself for about 3 pages.</div></blockquote>Actually, I did make the defense you attributed to monk, prior to monk saying anything. I can't really defend against your accusation since I didn't go anywhere because I have no action to go anywhere with. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 797 wrote:</cite>As for my saying I only claimed due to your not being waggoned, go read D1 please.

And yes, exactly: you were trying to defer the wagon on scum bobsnox to let him live another night so you could then immediately claim.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 797 wrote:</cite>Don't even pretend you know what I would or wouldn't be considering, I have no fucking clue how to make a setup.  I don't know what is considered balanced and what isn't.  I suck at that shit.  So don't even try and say \"I know there isn't a doctor\", why? Because you aren't psychic, and I am not a mod, nor have I ever created a setup, so you have no proof to back that claim, where as I DO have proof to back mine, if you'd like me to link it.</div></blockquote>My apologies for attempting to be a psychic; but you did just get done talking about how smart of a mofo you were. If you are a town JKer there is no doctor in this setup. If there is, it is horribly town sided with two roles that can prevent a kill (one of which can prevent it from two directions) thereby blocking the scum NK ~1/4 of the time on night 1 and even higher as the game goes on and neither of them are lynched/killed.

You then say substrike (my other scumbuddy) begins a huge 4-page case on me, and I fight back with him, and we go on fighting for 4 pages calling each other scum, until SOMEBODY ELSE says they think its town-on-town. And then I (when <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3351359#p3351359\" class=\"postlink\">ASKED</a>) claim, just to save the guy who was pushing for my lynch?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>My apologies for attempting to be a psychic; but you did just get done talking about how smart of a mofo you were. If you are a town JKer there is no doctor in this setup. If there is, it is horribly town sided with two roles that can prevent a kill (one of which can prevent it from two directions) thereby blocking the scum NK ~1/4 of the time on night 1 and even higher as the game goes on and neither of them are lynched/killed. Plus, you've apparently done a decent amount of reading on the wiki about breadcrumbs and reading a bunch of people's links in the signatures so it isn't too far of a stretch for the \"smart mofo\" to also be reading about game setups.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt is possible that this setup is horribly town sided.  They only have to pass a normalcy check to be allowed in the normal queue.  Not a balance check.  Also, link me to any wiki page which directly says that in making a setup a doctor should not be put with a jailer.  Since you're biggest attack here is that the wiki is where I get most of my information, mind me a wiki page that says it.  If you find one, I will self-vote and call myself scum.  Or even find me a signature that links to a page that says that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Nice condescending undertone.</div></blockquote><br>\nMy specialty.

I kind of said don't unless you were sure. Speaking of which, you've sort of been sure this whole time he was scum. I mean, granted, he was allegedly a high scum read for you, but the fact still remains that you were apparently like 100% sure you had hit scum. Not to mention this has been built up since yesterday, what with you saying you'd claim today, your breadcrumb, and talking about how the Jailkeeper should claim if he had anything all during the beginning of the day. In fact, now that I think of it, it's ALMOST like you were trying to bait a real jailkeeper claim just in case. I wouldn't be surprised if there was no claim if I had died last night, but that's not really relevant anymore. What's more, xvart replaced in during the beginning of the night, so you had ample time to plan out a rather intricate strategy like this if it were a scum scheme. Just saying.<br>\n<br>\nLook, right now I think xvart is honestly looking more town, but unless he's gonna claim a power role, I could almost see a lynch of him today, a Doc on my tonight, and a lynch of Maruchan tomorrow. I just really like ur odds on Maruchan better, because this whole thing reads like a scum gambit to me, but xvart could be the fall guy or the sacrificial lamb to gain towncred.<br>\n<br>\nThere might have been more I wanted to add, but I'm really starting to get tired. I'll call it good for now and let it digest with people. I'm really interested to hear how other people take this analysis. xvart and Maruchan are free to comment, but I'm really more intereested in the people who I'm not calling scum have to say.

Its important</div></blockquote>I think I've already explained what I believe to have happened, but I'll elaborate more this time. I think your team decided to no kill last night with you being scum roleblocker under the guise of confirming yourself (although not really since I don't have an ability). You probably picked me for the reasons you said: a player slot highly suspected so it makes you look town plus you don't have to worry about getting a competent player coming in and disrupting your teams mojo if you had the town looking in different directions already. Then, your \"jailkeep\" of me gets me lynched and I flip town. Oops you say, well you suppose I could have been the NK target. Plus, I think you were already locked into claiming today with your little attempted save on bobsnox that almost worked so you absolutely had to claim something because you would have looked terrible if there was a night kill and then didn't claim under whatever pretext you would have made up (or claimed JKer with no conclusive evidence which would then prompt the \"why did you claim or why were you so eager to claim?\"). Meanwhile, the town erupts into chaos and yields nothing concrete to help them today. It's the perfect scum play: get a suspected townie lynch with little liability and create chaotic smokescreen to distract the town for an entire day.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 805 wrote:</cite>It is possible that this setup is horribly town sided.  They only have to pass a normalcy check to be allowed in the normal queue.  Not a balance check.  Also, link me to any wiki page which directly says that in making a setup a doctor should not be put with a jailer.  Since you're biggest attack here is that the wiki is where I get most of my information, mind me a wiki page that says it.  If you find one, I will self-vote and call myself scum.  Or even find me a signature that links to a page that says that.</div></blockquote>You're taking what I said out of context. You said you do a lot of reading on the site. It isn't too hard of a stretch to think you would have come across games where this was discussed or even the MD forum where it is discussed. For someone cruising the forum for gambits I assumed you would also have a fundamental understanding of balance. I have neither moderated a game nor designed a setup but even thinking about the setup with a doctor AND a jailkeeper is ridiculous because of what I said before: \"with two roles that can prevent a kill (one of which can prevent it from two directions) thereby blocking the scum NK ~1/4 of the time on night 1 and even higher as the game goes on and neither of them are lynched/killed.\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 805 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Nice condescending undertone.</div></blockquote><br>\nMy specialty.

You say you wouldn't have mentioned it D1 if there wasn't a NK last night. How could you predict something that hasn't happened yet to base what you are claiming prior to said event happening unless... wait for it... you are scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd you didn't say I was an easy lynch. You said \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3354603#p3354603\" class=\"postlink\">You were the top scum suspect of almost EVERY player here</a>\" which wouldn't make for a difficult lynch to put through.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 806 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers Case wrote:</cite>This post reads to me as pushing a bogus case and asking to be convinced it is bogus under the guise of pressure.

First of all, it has nothing to do with the case on you now; since everything I've commented about you now has transpired after that point in the game.

You may confirm his role (RBer) but you will not confirm his alignment; plus you will get a blocked cop. <br>\n<br>\nMaybe Whiskers is the final scum match with Maruchan. Maruchan is sweating because I've nailed his plan/thought process down pat and if Whiskers is the other scum he is trying to direct all night actions, too; since upon my flip everything will be thrown in upheaval and their plan will have monumentally backfired so they need the town to have as little information as possible.[/speculation]<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link, 864 wrote:</cite>More like you started looking scummy.

And I've already provided reasoning for why scum would target me today; and why scum would claim a RB on me and still get an easy out when I flip town; the second of which is the most likely possibility.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>The third--! And yeah, I'm adding this in-- is that you say that he was going to try to not claim today. If there was a kill, he STILL would have claimed today, because I would have held him to it. Also, if you look at his breadcrumb, you know what role he was PLANNING on claiming. It's not like his claim depended on the nightkill. </div></blockquote>You apparently missed the part where he said he wasn't going to claim if there was a night kill. Great; you would have held him to that, but his intention was clear: he wasn't going to claim if there was a night kill after he said he was going to claim no matter what as long as he lived through the night. And, a scum player is going to claim JKer if they are a RBer 90% of the time, so if he is so insistent on breadcrumbing he should have been less concerned about breadcrumbing his role and outting himself and been focused more on breadcrumbing actions. But again, Maruchan isn't concerned with dying during the night for some strange (read obvious) reason. He got locked into a claim trying to save a buddy and then had to deal with the ramifications when it didn't swing his way.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Here's another question, for all you game-balance types (I'm looking at you, x-vart.) <br>\n<br>\nHow balanced would it be if it were all vanilla townies and scums, except for one Jailkeeper? Just curious. Would that be unbalanced?</div></blockquote>What's the point or relevance of this question? I'm not a game designer but I can easily recognize an lopsided game. I would assume it would be moderately balanced but slightly scum favored since, from what I remember, mountainous games are scum favored (not sure if it is significantly scum favored) but a JKer would only be able to block/prevent a NK and not carry the risks of blocking town PRs. Therefore, I would assume that the natural advantage of scum in mountainous games would be offset slightly by the JK protection/blocking capabilities; but it depends on how scum favored mountainous games are to begin with. But the difference between your example and a game with a cop/doc/JKer is comparing apples and oranges. As I've said, a JK/doc combo will block, assuming a random NK target nearly a quarter of the time with 12 players remaining (1 doctor protection, 1 roleblock, and one JK protection). Add in a cop to catch scum and you have a town orgy of power.", "time": "Thu Aug 18, 2011 6:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

Who says there's even a Doc anyway? <br>\nHaoala did. <br>\n<br>\nHow about you tell us what his coded message meant.

{"number": 902, "id": "3358895", "user": "Hikari Link", "user_id": "16078", "content": "I'm going to write this from the perspective that I was scum, so bear with me hear. I keep hearing arguments for me possibly being scum on the basis that I could have bussed bobsnox D1 to gain towncred. The problem there is that makes no sense. As I stated when I claimed, people were already starting to like my posts, so I had a pretty good in with the town. Furthermore, scum was already claimed Cop with no counter-claim. For starters, I'm not stupid enough to take the gamble that the Cop hadn't claimed already when I as town I wouldn't claim until D2 if necessary and at least Maruchan felt the same (also, his soft-claim could've been Cop and he could've been waiting for the bobsnox report to reveal, as I originally intended). That's an effective gamble of two scum for some paltry towncred when I already had towncred and bobsnox also had towncred. From there, the night actions would've depended greatly on what the special Mafia roles are. That's an infinitely safer play than claiming Cop, getting my scum partner killed, then apparently giving an innocent verdict on my scum partner, as people seem to be claiming.<br>\n<br>\nBack in the regular perspective now. Now the above doesn't at all remove the possibility that things went that way, it just means that if it's true I'm a far worse player than I've been given credit for being. Now I admit that if xvart flips scum, that it is highly unlikely that Maruchan is scum, but I really can't see any chain of events last night that makes sense leading up to today. Let's look at what happened if every claim is true.<br>\n<br>\n1. I got a report.<br>\n2. No night kill happened.<br>\n3. xvart got jailed.<br>\n<br>\n1. Now for all of those to be true, that means that either a. xvart was scum performing the kill (unlikely because he had a great deal of scumreads on him, I think) or b. xvart was the kill target (unliely because a mislynch on him would've been easy) or c. there was a Doctor save (not unlikely if the Mafia came after the claimed Cop, but unlikely if a jailkeeper exists) or d. no kill was submitted (unlikely unless there was a scum gambit). <br>\n<br>\n2. It also means that if there is a roleblocker he a. targeted Maruchan (which would mean option only 1c or 1d can be true) or b. targeted me (which means that xvart is the roleblocker) or c. targeted a random player (makes no sense wit a claimed PR and a soft-claimed PR) or d. targeted nobody (why would that happen?).<br>\n<br>\nNow consider how these look from my perspective. 1a is something I just can't see happening and the same for 1b. I'll fully admit that it is possible, but they just seem so highly unlikely that I think you can see where my suspicion would come from. 1c seems possible to me, but I simply don't see the likelihood if Maruchan is legit, which I'll get into soon. 1d makes no sense if Maruchan is legit. Why no kill when they don't even know a Jailkeeper is going to claim? What possible gambit is there to be had and why haven't they made there move yet?<br>\n<br>\nNow let's look at 1c or 1d deeper if Maruchan was scum. Now my assumption from the beginning has been that his claim was due to an unsuccessful kill on my last night as a result of the Doctor and that he never planned to claim if I died, only if I lived. I believe that 1c occurred, only that it happened with Maruchan as scum. On the other hand, I have considered 1d so that he could make his claim guaranteed, but considering that means leaving the Cop untouched for no reason, I really don't see this one as extremely likely anymore.<br>\n<br>\nMoving on to section 2. 2a seems highly unlikely, since as I've said, I can't imagine 1c or 1d with a town Maruchan. 2b seems unlikely to me as well because it seems like a bad idea to have the kill come in with him even more so if he's already got another important duty. Putting all your eggs in one basket just doesn't make sense when a Jailkeeper/Roleblocker could exist in the town. 2c is unlikely unless they were shooting for the doctor, which seems like a far worse move than targeting either me or town Maruchan. 2d just doesn't even make sense.<br>\n<br>\nSo if you look at my thought process here, you can see why I'd be suspicious of Maruchan. 1a and 1b just don't add up in my mind and seem far too convenient to be be true. No Mafia Roleblocker scenario makes any sense to me either, so it seems unlikely to me that we will see Maruchan framed. <br>\n<br>\nHopefully this will help everyone see that I didn't just lose my mind or something and that I actually have a legitimate concern. I'm not even denying that everything could have just went better than expected, but to me that just screams of unlikelihood. If xvart flips scum though, I'll accept the likelihood that Maruchan is town. Especially if he is roleblocker, though even if he's not. In that case, then I'd say Doc on Maruchan (unlikely to exist, but worth a shot) and Maruchan on me. If I die or get a report, then a Maruchan lynch, otherwise, we accept his claim as legit and we can continue onward from there tomorrow.", "time": "Fri Aug 19, 2011 5:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18530&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "18530"}

Link replaces in D1 and sees that Bobsnox is floundering and that LTP is also a high candidate on many scum lists.  (his two scum buddies.)<br>\n2. The town is calling for a cop counter claim on Bobsnox on day 1, Link indulges us.<br>\n3.

They employ a gambit with the non kill, with Link pushing that a doc must've saved the kill, and that the likeliness of Xvart actually doing the kill (and thus being effectively roleblocked by Maruchan) was slim to none.<br>\n5. Xvart hammers himself to prevent an awkward situation from coming up with VCA on Link.<br>\n<br>\nAnyone want to poke a hole in that admittedly outrageous theory?<br>\n<br>\nAlso I'm in the process of doing some important RL things that are kind of interfering.  (i.e. considering joining the USAF)  So, apologies, and if people have something to say on the above bit, I'll have answers and other scum candidates.

He would not have jailed Link given the scenarios that he was confronted with.</div></blockquote><br>\nBut he did jail me, so that's irrelevant. I got no result. Wasn't really a bad move anyway. Had I been scum, no kill would have went through. Not like there was really a better choice in terms of suspects.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Noramp wrote:</cite>alright im tracker and last night I tracked Substrike and N1 I tracked monk both went nowhere</div></blockquote><br>\nWorks for me. I don't buy the claim one bit, but as has been stated, this is basically a town win. I fully expect one of us to die tonight, but you should probably declare who you are Tracking so that I don't investigate them myself and increase our town-confirming speed. The reason you declare is in case of  framer. And you know what would really suck? A Ninja.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Substrike22 wrote:</cite>So you agree with my feelings that one of the two claiming power roles are lying?</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, one of the two power roles is lying, I'd like to hear whether Link got any results</div></blockquote><br>\nI wish people would read my first posts of the day carefully. I'm the claimed cop, of course I'm gonna bring my results out.<br>\n<br>\nSo I'm not really sure in terms of possibility whether or not a Tracker, a Cop, and a Jailkeeper is possible. I want to say it sounds unlikely, but I'd be lying if I said I thought it as implausible as a Jailkeeper, Cop, and Doctor. Point is, there's relly no reason to lynch noramp if he'll just keep confirming townies. It will be annoying as hell to wait it out if he is scum, but if he's not, I imagine both he and I will be night killed in the next two days. Given the current situation, I think Scumhunter, Panacea, or Friend are our best options for a lynch. And of those, I feel like Panacea has the greatest chance of being scum. Reasoning as follows:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Friend</div>: I've pretty much always read him as town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">iamusername</div>: Pointless for him to bring up that Mafia have no way to win at this point.

We lynch Noramp, likely winning the game and we leave in a small margin for the possibility that we lose, or we wait until he or I confirm almost all town and pretty much guarantee that we win.<br>\n<br>\nSo right now we've got 10 player. 3 are confirmed town, 2 are claimed PRs with the ability to confirm town, and 5 are unknowns. So if we lynched town today, I guarantee that I die or Noramp dies (but noramp is probably scum, so me), since the Mafia aren't going to want two confirmations a day. That leaves us coming into tomorrow with 4 confirmed, 1 claimed PR, and 3 unknowns. From there, we lynch an unknown and the PR dies during the night or a confirmed townie does. That leaves us with 4 confirmed townies, 1 PR, and 1 unknown or 4 confirmed townies and 2 unknowns. From there we can lynch the PR, a confirmed townie will die at night, and we can lynch the final unknown the next day. In an absolute worst-case scenario though, we'd lose if there was a Ninja among us.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, lynching Noramp today means that we can end the game if he is scum, but we'll have to do some actual scumhunting since I'll die tonight and there will be nobody left to confirm town. It will leave us with 3 confirmed town and 5 unknowns. The confirmed are guaranteed to die every night and unknowns lynched every day, so it will progress to 2-4, then 1-3, which is MyLo.<br>\n<br>\nBoth of these are the worst-case scenarios, assuming crazy amounts of town error. The former is clearly the superior method, but the latter is faster if Normap is scum. And should anyone want to entertain the notion that I am scum, remember that I'll be confirming town daily. Oh, and should a PR claim that they were roleblocked at all, they should be lynched immediately, as they lose all usefulness the moment their power stops working and there is no longer any way to confirm that they are town. So I'm sticking with that first idea.<br>\n<br>\nThe following assume I die tonight and the town mislynches everyday and all results are innocent. Based on the plan I presented, I'm going to suggest a Panacea lynch today, Whiskers tracking tonight, and mystery investigation from me in case there is a Framer. Tomorrow I'm dead, we lynch Scumhunter and track Friend. Then I suggest an iamusername lynch or a Noramp lynch if he is still alive.

I should have put that preference in my ruleset though, so it didn't seem so arbitrary. I will do that in any future games I mod.<br>\n<br>\nI'll post the role PMs tomorrow, but right now here are my thoughts on the game:<br>\n<br>\nAt the start, I felt like it would be town-sided, but I didn't see it turning into the rout that it did. I LoL'd when Scumhunter pegged the entire scum team on D-1, but I didn't see it devolving into a mechanical \"lynch then out results\" game. Basically, everything that could have gone right for the town did. Even the \"bad\" part of the JK role helped them out when it blocked the scum kill. <br>\n<br>\nI'm dissapointed with how it turned out in the end. Maybe I should have made the godfather a RBer so that the scum could counter the PR play in the late game. Or maybe I should have made the info roles limited. Either way, I think the town played pretty well this game and deserved to win, but when they started to get ahead it became virtually impossible for the scum to catch up.<br>\n<br>\nDespite this, I'm pretty pleased with how it went, being my first game modding, and I also appreciate the compliments for running it well, even if the setup was a bit lopsided. If you have any other comments or suggestions about my modding style, I'm open to them.
