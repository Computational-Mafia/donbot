Won't go into detail, look it up yourself. All of it's good here... mostly. I tried to explain the self-sacrafice thing as a stronger version of \"I'll eat my hat,\" but it didn't make me look better. also, not sure why it's such a big deal that bobsnox took his RANDOM vote off after he got shot for it. The random vote in the first place was dumb, but I've talked a bit about that. <br>5, bullshit. not fluff exactly, because it's related to the game. Talks about not liking to pressure lurkers, accuses bobsnox of walking onto the battlefield with a bag full of Derp. <br>6, Tries to get iamusername to explain why he thinks I'm town. +1. Explains to monk why she didn't vote for bobsnox anyway-- it was real weak. Kay. <br>7, No, I wouldn't say that. I'm not entierly sure what you mean, but if it means what I think it means, then, no, I wouldn't say that. <br>8, What does, \"early targetted town\" mean? And what does it have to do with you not liking my playstyle, and what does it have to do with not liking YOUR playstyle!? <br>Then, I don't really have a great read on any player yet-- although, this whole thing is helping a lot.  already explained that what looked really scummy (Friend) in a pool of three players looks comparatively less scummy in a pool of fourteen. Or, thirteen, apparently. The reference to a \"dead mouse\" is when I volunteered to be a lynch in a game, and one player replaced in and began tunneling me until he got me lynched.  He wasted his time, the town's time, because they couldn't have a conversation about anything else, for some reason. I said that he was a cat who was trying to catch a dead mouse. <br>It's catchy. I like it.</div></div></div><br>_____________________________ <br><br>Substrike22: <br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Substrike, ISOs</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">0, confirm. <br>1, OMG DAYKILL!? Maybe I overreacted to this-- You all seem pretty certain that I did. I am not. <br>2, Joking, then says he's found scum. How you so sure, bro? <br>3, No, he wasn't dead YET. There's nothing to say that the mod wasn't going to come in and say \"oh yeah, and that daykill worked and now Scumhunter, Doctor Cop, has been Day Killed. It is now Night One.\" <br>4, Is calling someone a moron for not getting a joke Appealing to Emotion? In anycase, how is my point on Friend \"interesting\"? If I wanted to deflect away from myself, or OMGUS somebody, I'd have voted for YOU, Substrike22, not Friend. <br>5, Modfluff <br>6, Votes me, tells us to refer back to his pregame stuff. I assume you mean #2 and #4? Or just #4?? <br>7, Tells me I'm scum. I'm scum for something I didn't do (or rather, doing something that I didn't threaten to do), and for my thing about his Daykill on Scumhunter. <br>8, quotes me with no additions. <br>... whatever! <br>9, All of it true, up until the point where 'all of this discussion about how I'm not scum verses who is scum.' What do you want me to do? This is why I called myself a dead mouse, Panacea. Well, an end to how I'm not scum, I've found a new hobby. <br>Then of course, there's the bit about Friend. i made it almosst immediately after he declared with unbelievable confidence that i was scum. I don't think I ws grabbing at straws, and I wasn't trying to start a wagon so much as point out that what Friend was doing was bullshit. <br>10, Hey hey, double digits. Here Substrike22 complains about lack of activity. That is certainly a problem with this game. Accuses bobsnox for inactivity. Why is everyone up in bobsnox's grill, I wonder.  It's not like he's the only player to not be playing. <br>Then there's more deadmouse catching. I decided to stop defending myself, that apparently is an appeal to emotion. <br>Then some stuff, I don't like it, but I suppose it's valid. <br>11, Isn't THAT an appeal to emotion? Also, I'm pretty sure nobody at this point had brought up tunneling, let alone accused you of it. Why bring it up if you don't think you're doing it?</div></div></div>"}

This was just the threat of an early daykill, rather than a (fake) submitted kill, but still, I think the situations are comparable.<br><br>Guess what alignment the people going \"what the fuck! what are you thinking!\" etc. are? I'll give you a clue; it's not scum. Scum are the ones who weren't sure how to react, and so kept on posting normally as if nothing had happened. Which, in this game, would be equivalent to not posting at all, because the game hadn't officially started. <br><br>Whiskers' pregame behaviour is entirely consistent with someone who is used to playing on a site where people actually would make daykills on the first page for the lulz, and I know these sites exist. His behaviour is not consistent with someone trying to score town points by affecting outrage at a premature kill on a possible townie.<br><br>In particular, this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Because of I'm upset about Substrike22's softclaim?</div></blockquote><br><br>reads strongly as a town reaction to me. I think scum faking the outrage would focus entirely on shouting \"that could be a townie you just killed!\" and not even consider any other possible downsides to the town, because that's where the 'reward' would come; the townflip of poor dead daykilled Scumhunter, vindicating Whiskers and showing his fake outrage to be 'justified'.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3301847#p3301847\" class=\"postlink\">Post #102</a> is the further posting that has me convinced that Whiskers is town - specifically, his responses to my unexplained town read on him, which are clearly paranoid about my motives. <br><br>If you call scum town, and don't explain why, they tend not to question it. They're just happy to have fooled someone. If you call town town, and don't explain why, especially when everybody else is calling them scum, they tend to think \"What makes this guy different? Does he know something the others don't?\" and they'll probably suspect that you are scum looking for town cred by defending them without actually stopping their lynch."}

Regardless, perhaps I should let him answer about his intentions himself, eh?<br><br>long story short: I can see how you could think monk's vote could be opportunistic and scum-motivated, but I don't think there is enough content from him to make a real value judgment. At the moment, his play is mostly a null-tell but my gut has him leaning town slightly. Monk does need to post more though. That would help."}

Then there was referring to yourself as Dead Mouse on Page Four, and refusing to defend yourself. Scummy. The clincher for me came near the end though- I've always been wary of players who do scummy things and announce that they're scummy as a means of hiding in plain sight, that's one of the biggest tells I've come across. You've done this with your self announced OMGUS. <br><br>The real clincher, however, was your attacks on MusicNinja (whose wagon I really don't understand) that were quickly abandoned as soon as a rather expedient wagon on bobsnox came up.

While I didn't like the way he came in later and said \"I didn't know which game this was,\" I do believe it was at least genuine: Bobscum could have easily lurked a few pages, come in, said \"I wasn't sure if I could post,\" and that would have been the end of it, I think.<br><br>His vote on Whiskers in #160 doesn't feel too horribly off to me: presumably the straw that broke the camel's back for him was Whiskers's \"I was going to vote later,\" statement, which struck me wrong, too.<br><br>By this point in the game (around page 8), I  wasn't too sold on a Bob lynch. One-liners with this tone are part of his playstyle. However, his leap onto the Musicninja wagon was way too opportunistic for me, and way less supported than I would have preferred.<br><br>Huh. I had thought there were a lot more Bob posts than there actually are. My conclusion on Bob is that he would be a better lynch candidate close to deadline than Whiskers. Is there a term for those players who are scummy early on, survive, and preoccupy a lot of attention for a good portion of the game thereafter? The ones that when their role is finally confirmed, when town annoy you because you spent so much time chasing town, and when scum annoy you because they shouldn't have lived so long. If not there should be. At least with Whiskers, I'm fairly confident we could catch him Tomorrow if he's scum.<br><br>On Musicninja, his first non-confirm post rubbed me the wrong way. I think someone else mentioned it, too. I don't like how he came in talking about what happened \"IF,\" (suspicious level of emphasis on the \"if.\") we lynched Whiskers and he flipped Town. I have a habit of making the same sorts of posts when I'm scum trying to get townie points.<br><br>I disagreed with his second post, wherein he called Whiskers mafia for trying to stop defending himself with his every post. There is a point where you have to just accept that people aren't going to change their minds on something you did and move on. Whiskers was trying to move the game forward, and it seems to me that Music was not. He also says in that post that he's pretty sure Whiskers is mafia. I don't have any problems with holding a vote, because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">typically</span> you're doing so until you're confident.

I think you are overanalyzing it a bit here. I think while its certainly possible for scum to hide between the guise of blatant anti-townishness, I think stubborn townies are actually way more likely to do self-proclaimed scummy things because they are not as concerned with appearing scummy as scum are. They think \"I have nothing to hide I'm going to do what I want to do\". That attitude can extend into making careless votes etc. Not to say that we should give people who display these things a free pass, but I'm not really seeing Whiskers attention-drawing actions as having much of a scum-driven agenda to be honest. Very much feeling the stubborn townie syndrome there.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tovarish wrote:</cite>Exactly, which is why Friend's behavior is decidedly anti-Town.

Perhaps its due to me not liking either of his votes (Whiskers/Panacea) or lack of content due to V/LA, but I think he is a potential scumlord as well.<br><br>I'm still fine with the vote on bob. Nothing has happened to make me change my mind on him. I don't mind Panacea's vote on LTP. In fact, I'm considering doing the same. It really is best if we have at least some content from every slot in the game going into the end of d1...Not sure a vote really helps accomplish this. Prod/replacement should though..."}

Either way I was wary of the two.  Then when he finally told us his reasoning it made sense and I began to go back to thinking the whole thing was just blown out of proportion.<br><br>As to why thoughts on whislers alignment I'm leaning more towards town.  The person that accused him of scum for flip lfopping his votes on an \"opportunistic hammer\"? No.  She switched her vote back to her main suspect after ir being on her secondary suspect.  She wanted musicninja lynched and only voted bob when she felt no possible chance for a nusicninja lynch.  When musicninja becomes a viable option again, shed rather lynch her number one suspect than her number 2.<br><br><br>I hope any of this makes sense and isn't too misspelt.  I'm on my cell at statefair.<br><br><br>As to your auestion whiskers, if its mylo with 1 scum I would nl.  If it is mylo with mulyiple scum I would lynch.

I'm not counter claiming, I'm not claiming a PR or survivor, I'm claiming that I want very hard not to die. I am fully capable of taking my death with grace, I have learned reasons not to be emo and hammer myself, and I would die if it wins us the game. However, I want very much Not To Die. <br>2) I did no rolefishing. Where's the rolefishing? I suggested that in THAT game, the OPEN one with all UNIQUE ROLES that massclaiming was an excellent town idea. In this one where we have likely more than one of some roles, Massclaiming would not be great. What you think is \"suggesting massclaiming\" is me giving a little bit of background. The arguments against massclaiming in that game were that \"Oh, but if scum claims cop and our cop counter claims, then we might lose our cop! D:\" And the reply is that \"Yeah, we MIGHT lose our cop, except that we'd catch a Mafia and if we lynch the right one our Doc could protect the realcop at night!\" <br>In this case, how many mafia do we have? Two? Three? Even so, cutting down the mafia by 33% in exchange for one power role is not bad. <blockquote><div><cite>Substrike22 wrote:</cite>Furthermore how the hell are we gaining a confirmed scum in exchange for Bob's claim 2 pages ago?  As far as I can tell he didn't investigate anyone on N0 and I missed the jump there.</div></blockquote>ALSO, the way we could catch a confscum this way if is somepony counter claims bobsnox. Then we'd lynch either the CC cop or bobsnox, and they would either be a cop or scum. If we lynch the cop, we lynch the confirmed scum the next day. If we lynch the scum, we protect the cop during the night, forcing the Mafia to use their NK on somepony else. <br>I thought of a way that might not work in this game, and will bring it up in <strike>a second</strike>now. I'll just keep it organized by #: It may not work in this game because it is not an open game, and ther may be more than one cop. However, I will stress that in THAT game, where ALL THE ROLES ARE UNIQUE and there is ONLY ONE COP, this tactic works perfectly. <br>3) I Do find his play style scummy-- or rather, I find it clean, and \"smart\" and it pisses me off and I don't like it. I want it to not be scummy because if he's scum I'll never catch him. I'll ISO him at somepoint maybe, and see if I can find scum tells or something in it, but My real problem with him is that he looks too good and it is making my gut ache. <br><br>[preedit]: Personal survival beyond Day 1 as town is a personal goal."}

Typically the Mafia member will try to be friendly in some way, either outright or, more often, subtly. If the Mafia member is ever lynched at some point, and other players have noticed the buddying, it tends to throw suspicion on the person the Mafia was being friendly towards, thereby causing confusion even after the Mafioso's death. </div></blockquote><br><br>If you are accusing me and Whiskers of buddying, you are accusing one of us of being town.  SO either we're buddying, or we're both scum.  One or the other.  Not both.<br><br>which is it?"}

Although the interactions between Whiskers and yourself from post 270ish to 272 is still an interesting read from my standpoint, not sure it's at the level I thought it was.  <br><br>That being said, I love the fact that you jumped from Bobsnox's wagon to the most inactive easy-lynch wagon in the day, being MusicNinja's.

Post what had your vote on her early on in the game, and any other scum reads you have.  if you can't then why have you been gunning for her so hard for so long?<br><br>As per your points listed, 1. Idgaf if you're town or scum, you don't want to die.  Dying as scum means you're probably more likely to lose.  Dying as town means you're out of the game and no longer get to enjoy the experience.  If someone ISN'T scared shitless when they're getting lynched, I'd be worried.  That means they are up to something, and they WANT to die.  It usually means their partner is bussing them, or they have some role whose action takes place upon their death.  So you do have a point.  She did have a rather high sense of self-preservation.  I find that a null read.  if she hadn't had a high sense of preservation, I would have found it scummy. Also you're whole pr/scum theory.  How do you know she isn't PR?  Is there some rule that says there is one town-aligned player that isn't Vanilla Townie?  I must have missed the memo, as I have played many games with multiple PRs.<br><br>Your second point, she already cleared up with saying that she was quoting her attitude from a previous game.  I believe this is the one you said you conceded on?  And you're whole \"not trade cop for scum d1\" is complete personal opinion.  If I was in a game, where there was guaranteed no more than 1 cop, no bastard modding, and no fake role PMs were given, and two people claimed cop seriously Day 1, I would be gunning for lynching one of them.  If you hit the mafia, you can have a doctor on the real cop, or if you hit the real cop, any interactions the fake one made the day before with other players can be carefully scrutinized to find their partners.  Personal preference of play style does not a scum-tell make.<br><br>Point 3, I already clarified this."}

So I don't see your willingness to die as scummy, on the contrary.  That being said I still think you're scum.<br><br>And my biggest case against Whiskers is that for the first 1-6 pages she defended, defended, defended, and didn't scum hunt at all.  That was my biggest complaint with her play at the beginning.  She's way too interested in self preservation to be town, unless she's a PR, which I believe is unlikely at this point in time. (to be clear I don't want her to claim at this point if she is, lest I be accused of rolefishing.)<br><br>Also I understand she attempted to clarify the three points which you obviously don't agree with, but you have to understand that I'm skeptical of most explanations because they've always got a self-preservation mode behind them.  I conceded the point I thought she won on, but still hold her to be scummy for the other two reasons and her dedication to self preservation.  <br><br>I don't think you're an idiot, I never really meant to make this personal with you or Whiskers.  Just doing scumhunting in the only ways I know how.  Don't claim to be all knowing here, I just don't trust people's motivations in telling me to change my mind."}

You said it had been discussed already. I really beg to differ. You just accepted whatever Substrike said without acknowledging what he was talking about and in the end admitted that you defended Maruchan through a scum tactic, known as a chainsaw defense (attacking the attacker of your scum partner, if anyone has a better definition feel free to give it). So now I'll ask you again why did you defend Maruchan and what makes you so sure that Maruchan is town to the extent that Substrike is scummy for voting him?"}

Its like the point I made with substrike.  I can say he claimed scum and he told us his partners name all I want, but none of you should BELIEVE me unless I provide proof that he has done so.  You should ALL go to his defense and say \"Where does he say that?\".<br><br>Its not that I am trying to rush a lynch, I truly think musicninja is scummy.  I think scummy people deserve to be lynched. IE: I think we should lynch this spot.  So yes I will be advocating a lynch for him. Thats what I do when I see someone scummy.  I advocate to get them lynched.  THe reason I don't want to wait for a replacement?  I HONESTLY BELIEVE that that slot is scummy, therefore I don't see a possible way for that slot to remove its scummieness.  Anyone who thinks a replacement can fix the scummieness, must not believe the slot is scum, in which case why would you want them lynched?  And if the spot IS scummy then a replacement coming in for a week won't change that, and it would suck for the replacement to repalce into a game, re-read 485 posts, then immediately get lynched out due to his predecessor's play."}

Suggests that he had no actual interest in the answer to this question, and was simply trying to make himself look useful.<br><br>From <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3327819#p3327819\" class=\"postlink\">Post #340</a>: \"If he is town, its quite easy to figure out where to go, it'd be someone on his wagon\" sounds an awful lot like scum defending lynchbait town to me.<br><br>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328216#p3328216\" class=\"postlink\">Post #348</a> he lists Scumhunter as one of his top suspects, then when asked for reasons he immediately retracts this read in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328363#p3328363\" class=\"postlink\">Post #356</a>, which is rather ironic considering his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3321433#p3321433\" class=\"postlink\">reason for voting Friend</a>. <br><br>His voting follows a general pattern of not paying the slightest attention to the bigger picture; he doesn't seem to be aware of the game state beyond the most recent pages. He'll vote one person based on a single post, then drop that entirely to vote someone else based on a single post, and so on. He's making it up as he goes along; this is not town behaviour. <br><br>I think I may have persuaded myself into changing my vote.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MusicNinja</span><br><br>Well, you already know where I stand with this one. He used the word 'yet', he's scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Noramp</span><br><br>His sequence of posts from <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3298748#p3298748\" class=\"postlink\">#86</a> to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3308794#p3308794\" class=\"postlink\">#155</a> feels town to me; clearly I agree with his stance on monk, which is a good start, but not necessarily proof of townness. But the fact that he picks out Scumhunter's town read on monk, which was one of a number of reads Scumhunter gave without explanation, and asks for reasoning, that doesn't seem like scum behaviour to me. I'd expect scum to demand reasons for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">all</span> of Scumhunter's reads, whereas it makes a lot more sense that for a town player, the one that they disagree with would stand out. <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3327100#p3327100\" class=\"postlink\">Post #327</a>: I guess it was Noramp that said this, not Scumhunter. My bad.<br><br>Overall, no real issues here.

Its like the point I made with substrike.  I can say he claimed scum and he told us his partners name all I want, but none of you should BELIEVE me unless I provide proof that he has done so.  You should ALL go to his defense and say \"Where does he say that?\".<br><br>Its not that I am trying to rush a lynch, I truly think musicninja is scummy.  I think scummy people deserve to be lynched. IE: I think we should lynch this spot.  So yes I will be advocating a lynch for him. Thats what I do when I see someone scummy.  I advocate to get them lynched.  THe reason I don't want to wait for a replacement?  I HONESTLY BELIEVE that that slot is scummy, therefore I don't see a possible way for that slot to remove its scummieness.  Anyone who thinks a replacement can fix the scummieness, must not believe the slot is scum, in which case why would you want them lynched?  And if the spot IS scummy then a replacement coming in for a week won't change that, and it would suck for the replacement to repalce into a game, re-read 485 posts, then immediately get lynched out due to his predecessor's play.</div></blockquote><br>I'm bored. <br>Usachan, can you make a vote and write up a case on somepony?"}

That said, it's still probably going to take me an hour or two to write and edit my post. I'm going to ISO everyone now in alphabetical order. At the end, I will then have my rankings in order of scum likelihood. I'll also ask that everyone read my signature and note the information there.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">bobsnox</span>: You've got such a meager post count and you are hardly scumhunting at all. Now you claimed <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3322404#p3322404\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> that you play like this with an investigative role to stay under the radar and stay alive, but the problem with that statement is that your activity didn't increase at all once you claimed. Might as well get cracking if the cat is out of the bag anyway, no?<br><br>Furthermore, I was never really sold on the notion that you would have waited longer to claim if you were scum. L-2 seems close enough to L-1 that you wouldn't want to take the risk.<br><br>Also, your votes have been only on Whiskers and MusicNinja, whom I've got a town read and a null read on, respectively, but I'll get to that later. You never really made any attempt to explain the MN vote and then eventually went back to Whiskers, who really isn't even all that suspicious.<br><br>Even so, the fact remains that you have claimed cop and short of a counter-claim, a lynch on you is just dumb right now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Friend</span>: This guy seems pretty legit. Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not one for succinct players, because that is generally the antithesis of my play-style, I don't think it is at all indicative of scum, it just makes it kind of harder to read a person. It can be harder for scum to slip up when they don't say much and it's harder to discern reasoning from town, though admittedly not to a detrimental level. Though it is hard to ISO this type of player because almost everything they say is extremely high-context.<br><br>Honestly, I've got a town read here because most of the shit you've said is stuff I've agreed with, with certain exceptions which will be made clear. I also like how you've tried to steer conversation in the right direction, rather than let what you perceived as a town v. town argument squander precious time <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3330342#p3330342\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, though I don't actually agree with the assessment that Substrike is town. But I'll get to that later. <br><br>Your logic <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3330448#p3330448\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> is sound too, granted the frustration there does nothing for the argument either way, as it could be an act by scum as easily as it could be genuine frustration from town.<br><br>Nothing else jumped out at me and like I said, a player like you is fucking hard as shit to ISO.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">iamusername</span>: I was pretty much sold on him from the moment he explained his town read on Whiskers, though I admit to being wary of him before that.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3304472#p3304472\" class=\"postlink\">These</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3307506#p3307506\" class=\"postlink\">three</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3335158#p3335158\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a> in particular are incredibly insightful to me and they definitely gave me some things to think about. The first post was pretty close to my reads at the time, regarding the probability of scum on the Whiskers wagon, with the obvious exception of LTP. The second one brought the strong defense to Whiskers that I was thinking of myself. Scum simply aren't likely to look a gift horse (or pony, in this case) in the mouth like Whiskers did. The third one just showed a lot of thought. I didn't agree with all of it, but it definitely showed that you were putting the effort in.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Maruchan</span>: You kind of try to get in well with Panacea and Whiskers the entire time, but as I read you, I sort of just got a town feel. Despite this feeling, it seems like you've done little more than defend Whiskers, soft-claim, and push for a MusicNinja lynch, despite your post count. As a result, your only about null, leaning town for me. Seems like scum would have supported a Whiskers lynch, considering how easy it would have been.<br><br>In regard to the soft-claim, I really don't see why you are deciding not just claim in this situation. What about tomorrow makes it so that you have to wait until then to claim? It's looking kind of suspicious to me. But if nothing else, I think it's still reason enough not to lynch you today.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Monk</span>: He starts out by assaulting Panacea for not having a vote down, which I don't see as a scumtell at all that early on. There's really no need to start a potential bandwagon that could get out of contol so early on. Bad enough it almost happened with Whiskers, MusicNinja, and bobsnox as early in the day as those wagons nearly came into fruition. There's nothing wrong with a little caution.<br><br>The lack of content from him also has me keeping my eye on him. Also, post such as <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328363#p3328363\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3330381#p3330381\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> really don't do a lot for you. It's been covered why it's suspicious by others, so in the interest of time, I'm going to leave it at that. <br><br>On the other hand, you've said a few pretty townie things, such as <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3330439#p3330439\" class=\"postlink\">attemptng to hold off on a MusicNinja lynch until he is replaced</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3317716#p3317716\" class=\"postlink\">telling off Friend for needing to be prompted to discuss his suspects</a>.<br><br>Due to the conflicting nature of these, I've got only a slight scum read on you.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">MusicNinja</span>: From the one game I've played with him, I definitely think he should be more active than this, but he was the Doc then, so he could have been more into it as a result. What I find particularly interesting is that he is in no other games right now, yet is not posting here, even though he's been online just the other day to celebrate the town vctory in the game we were in together. I feel that either he is a bored Vanilla or overwhelmed scum. But given his posts, I'm somehow inclined towards the former. I could totally see him saying the stuff he said town. I mean, the guy did soft-claim Doctor in our last game at the mere mention of the role, so I kind of see him as down for some questionable shit. At the same time, I don't want to rule out the scum possibility though. He's pretty null for me right now and I'd rather wait for his replacement to decide for sure one way or the other.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">noramp</span>: Putting bob at L-2 and not jumping on the Whiskers wagon early on seem like pretty town moves to me. Ditto for taking MusicNinja off L-1. If you were scum together, you probably would not have let it go on as long as it did. Same would probably been done by any scum if MusicNinja were scum, in all likelihood. Town read for you.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Panacea</span>: Well you certainly do use your vote sparingly, don't you? I can't help but think it's a bit suspicious that your only two votes have been on people that have next to no chance to being lynched. At the same time, this is a plus from you, since scum usually try for a mislynch. You've had considerable opportunity to jump on MusicNinja, yet you haven't. This pleases me. Particulary <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3335812#p3335812\" class=\"postlink\">this one.</a><br><br>Still, I could definitely stand to see more of you. You question a lot of people's moves in a good way, but lack of activity and lack of general pressure certainly aren't helping. Having a vote on someone isn't a great deal of pressure isn't a great way to put pressure on people when wagons are forming all around. I'd think your vote would be better-used placed on one of your suspects. I doubt very much we'll see any sort of quickhammering this early on, since it can be kind of suspicious in general and I imagine most wagons won't get higher than L-2 until we can come to a better consensus anyway.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Scumhunter</span>: This motherfucker right here seems pretty legit. From his first real post, I was pretty much on board with everything he said. I get the feeling that he thinks very similarly to me. One of my favorite things from him was easily <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328390#p3328390\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, because not long before it, I was thinking \"Why the fuck do I think that Substrike is town? He doesn't really do shit, he's just kind of there.\" His scumhunting seems really solid, which is extremely fitting, give his name.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Substrike22</span>: First of all, I disagree with every vote he's made in the game. Granted, he hasn't hopped on the MusicNinja wagon, but he's been riding Whiskers so fucking hard that it's barely even relevant and at this point would probably just look more suspicious than anything. I've seen little of value from him and I get the feeling that he's scum. <br><br>Oh, and saying that defending yourself as town is a scumtell is total fucking bullshit. I fucking do it all the time. There's no reason a townie should want a lynch wasted on the only person they can confirm for themselves is town. I fucking do it all the time. Letting yourelf die needlessly is just fucking dumb.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Tovarish</span>: His entire case against Whiskers never really felt that great and the best he seems to bring against anyone is some petty shit that's barely even evidence, as seen in posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3316662#p3316662\" class=\"postlink\">#232</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3328751#p3328751\" class=\"postlink\">#384</a>.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Whiskers</span>:First off, are you a fucking dude or a chick? Because that question has been nagging at me this entire time. <br><br>In terms of why I think you are town, questioning town reads on you and defending yourself both seem like town moves to me are both things I literally did myself in my last game.<br><br>My reads in order:<br><br>Scum<br>Substrike<br>Bobsnox<br>Tovarish<br>Monk<br>Noramp<br>Maruchan<br>Panacea<br>MusicNinja<br>Friend<br>Iamusername<br>Scumhunter<br>Whiskers<br>Town<br><br>The middle is sort of a jumble of order because I've got a few that are sort of really close. With time, I should be able to refine them, but I'm pretty firm on my top 3 and bottom 3."}

I took a bunch of extra hours at work these past two weeks since I move into my apartment next week and get to start paying university tuition again. Work calms tomorrow, though, so I should have more availability (with the exception of Wed. when I move. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> ). I hate excuses, I'm really sorry. I'll do better soon.</div></blockquote><br>No need to apologies. Life comes first and I understand very well the hassles of moving and college. I'm going through a similar stage in life myself.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite>@Substrike: A lot of my town-ish feel on Whiskers comes from the fact that I think he's probably just one of those reckless players, because a lot of his actions fit the \"too scummy to be scummy,\" box. You definitely don't see this as a possibility?</div></blockquote><br>I can tell you right now that if Substrike's got any sense, he's going to immediately dismiss that towntell as too WIFOM. Which isn't an entirely incorrect assessment. He may even disregard my meta read under the basis that meta can be changed to fool people. Though I'd be quick to point out that one who purposely throws away their town chances every game to try to improve their scum chances, especially in a manner that clearly doesn't work very well such as this, is a fool among fools and I wouldn't put Whiskers in that category.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite>And since you are (apparently) a PR, I can imagine why you'd want to not get yourself lynched.</div></blockquote> That's the second time you've mentioned this, when we were lucky enough that no one appeared to mention it when it actually happened. I don't feel that this is good town play.</div></blockquote><br>That's not completely true. His soft-claim was mentioned several times. And I can assure you, any scum worth his salt out there likely picked up on it the first time, if not the next few times it was slapped in our faces. He hasn't exactly been subtle about it. Better we get it out in the open so that he can be better protected tonight if he is essential.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite>First off, are you a fucking dude or a chick?

O.o</div></blockquote><br>As it happens, I've read Whiskers as male. The point, though, is that his gender is irrelevant to Whiskers's play-- correct, Whiskers? On the subject, though, Whiskers, would you prefer \"his/her, he/she, him/her,\" or does it matter? When I played with <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11373\" class=\"postlink\">Furry</a>, Furry didn't mind, and I just used Furry's name as much as possible so gender never came into play.</div></blockquote><br>Of course, gender in general is fairly irrelevant. But it's still a nagging curiousity that has been eating at me since I read that other game. If I honestly just played the brony odds though, I'd put my money on dude.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite>gender is irrelevant to Whiskers's play</div></blockquote><br>this. <br><br>Furthermore, I think it's cute that you all use the terms \"chick\" and \"dude.\" To quote Ouran, \"I'll just call everyone dude and bro now.\"</div></blockquote><br>This does nothing to sate my curiosity. It is an eternal mystery, apparently.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>I would make a case, but my case would be on MusicNinja.  and I think that THAT boat has been played enough already.  I don't think I can squeeze anything out of his few posts that haven't already been said.</div></blockquote><br>Do you have nobody else you can make acase against? If not, look at those that I or another have made cases against. ISO them and check the evidence. See if our claims hold up. Don't be afraid to double-check another person's work. You never know when you might be dealing with scum or if someone is mistaken on an issue.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>Also I think the lack of a replacement from musicninja's spot has SOMETHING to do with the fact that A: its so much catch-up to read, and B: even if they do read it and replace in musicninja is the prime scum suspect of many players, so it is disillusioning to join a game just to be lynched, causing prospective joinees to not want to replace him.</div></blockquote><br>Truth be told, I actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">wanted</span> that slot.

I am a charming devil, you see. I'd highly advise our cop, assuming bobsnox is telling the truth, check me tonight. Believe me when I say the last person you want in a MyLo situation is an unconfirmed Hikari Link. Scum love to use the \"too town\" scumtell against me. At least, that's what I wanted to say to that, but it would have been too risky, as I will soon get into. <br><br>In reality, I just really wish you guys hadn't believed in me so hard, not that I hold it against you, because I have to claim cop right now. I was really hoping I could hold off on it for a while, but I'm just too damn good at coming off town and while there is next to no chance of me being lynched today, I can't take the chance that I will get killed during the night.

While I admit that there could be two Cops, I'm very much willing to bet otherwise. <br><br>I really wanted to save my claim until tomorrow to see if we got a fake read from bobsnox so that we'd have another confirmed townie, but there are just too many factors that could make that gambit useless.

That plus I'm gambling that even if we don't have a Doctor/Jailkeeper/etc, the Mafia won't target me for fear of one.

That is the ONLY posy he has made in over a week, and before it the only posts he has made since this game STARTED, are in this game</div></blockquote><br>What does that have to do with you claiming he flaked in other games?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite>And since you are (apparently) a PR, I can imagine why you'd want to not get yourself lynched.</div></blockquote> That's the second time you've mentioned this, when we were lucky enough that no one appeared to mention it when it actually happened.

Better we get it out in the open so that he can be better protected tonight if he is essential.</div></blockquote><br>I honestly still have no idea what you guys are talking about</div></blockquote><br>Whiskers already brought it up.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>I would make a case, but my case would be on MusicNinja.  and I think that THAT boat has been played enough already.

If not, look at those that I or another have made cases against. ISO them and check the evidence. See if our claims hold up. Don't be afraid to double-check another person's work.

I was really hoping I could hold off on it for a while, but I'm just too damn good at coming off town and while there is next to no chance of me being lynched today, I can't take the chance that I will get killed during the night. The truth is I basically jumped out of my seat the moment bobsnox claimed cop. While I admit that there could be two Cops, I'm very much willing to bet otherwise. <br><br>I really wanted to save my claim until tomorrow to see if we got a fake read from bobsnox so that we'd have another confirmed townie, but there are just too many factors that could make that gambit useless. I could die during the night and you might immediately call for his blood, or worse, you could keep him alive on the off-chance that he is a Cop. You guys could call bullshit tomorrow under the belief that I should have claimed today. He could claim he got roleblocked, making my wait useless. There could be a Framer and he could be a real fucking Cop. Or any number of other things. <br><br>It's far less risky to claim now and hope I can garner some sort of protection from a Doc or Jailkeeper or someone. Even if I get roleblocked, I can assure you I'm still extremely useful to have around alive. Not to toot my own horn, but I am rather good at scumhunting, considering all of my experience until now has come as a vanilla townie. That plus I'm gambling that even if we don't have a Doctor/Jailkeeper/etc, the Mafia won't target me for fear of one. And in the worst case scenario that they do, it's still a Cop for scum trade, which I'll fucking take any day of the week.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Substrike22</span>, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: bobsnox</span></div></blockquote><br>facedesk<br>facedesk<br>facedesk<br>facedesk<br>facedesk<br><br>I thought I said if there is a cop out there, to not CC bob.</div></blockquote><br>You did say that.

What I said was \"Way to fucking paint a target on my back for the night kill guys.\" Who are scum going to target? bobsnox? No. He's probably scum and even if he isn't, any existing Doc would likely target him. Maruchan? Possible, but I have some reasons I'd rather not put out there just in case they are true.

Since we have two cop claims already, I figure I can just go ahead and say it out loud, what I think.</div></blockquote><br>I highly doubt we have 2-3 cops. I've got a theory about that which I was trying to keep under my hat until he claims. I was thinking that if bobsnox is Cop and died tonight, he would claim Doctor and say that he had placed his protection elsewhere. So if bobsnox does flip Cop, Maruchan is my top pick. Unless he wants to go ahead and claim something else. If he flips scum, I have a couple theories that I would rather keep quiet for now.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>... saying I would be willing to claim tomorrow is softclaiming?<br><br>good to know for future reference.</div></blockquote><br>It is. Scum aren't going to claim and vanilla townies don't need to claim.

Which would save a REAL (insert role you want to believe I am here) from being rolecopped, roleblocked, or killed.<br><br>So on that note I will commence promptly ignoring any hypothesizing on the topic of my role PM.</div></blockquote><br>You can say that, but if you are willing to claim tomorrow, that implies that your shit is dependent on Night 1. It looks like you could be scum setting the stage for a fake claim tomorrow. Just putting it out there.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>So, that was a softclaim for VT? <br><br>No, I understand WHY. Just, making the softclaim in the first place makes us (me) curious.

I won't just go at the beginning of the day \"I'm a -censored-\"</div></blockquote><br>That's certainly not how it sounded before. If you are a vanilla townie, you really shouldn't try t pose as a power role just to distract the Mafia, especially when you don't make an actual claim. You can make yourself look like scum and distract town power role. Like I said, it makes you look like scum waiting for some sort of flip tomorrow in the eyes of the town, which if anything, decreases your chances of being targeted by scum at night."}

I usually do kills that incriminate someone else, or that are unlikely to have any chance of having a doctor or jailkeeper on them.</div></blockquote><br>As far as I'm concerned, only bad town fall for the former because only bad Mafia make kills that incriminate themselves. It's too WIFOM to consider that kind of kill as a tell either way, so best to just look at the content of a player's actions. And the unclaimed, I would have fallen in the latter half too an extent. But it's far better to keep alive people that other people are suspicious of rather than killing one at random. When there are multiple relatively unsuspected people and a claimed Cop, scum have very good chances of hitting any one of those and it is generally worth the gamble to try for one of them and then push for a mislynch during the day.

But then I realized that only works if I I had been trying to make sure it looked like a Doc exists for some reason.

If you are scum, however, we lose our cop because I die for sure. So to chart this out:<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Link Plan</span><br>scumMaruchan: Keep cop, gain a report (possibility of Godfather lynch)<br>townMaruchan: Lose JK, no report<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Whiskers Plan</span><br>scumMaruchan: Lose cop, no JK, no report<br>townMaruchan: Lose JK, no report (possibility keep both)<br><br>My plan stands to gain more if you are scum. Whiskers's plan stands to gain more if, and only if, a Doc exists. Otherwise, it's just a worse version of my plan. That in itself is an unknown gamble and you said yourself that I'm more important to the town than you, did you not? So it stands to reason that the plan that keeps me alive over you is the better one, no?"}

The only difference is Whiskers plan gives us AN option of 1 cleared (banking on you and me both being town, which I think is the most likely scenario), and possible dead cop. Your plan gives us NO clears, and has no risk of losing cop.</div></blockquote><br>I'm fairly certain that by the logic that I might not be Cop, it's literally impossible to clear you as long as you live, so the point about clears is moot.</div></blockquote><br>Thats why I said the only way I am cleared is if we are both town.  In YOUR mind you know you're a cop( unless you're scum in which case I'm willing to throw in the tall now), so if you get no report, and you don't die, and we use Whiskers method, in YOUR mind you know I am clear 100%</div></blockquote><br>In my mind, yes. But that says nothing to the benefit of the town. And since your possibility chart included me as scum, which couldn't happen in my mind anyway, thn you can see how the list is fundamentally flawed. It's results either all need to be determined by me or all need to be determined by the town.<br><blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>hmmm, Town xvart, most definitely, ftm.</div></blockquote><br>He's looking pretty scummy to me. I can see no reason why town would try to fish for a response when they could just as easily get themselves lynched.<br><blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>Maru, I think it's likely that the scum targeted musicninja because that kill would give us no information and were banking on a doctor</div></blockquote><br>I disagree. He was a suspect for many, so a mislynch would not have been out of the question. Someone everyone thinks is town like Scumhunter or possibly Friend would have been a better target. <br><blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>I do not believe there would be a Doctor in this setup, Jailkeep/Cop combination is rather powerful imo</div></blockquote><br>I agree. But there could easily be a Doc in a set-up where there is no Jailkeeper.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>We're also going off of the assumption here that if either of us is scum, we would try to kill the other one.  Which, as we're both smart mofos, we wouldn't.  If I was scum, I would hope we had a Mafia Roleblocker, in which case I would have him roleblock you, and kill a random so you think you got jailed by me.</div></blockquote><br>If a blocker existed, I would have been blocked last night. Unless you are town, in which case you would have been blocked. If I were Mafia, I'd kill you because it wouldn't implicate me in any way and if you are Mafia, you'd kill me because if I wasn't roleblocked tonight, you'd be lynched anyway.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>Monk&amp;xvart for remaining scum. (with possible 1 more).  If monk had said \"I think there is a doc and Maruchan is scum, and xvart is just being caught in Maruchan's cross-fire\", I wouldn't have lumped him with scum.  But the fact that monk both believes xvart is town, and believes my claim, comes off as uber fishy.</div></blockquote><br>Pretty sure I said monk is town, so unless you are saying he's Godfather. I'm really close to just calling for a Maruchan lynch today, but that could end badly if he's just town fucking up. I think at this point, we should probably go with the xvart lynch and have the Doc and Maruchan on me tonight."}

If you are a town JKer there is no doctor in this setup. If there is, it is horribly town sided with two roles that can prevent a kill (one of which can prevent it from two directions) thereby blocking the scum NK ~1/4 of the time on night 1 and even higher as the game goes on and neither of them are lynched/killed.

I'll call it good for now and let it digest with people. I'm really interested to hear how other people take this analysis. xvart and Maruchan are free to comment, but I'm really more intereested in the people who I'm not calling scum have to say.

Its important</div></blockquote>I think I've already explained what I believe to have happened, but I'll elaborate more this time. I think your team decided to no kill last night with you being scum roleblocker under the guise of confirming yourself (although not really since I don't have an ability). You probably picked me for the reasons you said: a player slot highly suspected so it makes you look town plus you don't have to worry about getting a competent player coming in and disrupting your teams mojo if you had the town looking in different directions already. Then, your \"jailkeep\" of me gets me lynched and I flip town. Oops you say, well you suppose I could have been the NK target. Plus, I think you were already locked into claiming today with your little attempted save on bobsnox that almost worked so you absolutely had to claim something because you would have looked terrible if there was a night kill and then didn't claim under whatever pretext you would have made up (or claimed JKer with no conclusive evidence which would then prompt the \"why did you claim or why were you so eager to claim?\"). Meanwhile, the town erupts into chaos and yields nothing concrete to help them today. It's the perfect scum play: get a suspected townie lynch with little liability and create chaotic smokescreen to distract the town for an entire day.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 805 wrote:</cite>It is possible that this setup is horribly town sided.  They only have to pass a normalcy check to be allowed in the normal queue.  Not a balance check.  Also, link me to any wiki page which directly says that in making a setup a doctor should not be put with a jailer.  Since you're biggest attack here is that the wiki is where I get most of my information, mind me a wiki page that says it.  If you find one, I will self-vote and call myself scum.  Or even find me a signature that links to a page that says that.</div></blockquote>You're taking what I said out of context. You said you do a lot of reading on the site. It isn't too hard of a stretch to think you would have come across games where this was discussed or even the MD forum where it is discussed. For someone cruising the forum for gambits I assumed you would also have a fundamental understanding of balance. I have neither moderated a game nor designed a setup but even thinking about the setup with a doctor AND a jailkeeper is ridiculous because of what I said before: \"with two roles that can prevent a kill (one of which can prevent it from two directions) thereby blocking the scum NK ~1/4 of the time on night 1 and even higher as the game goes on and neither of them are lynched/killed.\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 805 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Nice condescending undertone.</div></blockquote><br>My specialty.

You say you wouldn't have mentioned it D1 if there wasn't a NK last night. How could you predict something that hasn't happened yet to base what you are claiming prior to said event happening unless... wait for it... you are scum.<br><br>And you didn't say I was an easy lynch. You said \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3354603#p3354603\" class=\"postlink\">You were the top scum suspect of almost EVERY player here</a>\" which wouldn't make for a difficult lynch to put through.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan, 806 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers Case wrote:</cite>This post reads to me as pushing a bogus case and asking to be convinced it is bogus under the guise of pressure.

First of all, it has nothing to do with the case on you now; since everything I've commented about you now has transpired after that point in the game.

You may confirm his role (RBer) but you will not confirm his alignment; plus you will get a blocked cop. <br><br>Maybe Whiskers is the final scum match with Maruchan. Maruchan is sweating because I've nailed his plan/thought process down pat and if Whiskers is the other scum he is trying to direct all night actions, too; since upon my flip everything will be thrown in upheaval and their plan will have monumentally backfired so they need the town to have as little information as possible.[/speculation]<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link, 864 wrote:</cite>More like you started looking scummy.

And I've already provided reasoning for why scum would target me today; and why scum would claim a RB on me and still get an easy out when I flip town; the second of which is the most likely possibility.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>The third--!

It's not like his claim depended on the nightkill. </div></blockquote>You apparently missed the part where he said he wasn't going to claim if there was a night kill. Great; you would have held him to that, but his intention was clear: he wasn't going to claim if there was a night kill after he said he was going to claim no matter what as long as he lived through the night. And, a scum player is going to claim JKer if they are a RBer 90% of the time, so if he is so insistent on breadcrumbing he should have been less concerned about breadcrumbing his role and outting himself and been focused more on breadcrumbing actions. But again, Maruchan isn't concerned with dying during the night for some strange (read obvious) reason. He got locked into a claim trying to save a buddy and then had to deal with the ramifications when it didn't swing his way.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Here's another question, for all you game-balance types (I'm looking at you, x-vart.) <br><br>How balanced would it be if it were all vanilla townies and scums, except for one Jailkeeper? Just curious. Would that be unbalanced?</div></blockquote>What's the point or relevance of this question? I'm not a game designer but I can easily recognize an lopsided game. I would assume it would be moderately balanced but slightly scum favored since, from what I remember, mountainous games are scum favored (not sure if it is significantly scum favored) but a JKer would only be able to block/prevent a NK and not carry the risks of blocking town PRs. Therefore, I would assume that the natural advantage of scum in mountainous games would be offset slightly by the JK protection/blocking capabilities; but it depends on how scum favored mountainous games are to begin with. But the difference between your example and a game with a cop/doc/JKer is comparing apples and oranges. As I've said, a JK/doc combo will block, assuming a random NK target nearly a quarter of the time with 12 players remaining (1 doctor protection, 1 roleblock, and one JK protection). Add in a cop to catch scum and you have a town orgy of power."}

If he flips town, I'll take responsibility when we get to MyLo/LyLo by accepting my own lynch, but we simply can't leave any uncertainty on the Maruchan slot. As I've already said, if I'm not certain that Maruchan is jailing me, I am using my investigate on him. Even if I get back a town result, I'm going to assume Godfather. Scumhunter, you must understand that even though we gain a marginal mechanical advantage, we give the scum a chance to take advantage if this is a gambit on their part, and worse yet, you divide the town.

There is at least one Vanilla scum (bobsnox flip) and at leastr one vanilla townie (standard rules of Mini Normal), but the other two (or three!) scum could all be scum PRs. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Doc + Cop + JK isn't super overpowered when the Mafia has roles identical to, more powerful than, or that can defeat, them.</span> (Example--Doc is overcome by roleblocker, Strongman, or Macho-variant townie roles.

Also, why is there \"likely a scum RB\", all of a sudden? There wasn't before. <br>Hasn't Maru been pushing for the xvart slot (On Day 1?)? More importantly, Friend (goodtown #1, the original goodtown player (the other two replaced in).) has been pushing for the xvart slot. He should be back from V/LA soon, so I'd reccomend him as a cop-vestigation candidate. <br><br>monk, since you're suddenly sure of a Scum roleblocker, what if he roleblocks Maruchan? Then Maruchan can't roleclock Hikari Link, then Hikari Link gets a read, and we lynch Maruchan, Town Jailkeeper. <br><br>Look. If you throw a doc into the mix, we DO get info on whether xvart is scum or not, because we're lynching him today. Then we will have that information. YOU, however, are just trying to confuse us. You added in the possiblility of a scum roleblocker (from out of nowhere, so I suspect it's you), so maybe Marucha nnot blocking HikariLink DOESN'T mean he's scum-- <br><br>Mafia Roleblocker is a much less common role that Doc. Who says there's even a Doc anyway? <br>Haoala did. <br><br>How about you tell us what his coded message meant. Hm?"}

I keep hearing arguments for me possibly being scum on the basis that I could have bussed bobsnox D1 to gain towncred. The problem there is that makes no sense. As I stated when I claimed, people were already starting to like my posts, so I had a pretty good in with the town. Furthermore, scum was already claimed Cop with no counter-claim. For starters, I'm not stupid enough to take the gamble that the Cop hadn't claimed already when I as town I wouldn't claim until D2 if necessary and at least Maruchan felt the same (also, his soft-claim could've been Cop and he could've been waiting for the bobsnox report to reveal, as I originally intended). That's an effective gamble of two scum for some paltry towncred when I already had towncred and bobsnox also had towncred. From there, the night actions would've depended greatly on what the special Mafia roles are. That's an infinitely safer play than claiming Cop, getting my scum partner killed, then apparently giving an innocent verdict on my scum partner, as people seem to be claiming.<br><br>Back in the regular perspective now. Now the above doesn't at all remove the possibility that things went that way, it just means that if it's true I'm a far worse player than I've been given credit for being. Now I admit that if xvart flips scum, that it is highly unlikely that Maruchan is scum, but I really can't see any chain of events last night that makes sense leading up to today. Let's look at what happened if every claim is true.<br><br>1. I got a report.<br>2. No night kill happened.<br>3. xvart got jailed.<br><br>1. Now for all of those to be true, that means that either a. xvart was scum performing the kill (unlikely because he had a great deal of scumreads on him, I think) or b. xvart was the kill target (unliely because a mislynch on him would've been easy) or c. there was a Doctor save (not unlikely if the Mafia came after the claimed Cop, but unlikely if a jailkeeper exists) or d. no kill was submitted (unlikely unless there was a scum gambit). <br><br>2. It also means that if there is a roleblocker he a. targeted Maruchan (which would mean option only 1c or 1d can be true) or b. targeted me (which means that xvart is the roleblocker) or c. targeted a random player (makes no sense wit a claimed PR and a soft-claimed PR) or d. targeted nobody (why would that happen?).<br><br>Now consider how these look from my perspective. 1a is something I just can't see happening and the same for 1b. I'll fully admit that it is possible, but they just seem so highly unlikely that I think you can see where my suspicion would come from. 1c seems possible to me, but I simply don't see the likelihood if Maruchan is legit, which I'll get into soon. 1d makes no sense if Maruchan is legit. Why no kill when they don't even know a Jailkeeper is going to claim? What possible gambit is there to be had and why haven't they made there move yet?<br><br>Now let's look at 1c or 1d deeper if Maruchan was scum. Now my assumption from the beginning has been that his claim was due to an unsuccessful kill on my last night as a result of the Doctor and that he never planned to claim if I died, only if I lived. I believe that 1c occurred, only that it happened with Maruchan as scum. On the other hand, I have considered 1d so that he could make his claim guaranteed, but considering that means leaving the Cop untouched for no reason, I really don't see this one as extremely likely anymore.<br><br>Moving on to section 2. 2a seems highly unlikely, since as I've said, I can't imagine 1c or 1d with a town Maruchan. 2b seems unlikely to me as well because it seems like a bad idea to have the kill come in with him even more so if he's already got another important duty. Putting all your eggs in one basket just doesn't make sense when a Jailkeeper/Roleblocker could exist in the town. 2c is unlikely unless they were shooting for the doctor, which seems like a far worse move than targeting either me or town Maruchan. 2d just doesn't even make sense.<br><br>So if you look at my thought process here, you can see why I'd be suspicious of Maruchan. 1a and 1b just don't add up in my mind and seem far too convenient to be be true. No Mafia Roleblocker scenario makes any sense to me either, so it seems unlikely to me that we will see Maruchan framed. <br><br>Hopefully this will help everyone see that I didn't just lose my mind or something and that I actually have a legitimate concern. I'm not even denying that everything could have just went better than expected, but to me that just screams of unlikelihood. If xvart flips scum though, I'll accept the likelihood that Maruchan is town. Especially if he is roleblocker, though even if he's not. In that case, then I'd say Doc on Maruchan (unlikely to exist, but worth a shot) and Maruchan on me. If I die or get a report, then a Maruchan lynch, otherwise, we accept his claim as legit and we can continue onward from there tomorrow."}

And you realize that if I die, I'm confirmed town and there's no reason to think my suspicions are in at all suspicious.

Not offended for being suspected, just surprised is all, any questions about my play I will certainly answer.<br><br>I'm not believing noramp's claim here really. But as a lone scum would he really think he would make it to the endgame as a tracker-claim in this scenario? Not so sure. Don't think its particularly likely but desperate times could call for desperate measures. noramp, one way to help convince me you are town if you are in fact town is to provide some sort of compelling case for who is scum if its not you...<br><br>Noramp, I'd like more specific reads from you other than just \"one of these people are mafia\". Why do you think each of your top suspects is likely scum?"}

As such I'm reading particularly carefully.<br><br>Cause I mean what could've happened was:<br>1. Link replaces in D1 and sees that Bobsnox is floundering and that LTP is also a high candidate on many scum lists.  (his two scum buddies.)<br>2. The town is calling for a cop counter claim on Bobsnox on day 1, Link indulges us.<br>3. Xvart and Link decided in their scumtopic on N1 not to do a kill, or perhaps because they were both replacements, one simply didn't get sent as they hadn't effectively communicated.<br>4. They employ a gambit with the non kill, with Link pushing that a doc must've saved the kill, and that the likeliness of Xvart actually doing the kill (and thus being effectively roleblocked by Maruchan) was slim to none.<br>5. Xvart hammers himself to prevent an awkward situation from coming up with VCA on Link.<br><br>Anyone want to poke a hole in that admittedly outrageous theory?<br><br>Also I'm in the process of doing some important RL things that are kind of interfering.  (i.e. considering joining the USAF)  So, apologies, and if people have something to say on the above bit, I'll have answers and other scum candidates.  Just needed to have something to let you all know I'm here and actually working at the game.</div></blockquote><br>I'll start by saying that there is no way that I'd ever do that as scum. Just letting you know for future reference. That's not a gambit, it's just fucking dumb play.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Substrike22 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Here's to hoping Maruchan didn't actually jail our cop. We really really should have specified that he not jail Link if xvart flipped scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Also, I think this doesn't make any sense what-so-ever.  Though I did not like Maruchan and the feeling was clearly mutual, he was not an idiot.  He would not have jailed Link given the scenarios that he was confronted with.</div></blockquote><br>But he did jail me, so that's irrelevant. I got no result. Wasn't really a bad move anyway. Had I been scum, no kill would have went through. Not like there was really a better choice in terms of suspects.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Noramp wrote:</cite>alright im tracker and last night I tracked Substrike and N1 I tracked monk both went nowhere</div></blockquote><br>Works for me. I don't buy the claim one bit, but as has been stated, this is basically a town win. I fully expect one of us to die tonight, but you should probably declare who you are Tracking so that I don't investigate them myself and increase our town-confirming speed. The reason you declare is in case of  framer. And you know what would really suck? A Ninja.<br><blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Substrike22 wrote:</cite>So you agree with my feelings that one of the two claiming power roles are lying?</div></blockquote><br>Yes, one of the two power roles is lying, I'd like to hear whether Link got any results</div></blockquote><br>I wish people would read my first posts of the day carefully. I'm the claimed cop, of course I'm gonna bring my results out.<br><br>So I'm not really sure in terms of possibility whether or not a Tracker, a Cop, and a Jailkeeper is possible. I want to say it sounds unlikely, but I'd be lying if I said I thought it as implausible as a Jailkeeper, Cop, and Doctor. Point is, there's relly no reason to lynch noramp if he'll just keep confirming townies. It will be annoying as hell to wait it out if he is scum, but if he's not, I imagine both he and I will be night killed in the next two days. Given the current situation, I think Scumhunter, Panacea, or Friend are our best options for a lynch. And of those, I feel like Panacea has the greatest chance of being scum. Reasoning as follows:<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Friend</span>: I've pretty much always read him as town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">iamusername</span>: Pointless for him to bring up that Mafia have no way to win at this point. Unless he's a Ninja or his assertion that all games of this size have 3 Mafia is untrue.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">monk</span>: Confirmed town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Noramp</span>: It's been explained what his fate is destined to be.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Panacea</span>: My gut says maybe and the fact that there's no escape for scum anymore tells me I don't really give a fuck. A perfect town win would be nice, but at the end of the day, a win is a win.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Scumhunter</span>: I'd be lying if I said there wasn't always a pang of suspicion here, but this comes with every player that looks extremely town. There's always gong to be the paranoia that there is some sort of boogeyman scum that is incapable of slipping up.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Substrike22</span>: See monk. Unless of course this set up ends up raping us with 4 scum...<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Tovarish</span>: Seems pretty likely town for obvious reasons. Also want to point out that setting it to invisible removes the last visited date and presumably switching it back will create a new last visited date of when you changed it, so there goes that theory.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Whiskers</span>: Feelings on Whiskers remain unchanged since the beginning of the game. I could be wrong here, but again, I don't give a fuck. It's or win.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Panacea</span><br>Sorry if I'm wrong, but you'll win anyway eventually, so don't even trip."}

We lynch Noramp, likely winning the game and we leave in a small margin for the possibility that we lose, or we wait until he or I confirm almost all town and pretty much guarantee that we win.<br><br>So right now we've got 10 player. 3 are confirmed town, 2 are claimed PRs with the ability to confirm town, and 5 are unknowns. So if we lynched town today, I guarantee that I die or Noramp dies (but noramp is probably scum, so me), since the Mafia aren't going to want two confirmations a day. That leaves us coming into tomorrow with 4 confirmed, 1 claimed PR, and 3 unknowns. From there, we lynch an unknown and the PR dies during the night or a confirmed townie does. That leaves us with 4 confirmed townies, 1 PR, and 1 unknown or 4 confirmed townies and 2 unknowns. From there we can lynch the PR, a confirmed townie will die at night, and we can lynch the final unknown the next day. In an absolute worst-case scenario though, we'd lose if there was a Ninja among us.<br><br>On the other hand, lynching Noramp today means that we can end the game if he is scum, but we'll have to do some actual scumhunting since I'll die tonight and there will be nobody left to confirm town. It will leave us with 3 confirmed town and 5 unknowns. The confirmed are guaranteed to die every night and unknowns lynched every day, so it will progress to 2-4, then 1-3, which is MyLo.<br><br>Both of these are the worst-case scenarios, assuming crazy amounts of town error. The former is clearly the superior method, but the latter is faster if Normap is scum. And should anyone want to entertain the notion that I am scum, remember that I'll be confirming town daily. Oh, and should a PR claim that they were roleblocked at all, they should be lynched immediately, as they lose all usefulness the moment their power stops working and there is no longer any way to confirm that they are town. So I'm sticking with that first idea.<br><br>The following assume I die tonight and the town mislynches everyday and all results are innocent. Based on the plan I presented, I'm going to suggest a Panacea lynch today, Whiskers tracking tonight, and mystery investigation from me in case there is a Framer. Tomorrow I'm dead, we lynch Scumhunter and track Friend. Then I suggest an iamusername lynch or a Noramp lynch if he is still alive. If Noramp was night killed, we need a Friend lynch and if he was not, an iamusername lynch. Unless one of the \"confirmed town\" is a Ninja, we win. This order is what I consider to be the most likely to avoid tracking a Ninja.<br><br>@Scumhunter: I'm not confirmed town. I could have lied about being jailed by Maruchan and thinking bussing bobsnox was a terrible move. I'm not scum, but there's no confirmation that I can see. Tovarish is confirmed town too, since there is no way he could have sent in the kill PM while he was offline.<br><br>@iamusername: Technically, a ninja could still fuck us. Technically."}

I asked if I could do that to which I was denied. I'm not mad about it because it's the mods game and his decision/rule set but I think the godfather should always have final say in who to kill and whom to send to kill.

I will do that in any future games I mod.<br><br>I'll post the role PMs tomorrow, but right now here are my thoughts on the game:<br><br>At the start, I felt like it would be town-sided, but I didn't see it turning into the rout that it did. I LoL'd when Scumhunter pegged the entire scum team on D-1, but I didn't see it devolving into a mechanical \"lynch then out results\" game. Basically, everything that could have gone right for the town did. Even the \"bad\" part of the JK role helped them out when it blocked the scum kill. <br><br>I'm dissapointed with how it turned out in the end. Maybe I should have made the godfather a RBer so that the scum could counter the PR play in the late game. Or maybe I should have made the info roles limited. Either way, I think the town played pretty well this game and deserved to win, but when they started to get ahead it became virtually impossible for the scum to catch up.<br><br>Despite this, I'm pretty pleased with how it went, being my first game modding, and I also appreciate the compliments for running it well, even if the setup was a bit lopsided. If you have any other comments or suggestions about my modding style, I'm open to them. Thanks everybody again.</span></span>"}

The reason I asked to be blocked was two-fold. The first was to make 100% positive. The second was to not die. And as we saw, that ended up rather nicely. Had I died, we couldn't have run that winning gambit and Friend might've got away unnoticed. I would've died for sure if Maruchan hadn't been on me, Normp might have gotten mislynched the next day, and his Tracker claim would've gotten him killed that night."}

A Cop could end the game with an investigation on scum or eliminate a suspect with a successful investigation, while a Jailkeeper only ends the game if he stops a kill from Mafia. Not only that, but if the kill was stopped when it wasn't because Friend was blocked, it could easily lead to a mislynch if the person was reasonably suspicious."}

When I made this game, I didn't realize that both Mini Normals and Mini Themes run on the same number. I picked the first available number for Mini <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Normals</span> which was 1208. However, midway through Papa Zito changed it to 1211 because that was what the actual number was."}
