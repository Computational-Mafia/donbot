The moderator gets 14 votes.<br>\n2) Please use vote tags to place your votes. Bold tags will also be accepted but are not preferred.<br>\n3) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post during the twilight period between the hammer and the closing of the thread.<br>\n4) If unsufficient votes are made on any player, or a majority of votes have been made to no lynch, no lynch will be made.<br>\n5) Nights will last 48 hours.<br>\n6) Do NOT quote any private communication from me, nor any mason, scum, neighbour, or house party topics that may or may not exist. You may paraphrase, just don't copy it wholesale.<br>\n7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>\n8) Days will last 2 weeks, or until a lynch (or no lynch) has been decided on.<br>\n9) Blue is my color. Refrain from using it.<br>\n10) Inform the mod before going V/LA. I will prod you after 48 hours of inactivity, and then again after 24 hours. At that point, I will be forced to replace you.<br>\n11) In the tragic event I drop off the face of the earth, a backup moderator will take my place.<br>\n12) Death is final, but a single contentless \"bah!\" post will be permitted.<br>\n13) The rules can be arbitrarily changed/added to by one party (me) anytime I am feeling greedy and/or evil.<br>\n14) Players may or may not use factional and individual actions simultaneously.<br>\n15) Be nice, and try to enjoy yourself. I will prod you after 48 hours of inactivity, and then again after 24 hours. At that point, I will be forced to replace you.<br>\n<br>\nFailure to abide by these rules is punishable by hours and hours of forced Justin Bieber listening.<br>\n<br>\nThis setup uses daytalk.<br>\n<br>\nExample PM:<br>\n<br>\nYou are a Vanilla Townie.<br>\nYou are aligned with the Town.<br>\nYour only tool is your vote.<br>\nYou win when all anti-town factions are dead and there is at least one town alive.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">GuyFawkes, <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Mafia Tracker</div>, survived and won!<br>\ncamn, <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">1-Shot Bulletproof Godfather</div>, survived and won!</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Ircher, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div>, was lynched Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nKillthestory, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div>, was killed Night 1.<br>\nDeathRowKitty, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Jailkeeper</div>, was killed Night 1.<br>\n<br>\nSnarkySnowman, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div>, was lynched Day 2.<br>\n<br>\nDuppin, <div style=\"display:inline;color:purple\">Serial Killer 1-Shot Strongman</div>, was killed Night 2.<br>\nAlmost50, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div>, was killed Night 2.<br>\n<br>\nThurhame, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Neighbour</div>, was lynched Day 3.<br>\n<br>\nZulfy, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Deputy Neighbour</div>, was killed Night 3.<br>\n<br>\nAristophanes, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Gunsmith</div>, was lynched Day 4.<br>\n<br>\nKatsuki, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div>, was endgamed.<br>\nIraonavp, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Miller Neighbour</div>, was endgamed.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Modkilled</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">EVERYONE DAMNIT</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Song: </div>The Cranberries: Zombie<br>\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ejga4kJUts\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Notes: </div>Welcome to Varied Music Mafia!<br>\n<br>\nReminder that the faction distribution of this setup is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">10:2:1</div>.", "time": "Sat Mar 19, 2016 2:20 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65796&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "65796"}

In fact it would've been scummy -in my bokk- if: a) I backed off BEFORE you claimed, or b) I stayed on the wagon after you claimed neighbour. The logical thing to do when someone claims neighbour is to let their <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">more than one</div> neighbours deal with it.

You've waited too long for people to forget about the details and then tried to bring it up again.

He's my top suspect of the SK role at best, but I can only be sure when he flips.<br>\n<br>\nAs for why I wouldn't vote him: I don't have a proper case. It's a read with some links between players, how they vote, how they argue for/against each other ..etc. Nothing solid to convince anyone. besides, the SK IS likely to vote scum and/or shoot them. Having other killers in the game will always put him in danger, whilst being the only killing role left makes it easier for him. The SK is basically scum hunting just as much as the town is. In fact, even more, because if he dies he loses, while the town can always rely on the \"rest of the team\" to bring in the win, plus they are looking for BOTH the SK AND the mafia, so it's a bit distracting.<br>\n<br>\nPut another way, if I was the SK I'd be only looking for mafia.
