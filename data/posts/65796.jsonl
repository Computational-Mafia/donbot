The moderator gets 14 votes.<br>2) Please use vote tags to place your votes. Bold tags will also be accepted but are not preferred.<br>3) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post during the twilight period between the hammer and the closing of the thread.<br>4) If unsufficient votes are made on any player, or a majority of votes have been made to no lynch, no lynch will be made.<br>5) Nights will last 48 hours.<br>6) Do NOT quote any private communication from me, nor any mason, scum, neighbour, or house party topics that may or may not exist. You may paraphrase, just don't copy it wholesale.<br>7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>8) Days will last 2 weeks, or until a lynch (or no lynch) has been decided on.<br>9) Blue is my color. Refrain from using it.<br>10) Inform the mod before going V/LA. I will prod you after 48 hours of inactivity, and then again after 24 hours. At that point, I will be forced to replace you.<br>11) In the tragic event I drop off the face of the earth, a backup moderator will take my place.<br>12) Death is final, but a single contentless \"bah!\" post will be permitted.<br>13) The rules can be arbitrarily changed/added to by one party (me) anytime I am feeling greedy and/or evil.<br>14) Players may or may not use factional and individual actions simultaneously.<br>15) Be nice, and try to enjoy yourself.

You just parked your vote on me yesterday but you never really attempted to push it anywhere and have been ignoring the main trains for most of the game. Most of your \"content\" is basically calling people out for low content. You claim you could be persuaded to vote on Kats but I'd like you to elaborate on that. What's your read on him?"}

At first I assumed he might be a Neighbor like me but in a different neighborhood (the fact that my neighborhood has a specific name made me think it might not be the only one); however, with three non-neighbor flips a second neighborhood seems unlikely. So he's probably one of the Mafia.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Almost50</span></div></blockquote>I kinda agree, as I had mentioned previously.

I do acknowledge that lynching scum is even better, but let's face it: You guys are moving in circles and don't know what you're doing.

He was already trying to backtrack on his vote claiming that it would be Katsuki's own fault if he flipped town. Because we just have different playstyles, but when I push on someone I'm not going to open it up with a \"hey guys, in case he should flip town it's his own fault because that was anti town ok?\". Sure the posts looks worse because from my point of view because I believe scum are more likely to push on a 'policy' lynch on someone for quickhammering as I assume everyone here knows that it isn't a scum tell (which might be a shame to be honest)."}

I also knew that the Deputy flip was a red-herring, since there was no way there could be a cop in this setup. From my point of view, I knew there were 3 neighbours, a miller, a JK, and a SK.
