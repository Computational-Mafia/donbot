Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference. Note that playing to win condition is a requirement. <br>02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (<span class=\"noboldsig\">I will look for \u201c@Mod\u201d</span>).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Posting</span></span><br>05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>08. Players should not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timing</span></span><br>09. Each Day Phase will last 240 hours. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. Players on V/LA will be exempt from these prod requirements; however, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>11. Players who do not make sufficient attempt to participate (including--but not limited to--players who require repeated prods) may be replaced at my discretion.<br>12. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day Phase</span></span><br>13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Name</span><br>In order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>If the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Game Design</span></span><br>17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase). <span class=\"noboldsig\">Every PT related to this game will be made public after the game is over, although I will redact posts by player request.</span><br>19. This game has one Town faction and one Mafia faction, with no other factions present. The number of players in each faction is not public knowledge. No player in any faction may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>20. At least one player will receive the following role:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Welcome, (player), to Mini Normal 1925!<br><br>Your role is Citizen, aligned with <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town</span></span>.<br><br>Abilities: You have no special abilities.<br><br>Victory: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>"}

That's a fact.

What I do know is that you a neglecting to even consider that he could have found \"sup\" to be scummy and instead repeatedly calling Creature a liar for it.  All that serves to do is discredit your opposition as opposed to answering their concerns.  Even your post right here in response to me is doing something similar.  All of the bolded is bullshit. In your opinion, there is nothing scummy about starting the game off with a simple 'sup\" - but I can see where somebody might get a slight scumread from it. I personally didn't get one from that post, but I think that's much more rational behavior for anybody, town or scum, than lying within the first few minutes of the game. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401763#p9401763\" class=\"postlink\">post 121</a>, Robbnva wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401421#p9401421\" class=\"postlink\">post 120</a>, DrumBeats wrote:</cite>How is that clearly a lie?</div></blockquote><br>Cause there is nothing scummy about saying sup which is basically saying hi or hello.

Rather than trying to get an explanation for why he found it scummy, you immediately jumped onto the idea that he was a liar, not that he had a bad read.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401763#p9401763\" class=\"postlink\">post 121</a>, Robbnva wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401421#p9401421\" class=\"postlink\">post 120</a>, DrumBeats wrote:</cite>Again preaching Creature's dishonesty for voting him.  Painting him as a liar for thinking your first post is scummy is terrible.</div></blockquote><br>Man I really hope you are scum. Cause there is absolutely nothing terrible about calling out a liar.</div></blockquote><br><br>There is when he did not objectively lie.  Your entire argument is that he's lying because there's nothing scummy about your own god damn post.  Of course you don't think there's anything scummy about your post.  If you did, chances are, you wouldn't've posted it.  Yet instead of fathoming that Creature found it scummy, you immediately accuse him of being a liar - and state it excessively.  All you are doing at this point is discrediting somebody.  You haven't made a case as to why Creature's scum; you haven't tried to understand where he was coming from; you have just discredited the shit out of him.  This isn't town trying to sort a player.  This is town or scum trying to discredit a player and push a policy lynch on them, without the policy actually being fulfilled.  I'm leaning towards scum, but I can see the same actions from a townie who likes to tunnel too much. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9401912#p9401912\" class=\"postlink\">post 124</a>, Robbnva wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9399769#p9399769\" class=\"postlink\">post 88</a>, Ircher wrote:</cite>Definitely anti-town.</div></blockquote><br>This is re: my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9399630#p9399630\">77</a> It's anti town to not want to work with dishonest people? Man that's 2 terrible posts you've made. You have an issue with me wanting to policy lynch somebody, that's fair but there is absolutely nothing anti-town about refusing to work with a person you don't trust. In the real world would you invest your money with a person you didn't trust? Probably not. Would you buy a car from a guy who was dishonest? Most people wouldn't. So why is it any different in mafia? Why would you want to work with someone you can't trust? If you can do that cool, but I can't.</div></blockquote><br><br>Here again shows my issue with you.  He finds one of your posts anti-town (and quite frankly it is, I'll talk about why in the next paragraph), and you dismiss it as a terrible post right off the bat.  Rather than finish your conversation about it with him (which to your credit, you did start a conversation this time) then evaluate after hearing his opinion - you just scream terrible post because it doesn't agree with you.<br><br>But as to why it's anti-town behavior (not necessarily scummy though) to refuse to work with \"liars\" is that you still need to have the discussion.  The town gets most of it's info from discussion and shutting a person out of it because of a lie is limiting that discussion.  The more discussion occurs, the more can be analyzed at the time, or post flip - which is usually the better time to analyze a liar's one since you can better interpret his motivations behind the lies then.

Why do you think Lynch all Liars is a good idea? Why do you think reaction testing on Page 1 qualifies for it?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm going to go on record here and say that I do not support lynching all liars. There are three kinds of lies in games: Lies that help town, lies that hurt town, and lies that are not alignment indicative and are null in nature. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=72351\" class=\"postlink\">Micro 723</a>,  I was a full cop. I claimed 1-shot cop on d2 in order to get 2 confirmed townies and avoid the night kill. The gambit worked and I was able to clear another player n2. I had the game nearly solved until BBT came in and fake claimed 2-shot redirector. This caused me to panic and lynch him instead of the scum that was already caught. That's an example of a lie that hurts town. <br><br>Another example of a lie that hurts town is in Mini Normal 1919 when Boonskiies faked an innocent on Fykus (who was actually the last remaining scum). His lie could have costed town the entire game had he not have admitted that he was lying. <br><br>Creature's lie fits into the third category. His lie is neither harmful to town nor helpful to town. It is NAI. <br><br>I believe in lynching all liars when the lie hurts town. <br><br>Sadly, I have seen town lie far more often than scum."}

Your presence in this game isn't helpful. You really arent scum hunting, instead you hide behind pointless questions, you lie repeatedly, and you can't even take the time to read properly. On top of that you are still holding on to a scum read that basically everyone has moved on from and still using reasons that have been disproven. You don't want to town read me that's fine but you have absolutely nothing to use against me that says I am scum anymore. Now you vote TB which I don't really care about, but you haven't explained where this read came from. You have asked at least 2 people to provide a case on somebody so clearly you think these are important, yet you don't post one yourself? and you have the nerve to call me a hypocrite? pot meet kettle.<br><br>and this is all I have to say to you drum.

That's where my scumread from you originated.  You jumped to that he was lying (which you were right about) rather than talking to him about it and figuring it out.  It did not appear to me like you were trying to sort Creature, it just appeared to me like you were trying to discredit his vote. <br><br>I have also expressed doubt about my read on you several times, but right now the amount of discrediting you do versus scumhunting is too much for me to change my read.  I'm going to take a page from your book here and tell you to read through my ISO to find it.  If you can't then I'll point it out - but I've been actively trying to work with you and understand your mindset.  You've been pushing me away, calling me a liar, and dismissing all of my questions to you as redundant.  Also, I have not seen you reconsider your read on me once this game.  So the same behavior that you are attributing to me is something you have been doing as well. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9406611#p9406611\" class=\"postlink\">post 470</a>, Robbnva wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9406257#p9406257\" class=\"postlink\">post 442</a>, DrumBeats wrote:</cite>Why does his ISO reek?

This goes back to when I called a lot of your reasoning OMGus because it is heavily rooted in it. <br>246 - This is again about you defending the push on you.  This isn't insight about Ircher - this is why you think his scumread of you is bad.<br>258 - This one is the most insightful of them all so far.  I commented when I saw this one that I liked this post. <br>271 - This is you again disagreeing with him that your own stances are antitown.  <br><br>1/6 is insight into why he might be scum.

Please tell me if that is the summary of your case on him and if I am wrong about anything, please let me know.

That is reasoning because it doesn't try to discredit my opinions, but it states why you find me scummy.  You don't think I'm scumhunting, and you think I'm trying to pocket Creature.

You then criticized me for not asking Creature why ahead of time and jumping to the conclusion that it was a scumread, when I should've asked him right away. You said this was a lack of me scumhunting. This is the exact reason I scumread you here.  You jumped to a conclusion and it did not feel like you were scumhunting.  The conclusion that you jumped to was the one that made Creature look the worst, which made me feel like you were trying to discredit him.

You suspect all of us for pushing you.  You've split them a little bit by saying that Ircher's 180 is sketchy and you don't like the advice he is giving people.  You don't think that I am scumhunting (which in my opinion is primarily because I'm scumreading you, but that's just my opinion) and you think I'm trying to pocket Creature.  Your case on Mario is tied to your case on Ircher.  <br><br>You are right that you have one more scumread not on your wagon, and I apologize for forgetting that read.  You push it far less than the others, so it slipped my mind. The reasoning for Former is unique, but it also still stems from Creature, just like your reads on Ircher, Mario, and I.  When all of your reads go back to one event that primarily involves yourself, I don't find that to be scumhunting.  It looks a lot more like you are trying to deter people from questioning your motives. <br><br>In response to your last question there, you're not the only one who's talked outside of the tunnel.  We all have.

Your presence in this game isn't helpful. You really arent scum hunting, instead you hide behind pointless questions, you lie repeatedly, and you can't even take the time to read properly. On top of that you are still holding on to a scum read that basically everyone has moved on from and still using reasons that have been disproven. You don't want to town read me that's fine but you have absolutely nothing to use against me that says I am scum anymore. Now you vote TB which I don't really care about, but you haven't explained where this read came from.

Among other things, his persistence in engaging Robbnva is indicative of him being town. Most scum aren't going to continue to engage with a stubborn player on something that is completely irrelevant by this point. That attracts a lot of unnecessary attention.

His overreaction to Ircher in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9398590#p9398590\">40</a> is bad, and it continues in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9399546#p9399546\">57</a>.  However, I liked his push to break up the tunnel in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9402406#p9402406\">142</a>.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9402414#p9402414\">148</a> is also a good question for Robb - though that's likely bias on my part.

I also like his question for Robb in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9403615#p9403615\">278</a> - but again, there's some bias there. <br><br>In general, I find those later posts to be more townie than I find the early ones to be scummy.  There's not a lot to go on, but I just don't think he's our best wagon for the day.  I wouldn't be too surprised if he flipped scum, but I don't really expect him to."}

On this other wagon if Robb or TB flipped it would've been heavily suspect.  Firecroc was behind so wouldn't have time to flip within the wagons duration, Wake and our swing vote Martin are being prodded, and Grat/Creature seem to not be the most active.

You had one scumread on somebody off of your tunnel, which you eased up on because we were pushing it.  You listed one townread, Zach, who you then backed off on because he townreads us.  This is why I think you're still in the tunnel.  The underlying factor of most of your posts right now is the beginning of the game.

I was tunneled with Robb because his behavior was so over the top that it felt like the same acting that Mulch was doing in the large. I noticed Mulch's OTT acting and nobody listened to me then, so I was trying to get people on board with that this time, because the interaction felt the same.  From what I'm hearing about his meta, this is likely Robb's usual behavior which makes me want to step back from it for a while and reevaluate tomorrow.<br><br>ThinkBig though, I am not fixing on singular non AI things.  I am making a case on somebody who I believe to be scum, since nobody has been willing to actually discuss ThinkBig with me.  Look at how many attempts I made to get people to consider my scumread on him, but they rarely were seriously discussed.  Due to that, I feel the need to make a huge case right now, as I did.  If you think back to the large, I did the same thing with Priscila.  When I think I have scum, I will aggressively push the case.  Even after that, you and Mario shut down the discussion pretty quick, for what I believe to be non AI reasoning.  Remember last game when you shut me down about Mulch because he was \"too scummy to be scum\"? You can't let one read on somebody's behavior cloud your entire perspective of them.  In my opinion, TB only posting whenever is actually a worse look for him, because it has allowed him to dodge questions while only arousing the suspicion of myself.  Robb asked him why he did the 180 and he never completely delivered on that question.  I asked him about the 180 on you, and he never even acknowledged it.  His posting style/frequency is not a reason to TR him here.  Mario says he is \"talking freely\" but I don't see that at all since he's not actually explaining anything he puts out there. <br><br>If we get in two deadlocked wagons and I'm the offwagon again - I'll pick between the two, but right now the game opened up a little bit, and I'm going to try to use that to lynch scum. The case on Former is not great in my opinion.  Basically the only merits to it I've seen is that his early posts were scummy and that he is more likely to flip scum than Ircher. He looks much better in the back part of his ISO though, and I like Dunn's entrance - though I will admit, I'm not sure what to make of the fact that it is so different to how he played in the large.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9415773#p9415773\" class=\"postlink\">post 1039</a>, MarioManiac4 wrote:</cite>Proposition: Creature is scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think this is a very likely possibility.  I hate that he threw out a reaction test but refused to analyze anything from it. It looks more like he was just trying to stir up shit.

Otherwise, you would know the answer to the question you just asked. My question for you is -- why?

Some of your posts shows just a lack of reading as youask questions that have been addressed countless number of times.

Also, I can easily pull up an instance somewhat similar to this where both a person white-knighting me and me were town; my point is that you are missing something that others see because you see things in greyscale versus vivid colors.</span></div></blockquote>"}

To be 100% sincere with you guys I did it because I wanted to check my minimum activity, since I was prodded and to unvote him the next day. I know that this sounds very stupid (and it is), but it was best idea of what I can do to also stir some waters and to change the direction the game was going to. If I wanted him lynched I wouldn't announce the L-1 vote and the request for the intent to hammer. Why I believe Ircher is town: the vote shifting he did at the beginning.

Where is the gender equality?<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elena</span></span><br><br>@Elena&gt; Regarding your vote on ThinkBig that you've explained that the reason you did it is his changing mood. Why haven't you voted for ircher since he kept changing constantly and quickly his votes? Wouldn't that be considered as being a changing mood?<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Robb</span></span><br>This is while you were talking with Drum<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\u00a0You should have been less suspicious of the person who shares your opinion and more suspicious of the person who doesn't.

For me not agreeing with another person way of thinking isn't a valid reason of why that person is scum.<br><br>@Robb: At one point you've said about Drumm that he is spamming the game.

I'm sure that in your experience of playing mafia you've played like a town and also like a scum. In those games where you were scum did you vote for you? How could you stand lying and decievien people? It's obvious that my first questions is rethorical and I'm sure you didn't vote for yourself. Wouldn't you use the same strategy as a town or as a scum by bussing whoever is voting you? That's another rethorical question as I'm positive you would.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Drum</span></span><br>@Drum: You've constantly stated that you understand why Creature found Robb's \"sup\" scummy as you've did in [post=#&lt;156&gt;]156[/post],[post=#&lt;159&gt;]159[/post] and [post=#&lt;160&gt;]160[/post].

Why do you think I told ircher that him using meta to town read me was stupid? That's part of the reason I'm scum reading him. He did a 180 on me for something stupid. To me that's suspicious. He even said if it wasn't for the meta he'd probably scum read me.<br><br>My biggest issue with ircher and Mario and to a lesser extent with Zach. They don't really explain themselves very well. Their reasons for scum reading and town reading people lack substance. Ircher's and Mario's votes have been terrible imo. <br><br>Then we add in the obvious connection from the beginning of the game. Why would town mario chainsaw defend ircher and hard defend ircher all game? Ircher did nothing townie at the beginning of the game. The vote on ircher was a good vote. It makes no sense. <br><br>So a town/town connection doesn't work for me.<br><br>Then we have the early push on me. That was completely scum motivated. I feel comfortable saying 2 scum on the wagon. If people want to give drum a pass for asking redundant questions that's cool, then the scum are in creature/ircher/Mario. <br><br>Given the confusion they have caused and this super weird defense of each other, we need to lynch one of them."}

I agree about finding issue about him scumreading Mario - but also the stance is more understandable from someone who hasn't read the thread yet.<br><br>Are you willing to lynch Creature right now?"}

And the dismissal from you about their scum potential as \"too scummy to be scum\" is as well.  <br><br>Meta-wise I think it's fine because as I said in my post, you had a shit reaction to being suspected day one in large 203.  I thought that your defensiveness to Dunn was gross, but it fit the meta.

It explains why he never seriously pushed Robb, but did pull a 180 quickly.   It explains how Robb knew Creature was reaction testing rather than a valid scumread, and why Creature never bothered to analyze the reaction test.  It explains why Robb wouldn't hop onto a TB or Creature vote late this phase when he apparently scumreads them. TB's apparent pocketing could just be buddying in this case."}

As a pr you have to know what's going on. Despite me personally scum reading both him and Mario, they became the 2 most obvious townies.

The fact the TB said he suspected Robb for his tunnel on Creature, yet earlier in 344 painted it as TvT makes me think he was trying to give Creature towncred if Robb was flipped at the time.  I've considered it being used to give Robb towncred, but TB's relationship with Robb looks much more like pocketing to me."}

You started this Zach wagon as you were pretty clearly on the way out.  It could be a scum attempt to make a buddy look better on their way out.  Or you could be trying to salvage your game by pushing against a townie who players associated as scum with you, which could both pull from your votes and make you look better if they flip town.  Or there's a very small chance that you're town and legitimately pushing a SR. There are a lot of pieces here, and I'm sticking with what makes the most sense.</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay.

Zach's neighborizor role was a solid counter to mine because it mad enough me trust him more initially. I tried to get him to neighborize me, which would've let scum know my role and kill me if need be. Wakes role seems like it was a good investigative role, but it couldn't be believed well since there's the possibility of a roleblocker. Universal backup existing is why I'm pretty sure one of the PRs we've revealed is scum though because that gives the town much more power with Wake and I's roles. Zach's role is also the only PR other than strongman so far that wouldn't make sense for a backup to take imo."}

Creature was never going anywhere that day. <br><br>Also, nothing I did swayed him over to flavor, he only voted there whenever he was at L-1. You were in a neighborhood with him at the time so you can probably speak more to the legitimacy of his thoughts, but from what I see here the dude is just distancing from Creature.<br><br>If he dodges the flavor mislynch while voting for scum, he then looks much better so it gives him towncred. There is no reason why TownZach should have been that confident he wasn't getting lynched to push a vanity wagon on Creature."}

If I had to do it again, I would probably gate the Cop with X-Shot rather than Loyal because the game heavily punishes deaths of Mafia players, and it's easy for the results on Mafia players--though technically ambiguous--to be seen as sufficiently actionable for a lynch. I would also consider a Tracker of some sort, although this again reinforces the positive feedback when Mafia players are lynched.<br><br>However, I do not think that it is at all accurate to say that the game as played was won due to the power of the Town. In fact, games like this in which the Town power has so little effect compared to what is possible are, I believe, a strong argument that the reason that our Mini Normal games have such lopsided results in favor of the Mafia is that we balance the games around what the Town could do, rather than what the Town is likely to do."}

It's hard to back off of a scumread in a situation like that even knowing it's the correct play and I applaud Robb for putting away his ego and making the right play.
