Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference. Note that playing to win condition is a requirement. <br>\n02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>\n03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>\n04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I will look for &#8220;@Mod&#8221;</div>).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Posting</div></div><br>\n05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>\n06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>\n07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>\n08. Players should not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Timing</div></div><br>\n09. Each Day Phase will last 240 hours. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>\n10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. Players on V/LA will be exempt from these prod requirements; however, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>\n11. Players who do not make sufficient attempt to participate (including--but not limited to--players who require repeated prods) may be replaced at my discretion.<br>\n12. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Day Phase</div></div><br>\n13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Name</div><br>\nIn order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>\n14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>\n15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>\nIf the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>\n16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Game Design</div></div><br>\n17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>\n18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase). <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Every PT related to this game will be made public after the game is over, although I will redact posts by player request.</div><br>\n19. This game has one Town faction and one Mafia faction, with no other factions present. The number of players in each faction is not public knowledge. No player in any faction may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>\n20. At least one player will receive the following role:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Welcome, (player), to Mini Normal 1925!<br>\n<br>\nYour role is Citizen, aligned with <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Town</div>.<br>\n<br>\nAbilities: You have no special abilities.<br>\n<br>\nVictory: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Fri Jul 07, 2017 3:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72508&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "72508"}

All that serves to do is discredit your opposition as opposed to answering their concerns.  Even your post right here in response to me is doing something similar.  All of the bolded is bullshit.

Your entire argument is that he's lying because there's nothing scummy about your own god damn post.  Of course you don't think there's anything scummy about your post.  If you did, chances are, you wouldn't've posted it.  Yet instead of fathoming that Creature found it scummy, you immediately accuse him of being a liar - and state it excessively.  All you are doing at this point is discrediting somebody.  You haven't made a case as to why Creature's scum; you haven't tried to understand where he was coming from; you have just discredited the shit out of him.  This isn't town trying to sort a player.  This is town or scum trying to discredit a player and push a policy lynch on them, without the policy actually being fulfilled.  I'm leaning towards scum, but I can see the same actions from a townie who likes to tunnel too much. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9401912#p9401912\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9401912#p9401912\" data-post-id=\"9401912\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 124</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9399769#p9399769\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9399769#p9399769\" data-post-id=\"9399769\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 88</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26976\">Ircher</a> wrote:</cite>Definitely anti-town.</div></blockquote>\nThis is re: my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9399630#p9399630\">77</a> It's anti town to not want to work with dishonest people? Man that's 2 terrible posts you've made. You have an issue with me wanting to policy lynch somebody, that's fair but there is absolutely nothing anti-town about refusing to work with a person you don't trust. In the real world would you invest your money with a person you didn't trust? Probably not. Would you buy a car from a guy who was dishonest? Most people wouldn't.

He finds one of your posts anti-town (and quite frankly it is, I'll talk about why in the next paragraph), and you dismiss it as a terrible post right off the bat.  Rather than finish your conversation about it with him (which to your credit, you did start a conversation this time) then evaluate after hearing his opinion - you just scream terrible post because it doesn't agree with you.<br>\n<br>\nBut as to why it's anti-town behavior (not necessarily scummy though) to refuse to work with \"liars\" is that you still need to have the discussion.  The town gets most of it's info from discussion and shutting a person out of it because of a lie is limiting that discussion.  The more discussion occurs, the more can be analyzed at the time, or post flip - which is usually the better time to analyze a liar's one since you can better interpret his motivations behind the lies then.

If you were scum hunting and looking for suspicious activity you should be questioning the things that go against your own mindset. You should have been less suspicious of the person who shares your opinion and more suspicious of the person who doesn't. That's part of my issue with you right now.</div></blockquote>\n\nI didn't find your sup post scummy, but I thought about how somebody could and I came up with a reason.  I'm not saying it until Creature answers because the last thing I would want to do is feed him one if he doesn't have one, but I could reason out why.  What I am having a hard time reasoning is why you would dismiss it as a lie so vehemently. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, the idea that I should look for scum in people who disagree with me is dumb.  Scum might hop onto your opinion to pocket you, or they might just have an opinion that makes sense.  Townies will likely have several diverse opinions.  I would rather try to see whose reasoning makes sense and feels genuine and whose doesn't from all sides of the game.  Zach and I don't agree about you right now, but I think he's looking pretty good.  Creature agrees with me about you, and I'm not certain about him right now.  <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402554#p9402554\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402554#p9402554\" data-post-id=\"9402554\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 157</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402535#p9402535\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402535#p9402535\" data-post-id=\"9402535\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 156</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29882\">DrumBeats</a> wrote:</cite>Here again shows my issue with you.

There are three kinds of lies in games: Lies that help town, lies that hurt town, and lies that are not alignment indicative and are null in nature. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=72351\" class=\"postlink\">Micro 723</a>,  I was a full cop. I claimed 1-shot cop on d2 in order to get 2 confirmed townies and avoid the night kill. The gambit worked and I was able to clear another player n2. I had the game nearly solved until BBT came in and fake claimed 2-shot redirector. This caused me to panic and lynch him instead of the scum that was already caught. That's an example of a lie that hurts town. <br>\n<br>\nAnother example of a lie that hurts town is in Mini Normal 1919 when Boonskiies faked an innocent on Fykus (who was actually the last remaining scum). His lie could have costed town the entire game had he not have admitted that he was lying. <br>\n<br>\nCreature's lie fits into the third category. His lie is neither harmful to town nor helpful to town. It is NAI. <br>\n<br>\nI believe in lynching all liars when the lie hurts town. <br>\n<br>\nSadly, I have seen town lie far more often than scum.", "time": "Sun Jul 09, 2017 8:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72508&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "72508"}

The \"scummy\" posts you have called out have been posts in which your motives have been called into question and you have said they are scummy because you see no reason a townie would scumread you.  I've already broken down the statistics with you that at least one townie has to have scumread you by now since there were at least 4 votes on you. Therefore at least one townie has scumread you.  That proves that there is a reason why a townie would scumread you, so why can't more than one townie do it?<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9404941#p9404941\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9404941#p9404941\" data-post-id=\"9404941\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 329</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26976\">Ircher</a> wrote:</cite>@Drum -- I'm not gonna reference the meta specifically cuz it's unethical to do so.</div></blockquote>\n\nUnethical?

Your presence in this game isn't helpful. You really arent scum hunting, instead you hide behind pointless questions, you lie repeatedly, and you can't even take the time to read properly. On top of that you are still holding on to a scum read that basically everyone has moved on from and still using reasons that have been disproven. You don't want to town read me that's fine but you have absolutely nothing to use against me that says I am scum anymore. Now you vote TB which I don't really care about, but you haven't explained where this read came from.

This is what you are doing when you accuse everybody who scumreads you of being scum for it because there isn't a reason a townie would do so, or because \"ircher is to experienced to do so.\"  It is not meant to actually try to figure out a persons alignment, but it is meant to make a person less trustworthy to other people.

That is reasoning because it doesn't try to discredit my opinions, but it states why you find me scummy.  You don't think I'm scumhunting, and you think I'm trying to pocket Creature.

You suspect all of us for pushing you.  You've split them a little bit by saying that Ircher's 180 is sketchy and you don't like the advice he is giving people.  You don't think that I am scumhunting (which in my opinion is primarily because I'm scumreading you, but that's just my opinion) and you think I'm trying to pocket Creature.  Your case on Mario is tied to your case on Ircher.  <br>\n<br>\nYou are right that you have one more scumread not on your wagon, and I apologize for forgetting that read.  You push it far less than the others, so it slipped my mind. The reasoning for Former is unique, but it also still stems from Creature, just like your reads on Ircher, Mario, and I.  When all of your reads go back to one event that primarily involves yourself, I don't find that to be scumhunting.  It looks a lot more like you are trying to deter people from questioning your motives. <br>\n<br>\nIn response to your last question there, you're not the only one who's talked outside of the tunnel.  We all have. The fact that all of your scumreads can be tied to that tunnel though is the part that I am suspicious of. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9406611#p9406611\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9406611#p9406611\" data-post-id=\"9406611\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 470</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402790#p9402790\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402790#p9402790\" data-post-id=\"9402790\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 180</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite>t's hard to move off to somebody else when the only serious discussion surrounds one topic.

Your presence in this game isn't helpful. You really arent scum hunting, instead you hide behind pointless questions, you lie repeatedly, and you can't even take the time to read properly. On top of that you are still holding on to a scum read that basically everyone has moved on from and still using reasons that have been disproven. You don't want to town read me that's fine but you have absolutely nothing to use against me that says I am scum anymore. Now you vote TB which I don't really care about, but you haven't explained where this read came from. You have asked at least 2 people to provide a case on somebody so clearly you think these are important, yet you don't post one yourself? and you have the nerve to call me a hypocrite? pot meet kettle. </div></blockquote>\n\n1) My questions are helpful to me understanding the mindset behind the players I am talking to.  This helps me make reads.  <br>\n2) How is holding onto a scumread that others have let go of scummy?  Wouldn't it be easier for me to follow the crowd and let go of it?  <br>\n3) I did explain the TB vote.  Looks like you haven't been reading - which is what you're accusing me of. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9406340#p9406340\">454</a> has it.  TB's 180 on you is baseless as of now, and his statement about Zach is scummy as shit.  He presents a duality of \"it is one of two options\" but both options lead to Zach being scum, when there is a simple possible third option of Zach finding another player scummy rather than trying to derail the Ircher wagon. <br>\n4) I have made cases on all of my votes - you just don't like the reasoning, or choose to ignore them.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9406611#p9406611\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9406611#p9406611\" data-post-id=\"9406611\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 470</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite>and this is all I have to say to you drum.

The second one you didn't answer, but oh well it's not the most important.  The third one you did answer, so thanks.  Only thing I still have outstanding here then is if you could check over what I interpreted your scumread on Ircher to be for when I looked through your ISO in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9406376#p9406376\">463</a> and a few that have popped up in this post.

The question is whether he actually used it to sort players, or just put it up there as an act. I would have to look at whether his reads match up to the reactions or not.<br>\n<br>\n--2) I liked your push on Robb, and the conclusion you came to.

The thing with this vote was there were firmly two sides.  If anybody on the former vote flipped to vote Ircher other than Creature or maybe Elena, it would've been shady as hell. On this other wagon if Robb or TB flipped it would've been heavily suspect.  Firecroc was behind so wouldn't have time to flip within the wagons duration, Wake and our swing vote Martin are being prodded, and Grat/Creature seem to not be the most active.

I was tunneled with Robb because his behavior was so over the top that it felt like the same acting that Mulch was doing in the large. I noticed Mulch's OTT acting and nobody listened to me then, so I was trying to get people on board with that this time, because the interaction felt the same.  From what I'm hearing about his meta, this is likely Robb's usual behavior which makes me want to step back from it for a while and reevaluate tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nThinkBig though, I am not fixing on singular non AI things.  I am making a case on somebody who I believe to be scum, since nobody has been willing to actually discuss ThinkBig with me.  Look at how many attempts I made to get people to consider my scumread on him, but they rarely were seriously discussed.  Due to that, I feel the need to make a huge case right now, as I did.  If you think back to the large, I did the same thing with Priscila.  When I think I have scum, I will aggressively push the case.  Even after that, you and Mario shut down the discussion pretty quick, for what I believe to be non AI reasoning.  Remember last game when you shut me down about Mulch because he was \"too scummy to be scum\"? You can't let one read on somebody's behavior cloud your entire perspective of them.  In my opinion, TB only posting whenever is actually a worse look for him, because it has allowed him to dodge questions while only arousing the suspicion of myself.  Robb asked him why he did the 180 and he never completely delivered on that question.  I asked him about the 180 on you, and he never even acknowledged it.  His posting style/frequency is not a reason to TR him here.  Mario says he is \"talking freely\" but I don't see that at all since he's not actually explaining anything he puts out there. <br>\n<br>\nIf we get in two deadlocked wagons and I'm the offwagon again - I'll pick between the two, but right now the game opened up a little bit, and I'm going to try to use that to lynch scum. The case on Former is not great in my opinion.  Basically the only merits to it I've seen is that his early posts were scummy and that he is more likely to flip scum than Ircher. He looks much better in the back part of his ISO though, and I like Dunn's entrance - though I will admit, I'm not sure what to make of the fact that it is so different to how he played in the large.  <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9415773#p9415773\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9415773#p9415773\" data-post-id=\"9415773\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1039</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25801\">MarioManiac4</a> wrote:</cite>Proposition: Creature is scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nI think this is a very likely possibility.

Not willing to push it today, I want to re-evaluate tomorrow.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9416386#p9416386\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9416386#p9416386\" data-post-id=\"9416386\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1145</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22272\">Wake1</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9416371#p9416371\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9416371#p9416371\" data-post-id=\"9416371\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1140</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29121\">Elena Fisher</a> wrote:</cite>hm perhaps not fueling the fire mostly just hiding behind the huge fight that's why I was looking for lurkers and asking questions <br>\n<br>\nlurkers being grat former and creature are the 3 that come to mind.</div></blockquote>\n\nHiding behind and fueling the fire are two completely different concepts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS: Elena Fisher</div></div></blockquote>\n\nHow is that difference AI though? <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9416423#p9416423\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9416423#p9416423\" data-post-id=\"9416423\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1153</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite>I am not being toxic.

Zach's neighborizor role was a solid counter to mine because it mad enough me trust him more initially. I tried to get him to neighborize me, which would've let scum know my role and kill me if need be. Wakes role seems like it was a good investigative role, but it couldn't be believed well since there's the possibility of a roleblocker. Universal backup existing is why I'm pretty sure one of the PRs we've revealed is scum though because that gives the town much more power with Wake and I's roles.
