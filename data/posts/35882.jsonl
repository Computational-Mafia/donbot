Read and respect them.<br>II) There is no personal communication outside the forum postings (regarding this game) unless your role specifically allows it.<br>III) Do not quote your Role PM or any private communication (either real or fabricated) with the moderator, co-moderator, backup-moderator, or fellow players. Paraphrasing your Role PM is acceptable.<br>IV) Be courteous and respectful to all your fellow players and the moderating team.<br>V) Play to your Win Condition. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TWO: DAY PHASE (DP)</span><br>I) Each DP shall have a two week deadline. <br>II) Votes must be <span class=\"noboldsig\">bolded</span> or they shall not be counted. Abbreviating someone's name is acceptable, so long as I can discern who you were voting for without trouble.<br>III) Unvoting is not required, but is much appreciated by the mods.<br>IV) Once you have reached a simple majority (half of all living players plus one) that person's fate is sealed and they shall be lynched. Unvoting cannot change their fate.<br>V) If half the living players approve a No Lynch (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No Lynch</span>), then no player shall be lynched and the game shall enter Night Phase. If deadline is reached and no one has received a simple majority of the votes, no one shall be lynched.<br>VI)  Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I arrive and post a death scene. All players may continue to post during Twilight.<br>VII) If you have failed to post for over 48 hours, I will send you a prod. Failure to respond to this prod within 48 hours will result in the replacement of that player. Force-replacing of flakers/rule-breakers will be occur at my discretion. Generally, this will happen after three prods.<br>VIII) A deadline extension may be granted; just ask.<br>IX) Votes and Unvotes shall not count in Twilight.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">THREE: NIGHT PHASE (NP)</span><br>I) NP shall last three days. <br>II) All groups with Quicktopics (QTs) will be able to converse during the NP.<br>III) Any role or faction with night abilities may choose to use them by PM-ing the mod with their choice.<br>IV) If no action is received, no action will be taken. All actions received after the deadline has passed will not be valid.<br>V) Night Action submissions will be accepted starting in the Twilight Phase.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FOUR: CAPITAL OFFENSES</span><br>I) Do not quote your Role PM or any private communication (either real or fabricated) with the moderator, co-moderator, or backup-moderator. Paraphrasing your Role PM is acceptable.<br>II) There is to be no personal communication outside the forum postings (regarding this game) unless your role specifically allows it.<br>III) <span class=\"noboldsig\">The following is a list of outlawed shenanigans:</span><br><ul><li>Using invisible text, codes, cryptography, etc.</li><li>Editing your posts (if you have the power to do so)</li><li>Insulting other players</li><li>Quoting any QTs you may have access to</li></ul>If any of these offenses are committed, I have the right to force-replace you from the game or modkill you.

Small matters like errors in the votecount can be posted in-thread.<br>II) I have the final say on any issue. I reserve the right to force-replace and modkill at my will.<br>III) This is a game.

This is the nub of the matter. He didn't make that jump. You did. Here's the order of events: in post 104, masenko gives two reasons for his vote. In 106, you quote only the second reason - perfectly legitimately, because you have a question about it. But the jump comes in 109, where you imply that his case on DoctorPepper rests solely on his second reason. You vote him on this basis, and manage to pull Gooner in with you.<br><br>Having said that, his unvote is pretty scummy too."}

Simultaneously all the discussion around the FOS from DoctorPepper arose. While I can understand that the FOS lacked reasoning at the time, I agree with DoctorPepper's point about Aegor. In fact Masenko FOSed Aegor for jumping in DoctorPepper wagon with no apparent reason.

His initial push on Dessew based off of a past game where he thought Dessew was town makes a lot of sense from a town perspective. On the other hand, if Smudger was scum, I doubt he would intentionally push on someone he perceives to be strong town. A cursory glance of Smudger/Dessew's past game shows that Dessew played quite well in that game enough that Smudger would remember him as a threat. The rest of his ISO also contains questions which seem to give him good leads like his push on Tommy for clarification followed up with a vote as well his continued probing of Masenko. I disagreed with his questioning of KidA but I don't think it is alignment indicative and Smudger is overall my strongest townread.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">2) kushm4sta</span> \u2013 I like his questioning of Smudger in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5574413#p5574413\">45</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5574435#p5574435\">47</a> as I had the same concerns while initially reading through the thread. His attempt to understand Smudger and probe for further motivations in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5569370#p5569370\">82</a> also feels very town as does his jump onto Surye in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5582934#p5582934\">118</a> as I too found Surye's push on Masenko to be off. I also agree with Albert that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5588537#p5588537\">185</a> is extremely unlikely to come from scum. I am fairly certain Kushm4sta is town as well.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">3) Aegor</span>- I find Aegor's unexplained voting and bandwagoning very townish. He seems to believe that not explaining votes is useful and is voting back and forth without explaining any of them. I can see that he is reacting to the discussion in thread while concealing his own opinions in a way which I find very townish. The very flippant dismissal of Masenko in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5575684#p5575684\">69</a> with a sarcastic request to lynch him reads as town who is voting quite carelessly, trying to generate reactions, and is very unself-conscious. His continuing to vote without reason even when being accused of such is also very town. His questioning is accusatory and aggressive and it feels genuine. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">4) Kid A</span> \u2013 I really like KidA's initial push on Gooner and it strikes me as quite a bold move. I also feel that his follow-up was very town-oriented. He used the reactions generated from his initial push to FOS DoctorPepper in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5585132#p5585132\">141</a> and develop a readslist in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5585146#p5585146\">143</a>. I also really like how he never uses his reaction test as a reason for the FOS but lets it flow naturally. He doesn't feel the need to explain his RVS vote while he develops useful conclusions from it. This shows that he is more interested in progressing the gamestate. I also like the take-charge attitude that he is showing. I have a moderate townread on KidA although weaker than Smudger and Kush. KidA, more explanations for your reads would be good so I can see where you are coming from.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">5) Albert B. Rampage</span> \u2013 I lean town on Albert mainly for his very restrained demeanor which matches what I know of his towngames often taking a while get into the game. I particularly like his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5588579#p5588579\">187</a> where he mentions that Kushm4sta is town because no scum would ever post that. It matches up with my perspective of Albert as town based on other games I've played or read. It also matches up with my own thought processes on Kush4sta. I further like that his reads and the switches between his reads feel very raw and not having an underlying agenda. For example, the vote on DoctorPepper followed by the hop to Tommy as well as asking why others are changing to Aegor. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">6) NJAC</span> - NJAC is one of my weaker townreads and it is mostly based on how he continues questioning Aegor for his unexplained votes. I read through one of NJAC's past games and I see that he townreads people based on the content they generate so I can understand the scumread of Aegor there. I like his push for explanations and more votes on Aegor as well as townreads on other players which shows he isn't just tunneling the same player and is keeping a wider perspective of the game. I want to see a lot more content before I develop a more solid read.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">EVERYONE ELSE</span></span> (will get to this later)<br><br>7) Masenko<br><br>8) Gooner<br><br>9) Surye<br><br>10) Dessew<br><br>11) Tommy<br><br>12) DoctorPepper<br><br>I think scum are among the players who I haven't townread yet.

Which is why I said I could learn a thing or two from him, because I thought it was quite clever, and certainly not as anti-town as I had initially thought."}

Can you explain why Tommy is scum?<br><br>I have a theory I want to run by you:<br><br>I dislike the interactions between DoctorPepper and Gooner. I had a mild suspicion that they were both part of a scumteam when DoctorPepper tried to link Masenko to Gooner by saying that Masenko is \"worried\" about Gooner. From experience, I find that scum are far more likely to create fake associative tells between their buddies and other townies so that in the event that their buddy is lynched, they can go after the townie, and in the event that the townie is lynched, they are exonerated from having to persue their buddy as much. Town sometimes tend to make associative tells as well but the strength of the reasoning Pepper provided for his Gooner-Masenko link is extremely weak making it more likely scum.  <br><br>I initially thought I was reading too much into it but more tells surface. Gooner in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5593426#p5593426\">247</a> telling Masenko to vote Tommy (over Pepper) corroborates my initial suspicion. That post just seems very off. Gooner isn't trying to figure out why Masenko is not voting his biggest scumread. Gooner flat out told Masenko to change his vote. Gooner, what do you hope to achieve here? You are not voting Tommy, you are voting Masenko. You are telling your scumread (Masenko) to vote Tommy when you don't even have a read on Tommy. <br><br>I think the scumteam is Pepper/Gooner + one of {Surye, Dessew, Tommy} <br><br>I am not confident in any of my reads on the last three. If I am right about Pepper and Gooner, then Tommy probably is town."}

I found DP's post very scummy, so from there my suspicion of him outweighed my suspicion of Tommy. My lack of justification for thinking Tommy was scum is what led to the rather strong wagon on me.

Yes, One of my scum reads is non committal reads, his entry was just calling out everyone town and leaving 5 people he hasn't sorted yet.

My issue with Kush is that there is a difference between \"scum wouldn't vote this way\" and \"scum won't say this\". The votes thing is a more transparent way to view someone, but with the content I don't necessarily see much pro town content and thnats easily fakeable as scum.

But as already stated that goes just as well for newb scum, even more so possibly. The thing is been scum are more likely to do it as they would inherently feel guilty to begin with as they have something to hide. Thus more likely to panic.

I've re-read the thread 2-3 times so I'll start with a general overview of the players here then go into greater depth regarding my scumreads:<br>Albert B. Rampage: He's had an opinion and he's stuck with it. He's wrong about me being scum but I like players who push their positions. Be very wary of anyone sticking the knife into ABR tomorrow for getting me lynched, ABR attacking me isn't scummy and ABR is probably town. Again, do not lynch him tomorrow. <br>DoctorPepper: This guy could easily be a scum off the wagon and is definitely worth looking at tomorrow. Basically he hasn't contributed much but it's more other people's opinions about him that concern me, more on this later. <br>Kid A: I have nothing against Kid A at the moment. To be honest I don't really have much on him at all. <br>Aegor: Bandwagony and active lurky, he's not a player I particularly like and certainly a player I could see as scum since he has never seriously been in lynch trouble. He hasn't had anyone really push him into contention and that's concerning. There are better candidates though. <br>Fusion: Not a player I like, more on him later. <br>Havingfitz: Don't particularly dislike him, I could see him as a scum trying to white knight me but there are better scum candidates. <br>Kush4msta: I would like it if this slot could contribute a bit more and his defence of Surye concerned me a little but there are better scum candidates around. <br>Smudger: I like his guy, he's generally been inactive and thought independantly with regards to the wagon on me rather than just mindlessly sheeping. <br>Surye: This is a guy I don't like. <br>Masenko: Another guy I don't really like. <br>Tommy: I have nothing against Tommy at this point, him defending me could be white knighting but I haven't seen anything scum indicative from him. <br>Dessew: Pretty much the same as ABR. He's pushed me in such a way that I doubt he's scum. Anyone sticking the knife into him tomorrow is probably scum. <br><br>Now I'm going to give more information on what I think is going on here."}

First of all his vote on me seems to come out of nowhere. This is very concerning for me, he literally pops up and votes for me having never mentioned any suspicion of me before. <br><br>Then we have this moment:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5606417#p5606417\" class=\"postlink\">post 365</a>, Surye wrote:</cite>In trying to find something to support my Aegor over Gooner position, I'm seeing little redeeming in Gooners posts. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I still don't like both of them</span> the more I read (and the more I have less issue with DP actually). Since Gooner himself said to vote him, DP or Tommy... <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gooner</span></div></blockquote><br>The phrase \"I still don't like both of them\" concerns me a lot since he had previously never announced any suspicion of me before. It seems like a slip from a player trying to justify leaping onto the wagon. It seems like someone who isn't actually reading my posts to investigate me but to get me lynched, one is something that town players do the other something that scum players do. This seems like a scumslip to me and I can certainly smell a lot of insincerity surrounding that comment. <br><br>Secondly as part of his defence Surye claims that he felt that Aegor wasn't going to be lynched today:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5606366#p5606366\" class=\"postlink\">post 361</a>, Surye wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5606334#p5606334\" class=\"postlink\">post 358</a>, Gooner wrote:</cite>Ok, busy day. Tomorrow I get home earlier so I'll be able to decide between Tommy and DP and make my vote relevant towards getting a lynch. For the rest of you I suggest voting Tommy, DP or myself to make your vote relevant today. I do not advocate lynching me since I am town but there we go.</div></blockquote><br>Between Tommy and DP? What's your thoughts on Aegor?</div></blockquote><br>I feel that this post implies that Surye still thinks Aegor has a strong chance of being lynched today. The fact he questions the assumption that the lynch is between Tommy, DP and myself and then asks for thoughts on Aegor before suddenly continuing to push people to vote for Aegor tends to suggest that he thinks he can get Aegor lynched and he disagrees with my thought that Aegor is not a candidate for the lynch. Again, his defence doesn't quite seem to jive with what he has put in the thread. <br><br>Finally, he says that he re-reads me and Aegor. Why is he not considering the other candidates for a lynch if he feels that the lynch is between Tommy, DP and myself? Instead he only considers me for the lynch. Again I'm seeing a player who is not actually investigating or trying to work out who the right lynch is today and is instead just trying to pin a lynch on a random townie today. <br><br>Part One of my scumteam thoughts, part two to come on Fusion and where I feel his insincerities lie."}

He seemed very certain that there were three scum, See here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5593328#p5593328\" class=\"postlink\">post 241</a>, Fusion wrote:</cite>Dr.Pepper, a couple of things:<br>1) You are misrepresenting the value of POE analysis.

I've narrowed down scum to 3 out of the remaining 5. <br></div></blockquote><br>It's plausible he could have assumed there were 3 scum but the certainty of the post seems to suggest more knowledge that there are three scum, something I have checked and isn't in the rules anywhere. It certainly is something that seems odd and is definitely worth pointing out. <br><br>Secondly we have his switch from Dr.Pepper to me:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5609602#p5609602\" class=\"postlink\">post 408</a>, Fusion wrote:</cite>Fitz's post didn't have a lot of in-depth content.

Anyway Fusion has had a scumread on Dr Pepper almost since his entry into the game and I have not seen a reason for him to change to Dr Pepper. Anyway, what I'm most concerned about is this point here. He says that my reaction seems town to get reads in before the hammer falls. Then in his next post he switches to me. Now the funny thing about this is that, at the time the vote count looked like this:<br>Dr Pepper (3)<br>Gooner (5)<br><br>At this time a switch to Pepper would have put one of his scumreads back into contention for a lynch rather than someone whose reactions seem town. Moreover, it could then be assumed that I would switch to Pepper before the deadline, I know my alignment and am not certain about his, it's only natural for me to vote there. That makes it 5-5. <br><br>Instead of taking the opportunity to put a scumread into contention for the lynch Fusion puts someone whose reactions seem town to L-1. <br><br>This is not a natural townie reaction, a townie would put the vote on DP and at least try to push his lynch. Fusion's move at this point makes no sense from a town perspective, he had a chance to put a scumread of his into contention for the lynch and chose to put someone whose reactions seem town into L-1 instead. This rings serious notes of insincerity to me. <br><br>Finally I'll move onto masenko/DP."}

I've already talked about Fusion's vote on him and how much it worries me.

The WIFOM of \"would Gooner have said something like that about his buddy?\" would be quite beneficial to scum-you, but as town, suggesting ABR is so extraordinarily town that anyone who attacks him is suspicious is very dangerous if you're wrong. (The same goes for your read on dessew.)<br><br>It just seems like the kind of thing people say when they <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> someone else's alignment, and don't have to worry about second-guessing themselves. Yes, you want to state your reads before you're lynched, but a town mindset would worry about what happens if you're wrong and you inadvertently position scum-ABR to have even more influence.</div></blockquote><br>Ok, I see where the confusion is. <br><br>I have townreads on ABR and Dessew for pushing my lynch in the way they did. I like players that stand by their reads. <br><br>I didn't say all people who attack these two are suspicious. I said all people voting for them <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">for pushing my lynch</span></span> are suspicious. There's a big difference there. If I am still lynched today people still shouldn't attack ABR and Dessew for pushing my lynch. If they make a scumslip or do something else scummy then lynch them. But don't lynch them for pushing my lynch today."}

I now doubt it was a bus because Gooner's pre-hammer thoughts were so towny. But what led me that way was Albert's promise that Gooner was scum. Also he'd said something before about taking full responsibility. He was talking like he knew Gooner's alignment. But I guess he just does that. At the moment I'm thinking he could be town after all.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5611259#p5611259\" class=\"postlink\">post 430</a>, Tommy wrote:</cite>ABR was a lot more talkative in his last scum game.</div></blockquote><br>Nearly at the end of a Day 1 and we gets this gem of meta? What a horrible comment.<br></div></blockquote><br>Man, everyone's a critic. Kush had issues with this comment as well. At the time, it was really important to me to work out whether I could trust ABR's relentless wagon. Now it's relented, of course. I think the difference between ABR's play style here and in that scum game is quite striking, so I thought you people might be interested. Not so much, as it turns out.<br><br>Now, Dessew: I think you were first concerned about me when I said to Fusion, 'If DoctorPepper manages to claim power without being counter-claimed, I'll consider any flashwagon you suggest.\u2019 You interpreted that as an attempt to get some role information. In fact I was talking about how much time was left. I was worried that Fusion was imagining getting in our intent to hammer just before deadline - so I was making the point that a power claim can sometimes mean you have to abort a lynch and quickwagon another player, and it\u2019s best to provide some time for that. But let\u2019s be clear: my aim was to kill Pepper. Still is, actually.<br><br>Your other problem (that I know of) was with the way I reacted to Rubicon\u2019s entrance. I still don\u2019t really get the way the town has dealt with Rubicon. It\u2019s not like I was the one who brought up Rubicon\u2019s role - he just claimed it on arrival. There was no vote pressure on him, he just did it. I struggle to see any motivation for that, town or scum. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s lying. So I need to get more out of him. If he\u2019s town, then obviously scum will be interested in these questions too. Of course I\u2019m aware of that. But it can\u2019t be helped: Rubicon opened a can of worms, and part of effective scum-hunting is to pick through them. It\u2019ll have to wait till Day 2 now, though.<br><br>Next I'll show that Surye is town.<br><br>I felt he misrepresented masenkoEX early on, but my town read on him started around <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5586494#p5586494\" class=\"postlink\">163</a> (somewhat awkwardly, since I was voting for him at the time). This is a businesslike, short post full of pro-town content. Whatever his alignment, this sort of thing helps town. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5589575#p5589575\" class=\"postlink\">195</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5589612#p5589612\" class=\"postlink\">197</a> he backs down from his position without being forced to - it looks to me like a genuine evolution of his thoughts. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5593795#p5593795\" class=\"postlink\">255</a>, he suspects Aegor, which I agree with. Same goes for <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5594602#p5594602\" class=\"postlink\">261</a> and DoctorPepper. Then when he votes Aegor, he criticises the Gooner wagon for not having much to it - and man, was that true. Then he too falls under ABR\u2019s spell and joins the terrible wagon. Point against him. But the \u2018still\u2019 thing is bobbins.<br><br>I'd much rather lynch Aegor or DoctorPepper than Surye. I will be around at deadline and would lynch Surye to avoid a no-lynch."}

Gooner's attack is unconvincing as well. Overall, even though I initially had suspicions of him, I am not convinced enough to vote him.<br><br>Tommy: Tommy's latest behavior looks suspicious. His defense of Surye seems contrived and while it looks townish and non-survivalistic on the surface, I don't buy that he still thinks he can push a wagon on Aegor. I also find Aegor quite townish as I explained in my catchup post and that hasn't changed. Tommy's defense of Surye seems more like a ploy for towncred right after Surye was accused by Rubicon when voting Tommy.

A lot of what he says also makes sense from a town perspective. His \"catch\" of Masenko in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5582600#p5582600\">109</a> for pre-attacking Aegor has a feel to it as if Surye genuinely believes Masenko is scum and the backtrack after he realizes he misinterpreted the point also reads townish. Gooner's attack is unconvincing as well. Overall, even though I initially had suspicions of him, I am not convinced enough to vote him.<br><br>Tommy: Tommy's latest behavior looks suspicious. His defense of Surye seems contrived and while it looks townish and non-survivalistic on the surface, I don't buy that he still thinks he can push a wagon on Aegor. I also find Aegor quite townish as I explained in my catchup post and that hasn't changed. Tommy's defense of Surye seems more like a ploy for towncred right after Surye was accused by Rubicon when voting Tommy. Between the two, I much prefer Tommy as the lynch.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tommy</span></div></blockquote><br>I find it very notable that when push comes to shove and Fusion has the choice at the end of the Day between Tommy and Surye, he goes for Tommy. <br><br>Firstly notice he states that Tommy's trying to push an Aegor wagon when there's no hope of one happening? Well Surye was also trying to push the Aegor wagon. This does not separate Tommy from Surye in any way. <br><br>The fact that Fusion is able to dig up a post from Surye, namely number 109, as a reason for Surye being town suggests he went back through the thread re-reading Surye, does it not, particularly considering he initally had Surye down as a not townread after having read through the thread? <br><br>If Fusion had re-read Surye then he would have noticed that Surye was also trying to push through a last minute Aegor wagon and his point on Tommy would have been irrelevant. Put simply, it's impossible to miss Surye's attack on Aegor on a re-read if you're a townie genuinely trying to make a decision between Surye and Tommy. <br><br>Now, if Fusion claims he didn't re-read Surye then why did an early day post suddenly give him a townread on Surye when it didn't initially. <br><br>His vote on Tommy is contrived and I suspect his initial not scumread on Surye was simply distancing. <br><br>So today I will vote on whoever of Surye or Fusion has the most votes. <br><br>At the moment that is <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fusion</span>. <br>I want Fusion or Surye lynched today."}

If you are town, you clearly think you \"spotted\" an amazing contradiction in my stance and pegged me as scum. Cases like this are sometimes annoying, sometimes just hilariously cute and laughable.

I'll just assume that in your haste, you genuinely misunderstood what I was saying. Here's what you missed:<br><br>I found Tommy scummy because his defense of Surye felt contrived to me. He called Surye town with poor reasoning while he continued to push another player (Aegor). Surye didn't do that.

Scum!\" Analyzing scum motivations is multi-layered, complex, and requires substantial analysis.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5633190#p5633190\" class=\"postlink\">post 623</a>, Gooner wrote:</cite>The fact that Fusion is able to dig up a post from Surye, namely number 109, as a reason for Surye being town suggests he went back through the thread re-reading Surye, does it not, particularly considering he initally had Surye down as a not townread after having read through the thread?

I think if Fitz was town, he would have recognized that and insisted that while I am town I am wrong about him.

It is quite clear. <br><br>Saying I \"contradicted myself\" is laughable and proves nothing. Contradictions aren't scumtells.

I have no idea why you are ignoring the substance of the argument to argue that \"retracts townread\" and \"continued threat to retract townread\" are contradictory statements. The idea is still the same. The substance of my argument is the same. Why are you focussing on irrelevant things as opposed to relevant ones?"}

I've explained why I dislike fitz, his wording surrounding his read of me yesterday was all wrong. Kush needs to step up and actually start playing the game. Rubicon seems town to me for the amount of effort he's putting into scumhunting. Fitz being off the wagon makes me feel better about kush and Rubicon with my assumption that there is one scum off the wagon. <br><br>On the Wagon on Day 1:<br>DoctorPepper/chamber<br>Albert B. Rampage<br>Surye<br>Dessew<br>Aegor<br><br>Who do I dislike from this lot? Pretty much all of them actually. DP's simply complete null so far and was the counter-wagon which narrowly avoided the Axe. Definitely suspicious with the knowledge of how quickly the Tommy wagon appeared and how DP hovered close to the lynch for a long period of time but nothing from his in-play thread that particularly concerns me. The fact he was replaced suggests genuine inactivity rather than lurking. <br><br>I like the fact ABR pushes his reads but if he spent as much effort explaining his reads as he did pushing them I would like him more. A lot of his votes and opinions simply feel baseless and he then seems to blame people for not following a baseless case. <br><br>I still have issues with Surye's in-thread play but Fusion coming up town makes me feel better about him. <br><br>Dessew's a player whose in thread play I generally like but he has voted for two townies and he was a bit of a non-entity yesterday, I feel he could have worked harder to push the Fusion lynch. <br><br>Aegor's a serial bandwagoner and seems pretty much unreadable. If he's town he needs to step up and get his head in the game. <br><br>Off the Wagon on Day 2:<br>Dessew<br>Rubicon<br>kushm4sta<br>Well with fitz as my best scumread and my logic that the most likely voting distribution is two scum on the wagon and one off it, that logically leaves Dessew as scum. Ok, fitz and Dessew so far then. <br><br>On the Wagon Day 2:<br>Fitz<br>ABR<br>Aegor<br>DP/chamber<br>Surye<br><br>So eliminating Fitz as scum that leaves one of the other four as most likely scum, I would lean Surye due to my problems with his individual play from Day 1 while the rest of them appear null, unreadable and simply annoy me. <br><br>So in conclusion I lean towards a scumteam of Fitz, Dessew and Surye."}

The situations are pretty much the same, actually - we were near LyLo there as well, I was probably going to die soon, and I was trying to keep one of my town reads from being mislynched.<br><br>So to wrap this up? The only team that could <span style=\"font-style: italic\">maybe</span> fit a scum-kushm4sta world is kushm4sta, Gooner, and havingfitz. Can I rule this team out completely? No. But here are some reasons why I think kush is town anyway, apart from his interactions with other players..."}
