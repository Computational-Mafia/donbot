Unvoting cannot change their fate.<br>\nV) If half the living players approve a No Lynch (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div>), then no player shall be lynched and the game shall enter Night Phase.

All players may continue to post during Twilight.<br>\nVII) If you have failed to post for over 48 hours, I will send you a prod. Failure to respond to this prod within 48 hours will result in the replacement of that player. Force-replacing of flakers/rule-breakers will be occur at my discretion.

I'm not the type to go back and look at someone's past games, but if what Smudger says is true, and Dessew's tell is obvious, then I don't see any problem putting a little pressure on him to see a reaction. So far, it hasn't been too revealing, and there now seems to be confusion about what his roles were (once again, not really into the meta stuff). I plan to not engage either player until I see anything noteworthy among their posts, but so far it's mainly been common RVS pressure, and Dessew's reaction hasn't made me lean towards scum or town.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DoctorPepper wrote:</cite>Also <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS: masenko</div></div></blockquote>\n\nI was planning on putting some pressure onto Kid A for his lack of response so far, but I'm more curious as to your reasoning for FOSing me, DoctorPepper.

His initial push on Dessew based off of a past game where he thought Dessew was town makes a lot of sense from a town perspective. On the other hand, if Smudger was scum, I doubt he would intentionally push on someone he perceives to be strong town. A cursory glance of Smudger/Dessew's past game shows that Dessew played quite well in that game enough that Smudger would remember him as a threat. The rest of his ISO also contains questions which seem to give him good leads like his push on Tommy for clarification followed up with a vote as well his continued probing of Masenko. I disagreed with his questioning of KidA but I don't think it is alignment indicative and Smudger is overall my strongest townread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">2) kushm4sta</div> &#8211; I like his questioning of Smudger in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5574413#p5574413\">45</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5574435#p5574435\">47</a> as I had the same concerns while initially reading through the thread. His attempt to understand Smudger and probe for further motivations in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5569370#p5569370\">82</a> also feels very town as does his jump onto Surye in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5582934#p5582934\">118</a> as I too found Surye's push on Masenko to be off. I also agree with Albert that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5588537#p5588537\">185</a> is extremely unlikely to come from scum. I am fairly certain Kushm4sta is town as well.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">3) Aegor</div>- I find Aegor's unexplained voting and bandwagoning very townish. He seems to believe that not explaining votes is useful and is voting back and forth without explaining any of them. I can see that he is reacting to the discussion in thread while concealing his own opinions in a way which I find very townish. The very flippant dismissal of Masenko in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5575684#p5575684\">69</a> with a sarcastic request to lynch him reads as town who is voting quite carelessly, trying to generate reactions, and is very unself-conscious. His continuing to vote without reason even when being accused of such is also very town. His questioning is accusatory and aggressive and it feels genuine. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">4) Kid A</div> &#8211; I really like KidA's initial push on Gooner and it strikes me as quite a bold move. I also feel that his follow-up was very town-oriented. He used the reactions generated from his initial push to FOS DoctorPepper in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5585132#p5585132\">141</a> and develop a readslist in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5585146#p5585146\">143</a>. I also really like how he never uses his reaction test as a reason for the FOS but lets it flow naturally. He doesn't feel the need to explain his RVS vote while he develops useful conclusions from it. This shows that he is more interested in progressing the gamestate. I also like the take-charge attitude that he is showing. I have a moderate townread on KidA although weaker than Smudger and Kush. KidA, more explanations for your reads would be good so I can see where you are coming from.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">5) Albert B. Rampage</div> &#8211; I lean town on Albert mainly for his very restrained demeanor which matches what I know of his towngames often taking a while get into the game. I particularly like his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5588579#p5588579\">187</a> where he mentions that Kushm4sta is town because no scum would ever post that. It matches up with my perspective of Albert as town based on other games I've played or read. It also matches up with my own thought processes on Kush4sta. I further like that his reads and the switches between his reads feel very raw and not having an underlying agenda.

I read through one of NJAC's past games and I see that he townreads people based on the content they generate so I can understand the scumread of Aegor there. I like his push for explanations and more votes on Aegor as well as townreads on other players which shows he isn't just tunneling the same player and is keeping a wider perspective of the game.

From experience, I find that scum are far more likely to create fake associative tells between their buddies and other townies so that in the event that their buddy is lynched, they can go after the townie, and in the event that the townie is lynched, they are exonerated from having to persue their buddy as much. Town sometimes tend to make associative tells as well but the strength of the reasoning Pepper provided for his Gooner-Masenko link is extremely weak making it more likely scum.  <br>\n<br>\nI initially thought I was reading too much into it but more tells surface. Gooner in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5593426#p5593426\">247</a> telling Masenko to vote Tommy (over Pepper) corroborates my initial suspicion. That post just seems very off. Gooner isn't trying to figure out why Masenko is not voting his biggest scumread. Gooner flat out told Masenko to change his vote. Gooner, what do you hope to achieve here? You are not voting Tommy, you are voting Masenko. You are telling your scumread (Masenko) to vote Tommy when you don't even have a read on Tommy. <br>\n<br>\nI think the scumteam is Pepper/Gooner + one of {Surye, Dessew, Tommy} <br>\n<br>\nI am not confident in any of my reads on the last three. If I am right about Pepper and Gooner, then Tommy probably is town.", "time": "Wed Jan 08, 2014 1:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=35882&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "35882"}

It seems like a slip from a player trying to justify leaping onto the wagon. It seems like someone who isn't actually reading my posts to investigate me but to get me lynched, one is something that town players do the other something that scum players do. This seems like a scumslip to me and I can certainly smell a lot of insincerity surrounding that comment. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly as part of his defence Surye claims that he felt that Aegor wasn't going to be lynched today:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5606366#p5606366\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5606366#p5606366\" data-post-id=\"5606366\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 361</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8508\">Surye</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5606334#p5606334\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5606334#p5606334\" data-post-id=\"5606334\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 358</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18516\">Gooner</a> wrote:</cite>Ok, busy day.

The fact he questions the assumption that the lynch is between Tommy, DP and myself and then asks for thoughts on Aegor before suddenly continuing to push people to vote for Aegor tends to suggest that he thinks he can get Aegor lynched and he disagrees with my thought that Aegor is not a candidate for the lynch. Again, his defence doesn't quite seem to jive with what he has put in the thread. <br>\n<br>\nFinally, he says that he re-reads me and Aegor. Why is he not considering the other candidates for a lynch if he feels that the lynch is between Tommy, DP and myself? Instead he only considers me for the lynch. Again I'm seeing a player who is not actually investigating or trying to work out who the right lynch is today and is instead just trying to pin a lynch on a random townie today. <br>\n<br>\nPart One of my scumteam thoughts, part two to come on Fusion and where I feel his insincerities lie.", "time": "Wed Jan 15, 2014 10:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=35882&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "35882"}

Anyway Fusion has had a scumread on Dr Pepper almost since his entry into the game and I have not seen a reason for him to change to Dr Pepper. Anyway, what I'm most concerned about is this point here. He says that my reaction seems town to get reads in before the hammer falls. Then in his next post he switches to me. Now the funny thing about this is that, at the time the vote count looked like this:<br>\nDr Pepper (3)<br>\nGooner (5)<br>\n<br>\nAt this time a switch to Pepper would have put one of his scumreads back into contention for a lynch rather than someone whose reactions seem town. Moreover, it could then be assumed that I would switch to Pepper before the deadline, I know my alignment and am not certain about his, it's only natural for me to vote there. That makes it 5-5. <br>\n<br>\nInstead of taking the opportunity to put a scumread into contention for the lynch Fusion puts someone whose reactions seem town to L-1. <br>\n<br>\nThis is not a natural townie reaction, a townie would put the vote on DP and at least try to push his lynch. Fusion's move at this point makes no sense from a town perspective, he had a chance to put a scumread of his into contention for the lynch and chose to put someone whose reactions seem town into L-1 instead.

ABR does seem dead set on the Gooner wagon, and from what I can tell this is down to him, Gooner,  claiming VT. I can live with that albeit briefly, until Gooners last few posts.  If scum he seems pretty resigned to the fact the lynch will happen but his reaction is pro town in my book, he provides in-depth posts on reads and breaks down why he suspects his 3 man scum team, this smacks of a town attitude IMO.

At the time, it was really important to me to work out whether I could trust ABR's relentless wagon. Now it's relented, of course. I think the difference between ABR's play style here and in that scum game is quite striking, so I thought you people might be interested. Not so much, as it turns out.<br>\n<br>\nNow, Dessew: I think you were first concerned about me when I said to Fusion, 'If DoctorPepper manages to claim power without being counter-claimed, I'll consider any flashwagon you suggest.&#8217; You interpreted that as an attempt to get some role information. In fact I was talking about how much time was left. I was worried that Fusion was imagining getting in our intent to hammer just before deadline - so I was making the point that a power claim can sometimes mean you have to abort a lynch and quickwagon another player, and it&#8217;s best to provide some time for that. But let&#8217;s be clear: my aim was to kill Pepper. Still is, actually.<br>\n<br>\nYour other problem (that I know of) was with the way I reacted to Rubicon&#8217;s entrance. I still don&#8217;t really get the way the town has dealt with Rubicon. It&#8217;s not like I was the one who brought up Rubicon&#8217;s role - he just claimed it on arrival. There was no vote pressure on him, he just did it. I struggle to see any motivation for that, town or scum. I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s lying. So I need to get more out of him. If he&#8217;s town, then obviously scum will be interested in these questions too. Of course I&#8217;m aware of that. But it can&#8217;t be helped: Rubicon opened a can of worms, and part of effective scum-hunting is to pick through them. It&#8217;ll have to wait till Day 2 now, though.<br>\n<br>\nNext I'll show that Surye is town.<br>\n<br>\nI felt he misrepresented masenkoEX early on, but my town read on him started around <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5586494#p5586494\" class=\"postlink\">163</a> (somewhat awkwardly, since I was voting for him at the time).

Then when he votes Aegor, he criticises the Gooner wagon for not having much to it - and man, was that true. Then he too falls under ABR&#8217;s spell and joins the terrible wagon. Point against him.

If you are town, you clearly think you \"spotted\" an amazing contradiction in my stance and pegged me as scum. Cases like this are sometimes annoying, sometimes just hilariously cute and laughable. Yours is the latter. I am not going to go into \"you misrepped me\" wall war because they rarely lead to alignment indicative discoveries. I'll just assume that in your haste, you genuinely misunderstood what I was saying. Here's what you missed:<br>\n<br>\nI found Tommy scummy because his defense of Surye felt contrived to me. He called Surye town with poor reasoning while he continued to push another player (Aegor). Surye didn't do that. Surye may have had suspicions of Aegor but the way he handled them felt more natural to me than Tommy's suspicions. The person they pushed on (Aegor in this case) is irrelevant. I don't particularly care who they pushed on. <br>\n<br>\nOther than that, Surye is Surye and Tommy is Tommy. They are different people. They have made different posts. They have acted differently, they have scumhunted differently. I am not going to treat them both as the same. Claiming that I am scum who has inconsistent stances because of this is juvenile scumhunting at best. That isn't how you catch scum. It is not as simple as looking at posts and saying \"Ooh, look! A contradiction! Scum!\" Analyzing scum motivations is multi-layered, complex, and requires substantial analysis.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5633190#p5633190\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5633190#p5633190\" data-post-id=\"5633190\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 623</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18516\">Gooner</a> wrote:</cite>The fact that Fusion is able to dig up a post from Surye, namely number 109, as a reason for Surye being town suggests he went back through the thread re-reading Surye, does it not, particularly considering he initally had Surye down as a not townread after having read through the thread?

Well Surye was also trying to push the Aegor wagon. This does not separate Tommy from Surye in any way. </div></blockquote> <br>\n<br>\nI found Tommy scummy because his defense of Surye felt contrived to me. He called Surye town with poor reasoning while he continued to push another player (Aegor). Surye didn't do that. Surye may have had suspicions of Aegor but the way he handled them felt more natural to me than Tommy's suspicions. The person they pushed on (Aegor in this case) is irrelevant. I don't particularly care who they pushed on. <br>\n<br>\nOther than that, Surye is Surye and Tommy is Tommy. They are different people. They have made different posts. They have acted differently, they have scumhunted differently. I am not going to treat them both as the same. Claiming that I am scum who has inconsistent stances because of this is juvenile scumhunting at best. That isn't how you catch scum. It is not as simple as looking at posts and saying \"Ooh, look! A contradiction! Scum!\" Analyzing scum motivations is multi-layered, complex, and requires substantial analysis.</div></blockquote>\nHow did Surye's push on Aegor feel more natural? Surye was voting for Aegor until 10 hours before the deadline. Moreover I don't see how Tommy voting Aegor is insincere in a situation where Tommy knows he is town and thinks Surye's town. <br>\n<br>\nI feel you were holding Tommy and Surye to a double-standard yesterday and that you knew you were going to vote for Tommy before you started reviewing their cases. \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5633190#p5633190\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5633190#p5633190\" data-post-id=\"5633190\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 623</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18516\">Gooner</a> wrote:</cite>The fact that Fusion is able to dig up a post from Surye, namely number 109, as a reason for Surye being town suggests he went back through the thread re-reading Surye, does it not, particularly considering he initally had Surye down as a not townread after having read through the thread? If Fusion had re-read Surye then he would have noticed that Surye was also trying to push through a last minute Aegor wagon and his point on Tommy would have been irrelevant. Put simply, it's impossible to miss Surye's attack on Aegor on a re-read if you're a townie genuinely trying to make a decision between Surye and Tommy.</div></blockquote> Like I said above, it is not the fact that Surye/Tommy were attacking Aegor. I didn't base my vote off of it. Rather, Tommy's defense of Surye came off like he was trying to pull a \"look at me! I am so town! I am not voting my counterwagon!\" move at towncred. Clearly I was wrong. I didn't have a ton of confidence in that read. Deadline was approaching.

I think if Fitz was town, he would have recognized that and insisted that while I am town I am wrong about him. He wouldn't quickly jump to an OMGUS attack and set himself up to weaken his townread and push me. The bolded is where he threatens to retract the read. It is quite clear. <br>\n<br>\nSaying I \"contradicted myself\" is laughable and proves nothing. Contradictions aren't scumtells. In fact, I think townies are probably far more likely to bring up contradictory thought processes in thread so I have no idea why you feel the need to point out something is contradictory.<br>\n<br>\nComing to the actual issue, I think it is extremely clear what I am trying to say about Fitz: Instead of substantiating his position (townread on me), he is attempting to weaken it (you could still be scum -&gt; you are trying my best to change it). I have no idea why you are ignoring the substance of the argument to argue that \"retracts townread\" and \"continued threat to retract townread\" are contradictory statements.

I've explained why I dislike fitz, his wording surrounding his read of me yesterday was all wrong. Kush needs to step up and actually start playing the game. Rubicon seems town to me for the amount of effort he's putting into scumhunting. Fitz being off the wagon makes me feel better about kush and Rubicon with my assumption that there is one scum off the wagon. <br>\n<br>\nOn the Wagon on Day 1:<br>\nDoctorPepper/chamber<br>\nAlbert B. Rampage<br>\nSurye<br>\nDessew<br>\nAegor<br>\n<br>\nWho do I dislike from this lot? Pretty much all of them actually. DP's simply complete null so far and was the counter-wagon which narrowly avoided the Axe. Definitely suspicious with the knowledge of how quickly the Tommy wagon appeared and how DP hovered close to the lynch for a long period of time but nothing from his in-play thread that particularly concerns me. The fact he was replaced suggests genuine inactivity rather than lurking. <br>\n<br>\nI like the fact ABR pushes his reads but if he spent as much effort explaining his reads as he did pushing them I would like him more. A lot of his votes and opinions simply feel baseless and he then seems to blame people for not following a baseless case. <br>\n<br>\nI still have issues with Surye's in-thread play but Fusion coming up town makes me feel better about him. <br>\n<br>\nDessew's a player whose in thread play I generally like but he has voted for two townies and he was a bit of a non-entity yesterday, I feel he could have worked harder to push the Fusion lynch. <br>\n<br>\nAegor's a serial bandwagoner and seems pretty much unreadable. If he's town he needs to step up and get his head in the game. <br>\n<br>\nOff the Wagon on Day 2:<br>\nDessew<br>\nRubicon<br>\nkushm4sta<br>\nWell with fitz as my best scumread and my logic that the most likely voting distribution is two scum on the wagon and one off it, that logically leaves Dessew as scum. Ok, fitz and Dessew so far then. <br>\n<br>\nOn the Wagon Day 2:<br>\nFitz<br>\nABR<br>\nAegor<br>\nDP/chamber<br>\nSurye<br>\n<br>\nSo eliminating Fitz as scum that leaves one of the other four as most likely scum, I would lean Surye due to my problems with his individual play from Day 1 while the rest of them appear null, unreadable and simply annoy me. <br>\n<br>\nSo in conclusion I lean towards a scumteam of Fitz, Dessew and Surye.", "time": "Mon Feb 03, 2014 5:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=35882&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "35882"}
