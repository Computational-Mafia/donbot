First, I believe that arguments that arise out of RVS are easily readable through the lens of \"is this player attempting to discover alignment\" or \"is this player attempting to win the argument\" town players tend to do the former, scum the latter. Second, I think that scum posts tend to try to keep the day random as long as possible, whereas town tend to jump right in and try to dig as far into what little information they have.  This one is a little less reliable than the former for finding scum players because town players tend to play like crap and enjoy being random and posting meaningless injokey crap that mires the thread down in randomness for pages and pages and allows the scum get away with doing the same, but its pretty good as a way to see which players are approaching the early game in a town way. I think your post fits these two patterns pretty well, so I'm pretty confident in you as town.<br><br>I hope that explains it a little better."}

If he's not maf, we don't really get much from that... maybe it would be best to lynch someone who would give us more info if they were town? It's easy to draw conclusions about people based on who the maf role is when they die, but hard to get much from it if they are town. That makes the theory of this game be sort of exponential, based a lot on the first day lynchee role. I think tonight if neither of the claimed masons get lynched, maf won't go for either of them.

It gives others a reason to look at beeboy and potentially makes it seem more acceptable for them to follow and vote him too without you needing to put much skin in the game until and if that happens.  It is very much the sort of thing one would do if they wanted a lynch, but didn't want to be seen as wanting it too much.  So yes, \"angling.\"  Your actions here don't only make sense if you disbelieve the claim - they also make sense if you're scum pretending to disbelieve the claim.  Hypothetical scum-you would have obvious incentive to want us lynched, whereas I don't see why hypothetical town-you would want to risk the lynch today even if you thought we might be scum.<br><br>Your use of the term \"weasel words\" is, ironically, an example of you using weasel words.  Your accusation of well-poisoning is too in the absence of an explanation of why my chosen words were a poor choice for what I was trying to say.  Like when you mentioned \"meandering\" without any explanation of why that was a poor choice of words.  Forgive me if I find your accusation of my using \"weasel words\" to be rather silly here."}

It mainly has to do with him \"ignoring\" me. Like I had to ask him about #195 3 or 4 times before he finally answered.

It's just not a thing that *actually* happens and it's not as unusual as it would seem for town players to be a bit reckless because of that.

I can understand why someone might potentially be unsure of the significant of what Dunnstral did, but duppin didn't give a reason for his hesitation in calling it scummy and, given that fact, the question in the second line just kind of seems tacked on.  I have the benefit of being 9 pages behind and being able to see how this turns out, so basically here's what I'm going to be looking for regarding duppin going forward: if he winds up voting Dunnstral really quickly OR backing off of this line of inquiry really quickly, I'm probably going to view it as at least a minor scum tell.  Either of those things would make it very plausible that he'd pre-chosen what he wanted to do with regards to Dunnstral and was just making a showing of putting his own stamp on his choice."}

Scum in some cases might also use self-meta as a defense if they're intentionally subverting their own meta or if their meta has recently changed, but it's probably less common.<br><br>What makes Dunnstral's post uncomfortable is that it leaves self-meta as the logical leap between what he said and what he meant - in order for his post to be meaningful, one must mentally add the statement \"Dunnstral would probably not be that gutsy as mafia.\"  Dunnstral's post is phrased in such a way that it's supposedly referring to a more global meta, which makes it easy to mentally add the appropriate logical leap without realizing that one is attributing anything specifically to Dunnstral's meta.  I'm not confident that the post is a scum tell, but it's....sleazy, in a way.  I think that whether or not it's a scum tell depends on how likely town would be to actually vocalize the leap to self-meta when posting that kind of a thought.  I'm currently leaning towards it being something that one would be reasonably likely to point out explicitly if they felt like it applies to them."}

In that case beeboy attempted to pressure genda to force him to claim vigi so they could out the other nk to claim so they could get him rid of him - if TSQ is the vigi that means they're most likely 3 mafia and they would straight up win this night since they would've killed off the only one who could NK him. If TSQ is the SK it means we most likely only have to mafias around, so we wouldn't lose yet.<br><br>It is possible, but I personally have a town read on beeboy so it's not something I'm willing to pursue. I'd obviously lose to a scum beeboy at this point.<br><br>So here is where I am at. I've been trying to revaluate my read on Titus' slot. While I do believe beeboy's claim, I do not believe his check clears her at all, but I kind of liked her posts today so I would at least like to consider a world where she could be town.<br>And I believe the only way for her to be town is if Heat is scum. <br><br>The votes on Titus day 1:<br>Heat, Beeboy, DeathRowKitty, Dwlee99, duppin<br><br>DRK and Dwlee confirmed town. I believe beeboy is town. That leaves me and Heat and I obviously know I am town.<br>That means that if Heat and Titus are both town this wagon was all town. Seems unlikely, but it's possible I guess. If this is indeed the case, then that means both day 1 trains (Titus and Zulfy) were both on town so scum wouldn't really need to care who their vote was on. This would however also mean that they chose to stack up on the same target two days in a row (since the d1 and d2 wagons were identical). If we have three mafias around I'd be very surprised if this was the case. If we have 2 mafias + a SK it makes a bit more sense though.<br><br>I'm personally more inclined to believe have a vigi + three mafias, but I honestly have no clue. That is also why I think it is very unlikely that Heat and Titus are both town. <br><br>I believe that if we have three mafias the team is Genda/TSQ, Titus/Heat and Firebringer.<br>If we have two mafias and a SK, then TSQ and Genda are both scum (sk/mafia) and last mafia would probably be Heat/Titus."}

I \"explained\" what I currently believe in and why I believe there is a mafia between you and Heat. I also mentioned TSQ/Gendaberry several times and I mentioned that if I had to pick a mafia between them (if we have three mafias which I believe) then I'd pick TSQ. What more would you like me to talk about? It should be obvious why I trust Genda a little bit more than TSQ (see my question to TSQ in #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7944086#p7944086\">1461</a>. This was the same point Genda brought up himself later actually, which I liked). <br><br>Just because we have a one and one doesn't mean I can't talk about something else for a while. In fact I'd say focusing on nothing but that is way more suspicious for obvious reasons. Beeboy is my top town so I wanted to know if he was townreading Heat (since he already claimed he was townreading you), because in that case I'd try to consider his reads for a while. My conclusion was that I do not believe both of you are town if we have three mafias but that it is a possibility if we have two mafias and a SK, although still unlikely.<br>Yes I know I am town and my obviously my thoughts are based around that.

VCA without a scum slip is not necessarily garbage. We had two identical (!) wagons two days in a row. Do you think that is a coincidence? <br>We had two trains tied day 1, one on you and then the other one on a confirmed town (Zulfy). Somehow the exact same people on Zulfy's train managed to lead a wagon day 2 on another town as well. How can we not read into that? Because we don't know your alignment? That is why I covered both possible scenarios (you as scum and you as town). If you are town, then I think Heat is most likely scum. It is possible he is town if we have 2 mafias and a SK. If you are scum, then Heat could honestly be anything but lean towards him being town.<br><br>So the only way I can see you as town is if we have 2 mafias and a SK, which is definitely possible but as previously stated I lean more towards the idea of us having 3 mafias around simply because I feel like town might be a tad too weak if not, but on the other hand it might just seem that way because of the night kills so far. Anyway, I can't see a scum team of three mafias without you. This is why I think you're scum.<br><br>You can go all paranoid and claim \"oh this is a setup, and now you're trying to do X because Y and blabla\", but I doubt that is going to get us anywhere."}

Am I trying to get you and Heat go after each other? Not really but it's a fair point. Knowing Heat is primed to do so is hardly truth though, since I wasn't aware that he was still scumreading you since he backed off. And why do you mention scumhunting again?

You believe we have a mafia and a SK which makes both TSQ and Genda mafia. I believe we have three mafias, which means only one of them is mafia. I consider it a possibility that we have a mafia and a SK in which case my reads are different. I honestly don't get your point. I've replied to everything you've just said but you just keep trying to discredit me by twisting what I'm saying. (like my \"reads depend on the setup\", wat)"}

Explain where I am wrong. <br><br>Stop making up weird stuff about me \"having to call you scum since your onto me\". I'd rather you actually respond to what I'm saying, like I am responding to you. Yesterday you made up so many weird reads to paint me as scum and everytime I addressed one of them you moved onto a new read. It's fairly obvious you're focusing more on coming up with actual reasons for scumreading me and trying to discredit what I'm saying than actually interacting me.<br><br>You called me out for OMGUS (claiming I was pushing on you since you were onto me), when the truth is that this is actually what you're doing. You haven't called me out a single time while I've called you scum throughout the entire game. Then when we get down to mylo (yesterday) and I give my read on you, you suddenly start to scumread me for no apparent reason whatsoever. Your scumread on me has not been based on my play but only on my push on you. If that is not OMGUS I don't know what it is. You're never addressed my acutal points, but would prefer to just try to discredit me and come up with bullshit claims as \"oh see this guy, backed into a corner, oh what a scummy push\" and whatsoever. <br><br>The thing about Beeboy makes no sense. Why would I argue that beeboy is scum? I've been townreading him throughout the entire game. What are you even saying? How did I float you yesterday? My read on you has been consistent, I brought it up yesterday since we might as well get some discussion going. The lynch was obviously going to be between Genda and TSQ. I wasn't even pushing on you yesterday, so I fail to see how I \"realized how bad my push was\" and I fail to see how I backed down. I'm still calling you scum. <br><br>When TSQ flipped I looked through ISO's again and noticed papermaker (your slot) had some okayish interactions with him, which made me revaluate my read on you. I still think you and Firebringer are the remaining scum. The only possible scumbuddy for Heat is Firebringer. So from my PoV Firebringer is 100% scum and the safest lynch. <br><br>As for why I didn't object to beeboy outing his result earlier, I wasn't expecting him to do so."}
