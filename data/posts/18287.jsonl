You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage in their respective QTs.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death: </div><br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.</div> Vote tags are also permitted if you would like to use those instead.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>\n6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, the player (or No Lynch) with the most votes will be lynched. In the case of a tie, the tie breaker will be the player who has the first active vote on them. Should there be no active votes at deadline no one will be lynched. I may grant deadline extensions if there are a significant number of replacements immediately before the deadline.<br>\n8. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Once you are killed (either via lynch or night kill) you may no longer post. This means that you do not even get a &#8220;Bah&#8221; post. The dead in this game are silent.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous/Mechanics: </div><br>\n1. <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bold, green</div> </div>text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>\n2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n4.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed. </div><br>\n5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n7. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. </div>Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The Golden Rule:<br>\n<br>\nPlease remember that this is a game and your main objective is to have fun! Be considerate of each other, don&#8217;t get personal, and enjoy the game.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample PM</div><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div><br>\nYou are just a simple villager.

Though, now that I know your vote on me isn't that random, that you think it was gut and followed it up with reposting what I've done and explaining everything <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">wrong</div>, everything up to the four points you give as to why I'm scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1)</div> I'm not constantly joking. That's RVS. I joke during RVS. Since Ludi has seriously questioned my play, I have not joked. Not once. Prove this wrong and I'll lynch myself.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2)</div> If you think this is overreacting to a case, let me show this to you.<br>\n<br>\nLudi has been concerned with the fact that he thinks I have this desire to lynch myself. Dedicated an entire post to it (which wasn't wrong, btw; read it in context to understand), but then directly links me to it. That's a problem.<br>\n<br>\nLudi also assumes that wanting votes on myself isn't the reason he's voting me, but that I've done something anti-town instead of simply saying \"yes.\" The only case he's given? The fact that I want votes on myself (which is wrong). He even says it's the only argument he needs.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">It doesn't make sense.</div> That's why I'm responding how I am.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3)</div> No. No. No. No. No. Ludi has had a vote on me for a while. I could've voted for him back as soon as he said he thought I was a good place to wagon. He talked more. I didn't like what he said. I voted. I gave reason for the vote. I don't vote for people that simply attack me. I vote for people that attack <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">anyone</div> for wrong reasons this early in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4)</div> You ignored my RVS vote on you.

It's funny how Jase criticizes Raaize for not wanting to discuss, yet Jase hasn't contributed to this discussion once...HM...his vote is on me, too...Jase. Talk. Soon. What do you think of the events that have occurred?<br>\n<br>\nHeliman, you haven't commented on Ludi's or my play. Do you think it's irrelevant compared to what Raaize has done so far?

Mafia, meanwhile, can be completely fucked if they die, and can fuck up for the rest of their team, which is why they don't want to make as many enemies as Town normally does, which is why he didn't ocmment on my vote or on the other BW vote on him.</div></blockquote>A load of interpretation.

I think everything he said on the matter is more or less what I would have said if I had been around at the time. SGRs unwillingness to say words is scummy. Getting the most basic god damn information about why you vote the way you do should not be like pulling fucking teeth. His point that Bo ignored his completely unexplained vote is not valid. Then he said this:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Considering we're still in the first few days of D1, I'm not interested in having a big argument, but in placing a vote in what seems to be an optimal D1 lynch.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat the hell do you mean the optimal D1 lynch? Nothing has happened yet, and you say you're placing your vote on the \"Optimal Lynch\", AND you think it's ok not to explain this vote? This does not check out at all. Then in post 49 he gives his reasoning against Bo in the space of 3 minutes. Looks like he had his reasons for making his vote in his head at the time he voted, and (back to my initial accusation against him) he just didn't want to get involved in the discussion. Scummy as all hell. Then of course there's his random ass unvote because he \"wants to figure out who he wants to vote first\" or something, pretty weak reason. At this point SGR is easily the scummiest in the game by quite a margin.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote<br>\nVote: SGR</div><br>\n<br>\nNow Ludis case agaisnt Bo seems mainly based on faulty theory. In the early game it's perfectly alright to intentionally accumulate votes on yourself to speed up discussion. While I don't really think that's what was happening acting a little scummy to start a legitimate bandwagon and kickstart discussion is a pro town move. Far better than everyone playing it straight and pretending their weak early game cases have any merit for the first five pages. It seems more though that Bos role in this was more just saying that he was alright with being that bandwagon that moves us out of RVS and the RV-esque. This is also fine with me. Ludi is null for me at this point.<br>\n<br>\nHeliman has been pretty reasonable so far but I don't have much of a read because not all scum say things that make no sense. Nothing he's said makes me think either way on him. Whatever, still early.<br>\n<br>\nEmp gets the same initial gripe as SGR. He throws out a vote but looks hesitant to engage in discussion. He's posted three times so far and he's given practically no content. What's the reason for your vote and for your Fos(es)?<br>\n<br>\nBos defense has been relatively well thought out.

On a side note, any explanation at all does not equal \"over explanation\".<br>\n<br>\nAs for the bit about me ignoring things there's not a whole let else to do. The lurkers are beginning to contribute. The only other interesting thing that's happening is the kiwi case, but they don't need my help advancing it. No point sheeping. Not time to lynch either so no point cheerleading for that case. I kicked off the case against you and that makes me head guy in charge of shouting at you. Until the game advances a little there isn't much else for me to do. I suppose I could try to pester Empking and see if he won't stop being so obtuse, but I'm not prepared to jump into that quagmire of tedium and sorrow alone.<br>\n<br>\nBluh I was going to outline my whole case here but I'm fucking tired and in all honesty you should be able to figure it out.

You know every vote on you will be a vote on town. We want to lynch scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe object of this game is not to vote town, rather to vote and lynch those players acting in the most-anti town ways, based on our own inner metrics, and hopefully they flip scum. <br>\n<br>\nAsking for votes on yourself is weird, and something I think no player with a town win condition should probably ever do. If the votes pile up to a lynch, you basically allowed scum to hop on for free onto a player who was openly asking for votes, which is anti-town, making it harder to discern who the scum are amongst the townies. <br>\n<br>\nNot only that, but as town you have to show the other townies through your actions that you are town. Asking for votes doesn't have any sembalance of pro-town motive (unless you can explain how voting for yourself and asking others to do so too is actually helping town, and I doubt you can), and I can think of several anti-town motives. <br>\n<br>\nYour actions don't help the town, and as most townies are actively trying to show their towniness and help town and scum are not, I easily conclude you're scum.<br>\n<br>\nThats why its a problem, and thats why i'm voting you. Actually, more people should as well.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYour logic here is horrible. Think about it. Yes a dead townie is bad. A dead maf is good. But neither is a good thing for the person being killed. You're really stretching if you think that is a good basis to lynch anyone, unless you just want someone dead and are looking for a reason to try and justify it. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SGRaaize wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Does Bo Know</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGive reasons for your votes! Seriously this drives me fucking nuts. I see absolutely no town motive in voting for someone (outside of RVS) without posting a reason for it with your vote. Lets say hypothetically, no one ever gave reasons for their votes. Think of how hard it would be for us to catch scum. It'd be damn near impossible to do it in an intelligent fashion.

I've only seen him make 1 joke (up to the point I've read) outside of RVS.<br>\n2. This is personal oppinion, but I don't think he's over reacting.<br>\n4. There was nothing in the other votes to defend against.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SGRaaize wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Heliman wrote:</cite>First, you can never Over-Justify a vote.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes, you can, its what I just did.

What could he have possibly said to that without looking over-reactive and scummy?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes, if only to comment on exactly how sheepy and how it had no reasoning, Mafia usually does this less because they don't want to show they care about the vote, meanwhile, town is not afraid of saying this, because they don't care if they get a lot of enemies, they just care about Town winning, which is something that can happen after they die. Mafia, meanwhile, can be completely fucked if they die, and can fuck up for the rest of their team, which is why they don't want to make as many enemies as Town normally does, which is why he didn't ocmment on my vote or on the other BW vote on him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n@First response: Oh God!

Because I use basic concepts since I have found that they are the most reliable when your searching for scum. Kiwi was already scummy in my eyes. I gave him the ultimatum because I was tired of him dodging peoples question and wanted him to answer it before I decided to vote him or not. I said what town kiwi should do because I noticed that he had been doing none of this and was pointing out his un-townie behavior while under pressure.
