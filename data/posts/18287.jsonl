You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage in their respective QTs.<br>3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a \u201cNo Action\u201d PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death: </span><br>1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone\u2019s fate.<br>3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>4. Please submit votes as: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.</span> Vote tags are also permitted if you would like to use those instead.<br>5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, the player (or No Lynch) with the most votes will be lynched. In the case of a tie, the tie breaker will be the player who has the first active vote on them. Should there be no active votes at deadline no one will be lynched. I may grant deadline extensions if there are a significant number of replacements immediately before the deadline.<br>8. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Once you are killed (either via lynch or night kill) you may no longer post. This means that you do not even get a \u201cBah\u201d post. The dead in this game are silent.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous/Mechanics: </span><br>1. <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Bold, green</span> </span></span>text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>4.<span class=\"noboldsig\"> Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don\u2019t get missed. </span><br>5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>7. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. </span>Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The Golden Rule:<br><br>Please remember that this is a game and your main objective is to have fun! Be considerate of each other, don\u2019t get personal, and enjoy the game.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample PM</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span><br>You are just a simple villager. You have no other weapon other than your vote, so use it wisely.<br><br>You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</div></blockquote>"}

What could he have possibly said to that without looking over-reactive and scummy?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes, if only to comment on exactly how sheepy and how it had no reasoning, Mafia usually does this less because they don't want to show they care about the vote, meanwhile, town is not afraid of saying this, because they don't care if they get a lot of enemies, they just care about Town winning, which is something that can happen after they die. Mafia, meanwhile, can be completely fucked if they die, and can fuck up for the rest of their team, which is why they don't want to make as many enemies as Town normally does, which is why he didn't ocmment on my vote or on the other BW vote on him.</div></blockquote>A load of interpretation. I've seen plenty of anxious scum and mellow town in my day, your argument boils down to individual play style.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SGRaaize wrote:</cite>Also ,your chainsaw defending of Bo is duly noted, as well as the fact you completely ignored all his scummy posts and his attitude in general, when and if Bo flips scum, you're next.</div></blockquote><br>Your red herring makes me shake in my internet boots.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Does Bo Know</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>Does Bo Know wrote:</cite>Heliman, you haven't commented on Ludi's or my play. Do you think it's irrelevant compared to what Raaize has done so far? Or did you even think any of it was scummy in the first place?</div></blockquote>I don't feel that the argument has carried it's course yet, but it feels like town vs town currently. As I see it now, your \"joke\" can be interpreted in favor of either side of the argument, and may even be beginning to boil down to just plain WIFOM."}

Then he said this:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Considering we're still in the first few days of D1, I'm not interested in having a big argument, but in placing a vote in what seems to be an optimal D1 lynch.</div></blockquote><br>What the hell do you mean the optimal D1 lynch? Nothing has happened yet, and you say you're placing your vote on the \"Optimal Lynch\", AND you think it's ok not to explain this vote? This does not check out at all. Then in post 49 he gives his reasoning against Bo in the space of 3 minutes. Looks like he had his reasons for making his vote in his head at the time he voted, and (back to my initial accusation against him) he just didn't want to get involved in the discussion. Scummy as all hell. Then of course there's his random ass unvote because he \"wants to figure out who he wants to vote first\" or something, pretty weak reason. At this point SGR is easily the scummiest in the game by quite a margin.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote<br>Vote: SGR</span><br><br>Now Ludis case agaisnt Bo seems mainly based on faulty theory. In the early game it's perfectly alright to intentionally accumulate votes on yourself to speed up discussion. While I don't really think that's what was happening acting a little scummy to start a legitimate bandwagon and kickstart discussion is a pro town move. Far better than everyone playing it straight and pretending their weak early game cases have any merit for the first five pages. It seems more though that Bos role in this was more just saying that he was alright with being that bandwagon that moves us out of RVS and the RV-esque. This is also fine with me. Ludi is null for me at this point.<br><br>Heliman has been pretty reasonable so far but I don't have much of a read because not all scum say things that make no sense.

He's posted three times so far and he's given practically no content. What's the reason for your vote and for your Fos(es)?<br><br>Bos defense has been relatively well thought out.

I dunno...This is an invalid question even if I did actually support the Bo wagon. Why should it be weird that I am suspicious of a dude who is suspicious just because he jumped on the same wagon that I happened to be on?"}

Your choice of words here is interesting.<br><br>There is a lot of discussion on Jase being scummy, I really don't see it though, I have kind of a null read on him right now.<br><br>I like ViFam's case on Kiwi.<br><br><br>Okay.

If the votes pile up to a lynch, you basically allowed scum to hop on for free onto a player who was openly asking for votes, which is anti-town, making it harder to discern who the scum are amongst the townies. <br><br>Not only that, but as town you have to show the other townies through your actions that you are town.

Seriously this drives me fucking nuts. I see absolutely no town motive in voting for someone (outside of RVS) without posting a reason for it with your vote. Lets say hypothetically, no one ever gave reasons for their votes. Think of how hard it would be for us to catch scum. It'd be damn near impossible to do it in an intelligent fashion.

What could he have possibly said to that without looking over-reactive and scummy?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes, if only to comment on exactly how sheepy and how it had no reasoning, Mafia usually does this less because they don't want to show they care about the vote, meanwhile, town is not afraid of saying this, because they don't care if they get a lot of enemies, they just care about Town winning, which is something that can happen after they die. Mafia, meanwhile, can be completely fucked if they die, and can fuck up for the rest of their team, which is why they don't want to make as many enemies as Town normally does, which is why he didn't ocmment on my vote or on the other BW vote on him.</div></blockquote><br><br>@First response: Oh God!

A vote on kiwi should be a vote from your own voiced opinion. I feel something like <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3288338#p3288338\" class=\"postlink\">voting based off an ultimatum</a> is an attempt to have undeniable justification. That is to say, if anyone goes back and questions his vote, YoYo can just defend, \"It's not MY fault! I said I was going to vote him if he didn't answer! You can't deny my policy, it's there in black and white.\" The point is, there were plenty of good reasons to vote for kiwi.

It talks about what town-kiwi should be doing, even though YoYo has his vote on him towards a lynch. I'm having a hard time describing it. It almost assumes kiwi will flip town?

Because I use basic concepts since I have found that they are the most reliable when your searching for scum. Kiwi was already scummy in my eyes. I gave him the ultimatum because I was tired of him dodging peoples question and wanted him to answer it before I decided to vote him or not. I said what town kiwi should do because I noticed that he had been doing none of this and was pointing out his un-townie behavior while under pressure. Does anyone even use the 3rd vote on the wagon = scum anymore. I'm sorry but in all the games I've been in, I haven't seen more scum be 3rd on the wagon than what statistics say it should be."}

There wasn't much activity by D2 and D3 so scum seemed to be well on the way to victory. Then came the Vifam-lynch and baboon-NK and I really thought either the town or YoYo was going to win; but then Soda jumped on the almost-confirmed doctor and pushed for his lynch. In the dead QT we pretty much agreed that wierdalexv was confirmed by then as baboon's town-RB claim was obviously false.<br><br>I thought the setup was balanced. I was surprised at how far the SK made it before using his BP, so I was glad of that. The roleblocker worked well for scum (blocked the SK and doc successfully) whereas the JOAT, which I consider one of town's more powerful PRs, didn't really get to do a whole lot.<br><br>If anybody has any comments/questions/concerns, feel free to let me know.
