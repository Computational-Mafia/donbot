I see the usage of this word in this case as not because fro99er is scumreading become, but because fro99er is overemotionally scumreading become without giving explanations. Yeah, after being called \"dense\" fro99er expands on his scumread finally. That's the next reason: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">become doesn't OMGUS</span>.

Why? Quite easy: they're partners. But even if they are not, that might mean one and the only thing: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">if fro99er is scum, LQ is town</span>. scum!fro99er wouldn't townread his partners so easily in the beginning of the game. I myself can clearly say that if fro99er is scum, then LQ is very probable town and I can call that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I trust fro99er's reads, but I do not trust him</span>. Makes sense? Yes.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9111122#p9111122\" class=\"postlink\">post 294</a>, Fro99er wrote:</cite>So you think I'm scum?<br><br>Then why is your \"RVS\" (because of his opinions) vote sitting on rb still?</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Here I can say the only answer to this question: become doesn't want to vote for his partner (fro99er). What is the other reason? I mean if become is scum and fro99er is town, become would as easily move his vote on him. But he does not. Because he is confused!newb!scum with tunneling for towncred partner.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Basically, there's no real reason behind fro99er's become scumread. 1.

In those 6 posts you 1) never mention my L-2 vote, 2) you seem to accept a Waffle wagon as well, 3) you vote LaLight  with only the comment \"Best thing yet, he has never been mislynch so we have nothing to lose\" (HTF does that even make any sense) , and then 4) you question iaws of his comment about LaLight and a mislynch.  Which seems odd given the comment you made when you voted LaLight.  So yeah...you are a solid candidate for scum atm.<br><br>I liked LaLight's post where he voted Fro99er.

In those 6 posts you 1) never mention my L-2 vote, 2) you seem to accept a Waffle wagon as well, 3) you vote LaLight  with only the comment \"Best thing yet, he has never been mislynch so we have nothing to lose\" (HTF does that even make any sense) , and then 4) you question iaws of his comment about LaLight and a mislynch.  Which seems odd given the comment you made when you voted LaLight.  So yeah...you are a solid candidate for scum atm.<br><br>I liked LaLight's post where he voted Fro99er.

Logically you voting for me and not Why makes zero sense unless the above post was an attempt to line up a mislynch on RB/me if your buddy got lynched after your bus."}

All your responses for why you are not Scum were \"I'm Town tho\" which is not going to be something a good mafia player is going to say.<br><br>Articulation only helps your game and never hurts it. you don't need to make wall posts, but you do need to provide rational for why you are Town and why X is Scum or Y is Town. Sometimes I just state a read naked, but that is because I know people are either going to see what I am seeing or they are going to ask. I am actually always counting on them asking. If they don't then I can use that against people who contradict my read later if they don't provide their reasons for Scum reading a player I said was Town.
