You later are crestfallen about this and say it is in regards to BlueBloodedToffee, and I believe it. It would be a great way to start casting suspicion upon people who answered your request. However, you could have just cut to the chase and asked if any of us have played with him. I still have not seen that, despite that being something you needed for a theory.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7619586#p7619586\">257</a>: Yeah, sucks to be you; you were late and missed the part where we left the RVS station on the scumhunting train. In context of the thread, your vote came in when the Dwlee99 wagon was gaining steam and a renewed push on Nosferatu would be a good thing. You say you wanted to place an RVS vote, but I saw it as something else.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7619596#p7619596\">258</a>: Having not read the game, maybe you should not have weighed in on an issue you were not reading and simply not posted. Again your timing is impeccably bad in context. It is plausible and understandable that you might not be caught up and not sure if you wanted to join a wagon that could have been bad. However, your PR motivation is shaky; Dwlee99 had been confirmed to be fake-claiming, that much was very obvious from the non-ramifications his claim caused. You are not cleared in my eyes, but your acceptable explanations will be kept in mind.<br>\n<br>\nWell, except for this bad TheCow read you soon put up.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7619647#p7619647\">261</a>: Uh, by <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7606152#p7606152\">96</a>, TheCow was definitely voting Dwlee99. Invalid. At <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610923#p7610923\">160</a>, he joked that he wanted to double-vote because Dwlee99 was so bad, and your <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">continued</div> misunderstanding of this is what is seriously wrong. Invalid and bad. This read is really, really bad.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7619672#p7619672\">264</a>: Okay, so you understand, Performer: by the vote count at the top of page three, it is clear that Dwlee99 was fake-claiming. That is exactly when it got sorted, along with Dwlee99's subsequent (paraphrasing here) \"lol you fell for a fake-claim\". You cannot make valid reads out of situations you are not understanding. Invalid. Moving on to his Chumba read and vote: Zulfy is not wrong that there was a bad question and not wrong to vote it. More null to me, especially as he shifts his reads and votes to TheCow and then Dwlee99 not long after, especially when he was defending Dwlee99 from Chumba earlier. Maybe pro-town, but nothing definitive for me. Zulfy's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7617721#p7617721\">179</a> is a simple pool of potential scum candidates. Pretty null evidence there, and not impressive from Zulfy, and not impressive of you to get a read from, Performer.<br>\n<br>\nYour later vote for Boon, despite your scumread on TheCow is the result of a poor logic chain.

Maybe being friendly with Chumba, maybe. His Heat vote may have been another opportunity vote or a last attempt of distancing, and I am going with the former as a good gut feeling.

I don't know how you see your slot as obvious town. YesterDay I couldn't decide if it was his ego or his play that was hitting me wrong, but the fact that he wouldn't hammer Nos but told Heat to put his vote there was bad. Heat I keep forgetting about, which I don't like. I didn't even remember he was in this game until I went back and reread it. Bothers me he can't remember why he scumread me, but at the same time, the game stalled quite a bit and I think a lot of us lost interest. Performer's yesterday was bad, his reads and votes not lining up, wasn't impressed with his start for today. Was planning on him or heat for now, depending on heat's response (if he ever gets back to me) on why he was scumreading me yesterday. <br>\n<br>\nI like Madonna and Droog for town.

I did not like her Day 1 interactions with Dwlee99, and her Zulfy vote on Day 2 seem flimsily supported by her <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7617745#p7617745\">184</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7617769#p7617769\">188</a>. UpTooLate's final vote of Day 1 was for my townread TheCow (and future obvtown), and the reason for that again is flimsy (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7609276#p7609276\">140</a>). UpTooLate posts previous to voting TheCow went like this: RVS, nothing, nothing, lol Heat vote, nothing, agrees with Zulfy about TheCow, null Nosferatu comment, shades Chumba, then votes TheCow. After that vote, UpToolate throws out a small defense for Dwlee99, claiming Dwlee99's fakeclaim was perceivable as a joke. (Maybe it was...but under pressure? Context.) Then it is four more interactions with Dwlee99, with no effort on UpTooLate's part to push her TheCow wagon and does not join the Dwlee99 wagon. Albert B. Rampage hammers, day done.<br>\n<br>\nDay 2. Cannot see why TheCow might scumlean/read UpTooLate and calls it OMGUS (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7617704#p7617704\">177</a>). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7617745#p7617745\">184</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7617769#p7617769\">188</a>, again, lame reasons to suspect Zulfy. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7618655#p7618655\">210</a> is clearly wrong because UpTooLate and I have different priorities <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> because despite the misrep, that still is avoiding the wagon of our best suspect in favor of a townread. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7618766#p7618766\">223</a> is bad because of an unwillingness to admit there are multiple ways to interpret her reasoning for voting Zulfy, no misrep. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7618766#p7618766\">223</a> is also interesting here because it highlights the change of votes from Heat to TheCow, which distances UpTooLate from Dwlee99 and gets another vote on TheCow, maybe to change where things were going. It turns out to be just one vote, though, since Zulfy jumps off TheCow to jump on Dwlee99. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7618805#p7618805\">226</a> is hilariously bad because UpTooLate admits to agreeing with Zulfy on Day 1, only to use crappy reasoning to vote Zulfy Day 2, especially after Zulfy helped lynch scum. That gets us through the 200's, and I am going to pause in this tirade for a moment. I keep officially voting UpTooLate until vote count 2.5 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7625705#p7625705\">357</a>), where it says I voted Performer, and I think the reason for that was that Performer came back in force and was stunningly bad while doing so.<br>\n<br>\nI could probably keep going and find a way to scum up UpTooLate further, but at some point, I had to decide if both UpTooLate and Performer were both scum and I could not concretely accept that idea. And I was voting Performer, right? And I scumread him on Day 1, and here he was scumming it up some more on Day 2, in direct response to me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then I went quiet, and the reason there is because I already devote a lot of time and thought to the game, and was not willing to spend more time sorting my scumreads thoroughly, and unsure if I could because I turned into a hate machine in response to the two of them. It is not until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7640727#p7640727\">489</a> that I know that I definitely, definitely do not want a Nosferatu lynch, and eh, that is what we got. I did not give near enough of myself between 325 and 584, sorry for dialing that in.<br>\n<br>\nYeah, I got plenty to push for an UpTooLate lynch if I genuinely felt they were coming from a scumspot. But again to my waffling between Performer and UpTooLate; one must/might be a misguided town that I am reading wrong because of a lot of dislike. I am more than happy to try to take in other people's reads of them once I am less self-absorbed.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr performer, i could do the same to you, probably", "time": "Wed Feb 17, 2016 7:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

I am going to say yes, despite my eroding townread of him late game. Why? The claims; there is only one other power role claimed, and town needs at least one of them. My poor brain demands that much. I like RadiantCowbells for town because we had no death last night. Earlier, I was worried RadiantCowbells and Boonskiies conspired their claims, opting for a no-kill in order to validate one/both of them because they were getting some heat. That is still possible, but way less likely than RadiantCowbells being a legit Jailkeeper, no matter what Boonskiies' alignment.<br>\n<br>\nSo, RadiantCowbells jailed me, and there was no kill. What does that mean? It means I either was scum trying to night kill or I was the intended night kill. If you are Alchemist21, that second half apparently does not exist. If you are town capable of deduction, that second half still counts for a heck of a lot. Because RadiantCowbells' action does not give a definitive result here; I may still be town, and we do not want to lynch town.<br>\n<br>\nSo I am going to ask people to cool it with the knee-jerk votes and at least consider the possibility of me being town. Look at my previous Days' plays and try to see them from a scum or town angle. I suggest you try to scum them up and see where that logic takes you. Why did I play Day 1 as I did? Why did I play Day 2 as I did? You get the idea. Bring some real arguments to the table as to why this Vanilla townie needs to die before another Vanilla townie, or anyone else for that matter. Am I a stronger scumread to you than other possible scumspects? You guys should work to validate your votes on me, no lazy voting nonsense.", "time": "Fri Feb 26, 2016 1:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

If he were scum though, wouldn't it make more sense for him to keep what he found to himself?<br>\n<br>\nBy putting the pressure on you to reveal your role, he must have known that it would draw a lot of attention back onto himself. That seems like a townie move to me.<br>\n<br>\nAt the same time, his claimed actions from earlier nights are pretty convenient. I've played with BBT before so I can understand the motivation there, but from what I can remember of reading through the early parts of this thread there was really nothing about TheCow that would have made him a good choice for motion detecting. Not to say that he was a bad choice, just that better choices were available. So it just seems convenient that he happened to choose someone who is now dead. <br>\n<br>\nAnd we also have to consider what he was hoping to get from you by forcing you to reveal. If he is just a motion detector of either alignment, all he would have seen is that you had some action last night, right? So if he's town aligned it makes sense that he would force your hand and make you claim on the chance that you were/are scum. If he's scum aligned, I guess his motive would be to try and gauge if you had a power role that could have stopped the NK, or if you had something like an information role because then he'd know that someone else in the game had a power role that stopped the NK. Unless scum just chose to go no-kill, in which case he'd just want to know what power your role holds.<br>\n<br>\nSo I mean, now that I write it out there are a lot of variables. I see your point that he could still be scum, I just don't know if scum would risk drawing so much attention to themselves and having exactly this happen.", "time": "Fri Feb 26, 2016 9:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

My belief is that the last 2 scum are in those 3 slots, and I wanted to see how their interactions together (and with Dwlee) looked.  <br>\n<br>\nMadonna was the only one of the three to vote Dwlee, which at first seemed to be a sheep of Cow's vote and later she had reasons to keep her vote on Dwlee following the Gladiator fakeclaim.  This would make her look Townier than the other 2, but some of her posts look like blatant coaching, perhaps in the hope that Dwlee would straighten up and get suspicion off of him.  Later in the game she's pretty vocal about her suspicions of Performer, which to me indicates that if she's scum it's likely not with Perf, and also means that she was plausibly the NK target if Perf was scum.  There wasn't any interaction between Madonna and Robster when he replaced in, just Madonna wondering if being a NK target really meant Performer could be scum.<br>\n<br>\nHeat was hesitant to put Dwlee to L-1 which obviously could be from a scumbuddy who didn't want to bus.  I think Heat being scum with Madonna is very plausible.  There is little interaction betweem the two or betweem Madonna and Bitten.  Heat being scumbuddies with Performer seems highly unlikely to me.  Heat started D2 with a vote on Performer (basing it on a reason that could apply to multiple people in the game actually) and continued voting him and voicing more reasons for suspecting him over time, even when Performer's wagon was at L-2, only leaving the wagon when Heat's vote was the only one left on Performer and was choosing between Nosferatu and UTL.  I can't see scum, after being hesitant to bus D1, start hardbussing their remaining partner D2 with a reason that could have been used on Town players.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer was also hesitant to vote Dwlee, which also puts him in the candidacy for a Dwlee scumbuddy, but that's about as far as it gets for me.  This may be reiterating what I said in the above two paragraphs, but I don't see Performer being scum with either of the other 2 slots.  It would have to mean he was getting bussed by his partner after Dwlee got lynched, and either Madonna is some kind of super-busser or Heat, well, I can't even imagine what Heat would have been thinking to not bus D1 then start hardbussing D2.  Also, I think scum subconciously avoid interacting with each other, and while neither replacement have interacted with each other/Madonna, Performer was not only facing suspicion from these 2, he responded to both in equal measure.  I could see scum wanting to distance from each other and maybe planning out scum theater during the Night, but not to the extent it went with him getting to L-2.  <br>\n<br>\nMy conclusion here is that the likeliest scumteam is Madonna and Bitten10MinutesAgo.  The only alternative to me is if I'm wrong about the Chumba/Droog slot being Town, and I'll look back through their ISO tomorrow, but as I've said before Droog's play hasn't given me any scumvibes, and I accidentally ISO'd Chumba at first thinking he was who Bitten replaced and was getting Townvibes from him.", "time": "Sat Feb 27, 2016 5:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

I'm just trying to get a better understanding of where you were coming from with that assessment.", "time": "Sat Feb 27, 2016 5:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

I don't think we can ever really fully accept anyone else as town unless we have absolute concrete proof. And yes, it seems almost definite that you're telling the truth about being jailer, but I'm just trying to keep an open mind and stay critical. I think that's the most important part of the game is never taking anything for granted and always keeping your guard up.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point I also think we need to start looking at who could be working together. I think it might be easier to find scum that way, because their interactions with each other might give them away more easily than just their posts on their own.<br>\n<br>\nI'm intrigued by the idea that Madonna could have actually been the NK target with the intention to frame you, just because that really narrows down the possibilities for who could be scum. Like my first suggestion that it was a big orchestrated thing with boon as scum seems kind of far fetched, so for just a second let's count him out of the equation. In that scenario we'd be assuming that you, boon, and Madonna are all town. I know that I'm town, but I don't expect you to just believe that, so leave me in the equation and your four remaining suspects are myself, Robster, droog, Zulfy, and Alch. So then it's a matter of looking at that group and not only trying to discern who could be scum, but who the most likely team is.<br>\n<br>\nBut that's where I struggle. I can come up with the different possible scenarios, but when it gets down to the actual reads and meta-ing of people's posts, I'm not always quick to pick up on different cues that might give someone a scum vibe. I think a big part of that is my inexperience, but I'm also just a gullible person so I'm easily convinced by anyone insisting to me that they're town as long as they can come up with a semi plausible reason.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, the TL;DR here is that I am really trying to stay critical and not align myself with anyone until I can be absolutely positive they're town. We really need a scum lynch today, I'm just not sure where to start with that.", "time": "Sat Feb 27, 2016 6:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

Droog replaced in, and the Townread became mutual.  I want to rule this out as a scumteam because I think it's pretty risky for scum to out each other as strong Town at the point they did, and Madonna's statement re: Chumba seems so knee-jerk for a situation when Chumba was barely pressured.  Given how Madonna handled Dwlee's lynch, I can't see her jumping at panicking over her scumbuddy for something as minor as Performer's first post on D3.  <br>\n<br>\nI can't really rule out Bitten/Droog as a scumteam because the little interaction there revolved around the claims, but I think an attempt to NK Madonna would come more likley from a Droog/Robster scumteam.  For Droog/Robster, Madonna it would be a matter of letting her live to be of use to Droog, or killing her for being a threat to Robster, while Droog/Bitten loses the buddying potential with a Madonna kill but gains some ammo to push a Robster lynch.  The thing about that though is I think they'd rather leave Madonna alive if the aim was pushing Robster's lynch.  People already suspected the slot and Madonna was one of the big voices for that lynch.  Pushing the lynch would be easier with Madonna alive.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7629311#p7629311\">394</a> has Chumba give a rather apathetic Townread of Performer while Performer is at L-2. I'd expect a little more urgency from someone trying to save a scumbuddy in that situation, and he actually put Dwlee at L-2, but ended on a note of IGMEOY more than \"I want you dead.\"  If Chumba is scum with Peformer, he's been pretty calm about their situations.  I think I'd rule this one out too.<br>\n<br>\nSo in my mind, the options are either Madonna and Bitten, or Droog and Bitten.  I don't think Droog/Bitten had much to gain from a Madonna kill, so I still think the most likely scumteam is Madonna and Bitten.", "time": "Mon Feb 29, 2016 3:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}

Rampage, both of which later turn out to be town, so either he had been suffering a lot of misinterpretation as town, or had been trying to scum up two townies and get their mislynches. I...I am pretty paranoid, so not sure I really be scumreading the droog/Chumba slot, and I know I do not want to because of at least his read on me. His read on TheCow was fine too, but both easy to fake and say, since TheCow was dead by the time droog showed up.<br>\n<br>\nHonestly, I will agree that Zulfy did nothing stellar in terms of scumhunting, which is basically why he was getting pinged by people, but there was a very raw and honest way he went about it that cleared his slot for me. It helped me deal with anything that might have been misconstrued as scummy. That people tried to use that as Day 2 leverage versus people's developing stances from Day 1 was grating. The unchallenged Mason claim really helped narrow down our suspect pool.<br>\n<br>\nAlbert B. Rampage has been a very divisive and decisive player in our game. A lot of ego, a lot of surety, even in the face of being dead wrong or doing less than he claimed. However, he moved strongly when he did, was not easily persuaded to change his vote, and apparently was a fucking jailer. So yeah, I will not say he was great, and he eroded my townread of him, but with RadiantCowbells' claim, you have to know he did everything in a good light.<br>\n<br>\nWhatever the case, droog lost his positioning on Zulfy and RadiantCowbells, and is then forced to find scum somewhere.

First, I share how I approached the claim, then how I viewed in context of the game state. Remember, this is in response to a guy stating I both fell for his fakeclaim, that it was some kind of scumtell, and that I was \"interesting bad\" quote unquote. So I point out where he was wrong. I also point out despite him finding me bad, he does not vote me, instead keeps his vote on Nosferatu. Why? Maybe he does not want to alienate me entirely, while trying to get other people to look at me and say, \"Hey, that person is interesting bad!\" I can only theorize because he clearly had no plan of attack. Voting back at me would have been pretty bad for him, honestly, but so was trying to deflect attention to me and not follow through with it himself.  He could not even bake up an argument for voting me, going with the vague \"interesting bad\" reason instead of something scumslanted because he simply could not think of how to scum me up. I was/am town; what arguments could he have? It turns out none, and that is it. Newbie scum found wanting, found a liar, and it is absolutely okay to Lynch All Liars on Day 1 after RVS.<br>\n<br>\nIf I was coaching Dwlee99, was I coaching other players too when I asked them for more basis to their arguments, like Chumba and Performer? What about when I walked players through their bad plays and did not vote them, like Nosferatu and Zulfy?<br>\n<br>\nLook at all this swing based on the long shot that I must have distance voted Dwlee99 originally and then had to bus him to prevent collecting suspicion. One might think I did not even try to get off the wagon, like potentially being okay with a Heat lynch or agreeing with Performer that we <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">might</div> still be in RVS.

My belief is that the last 2 scum are in those 3 slots, and I wanted to see how their interactions together (and with Dwlee) looked.  <br>\n<br>\nMadonna was the only one of the three to vote Dwlee, which at first seemed to be a sheep of Cow's vote and later she had reasons to keep her vote on Dwlee following the Gladiator fakeclaim.  This would make her look Townier than the other 2, but some of her posts look like blatant coaching, perhaps in the hope that Dwlee would straighten up and get suspicion off of him.  Later in the game she's pretty vocal about her suspicions of Performer, which to me indicates that if she's scum it's likely not with Perf, and also means that she was plausibly the NK target if Perf was scum.  There wasn't any interaction between Madonna and Robster when he replaced in, just Madonna wondering if being a NK target really meant Performer could be scum.<br>\n<br>\nHeat was hesitant to put Dwlee to L-1 which obviously could be from a scumbuddy who didn't want to bus.  I think Heat being scum with Madonna is very plausible.  There is little interaction betweem the two or betweem Madonna and Bitten.  Heat being scumbuddies with Performer seems highly unlikely to me.  Heat started D2 with a vote on Performer (basing it on a reason that could apply to multiple people in the game actually) and continued voting him and voicing more reasons for suspecting him over time, even when Performer's wagon was at L-2, only leaving the wagon when Heat's vote was the only one left on Performer and was choosing between Nosferatu and UTL.  I can't see scum, after being hesitant to bus D1, start hardbussing their remaining partner D2 with a reason that could have been used on Town players.<br>\n<br>\nPerformer was also hesitant to vote Dwlee, which also puts him in the candidacy for a Dwlee scumbuddy, but that's about as far as it gets for me.  This may be reiterating what I said in the above two paragraphs, but I don't see Performer being scum with either of the other 2 slots.  It would have to mean he was getting bussed by his partner after Dwlee got lynched, and either Madonna is some kind of super-busser or Heat, well, I can't even imagine what Heat would have been thinking to not bus D1 then start hardbussing D2.  Also, I think scum subconciously avoid interacting with each other, and while neither replacement have interacted with each other/Madonna, Performer was not only facing suspicion from these 2, he responded to both in equal measure.  I could see scum wanting to distance from each other and maybe planning out scum theater during the Night, but not to the extent it went with him getting to L-2.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">My conclusion here is that the likeliest scumteam is Madonna and Bitten10MinutesAgo.  </div>The only alternative to me is if I'm wrong about the Chumba/Droog slot being Town, and I'll look back through their ISO tomorrow, but as I've said before Droog's play hasn't given me any scumvibes, and I accidentally ISO'd Chumba at first thinking he was who Bitten replaced and was getting Townvibes from him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7706020#p7706020\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7706020#p7706020\" data-post-id=\"7706020\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1163</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24636\">Alchemist21</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7705338#p7705338\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7705338#p7705338\" data-post-id=\"7705338\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1159</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20971\">RadiantCowbells</a> wrote:</cite>Madonna/Droog makes a lot of sense, if my reads going into night were correct.<br>\n<br>\nStill deliberating.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI've finished going through the ISO's I wanted to.<br>\n<br>\nChumba and Madonna were arguing over Chumba voting Zulfy while Madonna called Zulfy low-hanging fruit, but then D3 comes and when there was barely any mention of Chumba, Madonna suddenly says they'd lynch everyone else before Chumba (and she hadn't actually stated a read either way on him until then). Droog replaced in, and the Townread became mutual.  I want to rule this out as a scumteam because I think it's pretty risky for scum to out each other as strong Town at the point they did, and Madonna's statement re: Chumba seems so knee-jerk for a situation when Chumba was barely pressured.  Given how Madonna handled Dwlee's lynch, I can't see her jumping at panicking over her scumbuddy for something as minor as Performer's first post on D3.  <br>\n<br>\nI can't really rule out Bitten/Droog as a scumteam because the little interaction there revolved around the claims, but I think an attempt to NK Madonna would come more likley from a Droog/Robster scumteam.  For Droog/Robster, Madonna it would be a matter of letting her live to be of use to Droog, or killing her for being a threat to Robster, while Droog/Bitten loses the buddying potential with a Madonna kill but gains some ammo to push a Robster lynch.  The thing about that though is I think they'd rather leave Madonna alive if the aim was pushing Robster's lynch.  People already suspected the slot and Madonna was one of the big voices for that lynch.  Pushing the lynch would be easier with Madonna alive.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7629311#p7629311\">394</a> has Chumba give a rather apathetic Townread of Performer while Performer is at L-2. I'd expect a little more urgency from someone trying to save a scumbuddy in that situation, and he actually put Dwlee at L-2, but ended on a note of IGMEOY more than \"I want you dead.\"  If Chumba is scum with Peformer, he's been pretty calm about their situations.  I think I'd rule this one out too.<br>\n<br>\nSo in my mind, the options are either Madonna and Bitten, or Droog and Bitten.  I don't think Droog/Bitten had much to gain from a Madonna kill, so <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I still think the most likely scumteam is Madonna and Bitten.</div></div></blockquote>", "time": "Sun Mar 06, 2016 8:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65120&start=1450", "forum": "53", "thread": "65120"}
