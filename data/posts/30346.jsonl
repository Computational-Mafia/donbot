Too late at night for me to go back and look, but for some reason I got the impression he came over from EM, which would take away his newb excuse/pass. I remember my first game as well, so yes I can budge on that. I am very wary of this player, nonetheless. <br><br>As for TNE, I've been skimming through some of his old games now that I'm in a game with him. Not liking what I see from him/her in this game - his tone seems forced, trying too hard. This is from my gut....TNE you said \"I'm underestimating the value gut and meta tells.\" Gut is telling me that you're scum...reading your past game ISO's leads me to the same conclusion. <br><br>Fuzzy's opening is pretty town I think after reading ISO's and the game again. Guy is leaning town, but please keep in mind I haven't seen most of these players as both alignments. <br><br>Fsnake *might* be a possible scum partner for TNE, because it's really easy for TNE to just say \"yeah, that guy is town because of X game\" so soon. I read through FSnake's posts, and I don't see anything stick out to me. Maybe TNE, your read on FSnake is something you can explain more in depth sometime. Because right now it looks like a sketchy read at best, like DoctorPepper so alluded to.<br><br>I'm not sure about Sakura's opening. I haven't seen Sakura-scum, first and foremost, and also I think I need longer to get a feel of her rhythm as she proceeds in this game. That's it for me for tonight. Gonna go to bed. Feel free to ask me some Q's. I'm content with my TNE vote. Lates."}

Mostly words, less substance. He promises a list but doesn't give it to us until we squeeze it out of him, and the list is quite disappointing to say the least.

If there is also a doctor a jailer in the game, there is a 1 in 3 chance of that person being a mafia member. Because all the other roles that could prevent an NK I can think of are not reliant on targeting a potential scum player, there is no useful information for the town there."}
