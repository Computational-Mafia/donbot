I mean, they're just going to get called out on it and be forced to vote.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNo issue, it was just a question meant to jump-start discussion. Choosing not to participate in RVS isn't scummy, in my opinion, and a simple question like that doesn't require a pressure vote. Putting a serious vote on me because of that is being a little overcritical.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4440423#p4440423\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4440423#p4440423\" data-post-id=\"4440423\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 35</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19287\">Cheery Dog</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4440414#p4440414\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4440414#p4440414\" data-post-id=\"4440414\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 33</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20080\">Radelle</a> wrote:</cite>You say this like it's just an example of a plausible scenario, but I'm getting the impression by you saying you think it's deliberate that you actually think this.

The longer it goes on, the more obvious it becomes that he isn't voting for the player he is pressuring. I don't see him getting away with it initially, much less carrying it out all the way to fruition several more pages down the road. So that makes a success rate of 0% with no advantage gained.

{"number": 85, "id": "4445409", "user": "toxictaipan", "user_id": "15560", "content": "Alright, I was hoping to hear from Parama, but apparently that's not going to happen.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't want anyone to make my case for me, or to simply answer with a, \"Yes/No\", answer. I didn't want anyone to do anything specific. I do see some issues with Sable Tip's post, but I was trying to gather information with mine. I forced the players to go back over his post and look for something they may have missed, and to take a stance on it, as well. This helps us see how players are generally reacting to the game, who's paying attention and catching the little things, etc.<br>\n<br>\nI was expecting smart/cautious townies to react much like Abaddon did, saying something along the lines of, \"Yeah, I think I see what you're saying. However, I want to see if our thoughts corroborate. What are you seeing?\" or perhaps, \"I've went back over his post and I still don't see anything. I'm calling your bluff.\" (Though I have a feeling the general reaction from the town was less, \"I've went back over his post,\" and more, \"I'm calling your bluff anyway.\") I expected some comments about having my case made for me, but I thought a reasonable town would try to work with me a little bit without handing me a case -- especially from those who had a town read on me. It was well within reason to put the burden of proof on me and still have this work, but I digress.<br>\n<br>\nI figured scum would be more apt to just blurt out what they saw wrong with the post, looking for approval and hoping to get easy town points. Alternatively, I was expecting scum to be critical of my approach without much consideration of what Sable Tip's post actually says. Why pretend to go scum hunting when you can just attack a player for his strange approach to the situation and get away with it? The drawback is that you have to take this with a grain of salt because a townie that doesn't know any better could easily do these same things, but nothing is ever concrete in scum hunting. Still worth it to see who does what, though. I was trying to get everyone's reaction to both Sable Tip's post and my own, though I mostly got the latter. Regardless, I still think there's a bit of good information here we'll be able to use.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for Sable Tip... Doesn't anyone find it odd that his 3 suspicions (Cheery Dog, Abaddon, and Parama) are all suspicious of Radelle (to varying degrees), but he lists Radelle as a neutral read? If I had any confidence whatsoever in my reads, and all 3 of my suspicions were expressing doubt over the same player, that player would be pretty far up my town reads list. I'd expect him to list Radelle as leaning town at the very least. He's not being consistent with his reads, and that's scummy. Also, he hasn't really provided <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> Parama and Abaddon are scummy, unless I am to take it that being aggressive and harsh is somehow scummy. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that bothered me was his reference to Parama's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\">Post 47</a>. I can't tell if Sable Tip is trying to buddy me here or what. That part of his post altogether doesn't make much sense to me. It seems like he&#8217;s trying to use it as a lame excuse to vote Parama, but at the same time it reads sort of like a defense so I&#8217;m wary of buddying.

I heartily dislike the wishy-washy argument in his 57 which seems to not contribute anything, realistically. It strikes a middle ground between Cheery and Abaddon who were arguing at the time quite wildly, and puts scumreads on both of them, whilst jumping on what is effectively a continuation of a statement made in RVS to try and justify a vote on Parama. He seems to hint at there being a correllation between Parama's and Abaddon's RVS 'argument' when in fact Abaddon's #17 pretty much agreed with Parama's #16. What I don't like about this is he contradicts himself here, calling it the start of a 'tiff' between them when there has been no such argument. Whilst this may simply be an oversight and lazy towntelling, I'm more inclined to say that it's scum trying to mislead town, since it doesn't take a huge amount of effort to look at the posts in isolation and realise that there is no such argument. Now, he paints them both as scum, which I believe is laying the groundwork for his cases later on, since he leans heavily on Parama being scum.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to this, he tries to call people out based on their contribution. Now, I realise that I'm not exactly the flag-bearer for punctuality and consistent contribution in this game so far, but he calls out two people who have posted quite a bit more than I had at that point in the game, considering I was on zero posts thus far. Calling people out for inactivity is one thing, but realistically, calling people who've posted out more than people who haven't? I just can't see any townsided reason not to put large pressure on lurkers to play.<br>\n<br>\nI can't see a town-sided element resting a case on so flimsy a point, and so my vote at the moment goes on Sable Tip.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sable Tip</span><br>\n<br>\nOther people I don't like at the moment include JacobSavage, who (again, whilst I can't really call others out on it given my record this game) has contributed little to nothing, and has posted only what could be construed as a jokepost when we are arguably knee-deep in discussion. It looks to me like mafia who is trying to avoid prods, in all honesty. If we don't see a post with real contribution in within the next 8-10 hours I'll be inclined to FoS him.<br>\n<br>\nI'm swinging mid-town on Tommy and toxic, since the posts they both make seem to be clear and easy to understand, rather than wrapped in fluff, which to me indicates town-freindly play. The only exception to this being Toxic's 'reaction test' attempt, which whilst I can see the potential benefits of such a strategy, I think was poorly executed. I don't think he's any less town as a result though.<br>\n<br>\nI'm bordering neutral on pretty much everyone else, barring Radelle, however I'm not getting that from a read, it's simple association with Sable which I refuse to act on until I have a more concrete read.", "time": "Wed Oct 31, 2012 2:52 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}

The reaction test, as stated, has very little to do with Sable Tip's alignment, or with which alignment Toxic assigned to him.

The reaction test was for peoples' reactions to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toxic's</div> actions, not Sable Tip's post.

He leaves his reasoning open, but Parama voted first. It's Abaddon who's agreeing with Parama. <br>\n<br>\nAs for point 2, I'll agree there is no town motivation to muddy the waters, but I also agree with Parama that you have to take implications from time to time. If he changed words and tried to use that as a main point in a case to make another player look scummy, I'd say you really had something there. In this context, however, I don't see it as a huge issue.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 3 is also fair, but I think his presence was never great enough to matter. I don't know who all asked him what, or how many times he posted afterward (and I don't care to look right now), but I think most questions that went unanswered were probably due to his lack of presence rather than intentionally dodging them.<br>\n<br>\nI get what you're saying with point 4, but any reasonable townie should be able to ignore this pretty easily. I doubt this tactic is that all that effective, but it is noted.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 5: It's arguable that he's looking for contradictions and trying to scum hunt, even if not as much as he should be. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\">Post 47</a> is another post to consider. Again, I'd say this is mostly due to lack of presence. You have to remember that the majority of his posts happened during the earliest stages of the game when there wasn't much to comment on. We did get out of RVS and move the game into a serious discussion very quickly, but his posting dropped off at the top of page 3. There was stuff to comment on, but still not a ton of stuff. This would be much more suspicious if he had been consistently active and then dropped off around page 5 or so when things started getting really heavy.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 6 is defeated by the fact that he replaced out, in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe main problem is he wasn't here to post anything, and now he's been replaced. You're trying to attack someone who basically wasn't even there. I think it's better to wait and see how absta101 does and go from there, rather than pursuing a case on someone who isn't even in this game anymore.", "time": "Fri Nov 02, 2012 7:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}

Then, I may go through a few people's posts using the \"Display posts by user\" feature.<br>\n<br>\nI find it strange that Abaddon, in Post #17, points out that he thinks Radelle is overdoing it while Parama's post had a tone that was much more fake. I've read some of Parama's games, and he normally acts like that, but I still find it a little weird that he called Radelle out, but not Parama. Then later, in Post #21, his accusation on Cheery of \"obvious chainsawing\" are unwarranted, as Cheery didn't really defend Radelle or make a very serious attack on Abaddon. Add to that that he's the only person that really stands out to me on Page 1, and I have an early suspect.<br>\n<br>\ntoxic's Post #32 upsets me. First, he says \"RVS is over.\" Then, he doesn't really comment on the recent happenings, but instead attacks someone who didn't comment on the recent happenings.

Radelle's questions didn't really seem to have reason to them.<br>\n<br>\nCheery in Page 2 seems insistent on keeping his scum read on Abaddon after many admitted flaws in his logic were pointed out.

It's not something that people will normally call town-like, seeing as no one mentioned it, but at the same time, it seems like a really unlikely position to fake as scum.<br>\n<br>\ntoxic's Post #61 was generally useless and out-of-place compared to things he had posted previously.

He makes the distinction that Cheery can't be both scum or an idiot (which doesn't make sense), but notice how he doesn't make the distinction of Cheery being a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Village Idiot</div>. That read was leaving itself open.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis seems a bit far-fetched.<br>\n<br>\nAh, there we go - toxic has a reason for stalling. It's totally legit, and toxic's town. However, he had the huge reason that had to do with scumhunting and all sorts of stuff, but he never drew any conclusions from his plan. It was pretty much useless. It's more of a sign of poor play than scumminess.<br>\n<br>\nHere's why Jacob is town. Everyone is posting their reads and contributing to the thread. Then, suddenly, Jacob comes along in Post #91 and basically says that he has no reads, and that he needs to create a spreadsheet for this game. I really doubt that he's bold enough to do this and expect to get away with it as scum. I also doubt that this is due to bad scum play - in that case, he would likely be attacking <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">someone</div>. Therefore, he must be town who genuinely lost in this game - understandable, as that is how I felt about this game at first. He also makes a spreadsheet that looks like it had some serious time and effort put into it. Again, if he's too lazy to fake reads as scum, he's not going to be making some badass spreadsheet. That's why Jacob was and is at the top of my town list. I expect there to be some nice reactions to his play here, though.<br>\n<br>\nTommy's Post #107 is really good. He's encouraging Jacob to scumhunt, something which does nothing but hurt the scum win condition by allowing people to get an accurate read on Jacob, and if Jacob is town, allowing him to find the scum more easily.<br>\n<br>\nIdiot's Post #108 attack on Parama is filled with words, but lousy. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Nothing</div> he accused Parama of is really indicative of scum, and most of it is Parama's playstyle.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar, as of Page 5, is being a bit of a spectator. He's commenting on random tidbits here and there, but never really states a conclusion. I have a problem with that.<br>\n<br>\nPost #115 is a town post from a guy who doesn't really know what he's talking about. This is kinda weak reasoning, but he's making a big case on the weak player - and it looks genuine. Scum usually can't manage that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Note: Parama replaced out.</div> Using his inactivity to call him scum will not work. Post #119 by Cheery was a terrible vote for that reason.<br>\n<br>\nReads lists are usually bad things to make as scum because they establish connections with everybody. That is why Abaddon's #121 is a towntell. Even if he is calling out my slot. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Post #129 is good as well, in that he naturally but regretfully defends Parama.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm a bit too tired to finish the rest of this tonight.

Does each post count just as much as any other, or does your system allow you to give certain posts more weight?<br>\n(4) if each post does get a score, is that score just a rating of scummyness from 1-10 (like the final scores are) or do you rate those differently?<br>\n(5) how many times have u used this method? <br>\n<br>\nI probably have a lot of questions, but its stupid for me to ask them when im just speculating right now.  maybe the best thing for you to do would be to write a cohesive description of how your system works.

I guess what I was trying to drive home (not reading back what I wrote), is that I haven't really gotten the feel that I was scum at all from Toxic until I made a post explaining how I found Abaddon scummy and how I think he is scum sitting on a vote and not doing much else. Toxic's replies directly afterwards seem to be focusing more on defending against what I said about Abaddon instead of saying how I myself am scum for it. This is apparent in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450743#p4450743\" class=\"postlink\">post 135</a> regarding his feelings regarding the conflict between wanting me to provide evidence (which I did) vs Abaddon having none. His reply in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450838#p4450838\" class=\"postlink\">post 139</a> was not answering the question, but instead answering on his behalf and essentially just trying to defend him again.<br>\n<br>\nThe only <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">potentially</div> valid point Toxic has tried to push has been this notion that scum-me jumped ship to go over to Abaddon's wagon because his wasn't going anywhere. Not only was this idea not brought up at any point between my vote for Abaddon and my post explaining why I think Abaddon is scum, but if my pure scum-motivation was to just jump ship to hop onto a more viable wagon, it wouldn't make sense to jump ship onto one of town's <br>\nmore townie reads vs the more viable Sable and Parama bandwagons.<br>\n<br>\nI've slowly been turned into some sort of aggressor in the conversation between Toxic and I, when it's Toxic who first tried to attack me directly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450621#p4450621\" class=\"postlink\">post 134</a> and not my case. From this point on, it's been me mainly addressing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">his</div> attacks and explaining my thought process. His whole conversation with me has been ridiculous, from saying I should have presented a case for why Abaddon was scummy with my base vote (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4446523#p4446523\" class=\"postlink\">I did</a> along with some things leading up to it), meta reads are useless and I should present more than that (which I did in my \"why is Abaddon is scum\" post, and I explain how things lead up to that post), and that I should provide evidence against Abaddon (but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">only</div> within a certain time frame, and only I have to, Abaddon's evidence is just \"there\"). Just look at our responses. Even when I point out how I did everything he has been trying to accuse me of, it either doesn't matter or he tries to point something else to direct the conversation to.<br>\n<br>\nScum aren't scum due to scummy posts though. Everyone makes scummy posts, what you have to keep in mind is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why did someone makes a post and what purpose did they hope to achieve</div>. I really don't know what Toxic is hoping to achieve. It's obvious with his first attack against my case on Abaddon that his purpose was to try and defend Abaddon through discrediting my vote and why I thought he was scummy - but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div>. This could be scum defending scum, scum trying to gain town credit from defending town, or town trying hard to defend a town read. I honestly can't tell. Some people are just horrible arguers, and I think he feels he has some sort of \"catch\" on me and is trying to damnedest to reel me in with anything he can throw at it. I've actually been holding onto a town read of Toxic because I don't think scum would go so out of their way to push a lynch on someone they know is town only to probably take the downfall for it the next day. <br>\n<br>\nWhat purpose did I hope to achieve when I made a serious vote on Toxic page 1? To get out of RVS because it sucks, and I got a somewhat scummy vibe out of Toxic at the beginning so I rolled with it. It wasn't supposed to be some MASTERFUL <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">REALLY SERIOUS</div> case on Toxic, and I don't know how anyone would reasonably expect it to be so when just basing things off RVS. I moved off of Toxic because I thought his attitude for asking a stupidly simple question was townie and his responses were null so I moved on.<br>\n<br>\nI'm just done the arguing though. I'm not going to vote Toxic today so I'm not going to bother arguing anymore. Arguing between two others in wall posts are anti-town: barely anyone reads them and there are more than one scum in the game anyhow.

I refuse to believe that you are so busy that you have time to read the thread and make votes, but not enough time to explain them.  The \"stating reads without explanation\" is bad, but not voteworthy.  You outright voted without an explanation, and that's way worse.<br>\n<br>\nI agree with Deltabacon, Trollie has been utterly inconsistent with his statements concerning CD, switching from wishy-washy scumreads to meta-defense, which is just bad to do for someone else unless you've got a damn good reason (like you know he's a power role or something).

As with several players thusfar, he made a list of reads in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4454299#p4454299\" class=\"postlink\">176</a>, but didn't explain them.  This is a pet peeve of mine, because it doesn't contribute to the town, but I'll let it slide since it's all over the place and therefore not necessarily indicative of alignment.  However, Sherlock also voted for Radelle without giving any kind of explanation other than gut.  This is scummy, but since he admitted to being new to online Mafia I'm going to let it slide for now.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4459542#p4459542\" class=\"postlink\">post 211</a> he explains his thoughts on the whole game.  It's basically the same sort of thing I'm doing now, examining everyone else's play.  He continues this in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463890#p4463890\" class=\"postlink\">262</a>.  His arguments for how people are playing match his reads in 176, so at least he's consistent.<br>\n<br>\nA lot of his playstyle seems to be based on feeling.  For example, his gut reads, and his talk about Sable's 57 and Tommy's 115 feeling genuine.  I'm going to assume this playstyle is a holdover from playing mafia in real life.  This is also why he claims to have a town read on Trollie, saying that Trollie seems to be genuine about what he's saying, but is making weak arguments (see <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463890#p4463890\" class=\"postlink\">post 262</a>).  All in all I get a town feel from Sherlock, since he does seem to be trying to contribute, and the only slips that I can see (his gut reads) are easily explained as playstyle.  Not a playstyle I like, but legitimate.<br>\n<br>\nNull/Leaning Town<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Abaddon</div><br>\n<br>\nMakes some one-word statements and reasonless votes until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440380#p4440380\" class=\"postlink\">29</a>.  Or at least that's where I'm going to say RVS is over for him, because I still can't tell where RVS stopped.  There should be an announcement or something.  Anyway, that is when he in his argument against CD about whether CD is scum or an idiot.  His arguments with CD are very short posts that are based largely on assumptions (\"I'm assuming CD is new town because of his play\", when he could have just glanced at CD's wiki to see how many games CD's played) and game theory.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442557#p4442557\" class=\"postlink\">62</a> he rightly calls out toxictaipan for fishing for explanations for why Sable is scum instead of just doing it himself.  This is toxic's so-called reaction test, which I'll look at more when I do my read on toxic.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4445512#p4445512\" class=\"postlink\">86</a> Abaddon says he doesn't buy toxic's explanation for the test, but doesn't push him.  This confuses me.  He had is vote on Radelle ever since the RVS, but didn't put it on toxic, even though he had a much stronger reason to vote for toxic (or at least, Abaddon hadn't explained his post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440248#p4440248\" class=\"postlink\">19</a> vote on Radelle beyond saying that Radelle's post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4439999#p4439999\" class=\"postlink\">15</a> was fake and overdoing it).  This is unusual behavior, especially considering the fact that he also left his RVS vote on toxic while arguing against Radelle.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448870#p4448870\" class=\"postlink\">121</a> he does the \"post your reads on everyone\" thing, and while he gives some sort of explanation for some of his reads, they're all weak (for example, his read on me, which he says is \"positive behavior.\"  What does that mean?).  Fortunately his scumreads are explained more fully, but I'd prefer to see specific examples.  He goes on to argue against Tommy's case on Parama and arguing with pretty much everyone over the next few days.  After November 2nd his activity takes a nosedive.<br>\n<br>\nAbaddon's play is mostly laconic.  He doesn't go into long arguments about things, and seems to be poking his head here, there, everywhere, making short statements about everything.  He also talks a lot about playstyle and game theory, which is nice, but shouldn't get in the way of analysis.  He does seem to have a slight relation to Parama.  He defends Parama against Tommy in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4449024#p4449024\" class=\"postlink\">post 123</a> by arguing against Tommy's case.  His actions in conjunction with Parama during the RVS also seem cooperative, but that's mostly a feeling, and I feel hypocritical even mentioning it.<br>\n<br>\nNull/Leaning Scum<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">absta101</div><br>\n<br>\n(note that because I am currently pissed at absta this will probably be harsher than it would have been under normal circumstances)<br>\n<br>\nReplaced Parama in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450164#p4450164\" class=\"postlink\">post 127</a>.  His <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452192#p4452192\" class=\"postlink\">post 157</a> consists mostly of agree/don't agree statements, and isn't very useful.  As with several other players, he has a problem of not explaining his reads until questioned, and frankly you shouldn't have to be asked.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4458616#p4458616\" class=\"postlink\">post 200</a> he argues that Abbadon is faking <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4444871#p4444871\" class=\"postlink\">82</a>.  I don't necessarily buy that, because it may have just been bad phrasing on Abbadon's part.  Then absta does very little of note until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4467651#p4467651\" class=\"postlink\">post 294</a>, where he votes Cheery but doesn't give an explanation, instead asking Cheery to answer two questions.  Asking questions isn't an explanation for a vote.  It's scumhunting, sure, but I want reasons for votes.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAbsta asks a lot of questions but gives very, very little substance.  Also, in post 200, he also acts like townie players shouldn't call out bad play if said bad play was in line with one of their own statements (player A and player B agree that player C is scummy, but B's argument is crap.  Even so, A can't call B out for crap arguments).  This is retarded, and absta should be flogged for saying it.  BAD PLAY IS BAD PLAY, and should be called out whenever it happens.  This makes me think that absta is new (plus his blank wiki and join date), so it may just be newbishness talking, but still.<br>\n<br>\nScum<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cheery Dog</div><br>\n<br>\nOpted not to join in the RVS, then voted for Abaddon for not voting Radelle while seeing her as scum, as noted above.  He says that Abaddon was likely intentionally leaving his vote off of Radelle for appearance's sake, but then doesn't really develop it any further and then drops it in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448174#p4448174\" class=\"postlink\">post 110</a>.  Then he votes for Parama for lurking (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448820#p4448820\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a>) after Parama already replaced out.  He has also repeatedly suggested that people lynch him for his playstyle  (for example, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4453457#p4453457\" class=\"postlink\">post 167</a>).  In all honesty, after that, I don't even pretend to follow what he's doing.<br>\n<br>\nCD is incredibly hard to read.  There is an entire circle of Hell where sinners are forced to figure out CD's alignment.  He's been hedging a bit (examples include his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440387#p4440387\" class=\"postlink\">post 30</a>), and has expressed that he is a largely reactive player, using that as an excuse to forego scumhunting (such as his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4454821#p4454821\" class=\"postlink\">post 182</a>).

In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4446077#p4446077\" class=\"postlink\">post 92</a>, saying Sable Tip was being wishy washy in his arguments against Abaddon and Parama in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4441458#p4441458\" class=\"postlink\">post 57</a>.  Then he votes Sable Tip, also calling him out for improperly attacking inactives.  His next post, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452439#p4452439\" class=\"postlink\">post 161</a>, attacks CD for coasting and not being very useful (this is something I also noted, see above), and votes for him.  He also complains about Sable \"chainsawing\" him in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4447832#p4447832\" class=\"postlink\">post 109</a>.  Deltabacon then argues back and forth for a bit with CD and his gallant defender Trollie.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4458814#p4458814\" class=\"postlink\">post 203</a> his attention shifts over to Trollie for defending CD.  Deltabacon argues that Trollie has been shifting his view on CD back and forth between town (defending him) and building a half-assed case against him.  Deltabacon later discounts the meta-defense for CD, saying that in previous games CD was more coherent in his posts, and continues to call Trollie out for defending CD with insufficient evidence.  He keeps hammering Trollie from then on.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4465162#p4465162\" class=\"postlink\">post 275</a> he again calls Trollie out for being inconsistent, citing his constant defense of CD while having him as a scumread.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4465915#p4465915\" class=\"postlink\">post 280</a> he makes what seems to me the most damning argument against Trollie.<br>\n<br>\nDeltabacon has certainly been less active than some, but his posts are invariably substantive.  He accurately calls CD out for coasting, then  consistently blasts Trollie for defending CD for crappy reasons.

His biggest scumreads at this point are CD and Trollie, though he does not explain why until later, and then it's mostly just feeling.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4458707#p4458707\" class=\"postlink\">post 202</a> he posts an update on his spreadsheet and gives full explanations for his reads.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4459870#p4459870\" class=\"postlink\">post 218</a> he votes Trollie.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463937#p4463937\" class=\"postlink\">post 263</a> he unvotes, saying he buys Trollie's more recent statements as being town.  He latersays we should hold off on attacking CD until later, and says he doesn't really endorse any lynches at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nI have mixed feelings about Jacob, mostly because his posts were largely insubstantial until 202 (even his 138 post with the spreadsheet was lacking, because it was essentially no different from listing reads without reasons).  Then post 202 happens, and he swings hard over to the townie side.  Unfortunately all of his posts are based around his spreadsheets and contain remarkably little analysis.  I would have a more positive read on Jacob if he gave more posts like 202.  Then again, he currently does not want to lynch anyone, which is strange, given he's repeatedly expressed scumreads on CD and Trollie, and didn't explain in detail why they changed.  I'm going to have to wait and see more before I make a decision.<br>\n<br>\nNull<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JasonWazza</div><br>\n<br>\nDidn't come in until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440831#p4440831\" class=\"postlink\">post 52</a>, where he votes for Radelle, saying that she was implying CD's anti-RVS attitude was scummy, and saying that Radelle was trying to distract the town.  He then proceeds to do nothing else until getting replaced by Sherlock.<br>\n<br>\nHe didn't really stick around long enough for me to form an opinion, so my read on the slot is entirely based on Sherlock.

What followed thereafter was a series of extremely sarcastic and utterly worthless posts.  He replaced out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448750#p4448750\" class=\"postlink\">post 117</a> after being active in all of his other games but lurking in this one.  His replacement is absta.<br>\n<br>\nParama didn't explain diddly when he was here, always acting like whatever he thought was obvious to everyone and generally acting like a jerk.  Normally I would go after him for not explaining any of his posts, but I'm going to assume he was just a terrible player.

She continues working on toxic through to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442842#p4442842\" class=\"postlink\">post 68</a>, also questioning toxic's reaction test, and getting into a big semantic argument with a lot of players over either/or and game theory.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4444842#p4444842\" class=\"postlink\">post 80</a> she gets into a pointless fight with toxic over who gets credit for ending RVS, and says toxic is overthinking where his vote goes, and says Jason is town. Later Radelle calls out Parama for being active in other threads but not this one, and argues with Abaddon over whether the town is justified in arguing against bad arguments, even if said bad argument is against someone you find scummy.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4446523#p4446523\" class=\"postlink\">post 97</a> she votes for Abaddon, arguing that he is somehow not being aggressive enough in going after her (?) while attacking other players.  This is what Abaddon calls a strawman argument.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450509#p4450509\" class=\"postlink\">post 131</a> she lays down her case against Abaddon while responding to Abaddon's argument against her.  Her argument mostly rests on Abaddon being entirely reactionary in his responses and not seriously pursuing his argument against Radelle.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450743#p4450743\" class=\"postlink\">post 135</a> she defends her argument against Abaddon (which as toxic points out only used posts prior to 97 and ignored all subsequent posts).  This defense continues in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4451124#p4451124\" class=\"postlink\">post 142</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4455120#p4455120\" class=\"postlink\">post 184</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463623#p4463623\" class=\"postlink\">post 259</a>.  This defense is also a sort of passive attack against toxic, who was her biggest critic.  She has been MIA since November 7th.<br>\n<br>\nRadelle has been on the defense ever since 97, going over the same stupid points about the timing over her argument and whether toxic is scummy for his reasoning concerning Radelle's argument being scummy.  While I agree with toxic that Radelle should have been quicker in explaining her argument and should have used more recent information in it, this entire argument makes my head hurt, so instead I'm going to focus on the fact that Radelle hasn't posted anything original (repeating old points doesn't count) since 97, and therefore has stalled scumhunting.

Sable argues that while it was most likely just a mistake, scum might have still done it.  Sable then calls Parama out for arrogantly acting like what he meant in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\" class=\"postlink\">post 47</a> was obvious, when it wasn't.  Sable then voted for Parama.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4447832#p4447832\" class=\"postlink\">Post 109</a> is a massive defense of 57, and votes for Deltabacon, saying that his entire argument against Sable was crap.  Sable didn't really do anything more until replacing out.<br>\n<br>\nAs with other people who only posted a few times before being replaced out, I don't really have any strong read on Sable.<br>\n<br>\nNull<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar</div><br>\n<br>\nVotes for Abaddon in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440525#p4440525\" class=\"postlink\">post 39</a>, saying that there was no scum motivation for arguing against Radelle without laying down a vote, but still seeing it as scummy somehow. Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440598#p4440598\" class=\"postlink\">post 45</a>  he asks CD why scum would want to do what Abaddon did (all the while still having his vote on Abaddon).  Strangely he continues to side with Abaddon, saying that Abaddon responded to toxic's reaction test appropriately and that Abaddon's response to Tommy's case on Parama was correct.  Admittedly, Slandaar also made points against Abaddon during this time period (posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450295#p4450295\" class=\"postlink\">130</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4459954#p4459954\" class=\"postlink\">220</a> are examples), but in general he doesn't make any strong stands.  After that Slandaar is all over the place.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar's play has been incredibly non-committal.  He hasn't made any determined arguments against anything at all, a prime example being his scum-have-no-reason-to-do-it-but-its-still-scummy-anyway first vote on Abaddon.  His play is extremely weak because he isn't making strong stands on anything, and just seems to be coasting, though less obviously than CD.<br>\n<br>\nScum<br>\n<br>\n------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheTrollie</div><br>\n<br>\nDoesn't really post anything game-related until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4451032#p4451032\" class=\"postlink\">post 140</a>, where he lists a bunch of completely unexplained reads.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452318#p4452318\" class=\"postlink\">post 160</a> he quotes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448820#p4448820\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a> as CD's scummiest post, saying that CD is illogical and lacking good judgment, but then makes a big deal about how players like that always turn out to be town.  His <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very next post</div>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452515#p4452515\" class=\"postlink\">post 162</a>, says that there is no good case on CD, exclusively using assumptions on CD's playstyle and meta as a defense.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4453341#p4453341\" class=\"postlink\">Post 166</a> basically says that it's OK for townies to forego scumhunting.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4457568#p4457568\" class=\"postlink\">post 196</a>, he votes for Radelle, having never made a single argument ever against Radelle, and saying that he's explained the reads he felt were important (when he obviously hadn't, given his vote). <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460503#p4460503\" class=\"postlink\">Post 229</a> did a fantastic job of not answering my question about what his reads meant, all the while saying that he thought CD was scum, but that there was no reason to see CD as scum.  Once I finished picking up the pieces of my shattered psyche and went on, I hit <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460750#p4460750\" class=\"postlink\">post 233</a>, which basically reiterates that the case against CD is bad.  After that he gets in a brief discussion with Jacob over how Jacob's spreadsheet worked, until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4464417#p4464417\" class=\"postlink\">post 266</a>, when he digs back into his meta defense of CD, again insisting that there is no good argument against CD, and claiming that it is his personal crusade against all of MafiaScum's &#8220;faulty logic.&#8221;  Note that in all this time Trollie has never even mentioned Radelle.  Then, finally, in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4467469#p4467469\" class=\"postlink\">post 291</a>, he lists a few words that he mistakes for being a case against Radelle.  Later he says that he has a null read on CD (without giving a reason).<br>\n<br>\nTrollie is by far the scummiest player thusfar, doing his best to both buddy and distance CD, and failing miserably at both. His defense of CD is entirely based on meta, acting like it gives CD free reign to be as scummy as he damn well pleases, because all of MafiaScum must be wrong and that meta must be an invariably solid defense for everything anyone ever does.  But in my mind even this pales in comparison to his utterly unexplained vote on Radelle, when he insisted that he had explained all of his important reads.  I absolutely refuse to believe that he didn't think his read on Radelle wasn't important <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">when his vote was on Radelle</div>.  Trollie is completely, obviously, blatantly<br>\n<br>\nScum<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tommy</div><br>\n<br>\nVoted for Parama in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440469#p4440469\" class=\"postlink\">post 37</a>, in response to Parama's unexplained read on Radelle and misinterpretation of CD's case against Abaddon. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440772#p4440772\" class=\"postlink\">Post 50</a> continues this case against Parama, and includes Parama's unwillingness to defend his votes.  Tommy also says he has a town read on CD because CD admitted to maybe being mistaken (this isn't a towntell, it's just someone being waffly). <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4443178#p4443178\" class=\"postlink\">Post 75</a> is another rejection of toxic's reaction test.  Tommy afterwards puts out a few feelers against Jason, Jacob, and Sable, and calls out Deltabacon for being inactive, though retracts that after a while.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448651#p4448651\" class=\"postlink\">post 115</a> Tommy lays out his full case against Parama (the one Abaddon dismissed).  The arguments are based mostly on the fact that Parama didn't do anything at all useful throughout his entire stay, but as I mentioned above, I see them as mostly just Parama being bad at the game.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4453748#p4453748\" class=\"postlink\">post 169</a> Tommy calls Trollie town without giving an explanation, and sides with Deltabacon's case against CD.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4459924#p4459924\" class=\"postlink\">post 219</a> Tommy calls absta out for supposedly making a bad case against Abaddon, then assumes that absta has ulterior motives.  He doesn't explain why the case against Abaddon is bad, he just says it is.  He does this again in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4461029#p4461029\" class=\"postlink\">post 242</a>, saying absta's argument was made up, but not presenting any evidence for it.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4462446#p4462446\" class=\"postlink\">post 252</a> he unvotes absta (he had never voted for absta), even though absta was his strongest scumread, and switches over to Radelle.  <br>\n<br>\nTommy makes broad statements, like &#8220;this is good, this is bad, this is bad because {assumption}&#8221;, none of which are very useful.  Admittedly Tommy's been active, but activity isn't a good measure of someone's alignment.  I am annoyed by his lack of explanation for why he thinks the way he does about things (why is Trollie town, for example).  I am also annoyed by how in 252 he dropped his biggest scumread (absta) in favor of Radelle, saying that Radelle was one of the only three lynch choices.  That's blatantly retarded.  As of this post we're still about 6 days away from the deadline, there's still plenty of time to make cases for people that we think are scummiest.  Why then does Tommy want to begrudgingly hop on a wagon so early?  This is just bad.  Tommy is<br>\n<br>\nScum<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">toxictaipan</div><br>\n<br>\nVoted for me in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440397#p4440397\" class=\"postlink\">post 32</a>, saying that I should have noticed that RVS was over by then.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4441014#p4441014\" class=\"postlink\">post 53</a> he sides with Abaddon in the CD vs Abaddon argument, saying that scum wouldn't argue against someone without voting for them since there is no motivation to do so.  Toxic also points out that his earlier statements, which Parama quoted in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\" class=\"postlink\">post 47</a>, didn't contradict, and continues his argument that I should have been more useful and not made a random vote so late.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442531#p4442531\" class=\"postlink\">post 61</a> toxic makes his famous reaction test. Apparently the point of the reaction test was to see who would jump on him for making such a post, implying that those people were cautious town.  Starting in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442897#p4442897\" class=\"postlink\">post 73</a> he gets into his stupid argument with Radelle about who gets credit for getting us out of RVS, or in what way RVS should end, or some other nonsense that is essentially a game theory discussion.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4445409#p4445409\" class=\"postlink\">post 85</a> toxic explains his reaction test, saying that smart or cautious townies would act like Abaddon did (calling out toxic's bluff).  He also calls out Sable for having Radelle as a null read when Sable's three scumreads all listed Radelle as scum.  Later he states town reads on Abaddon and Tommy, thanks to their reactions to his test.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450565#p4450565\" class=\"postlink\">post 133</a> toxic says that the alignment of players responding to his reaction test is irrelevant, it's the reactions themselves that are important.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450621#p4450621\" class=\"postlink\">post 134</a> he points out that Radelle's case against Abaddon exclusively relies on posts before 97 and ignores all subsequent posts, in addition to waiting to post a reason for the vote.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450838#p4450838\" class=\"postlink\">post 139</a> he elaborates on this reasoning and votes for Radelle.  For the next little while he continues his back and forth with Radelle.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452071#p4452071\" class=\"postlink\">post 154</a> he argues against Tommy's case on Parama, while continuing his argument with Radelle.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4470806#p4470806\" class=\"postlink\">post 317</a> he says he doesn't like the wagon on Trollie, claiming that he read Trollie's ISO and found his reaction to CD reasonable (he didn't respond to the argument against Trollie's unexplained vote on Radelle).<br>\n<br>\nWhile I absolutely love the fact that toxic is talkative and explains most of his thoughts when appropriate, I can't say that I have a town read on him.  I don't like toxic's argument that Sable should have seen Radelle as town in post 85.  I'm assuming what he's going for is &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221;, and that Radelle should have been a town read, but that's just bad, because it requires you to ignore your own read and base your reads on what your suspects think.  I'm guessing that this is also why he didn't mention the argument against Trollie's vote on Radelle.  I also don't think his reaction test is useful at all, since he says both that alignment doesn't matter and that the test helps you figure out who is town.  That's idiotic, but it's not a scumtell, since I can't imagine scum coming up with such an elaborate ruse for doing post 61.  Then again, I agree with him that Radelle should have been more forthcoming in her reasons for voting for Abaddon and should have used more recent evidence when she finally did explain it.  Overall I don't really have any strong feelings about toxic's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nNull", "time": "Sun Nov 11, 2012 4:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}

You're tacitly saying that the only real purpose of the reaction test was to catch Sable Tip's scumbuddies geeking out based purely on a bald declaration of suspicion. That's utterly absurd.<br>\n<br>\nLike I said, you're completely missing the point. The reaction test, as stated, has very little to do with Sable Tip's alignment, or with which alignment Toxic assigned to him. Toxic took a thoroughly neutral post and made a bold declarative statement, then refused to back it up. The reaction test was for peoples' reactions to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toxic's</div> actions, not Sable Tip's post. He could have emphatically declared Sable Tip Town while refusing to explain why for a near-identical effect. The slight variance of whether Sable Tip was scum or not utterly pales in comparison to the far more distinct question of how people would react to Toxic's actions.<br>\n<br>\nGet your head out of your ass, Slandaar.

I didn't want anyone to do anything specific. I do see some issues with Sable Tip's post, but I was trying to gather information with mine. I forced the players to go back over his post and look for something they may have missed, and to take a stance on it, as well. This helps us see how players are generally reacting to the game, who's paying attention and catching the little things, etc.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This I follow</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: part2</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I was expecting smart/cautious townies to react much like Abaddon did, saying something along the lines of, \"Yeah, I think I see what you're saying. However, I want to see if our thoughts corroborate. What are you seeing?\" or perhaps, \"I've went back over his post and I still don't see anything. I'm calling your bluff.\" (Though I have a feeling the general reaction from the town was less, \"I've went back over his post,\" and more, \"I'm calling your bluff anyway.\") I expected some comments about having my case made for me, but I thought a reasonable town would try to work with me a little bit without handing me a case -- especially from those who had a town read on me. It was well within reason to put the burden of proof on me and still have this work, but I digress.<br>\n<br>\nI figured scum would be more apt to just blurt out what they saw wrong with the post, looking for approval and hoping to get easy town points. Alternatively, I was expecting scum to be critical of my approach without much consideration of what Sable Tip's post actually says. Why pretend to go scum hunting when you can just attack a player for his strange approach to the situation and get away with it? The drawback is that you have to take this with a grain of salt because a townie that doesn't know any better could easily do these same things, but nothing is ever concrete in scum hunting. Still worth it to see who does what, though. I was trying to get everyone's reaction to both Sable Tip's post and my own, though I mostly got the latter. Regardless, I still think there's a bit of good information here we'll be able to use.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I do not buy this though, there is NO WAY that post was a reaction test.  Maybe it was retrospectively one, but there are so many better ways to reaction test than this.  The question &#8220;does anybody else see&#8230;&#8221; means either (1) that he wants us to say, &#8220;no, show us&#8221; or (2) that he has a good reason to refrain info, or (3) that he isn&#8217;t actually sure there is something off.  SO I have a few problems with this.  First, if this was a reaction test, as he claims, then why is he able to so perfectly explain what is wrong below?  If what he says below is true, then why would he find it scummy for someone to say &#8220;yes, blab la bla&#8221;  Second, If Toxic wants to reaction test based on sable tip&#8217;s post, the way to do it would be to get sable tip to say something showing that he did not consider the issue that Toxic is bringing up.  Something about his parama read, or even telling Sable tip what is wrong and seeing if Sable tip has a bad response to that.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: part3</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">As for Sable Tip... Doesn't anyone find it odd that his 3 suspicions (Cheery Dog, Abaddon, and Parama) are all suspicious of Radelle (to varying degrees), but he lists Radelle as a neutral read? If I had any confidence whatsoever in my reads, and all 3 of my suspicions were expressing doubt over the same player, that player would be pretty far up my town reads list. I'd expect him to list Radelle as leaning town at the very least. He's not being consistent with his reads, and that's scummy. Also, he hasn't really provided <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> Parama and Abaddon are scummy, unless I am to take it that being aggressive and harsh is somehow scummy. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that bothered me was his reference to Parama's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\">Post 47</a>. I can't tell if Sable Tip is trying to buddy me here or what. That part of his post altogether doesn't make much sense to me. It seems like he&#8217;s trying to use it as a lame excuse to vote Parama, but at the same time it reads sort of like a defense so I&#8217;m wary of buddying. Maybe I'm biased here because it's something concerning me, but it really rubbed me the wrong way.</div></div></div> </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nK, I kept reading the ISO: Toxic reads fairly town except for this one issue (the reaction test). So I don&#8217;t really know what to do with him.  Time to take a look at Abaddon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl;dr</div><br>\nLook at my comments in the last post of Toxic&#8217;s that I quoted.

The slight variance of whether Sable Tip was scum or not utterly pales in comparison to the far more distinct question of how people would react to Toxic's actions.</div></blockquote><br>\nNow he&#8217;s on the side of toxic for the reaction test?<br>\nAlso, side note: sable tips alignment is SUPER important.  Either way, town will either see it and take a stab, see it and ask toxic to clarify, or say no, wha.  If sable is town, toxic is right that scum MIGHT feel like they are being given the opportunity to attack someone, but honestly I don&#8217;t think they would because they don&#8217;t know specifically what toxic is talking about and pulling something out of their ass is a bad idea.  If sable is SCUM, then now SCUM will likely say &#8220;no, what&#8221; or &#8220;I think, but I want to hear what you have to say&#8221;  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">in conclusion</div> The reaction test is worthless, at the very best its worthless till a sable slot flip.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4448846#p4448846\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4448846#p4448846\" data-post-id=\"4448846\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 120</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20059\">Abaddon</a> wrote:</cite>^This absolutely reeks of opportunism.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously rethinking my NewTown position on Cheery Dog.<br>\n<br>\nBah, this thread has way too many scummy players and far too few Townie ones.</div></blockquote><br>\n^this absolutely reeks of opportunism.  <br>\n<br>\nIf Ab thinks CD is newb town who is bad at scumhunting but trying then there is nothing wrong with CDs post.  <br>\n<br>\nThe &#8220;bah&#8221; comment is sooooo overdone.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4468730#p4468730\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4468730#p4468730\" data-post-id=\"4468730\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 298</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20059\">Abaddon</a> wrote:</cite>I'm really disliking a lot of what Trollie's had to say lately.

Of course, this could be a play style issue, but the way this post was made seemed methodical, and it was like absta was intentionally not being transparent about his read of Radelle. The actual attack on Abaddon here makes no sense to me as well.

It's an easy thing to suspect, and I definitely could see town suspecting kwll for the post, but the way abstaresponded was more of a, \"That post was bad. Therefore, I would lynch you.\" That is scum logic not translated into town words.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nOf course, there's the series of unexplained votes between kwll and Trollie. That's already been gone over. I especially don't like the one where he uses a self-vote to transition his vote from kwll to Trollie.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4480565#p4480565\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4480565#p4480565\" data-post-id=\"4480565\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 461</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18562\">absta101</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think he had no read whatsoever on Deltabacon but, despite that, he decided to plump for 'Town' without thinking.

Interestingly, he votes for the same reason some people, specifically delta, are voting me.  That he feels Abb should not have defended a scum read of his.  I, of course, disagree, because bad arguments prevent scumhunting and allow opportunistic scum to push a mislynch, but it seems I am alone on that belief in this game (oh ,except for that Abbadon feels the same way but for some reason is voting me because of it.)  I would say this looks genuine, but again, there is a chance that absta noticed how much Parama and Abbadon were buddying and therefore chose to bus hard.

He's apparently read through Radelle's ISO, but nothing seems to be comment-worthy as to why Radelle is town. However, he does have the ability to comment on details of one specific post by Abaddon. It doesn't add up that he's read Radelle's whole ISO, yet only uses one post as evidence for Abaddon being scum.

It is slightly scummy that absta101 hasn't since been able to explain why he did it, but then I guess he's had quite a bit of explaining to do.

You're right that this wasn't a scum-tell and TheTrollie was wrong.

Your reasons are unsubstantiated because even if you legitimately believe them, they rely on gut assumptions.  I do not make unfounded assumptions.  I don't do gut.  I analyze evidence presented in the game thread only.  I accept meta as part of defense only because there is widespread agreement that it is legitimate.  I completely ignore gut, because it's impossible to argue against.  If you want to change my mind on something, you have to argue in a way that I can agree with.  You haven't, and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can't</div> in this case because your assumptions <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">are not based on game-related evidence</div>.  Like I said, that's the sort of thing that made Trollie look suspicious at first, and you're doing the same thing to defend him.  I'm a little more willing to accept it from you just because you're new to online mafia, but my patience is very limited.

I can sum it up. Most of it is stuff that involves his motivations for posting, as a lot of his posts really don't make sense from a \"I'm trying to trick the town into thinking I'm town\" thought process. He's an experienced player; as scum, he would be putting more of an effort in to make himself look town.

And as I said above, it's honestly impossible to argue against.  Any attempt to do so would just turn into a theory discussion about how scum, experienced or not, would likely react under certain stimuli, as in my little exchange with Trollie over this.  If it's gut, I can't magically make you feel differently.  You've already seen all the arguments and tossed them aside because you don't think they feel right.  You don't like the wagon.  How do I argue against that?  \"No, Sherlock, you really <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> like the wagon!\"  Do you see what I'm getting at?

They are very stream-of-consciousness so sorry about that:<br>\n<br>\nCD-thinking viging CD or Abb.  Their quarrel early D1 makes both being scum unlikely. <br>\n-definitely dont want him in LYLO even if town, and with the hype over CD there is no reason for mafia to kill him.  This alone might be enough to warrant the CD vig.<br>\n- most ppl expressed interest in directing my shot to CD<br>\n- A CD flip would help us analyze the wagon that was on me. <br>\n-CD may not get any more readable. rather let town use the lynch on someone we can discuss more.<br>\n-he picks up on arguments very opportunistically (ie. parama and there was one other)<br>\n- post #167 is very scummy, with his \"you can string me up...\" paragraph.  Very scummy post<br>\n- his adamant stance on me is very strange because it stems from me wanting to gain town cred with his lynch.  I showed him why that made no sense, he agreed it made no sense but still wouldnt budge.   even after my claim he didnt budge.  That being said, scum cheery knows absta is town and doesnt switch over to that wagon.  maybe trying to gain town cred when absta is lynched? maybe trying to stay on the wagon of claimed PR?  idk, this is weird as scum.<br>\n-did more meta on CD, I am starting to think my defense was pre-mature, he is a lot derpier than in some of his other games.  Also makes references to his own townie-ness a lot more here <br>\n-If Cd flips town, Delta hopped on an easy target and then once I started in and recieved votes of my own, delta jumps on and becomes most vocal.<br>\n-CD jumps on right , then Abbadon<br>\n<br>\nSide-note: need Kinetic action on D2 desperately, as I go through this stuff, I realize that Radelle is so crucial in this picture. <br>\n-not worth vigging Kinetic because it might be super easy to get a read on that slot once he starts participating<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAbb-i have explained the scum-read, Absta and his town read slandaar start a Abbadon counterwagon.  worry is that scumSlandaar is trying to gain town cred by preventing Absta lynch and at the same time directing our D2 mislynch<br>\n- total lurker<br>\n<br>\nSide note: since Absta flipped Town, anyone against my lynch from the begining and on absta probtown<br>\n<br>\nsidenote: CD and Abaddon are the two ppl still on my wagon in VC 1.14<br>\n<br>\nAbadd wasnt active, slandaar and town absta on abaddon<br>\n<br>\nany other good vigs?<br>\n<br>\n_Sherlock_ - TOWN dont see him actively starting the absta wagon while there is already a huge town wagon.  I understand him staying off of a town wagon, but starting a new one rather than going with one already in existance makes no sense as scum<br>\n<br>\nTommy - probtown - i like his analysis in post #454.  i dont like that he doesnt support my abaddon wagon.  Tommy's been giving me a lot of trouble from the beginning.  Whenever logic says scum on him, my gut says town, and whenever logic says town, gut says scum.  I think this will be easy to clarify as we see more flips though, since he is actually doing quite a lot of work in his posts.<br>\n<br>\nKwll - unsure - i had a gut town read at first but now not sure, he does switch from me to absta fairly quick, think that might be more likely town but idk, have to look at where that is in relation to my claim.  I feel that most of the reasons to kill him would be the same as some of the reasons to kill CD, but I also think Kwll may get easier to read as the game goes on, and I think his flip would be less helpful than CD's flip.<br>\n<br>\n JacobSavage - town - His one scummy thing is starting the wagon then hopping right off of it as it gains steam. overall though, i was pretty confident he was town, and I think his flip would be way less usefull than other's flips, plus hes a pretty solid town read so if hes town he might get NKed, definitely not killing him.  <br>\n<br>\nIdiotking - null - the only reason I think he is town is because of that one post where he calls everyone scummy.  That seems likely to come from town, but can also be scum throwing shit at the walls to see what sticks.  Hes certainly not the best kill target but i think D2 needs more Idiotking examination.<br>\n<br>\nAbsta-conftown-DEAD<br>\n<br>\nCD- already discussed in full<br>\n<br>\nAbadd- already discussed<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar - Needs to be a focus of D2, he weilds a lot of town conrol for no apparent reason.  Dont trust him.<br>\n<br>\nKinetic - Need to keep him alive to get info from him D2.  unfortunately we have no idea what his play will be like but its not worth vigging someone before we know what their deal is.<br>\n<br>\nDelta - I need to review delta.  I have only one reason to think he is town and that may not have been a good one.  If I vig CD though, we will get info on delta.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion:<br>\nGot lots of places to go for D2.  vig of CD is best because<br>\n(1) good chance scum<br>\n(2) this is where town wanted to direct my kill (including absta who is now conftown)<br>\n(3) Given CD's posts, and voting patern (like not unvoting me ever D1), even a townCD is probably a detriment to town<br>\n(4) CD flip will be relatively informative.<br>\n<br>\nReasons not to vig CD<br>\n(1) Scum is going to expect CD vig.<br>\nnot seen many scum docs in this forum.  <br>\n<br>\nk vig CD", "time": "Wed Nov 21, 2012 5:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}

It's more likely that he's doing things the same way he was doing them in his recently-finished game and making a legitimate read list. Someone mentioned when he made the post that he has way too many scum reads in his post to be scum, and I tend to agree with that. Add to that that he listed no one I see as potential scum as a town read, which either means he's not supporting his partners or he's town (or I'm wrong... nah). I disagreed with most of his reads, but he's been consistent with them since the reads post and seems to genuinely believe every point he makes. The fact that he's willing to put a huge post out there in the first place is also a slight towntell, as from a scum PoV, it creates connections between him and every other player. Him showing low confidence in some reads, such as at the end of his read on Abaddon, shows that he's posting all reads that come to his mind instead of finding what's good and making it fit into a read. In my experience, scum are less likely to gather reads in this way because they already know what they want their reads to be, while town are still trying to find theirs. His read on Delta seems to be mostly based on the fact that he attacked Trollie constantly, something terribly wrong, but not something I see Mafia basing a town read on, considering that he wanted Trollie-not-mafia dead. He's too confident about his read on Trollie to be faking it and expect a good reaction to it later, knowing he's not mafia. I also am a fan of the fact that he types up pretty big walls on some players just to end up giving them a null read. It again shows thought. That about wraps up why I got a huge town read on Idiot right after his reads post. The cherry on top of Idiot-town is his Neighbor claim. A two-man neighborhood is pretty likely to have two town, and Jacob's comment about forgetting to check the QT means that if there's scum in the Neighborhood, it's most likely Jacob, not Idiot. His confusion around his read on me is a town tell because, like I've said before, people are less likely to take things step-by-step like that as scum than as town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TOWN</div><br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:80%\"></div><br>\n<br>\nThis is all I can get done tonight, sorry.

I wanted to get through this game today, but I've already spent about 4 hours on the read and I'm only on about page 15. I'll give you guys something right now, but it won't be my big I'm caught up post. <br>\n<br>\nRight now the reads I have are such: <br>\n<br>\nTown, or leaning town: IK, Delta, Sable/Kwill<br>\n<br>\nFor Delta: Starting with #203, as well as a few other things, I've noticed hints that tell me that Delta is likely town. Before #203 I had a slight scum/neutral read on him, but since then I've approved of his posts (up to page 15).<br>\n<br>\nIK: Posts #180, #222 gave me a town read. I have some issues though with his large post (#331), as many of his reads are just... bad. He makes 7 solid \"scum\" reads, but so far 3 of those (Tommy, Absta/Parama, CD) have been confirmed town. Additionally, his other three scum reads (this slot, Slan, Trollie) don't feel like solid scum reads to me. The only scum read he has that I agree with is Abaddon. That is distressing, and I'm curious what the next couple pages reveal about more of his play.<br>\n<br>\nSable/Kwill: This read is almost solely based on Sable's early game play. #109 was a great post. This read is most likely to change though as I haven't seen many good posts yet from this slot and it is my weakest town read right now.<br>\n<br>\nNeutral: Trollie, Slandaar (leaning town), Sherlock, Jacob<br>\n<br>\nTrollie: I haven't quite caught up, but I think I remember him claiming vig. This might change my read eventually. At this point, IK's #222 is a good staple on Trollie's play at this point. As well, I really dislike #232 from Trollie. Seems to be an argument that he just... doesn't need to make. Maybe an IIOA tell. Delta's #265 is on point with how I feel about Trollie. However, despite IK and Delta's attacks on him, I'm hesitant to put a scum tag on him yet. His arguments and defense makes enough sense that I'm not sold on him being scum yet.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar: Shitposting #146, 147, 149, and #198. Seemed to be actively lurking. Comes back with a vengeance in #270 (my notes literally state \"HOLY SHIT, STOP THE PRESSES, SLANDAAR MADE A NON-SHIT POST\"). Makes another good posting at #290. Probably most \"townie\" person sitting on my neutral row right now.<br>\n<br>\nJacob: I simply do not have a lot of notes on him. His only post that is in my notes is he made a list in #202. His only other post that I made a comment on was #304, and that it was a bad idea.<br>\n<br>\nSherlock/Jason: This slot distresses me the most though. #211 echos some of what I feel about Toxic #67, but comes to the opposite conclusion. Specifically: \"I really don't like toxic's Post #67. He's completely avoiding the topic with Abaddon. He also bothered to comment on many other things before that. However, if he actually does end up commenting on it and has a decent reason to stall, he's probably town.\" #262 he makes a reads post, and so far his posts have been well-written and defended, but his reads are nearly exactly opposite mine at this point. Specifically:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kinetic's Notes wrote:</cite>Kinetic's Reads as of #262<br>\nConfirmed: Tommy, Parama/absta, CD, Radelle/Kinetic<br>\nTown: Delta, Sable/kwill, IK<br>\nNeutral: Trollie (leaning scum), Slandaar, Sherlock, Jacob<br>\nScum: Toxic, Abaddon<br>\n<br>\nComparably, Sherlock has toxic/Jacob as strong town (S/N), Tom/Troll town (CT/N), Somewhat town Ab/Sable (S/T), while scum reads on this slot, CD (CT/CT), and neutral to scum on Absta, Delta, IK, and Slan (CT/T/T/N). That is nearly perfect variance. We agree mostly on Slandaar and Sable-kwill, but everything else is far off.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSince then, my read on Slandaar has moved toward leaning town, but based on #318, Sherlock's reads haven't changed. He does not comment on Slandaar though.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I like Sherlock's posts, but I'm disagreeing with his conclusions.<br>\n<br>\nScum reads: Toxic and Abaddon<br>\n<br>\nThese reads are actually strongly tied together. At first, I have issues with Toxic's #53 and #67. Both seem very very scummy. Eventually Toxic #85 is somewhat redeeming. At this point, Abaddon even gets town points for #86 and 88 in my book for calling Toxic on his shitty logic.<br>\n<br>\nMoving forward, Abaddon's #106 bugs me for calling something a strawman argument that wasn't technically a strawman, and then claiming that opinions are not something that could be defended against. In point in fact, Radelle's issue here was very much a meta argument, not an in game one, but nonetheless Abaddon fight he should not defend against it at all.<br>\n<br>\nAbaddon #118 then really rubs me the wrong way for its strong defense on Toxic. This follows with Toxic #134 where Toxic appears to chainsaw into Radelle's attack into Abaddon's play. Radelle's #135/Toxic #139 also shows a rather weird argument. Specifically from my notes:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>#135/139 -(This Slot)/Toxic - Toxic asks for evidence, but is pushing for only a certain type of evidence. He's taking the initial vote, which being an early vote really doesn't have to have too much more than a gut reaction, and trying to twist it into a later vote, which certainly would require more evidence. Except, Radelle has provided some evidence to now support her initial gut, but because it isn't exactly as toxic wants it, Toxic ignores it. This reeks of a double chainsaw, scum-buddies attacking each other's wagons... The problem with that theory being both players are attacking Radelle. I don't think that's a double chainsaw technically. Although Radelle's play isn't the best, I'm finding Toxic/Abaddon's attacks to be falling flat.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nToxic's #145 is a good post overall, but reinforces some of the buddying tells between him and Abaddon. Toxic's #154 shows a complete change of tone that he has used for the whole game when addressing Tommy. My own belief was that Tommy's case via #115 on Parama was more a note of Parama's bad play, rather than Parama's scummyness, but Toxic appears to be one of the few players giving Tommy's case a possible chance at success.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like Toxic's #191 proficiency argument. I didn't like his reaction test when I first saw it, but his insistence that, obviously, only people who can read them accurately can understand his reaction test and the reactions he generated with them. Bugs me that even this far into the game he keeps repeating that point. IK's attack on this was fairly intuitive (that the reactions don't measure scumminess), but Toxic's response is pretty much \"Well I can find scumminess in them\".<br>\n<br>\nToxic's #277 insistence on this \"conflict\" is annoying, repetitive, and ultimately useless. Even if we take his word that there is a conflict, it doesn't indicate scumminess.<br>\n<br>\nSo that's what I have for now, hopefully that helps everyone who was waiting for something form me. I will try to find some more time later to pick up the rest of the read-through.", "time": "Sun Nov 25, 2012 11:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}

I had already caught him not voting for a scum read. Also, you provided him that, \"belief,\" of my motives. When I questioned him about it, he couldn't explain what I had to gain. He says he's answered all my questions, but this one remains unanswered -- and it's arguably the most important factor regarding the, \"baiting,\" issue. So, no, I don't see it, because it's not his belief. It's yours.<br>\n<br>\nNormally I wouldn't have a problem with a replacement waiting to catch up before voting. However, this is different. I don't understand what he's waiting for. If he hadn't provided any content, was still way behind on catching up, and didn't have a clue what was going on, then I could see it. But he's already provided his views on the game and declared some strong scum reads. You've been reading his posts. Do you honestly see any scenario where Kinetic doesn't end up voting for me? I was a major scum read of his for the first half of the game, and he believes I'm still currently acting scummy. Do you think he really believes there is going to be some hidden gem in the middle of the game that will totally change his mind about that?<br>\n<br>\nThere is no trap, there is no bait. I'm not trying to trick him into voting someone else. My point is, I think it is (and has been since the beginning) pretty obvious that Kinetic will end up voting for me when all is said and done, and I have nothing to gain from it. That's why the bait reference makes literally no sense. He's procrastinating on having to vote for his top scum read, and he's trying to leave his options wide open. If he changes his mind about me, or becomes more suspicious of another player, he can always change his vote.

He is not necessarily town, but we can <br>\n<br>\ndeal with that later.  I think it would be good for the town to vote on who they think Trollie <br>\n<br>\nshould kill (I.E. treat it as a second lynch).  At this point even if Trollie is a SK he will <br>\n<br>\nwant to kill mafia.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar is active lurking like always.  His utter uselessness makes me sad.  Like an onion <br>\n<br>\nmade of sadness.<br>\n<br>\nThor hasn't really posted any dramatic arguments so far, but it's only been a few days.  I <br>\n<br>\nalso have difficulty with his jokes (for example, did you actually not read the thread, Thor, <br>\n<br>\nor was that a joke?), but that's obviously not scummy.  I think I'm just going to wait and <br>\n<br>\nwatch more of his play.  Or at least wait until I can examine his play in the context of <br>\n<br>\nAbaddon's play.  I would like to point out though that he's right, nobody has made an argument <br>\n<br>\nabout Thor's actual play since he replaced in.  They just want to go after him for his slot.  <br>\n<br>\nThat's fine and all, Abaddon was scummy, but you can't really say Thor's deflecting anything <br>\n<br>\nwhen nothing has been firmly said against him.<br>\n<br>\nSherlock is most likely not scum, almost completely due to Trollie's claim that he isn't one-<br>\n<br>\nshot.  The only way I can see for Sherlock to still be scum is if he had just decided to <br>\n<br>\nprotect Trollie for some reason or another (maybe just to irritate the town or something).  <br>\n<br>\nEven then though, it would not make sense for him to be against Trollie shooting on N1 (unless <br>\n<br>\nthat was just a front, but then things are getting way too convoluted; he'd have to be faking <br>\n<br>\nopposition to something that would directly benefit him and was being actively supported by <br>\n<br>\nthe town, all to build town props somehow).  I think Sherlock is best left alone for now.  If <br>\n<br>\nhe is scum, he is either a complete genius or a complete lunatic.<br>\n<br>\nKwll's play is still completely unreadable to me, as any new guy's play is.  I am still ok <br>\n<br>\nwith using him as a last resort for lynch, because as I've said before, we absolutely do not <br>\n<br>\nwant him around in LYLO.  I'd actually appreciate it if Trollie killed him, unless there's a <br>\n<br>\nclearly better option.<br>\n<br>\nKinetic appears to have gotten into a big old slapfight with toxic.  Isn't this, like, the <br>\n<br>\nfifth one of these toxic's been in this game?.  I get the feeling that toxic is kind of like <br>\n<br>\nhow I used to be, back when I got into arguments over ridiculous little things that lasted for <br>\n<br>\nages.  Anyway, I agree that regardless of whether Kinetic was correct in his read of toxic, he <br>\n<br>\nshould have had his vote on toxic if that was his strongest scumread.  I don't think it's <br>\n<br>\nnecessarily scummy, because he hadn't caught all the way up, but it is still something to <br>\n<br>\nconsider.  Then later he votes Thor after getting into his big thing with toxic, saying that <br>\n<br>\nhe was really waiting for his other major scumread to pop back in.<br>\n<br>\nW... <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why?</div>  That's just... odd.  I can't imagine any sort of town reason for doing that. <br>\n<br>\n If you've got two scumreads and you don't want to vote for one of them just yet for some <br>\n<br>\nreason, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">vote for the other one, dummy.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves me with Kinetic, Slandaar, and kwll.

If he believes me that I'm town, then we also know for certain that the three remaining scum are Slandaar, Sherlock and kwll in this highly unlikely scenario, but I digress.<br>\n<br>\nIn the highly likely chance that Trollie hits scum, the town enters Day 3 with at most 3 scum remaining, an active Vig, 3 \"undecideds\" in the remaining players from {Slandaar, Sherlock, Kinetic, or kwll} and only 3 of {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa and IK} because the scum cannot kill from the \"Undecided Group\" or lose their shield. Thus leaving pretty much 2 Town within {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK} that are still alive, and Trollie is Vig in this scenario, and at worst Trollie hits the only townie in the three undecided, making it 3-4 town and 3-4 scum, with the likelihood that if there is 4 scum (or at the very least, he's a traitor, and may not count toward mafia win condition while the vig is alive because with two kills available and the mafia having a chance to either miss from a doc, hit their own traitor and Trollie to kill, plus not a sure thing to force a lynch, the game wouldn't end immediately), the fourth is NOT team scum, and thus we are not in endgame. <br>\n<br>\nIf Trollie hits a scum in this scenario, we enter the day with 4 town, and 2-3 scum. Two in the group of the three remaining from {Slandaar, Sherlock, Kinetic, and Kwill} and one in the group of the three remaining from {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa and IK}. <br>\n<br>\nIf Trollie is SK in this scenario, we enter day 3 with either 3-4 town, 1 SK, 2-3 Mafia, of which, most likely there are 2-3 mafia within {Kinetic, Sherlock, Slandaar, Kwll} but only two are alive (because in the event of Thor flipping town, Trollie's best shot at hitting mafia is killing in that group), and then 0-1 Mafia within {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK}. <br>\n<br>\nIf Trollie is SK, If he hits Mafia, its 4-1-2, with 1-2 Mafia in the two remaining alive from {Kinetic, Sherlock, Standaar, and Kwll} and 0-1 Mafia within {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK}. <br>\n<br>\nHere: Town win is likely. Town still have majority, and with two major suspects in the two still alive, the likelihood is town hits scum. Assuming the town lynches town though it means that the other MUST be mafia, and Trollie MUST kill that person during the night making:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf Trollie is SK, If he hits town, than it pretty has that the last three within the group of {Sherlock, Slaandar, Kinetic, and Kwll} must be mafia, and there are no mafia within the remaining 3 from {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK}. <br>\n<br>\nHere: Town win or Draw. <br>\n<br>\nTown and Trollie lynch mafia Day 3. During night, town does not protect Trollie. Either:<br>\n<br>\nHe is immune, survives night kill, kills mafia and thus makes it 3 town, 1 mafia, 1 SK in endgame. Town Win.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">He is immune, survives night kill, kills town,</div> and this leads to an inevitable SK win, unless town spite Trollie, team up with Mafia to kill him and give the Mafia the win.<br>\nHe is not immune, does not survive the night kill, kills mafia, makes it 4 town, 1 mafia in end game with the mafia known. Town Win.<br>\nHe is not immune, is not targeted for night kill, kills mafia, makes it 3 town, 1 mafia, 1 SK. Again, Town Win.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">He is not immune, does not survive night kill, kills town,</div> makes it 2 town, 2 mafia. Mafia Win.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">He is not immune, is not tarted for night kill, kills town,</div> makes it 1 town, 2 mafia, 1 SK. Mafia Win.<br>\n<br>\nTHUS: The only way for Trollie to win this game if he is SK is if he is immune to night kills, and targets a town member during Night 3, AND the town decides not to screw him over. <br>\nTHUS: The only way for the Mafia to win is if Trollie, on Night 3, kills a town member.<br>\nTherefore: If Town agrees if Trollie targets town during Night 3, we will throw the game to the Mafia, we force Trollie to have to attack Mafia in this event, and therefore, the only way Scum can win if Thor is Town is if Trollie is SK, and basically sacrifices himself to let the mafia win. This \"denial\" tactic forces Trollie to basically decide the game for Mafia or Town, no matter his immunity.<br>\n<br>\nOK, I'm done going through all the possible contingencies. That is the absolute worst case scenario (Trollie is SK, Thor is not Scum). Even under that scenario, town still wins 50% of the time, and Trollie cannot win. Most likely though, the scenario isn't that bad, and frankly, Thor is scum, regardless of Trollies alignment. <br>\n<br>\nI'm going to bed.", "time": "Mon Dec 03, 2012 4:13 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}

The facts, based on the context of where Thor was, and based on Abaddon's play, indicate a motivation that is a motivation that is inherent with knowledge that Thor claims he does not have. As only scum would have that knowledge, it indicates scum. The ONLY thing elsewise that would prove that knowledge is if Thor claimed COP, and an innocent result on Toxic. But frankly, he had that opportunity, that was the ONLY claim I was looking for when he was supposed to claim and frankly, now it doesn't make sense.

I see some instances of bad things by kinetic, but mostly i think people are just disagreeing with his theories and feeling like there is no way they could come from town because of that.  Kinetic comes off as very genuine, and as if he really believes the things he is saying.  On the other hand, I really do not see why Thor is getting away with his play.  He keeps deflecting by exploiting some of the disagreeable things Kinetic is saying.  <br>\n<br>\nI believe Thor is scum.  Thor, the argument against you is firstly all of the reasons Abaddon is scummy.  I have made an argument to this effect in the past and so have many others.  If things went my way D1 we would have lynched Abaddon, but then when suspicion shifted to absta he did not react well.<br>\n<br>\nI really gotta get to work, but I can say this.  I know its not a very detailed case but this is what I can offer.  I plead with other players to really take a close look at kinetic v. thor and decide which of them looks more genuine.  Thor<br>\n<br>\n(1) deflects a lot, especially by saying kintetic has no case, has no case has no case.<br>\n(2) seems to keeping himself to a higher level of restraint than Kintetic.  Kinetic is putting himself out there.  He has given us a ton of content since his feud with thor.  Is this scum trying desperately to avoid a lynch? No, i dont think so.  I think it is someone who GENUINELY believes the things he is saying and is pleading with us to not stupidly lynch him when he is town.  Thor, on the other hand, did not try as hard to kill his wagon, instead he kept asking questions so that he could convince us that the wagon on him was not well founded.  It is well founded, it is very well founded.  <br>\n(3) Thor is using a tactic (the one above) i see a lot of scum players use and that is very successful usually.  The one where you keep laughing off the case against you.  Now i dont know thor meta, and i dont have the time to check it, so maybe this is his town play as well, but I see no town motive from his defense.  He is 100% defensive and accusational.

We all do scummy things sometimes as town.  That does not make every one of us scum.  When pressured, Thor looks scummier than Kinetic.  There is no one argument or one post that should seal our reads. <br>\n<br>\nThor is acting scummy.  <br>\n<br>\nKinetic is acting like town who genuinely holds those theories that he is espousing to be true, though almost none of the other players in this game agree.  It is not THAT he is disagreeable that makes him scummy though.  This is the same issue I had with the case on CD yesterday.  Someone can think crazy things as town, the question is, do they believe what they are saying, or are they saying it to avoid getting caught.

I think it is someone who GENUINELY believes the things he is saying and is pleading with us to not stupidly lynch him when he is town.

You were \"100% defensive\" when your initial play was an offensive attack, calling me out for attacking, when I was in fact defending a post that was not even an attack on toxic. It was initial reads from half the game that I posted so there was SOME content from my slot while I caught up. Instead of waiting until Iw as completely caught up though, like I kept asking, I had to keep getting pulled to the front of the thread in order to defend myself and say: FUCKING WAIT.

You're \"100% on the defensive here\".<br>\n<br>\nYou call my actions scummy, but my actions up to that point were: Post initial reads so that everyone could get some more from my slot (town), trying to catch up on the game (town), defending myself from toxic's attacks which were based on preliminary, unfinished posts that I said weren't finished, yet he decided to take issue with (town).

Given that night actions are definitely randomized if one isn't sent in, we need to figure out why only Thor died.<br>\n2.  It is possible that scum intentionally left their NKs unsent so that they would be random, and NK analysis would thus be useless.  However, this would intentionally be giving up their control over who dies, which trumps any benefit from truly randomized NKs.  Has anyone here ever seen scum who actually, truly just picked some random guy to NK?  All of them that I've ever seen had scum talking about who specifically to kill.<br>\n3.  Trollie claimed to kill Cheery N1, and we have no reason to doubt him.  Why, then, would scum kill Tommy?  He was hardly the most townie of players.<br>\n<br>\nFor the Thor thing, here's the possibilities that I can see.<br>\n<br>\n1.  Scum and Trollie both targeted Thor.  This would be silly, since Thor was easily one of the most suspected players in the game.  However, I've seen scum do stupid things like this before, so it's not impossible.<br>\n2.  Scum targeted someone else, Trollie targeted the same person, and Thor protected that person.  This would lead to the question, who did they both target?<br>\n3.  Scum targeted Thor, Trollie targeted someone else, Thor protected that person.  Again, this would be stupid, but not unheard of.<br>\n4.  Scum targeted someone else, Trollie targeted Thor, Thor protected person that Scum targeted.  I could see this, because Trollie seemed to want to kill Thor yesterday.<br>\n5.  Scum targeted Thor, and Trollie is 1-shot.<br>\n6.  Scum targeted someone, Thor protected them, and Trollie is 1-shot.<br>\n7.  Scum targeted Slandaar, Trollie targeted Thor.  Why the hell would this happen?  Incredibly unlikely.<br>\n8.  Scum targeted Thor, Trollie targeted Slandaar.  The first part would be stupid, the second part would make sense, because Trollie would have an interest in confirming Slandaar's story.<br>\n9.  Scum targeted someone, Thor protected that person, Trollie targeted Slandaar.

Look at the difference between his Day 2 and Day 3 play. During Day 2, he was fairly active in the discussion, but avoided the subject constantly and commented on mostly irrelevant things. Today, he seems to be much more on the ball about everything.

If Sherlock dies tonight and flips town it confirms Slaandar as scum, which scum don't really want.  So Sherlock has a chance to survive the night if he's telling the truth.  If he's not telling the truth, we lynch Slaandar, he flips town, and we're basically dead.<br>\n<br>\nGoing along with this, Konowa is off limits, because lynching him would be stupid without some sort of confirmation about Sherlock's alignment.  Even if Sherlock's right, Konowa might be a godfather, so I want to play it safe.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to kill Jacob, because doing so would be a complete shot in the dark from my perspective.  Scum in a single two-man neighborhood is extremely unlikely, and we'd be playing Russian Roulette with it.<br>\n<br>\nTrollie should obviously not be lynched, because we need to assume he's not scum for now.  He also needs to do what the town as a whole agrees, because 1.  that would lead to more discussion, which we really damn well need right now, 2.  it would allow the town as a whole to decide rather than a single person, and crowdsourcing is actually a good thing, 3.  if he's a SK he needs to be chained.<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves toxic and kwll.  I do not at all buy Sherlock's argument that kwll is town, because from what I can see it's based on gut, and as I've said many times, I don't buy gut.  Since my reads up to this point have been complete crap, I'm going to just have to go on pure setup analysis, which is something I really hate doing.  I say we lynch kwll, partially because he's completely unreadable to me, and partially because of the process of elimination.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves toxic, who may or may not be NK'd by Trollie.  I can't say I have a scumread on toxic, but as I've said, my reads up until now have been complete crap, so I don't know.  The only strong read I still have is on Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nSo I suppose going against what I said up there, Slandaar may be the best bet for a Trollie NK, if kwll flips scum.  We'd definitely have survived the night, and it would give us a clear indication of Sherlock's alignment.  While we wouldn't know about Konowa (it's possible for scum claiming cop to buddy a townie in order to get props), it would at least cut down scum's numbers.<br>\n<br>\nAssuming we lynch scum today, it will probably be in scum's best interests to kill Trollie, simply because regardless of his alignment, he's another night killer, and scum won't want more opportunities for him to kill them.  If he's vig, well, we'd really have no way of knowing.  If he's a SK, hooray.<br>\n<br>\nAssuming we lynch kwll and he flips scum, Sherlock should investigate either Jacob or toxic.  Since Jacob's more up in the air for me, he may be the best bet, because like I said, I don't like Russian Roulette.<br>\n<br>\nAssuming we lynch kwll and he flips <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">town</div>, well, we need a backup plan for what Sherlock and Trollie should do.  Sherlock may still want to investigate Jacob, because hell, why not.  Trollie should still probably go after Slandaar.

I got a minor town read from the way he bluntly showed an opposite view from me as far as Trollie's alignment. This view remains consistent throughout Day 1, as he stay's on Trollie's ass to the end. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> The sense I got from his Post #321 made me feel that he's actually going through his reads with some serious effort. This makes me feel that he's either highly detailed scum putting effort into faking each of his reads in detail, or he's town. My only samples are one recently finished game and games from years ago, but his max posting quality seems to be higher as town, similar to his posting here. Along the same line, there's Post #331. As he claimed that his post took two days to assemble, it's less likely that he took two days faking a huge post when he hasn't had a history of doing that before as scum. It's more likely that he's doing things the same way he was doing them in his recently-finished game and making a legitimate read list. Someone mentioned when he made the post that he has way too many scum reads in his post to be scum, and I tend to agree with that. Add to that that he listed no one I see as potential scum as a town read, which either means he's not supporting his partners or he's town (or I'm wrong... nah). I disagreed with most of his reads, but he's been consistent with them since the reads post and seems to genuinely believe every point he makes. The fact that he's willing to put a huge post out there in the first place is also a slight towntell, as from a scum PoV, it creates connections between him and every other player. Him showing low confidence in some reads, such as at the end of his read on Abaddon, shows that he's posting all reads that come to his mind instead of finding what's good and making it fit into a read. In my experience, scum are less likely to gather reads in this way because they already know what they want their reads to be, while town are still trying to find theirs. His read on Delta seems to be mostly based on the fact that he attacked Trollie constantly, something terribly wrong, but not something I see Mafia basing a town read on, considering that he wanted Trollie-not-mafia dead. He's too confident about his read on Trollie to be faking it and expect a good reaction to it later, knowing he's not mafia. I also am a fan of the fact that he types up pretty big walls on some players just to end up giving them a null read. It again shows thought. That about wraps up why I got a huge town read on Idiot right after his reads post. The cherry on top of Idiot-town is his Neighbor claim. A two-man neighborhood is pretty likely to have two town, and Jacob's comment about forgetting to check the QT means that if there's scum in the Neighborhood, it's most likely Jacob, not Idiot. His confusion around his read on me is a town tell because, like I've said before, people are less likely to take things step-by-step like that as scum than as town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TOWN</div><br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:80%\"></div><br>\n<br>\nThis is all I can get done tonight, sorry.

I got a minor town read from the way he bluntly showed an opposite view from me as far as Trollie's alignment. This view remains consistent throughout Day 1, as he stay's on Trollie's ass to the end. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> The sense I got from his Post #321 made me feel that he's actually going through his reads with some serious effort. This makes me feel that he's either highly detailed scum putting effort into faking each of his reads in detail, or he's town. My only samples are one recently finished game and games from years ago, but his max posting quality seems to be higher as town, similar to his posting here. Along the same line, there's Post #331. As he claimed that his post took two days to assemble, it's less likely that he took two days faking a huge post when he hasn't had a history of doing that before as scum. It's more likely that he's doing things the same way he was doing them in his recently-finished game and making a legitimate read list. Someone mentioned when he made the post that he has way too many scum reads in his post to be scum, and I tend to agree with that. Add to that that he listed no one I see as potential scum as a town read, which either means he's not supporting his partners or he's town (or I'm wrong... nah). I disagreed with most of his reads, but he's been consistent with them since the reads post and seems to genuinely believe every point he makes. The fact that he's willing to put a huge post out there in the first place is also a slight towntell, as from a scum PoV, it creates connections between him and every other player. Him showing low confidence in some reads, such as at the end of his read on Abaddon, shows that he's posting all reads that come to his mind instead of finding what's good and making it fit into a read. In my experience, scum are less likely to gather reads in this way because they already know what they want their reads to be, while town are still trying to find theirs. His read on Delta seems to be mostly based on the fact that he attacked Trollie constantly, something terribly wrong, but not something I see Mafia basing a town read on, considering that he wanted Trollie-not-mafia dead. He's too confident about his read on Trollie to be faking it and expect a good reaction to it later, knowing he's not mafia. I also am a fan of the fact that he types up pretty big walls on some players just to end up giving them a null read. It again shows thought. That about wraps up why I got a huge town read on Idiot right after his reads post. The cherry on top of Idiot-town is his Neighbor claim. A two-man neighborhood is pretty likely to have two town, and Jacob's comment about forgetting to check the QT means that if there's scum in the Neighborhood, it's most likely Jacob, not Idiot. His confusion around his read on me is a town tell because, like I've said before, people are less likely to take things step-by-step like that as scum than as town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TOWN</div><br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:80%\"></div><br>\n<br>\nThis is all I can get done tonight, sorry.

This is dumb because I don&#8217;t think any of us believe that scum shot thor.  So he is picking and chosing evidence (he references the bodyguard ability, and that thor died, and that he had a town read on Sherlock) but not conceding to the fact that the NK probably tells us nothing cause Thor likely protected someone (id say me)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4537249#p4537249\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4537249#p4537249\" data-post-id=\"4537249\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1327</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20162\">_Sherlock_</a> wrote:</cite>I have an alternative idea.<br>\n<br>\nNo-lynch, Trollie doesn't shoot.

I messed up because I figured that if I claimed I shot slandaar it would confirm his claim and make him look town, but then we realized that the claim is just as likely to be a scum role.  Then I realized what I should have done is claimed a shot on some rando to get a better reaction test, so I figured I got what I needed from the slandaar claim, now ill claim I shot Sherlock.  THE VERY OBVIOUS EXPLANATION FROM TOWN SHERLOCK IS THAT THOR PROTECTED HIM.  HE HAD ALREADY SAID THAT THOR HAD A TOWN READ ON HIM.  But he goes STRAIGHT to calling me a liar.  Why? Because Scumlock knows that SCUM SHOT ME last night, so if I didn&#8217;t die that must mean that Thor protected me, and that I shot either Thor or Slandaar (who claimed 1shotbp).  If Sherlock did not know the truth of the scumkill last night, the VERY OBVIOUS explanation would have been that thor protected him.  <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">this is the main problem I have with Sherlock right now</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4539666#p4539666\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4539666#p4539666\" data-post-id=\"4539666\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1462</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20162\">_Sherlock_</a> wrote:</cite>@Trollie: Here's a possibility:<br>\n<br>\nThor sees me as town, wants to protect me from the NK because I may get killed if the Mafia think he's on Trollie (or, he's protecting me from Trollie - less likely).

Correct?<br>\n<br>\nI don&#8217;t see why this is hard to figure out.  Scum were not going to shoot claimed Vig in Trollie since it would fail anyways.  Also the fact that Thor never claimed who he was going to protect leaves it open to the possibility that maybe he wouldn&#8217;t protect Trollie, but I digress.  Easiest way out of this situation is for scum to shoot Thor in the face, eliminating that problem.<br>\n<br>\nNow.<br>\n<br>\nTrollie, we don&#8217;t know who Thor protected, so the fact that you shot Sherlock and him still being alive is not indicative of him being scum.  Thor could have protected Sherlock.  So you shooting him would have been cancelled out by Thor&#8217;s BG.  Also, think about this, if scum do indeed have a RB&#8217;er then why not RB Thor &#8211;and then- shoot you.  This would have left Thor alive today when he most likely would have been a prime mislynch target.<br>\n<br>\nPoint in fact is that we have a cop claiming a guilty on Slandaar.

This is because on N2 his scumlist included two confirmed scum, and only a truly desperate scum would do that (on N2 they had no reason to be desperate).<br>\n<br>\nWe've also basically confirmed that I'm town, so that's nice.  Either Sherlock correctly identified me as town or Sherlock is scum claiming cop, and I am therefore town.  Konowa is in a more curious position.  Either Sherlock correctly identified him as town, he is the Godfather, or he is town and Sherlock is scum claiming cop with a townread on him to gain confidence.  2/3 of these scenarios have him as town, and his play combined with his predecessor's play has me fairly sure that he's town.<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves Kwll and Sherlock.  I'm certainly willing to give Sherlock the benefit of the doubt now, so Kwll should probably be the lynch today.  However, I don't at all like him investigating me last night, because seriously, why the hell would he do that?  He'd have been far better off investigating Jacob, because if Jacob flipped scum then we'd have our scum neighbor, and if Jacob flipped town then that means we're not two scum fakeclaiming neighbors together.  I was basically universally seen as town, so doing so fits the \"scum trying to hide a bad investigation\" thing.<br>\n<br>\nAnd more:  If he knew Trollie was going to shoot his buddy, then he'd have at least one mislynch in his way beforehand.  Thus, claiming to have found scum last night would be impossibly dangerous, because when we lynched that person and they flipped town he'd be dead within moments.  So, he would have had to fake an investigation on someone who was seen as obvious town, leaving the possibility that the not-obviously-town people would be available for lynching.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, kwll is independently scummy.<br>\n<br>\nSo here's what I'm thinking:  We kill kwll, and if that's not game over, Sherlock investigates Jacob.  If Sherlock gets a town read on him, we have a seriously high probability of there being a Godfather.  In that case, I think Konowa would be the Godfather, because as Sherlock said, neighbor Godfather would be silly.  OR, we lynch Sherlock tomorrow, and cross our fingers.<br>\n<br>\nI want to wait at least a few hours before lynching Kwll so that we can discuss this stuff and so that the Mod can respond to Jacob's second question.", "time": "Sat Dec 22, 2012 9:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23772&start=1675", "forum": "53", "thread": "23772"}
