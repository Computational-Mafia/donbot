I didn't want anyone to do anything specific. I do see some issues with Sable Tip's post, but I was trying to gather information with mine. I forced the players to go back over his post and look for something they may have missed, and to take a stance on it, as well. This helps us see how players are generally reacting to the game, who's paying attention and catching the little things, etc.<br><br>I was expecting smart/cautious townies to react much like Abaddon did, saying something along the lines of, \"Yeah, I think I see what you're saying. However, I want to see if our thoughts corroborate. What are you seeing?\" or perhaps, \"I've went back over his post and I still don't see anything. I'm calling your bluff.\" (Though I have a feeling the general reaction from the town was less, \"I've went back over his post,\" and more, \"I'm calling your bluff anyway.\") I expected some comments about having my case made for me, but I thought a reasonable town would try to work with me a little bit without handing me a case -- especially from those who had a town read on me. It was well within reason to put the burden of proof on me and still have this work, but I digress.<br><br>I figured scum would be more apt to just blurt out what they saw wrong with the post, looking for approval and hoping to get easy town points. Alternatively, I was expecting scum to be critical of my approach without much consideration of what Sable Tip's post actually says. Why pretend to go scum hunting when you can just attack a player for his strange approach to the situation and get away with it? The drawback is that you have to take this with a grain of salt because a townie that doesn't know any better could easily do these same things, but nothing is ever concrete in scum hunting. Still worth it to see who does what, though. I was trying to get everyone's reaction to both Sable Tip's post and my own, though I mostly got the latter. Regardless, I still think there's a bit of good information here we'll be able to use.<br><br><br>As for Sable Tip... Doesn't anyone find it odd that his 3 suspicions (Cheery Dog, Abaddon, and Parama) are all suspicious of Radelle (to varying degrees), but he lists Radelle as a neutral read? If I had any confidence whatsoever in my reads, and all 3 of my suspicions were expressing doubt over the same player, that player would be pretty far up my town reads list. I'd expect him to list Radelle as leaning town at the very least. He's not being consistent with his reads, and that's scummy. Also, he hasn't really provided <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> Parama and Abaddon are scummy, unless I am to take it that being aggressive and harsh is somehow scummy. <br><br>Another thing that bothered me was his reference to Parama's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\">Post 47</a>. I can't tell if Sable Tip is trying to buddy me here or what. That part of his post altogether doesn't make much sense to me. It seems like he\u2019s trying to use it as a lame excuse to vote Parama, but at the same time it reads sort of like a defense so I\u2019m wary of buddying. Maybe I'm biased here because it's something concerning me, but it really rubbed me the wrong way."}

I heartily dislike the wishy-washy argument in his 57 which seems to not contribute anything, realistically. It strikes a middle ground between Cheery and Abaddon who were arguing at the time quite wildly, and puts scumreads on both of them, whilst jumping on what is effectively a continuation of a statement made in RVS to try and justify a vote on Parama. He seems to hint at there being a correllation between Parama's and Abaddon's RVS 'argument' when in fact Abaddon's #17 pretty much agreed with Parama's #16. What I don't like about this is he contradicts himself here, calling it the start of a 'tiff' between them when there has been no such argument. Whilst this may simply be an oversight and lazy towntelling, I'm more inclined to say that it's scum trying to mislead town, since it doesn't take a huge amount of effort to look at the posts in isolation and realise that there is no such argument. Now, he paints them both as scum, which I believe is laying the groundwork for his cases later on, since he leans heavily on Parama being scum.<br><br>In addition to this, he tries to call people out based on their contribution. Now, I realise that I'm not exactly the flag-bearer for punctuality and consistent contribution in this game so far, but he calls out two people who have posted quite a bit more than I had at that point in the game, considering I was on zero posts thus far. Calling people out for inactivity is one thing, but realistically, calling people who've posted out more than people who haven't? I just can't see any townsided reason not to put large pressure on lurkers to play.<br><br>I can't see a town-sided element resting a case on so flimsy a point, and so my vote at the moment goes on Sable Tip.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sable Tip</span><br><br>Other people I don't like at the moment include JacobSavage, who (again, whilst I can't really call others out on it given my record this game) has contributed little to nothing, and has posted only what could be construed as a jokepost when we are arguably knee-deep in discussion. It looks to me like mafia who is trying to avoid prods, in all honesty. If we don't see a post with real contribution in within the next 8-10 hours I'll be inclined to FoS him.<br><br>I'm swinging mid-town on Tommy and toxic, since the posts they both make seem to be clear and easy to understand, rather than wrapped in fluff, which to me indicates town-freindly play. The only exception to this being Toxic's 'reaction test' attempt, which whilst I can see the potential benefits of such a strategy, I think was poorly executed. I don't think he's any less town as a result though.<br><br>I'm bordering neutral on pretty much everyone else, barring Radelle, however I'm not getting that from a read, it's simple association with Sable which I refuse to act on until I have a more concrete read."}

It's pretty clear what you were building up to with your vote. I'm saying that you've had all game to call him out, or at least mention some kind of suspicion, for his scummy behavior throughout the game.

It's one thing to call him out, it's another to be hypocritical about it (and scummy to boot!).<br><br>I disagree. The evidence is there. It was obvious why he voted for you from the beginning. The strawman argument is a point against you, and it's evidence there for everyone to see. You say it's arguable, but you've yet to try to argue against it (probably because you can't). It stands until then. While I'll admit he didn't cite any specific posts that cast others in a questionable light, nothing to me suggests he would be unable to do so if asked about it. We can find out real quick.<br><br>@Abaddon: Where has Radelle gone out of her way to cast others in a questionable light?"}

He leaves his reasoning open, but Parama voted first. It's Abaddon who's agreeing with Parama. <br><br>As for point 2, I'll agree there is no town motivation to muddy the waters, but I also agree with Parama that you have to take implications from time to time. If he changed words and tried to use that as a main point in a case to make another player look scummy, I'd say you really had something there. In this context, however, I don't see it as a huge issue.<br><br>Point 3 is also fair, but I think his presence was never great enough to matter. I don't know who all asked him what, or how many times he posted afterward (and I don't care to look right now), but I think most questions that went unanswered were probably due to his lack of presence rather than intentionally dodging them.<br><br>I get what you're saying with point 4, but any reasonable townie should be able to ignore this pretty easily.

Again, I'd say this is mostly due to lack of presence. You have to remember that the majority of his posts happened during the earliest stages of the game when there wasn't much to comment on. We did get out of RVS and move the game into a serious discussion very quickly, but his posting dropped off at the top of page 3. There was stuff to comment on, but still not a ton of stuff. This would be much more suspicious if he had been consistently active and then dropped off around page 5 or so when things started getting really heavy.<br><br>Point 6 is defeated by the fact that he replaced out, in my opinion.<br><br><br>The main problem is he wasn't here to post anything, and now he's been replaced. You're trying to attack someone who basically wasn't even there. I think it's better to wait and see how absta101 does and go from there, rather than pursuing a case on someone who isn't even in this game anymore."}

It doesn't really look terribly good, the way he chainsawed me and voted me, without any regard to the fact that there is other players in the game. True, there was a discrepancy in my post wherein I did the same thing as him (looked for more contribution from JacobSavage), however this is mitigated by the fact that I was looking mainly at the fact that he made a completely useless dumbtell post in the middle of the day's discussion.

For instance: Sherlock and TheTrollie both have the same rating, yet you're reasonably sure of one and unsure of the other. It looks like your rating system has 'towniness' as high numbers and 'scumminess' down as low ones, but Slandaar is neutral leaning town whereas Radelle is just neutral. I'm not attacking, I just don't think I'm reading your post correctly.<br><br>However, one thing I did notice, which I had missed in my look at Cheery Dog was why TheTrollie seemed so adamant to proclaim him as town.<br><br>If we look at TheTrollie's ISO, posts 160, 164 and 166 are highly contradictory.

Sure, he dismantled it after because he 'doesn't have faith in his scumreads from illogical posts', but can anyone really see the townsided benefit of being lazy? I certainly can't. I carry on with this line, saying it's not a rhetorical question if it prompts a response. <br><br>Cheery -tries- to look town and deflect the questions (which didn't work, I still think he's scummy) but then Trollie steps in again, seriously asserting that Cheery might be passive town.

I don't understand how you really come to that conclusion."}

First, I'll read through the game and point out what I see that stands out. Then, I may go through a few people's posts using the \"Display posts by user\" feature.<br><br>I find it strange that Abaddon, in Post #17, points out that he thinks Radelle is overdoing it while Parama's post had a tone that was much more fake. I've read some of Parama's games, and he normally acts like that, but I still find it a little weird that he called Radelle out, but not Parama. Then later, in Post #21, his accusation on Cheery of \"obvious chainsawing\" are unwarranted, as Cheery didn't really defend Radelle or make a very serious attack on Abaddon. Add to that that he's the only person that really stands out to me on Page 1, and I have an early suspect.<br><br>toxic's Post #32 upsets me. First, he says \"RVS is over.\" Then, he doesn't really comment on the recent happenings, but instead attacks someone who didn't comment on the recent happenings. That's a hypocritical attack.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440414#p4440414\" class=\"postlink\">post 33</a>, Radelle wrote:</cite>You say this like it's just an example of a plausible scenario, but I'm getting the impression by you saying you think it's deliberate that you actually think this. So, <span class=\"noboldsig\">am I right that you actually think Abaddon is my scum buddy</span> or why else do you think he was being deliberate by not voting me?</div></blockquote><br><br>The bolded sentence is said in a tense that makes it look like Radelle knows that Cheery is town.<br><br>I really like Tommy's point in Post #37. Radelle's questions didn't really seem to have reason to them.<br><br>Cheery in Page 2 seems insistent on keeping his scum read on Abaddon after many admitted flaws in his logic were pointed out. I really can't see why he would be that way as town.<br><br>I really like the part in Sable's Post #57 about playing Devil's Advocate. It's not something that people will normally call town-like, seeing as no one mentioned it, but at the same time, it seems like a really unlikely position to fake as scum.<br><br>toxic's Post #61 was generally useless and out-of-place compared to things he had posted previously. Abaddon clearly wins their little tiff after that.<br><br>I like Abaddon's conclusion in Post #66. I agree with it, and I think it is another unlikely stance for scum to try and take.<br><br>I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> don't like toxic's Post #67. He's completely avoiding the topic with Abaddon. He also bothered to comment on many other things before that. However, if he actually does end up commenting on it and has a decent reason to stall, he's probably town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442842#p4442842\" class=\"postlink\">post 68</a>, Radelle wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Tommy</span>:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440469#p4440469\" class=\"postlink\">post 37</a>, Tommy wrote:</cite>This appears to be some sort of logical pedantry about and/or vs either/or. I can't see what Radelle hopes to get out of it.</div></blockquote><br>I wanted a definitive read since he was slowly creeping his way to a scum read on Cheery without actually directly stating so. He makes the distinction that Cheery can't be both scum or an idiot (which doesn't make sense), but notice how he doesn't make the distinction of Cheery being a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Village Idiot</span>. That read was leaving itself open.</div></blockquote><br><br>This seems a bit far-fetched.<br><br>Ah, there we go - toxic has a reason for stalling. It's totally legit, and toxic's town. However, he had the huge reason that had to do with scumhunting and all sorts of stuff, but he never drew any conclusions from his plan. It was pretty much useless. It's more of a sign of poor play than scumminess.<br><br>Here's why Jacob is town. Everyone is posting their reads and contributing to the thread. Then, suddenly, Jacob comes along in Post #91 and basically says that he has no reads, and that he needs to create a spreadsheet for this game. I really doubt that he's bold enough to do this and expect to get away with it as scum. I also doubt that this is due to bad scum play - in that case, he would likely be attacking <span style=\"font-style: italic\">someone</span>. Therefore, he must be town who genuinely lost in this game - understandable, as that is how I felt about this game at first. He also makes a spreadsheet that looks like it had some serious time and effort put into it. Again, if he's too lazy to fake reads as scum, he's not going to be making some badass spreadsheet. That's why Jacob was and is at the top of my town list. I expect there to be some nice reactions to his play here, though.<br><br>Tommy's Post #107 is really good. He's encouraging Jacob to scumhunt, something which does nothing but hurt the scum win condition by allowing people to get an accurate read on Jacob, and if Jacob is town, allowing him to find the scum more easily.<br><br>Idiot's Post #108 attack on Parama is filled with words, but lousy. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Nothing</span> he accused Parama of is really indicative of scum, and most of it is Parama's playstyle.<br><br>Slandaar, as of Page 5, is being a bit of a spectator. He's commenting on random tidbits here and there, but never really states a conclusion. I have a problem with that.<br><br>Post #115 is a town post from a guy who doesn't really know what he's talking about. This is kinda weak reasoning, but he's making a big case on the weak player - and it looks genuine. Scum usually can't manage that.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Note: Parama replaced out.</span> Using his inactivity to call him scum will not work. Post #119 by Cheery was a terrible vote for that reason.<br><br>Reads lists are usually bad things to make as scum because they establish connections with everybody. That is why Abaddon's #121 is a towntell. Even if he is calling out my slot. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Post #129 is good as well, in that he naturally but regretfully defends Parama.<br><br><br><br>I'm a bit too tired to finish the rest of this tonight.

Why the hell does scum need to go through the trouble of building the spreadsheet.  they dont care enough about scumhunting to do that.

Does each post count just as much as any other, or does your system allow you to give certain posts more weight?<br>(4) if each post does get a score, is that score just a rating of scummyness from 1-10 (like the final scores are) or do you rate those differently?<br>(5) how many times have u used this method? <br><br>I probably have a lot of questions, but its stupid for me to ask them when im just speculating right now.  maybe the best thing for you to do would be to write a cohesive description of how your system works.

This is apparent in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450743#p4450743\" class=\"postlink\">post 135</a> regarding his feelings regarding the conflict between wanting me to provide evidence (which I did) vs Abaddon having none. His reply in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450838#p4450838\" class=\"postlink\">post 139</a> was not answering the question, but instead answering on his behalf and essentially just trying to defend him again.<br><br>The only <span style=\"font-style: italic\">potentially</span> valid point Toxic has tried to push has been this notion that scum-me jumped ship to go over to Abaddon's wagon because his wasn't going anywhere. Not only was this idea not brought up at any point between my vote for Abaddon and my post explaining why I think Abaddon is scum, but if my pure scum-motivation was to just jump ship to hop onto a more viable wagon, it wouldn't make sense to jump ship onto one of town's <br>more townie reads vs the more viable Sable and Parama bandwagons.<br><br>I've slowly been turned into some sort of aggressor in the conversation between Toxic and I, when it's Toxic who first tried to attack me directly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450621#p4450621\" class=\"postlink\">post 134</a> and not my case. From this point on, it's been me mainly addressing <span style=\"font-style: italic\">his</span> attacks and explaining my thought process. His whole conversation with me has been ridiculous, from saying I should have presented a case for why Abaddon was scummy with my base vote (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4446523#p4446523\" class=\"postlink\">I did</a> along with some things leading up to it), meta reads are useless and I should present more than that (which I did in my \"why is Abaddon is scum\" post, and I explain how things lead up to that post), and that I should provide evidence against Abaddon (but <span style=\"font-style: italic\">only</span> within a certain time frame, and only I have to, Abaddon's evidence is just \"there\"). Just look at our responses. Even when I point out how I did everything he has been trying to accuse me of, it either doesn't matter or he tries to point something else to direct the conversation to.<br><br>Scum aren't scum due to scummy posts though. Everyone makes scummy posts, what you have to keep in mind is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why did someone makes a post and what purpose did they hope to achieve</span>. I really don't know what Toxic is hoping to achieve. It's obvious with his first attack against my case on Abaddon that his purpose was to try and defend Abaddon through discrediting my vote and why I thought he was scummy - but <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span>. This could be scum defending scum, scum trying to gain town credit from defending town, or town trying hard to defend a town read. I honestly can't tell. Some people are just horrible arguers, and I think he feels he has some sort of \"catch\" on me and is trying to damnedest to reel me in with anything he can throw at it. I've actually been holding onto a town read of Toxic because I don't think scum would go so out of their way to push a lynch on someone they know is town only to probably take the downfall for it the next day. <br><br>What purpose did I hope to achieve when I made a serious vote on Toxic page 1? To get out of RVS because it sucks, and I got a somewhat scummy vibe out of Toxic at the beginning so I rolled with it. It wasn't supposed to be some MASTERFUL <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">REALLY SERIOUS</span> case on Toxic, and I don't know how anyone would reasonably expect it to be so when just basing things off RVS. I moved off of Toxic because I thought his attitude for asking a stupidly simple question was townie and his responses were null so I moved on.<br><br>I'm just done the arguing though. I'm not going to vote Toxic today so I'm not going to bother arguing anymore. Arguing between two others in wall posts are anti-town: barely anyone reads them and there are more than one scum in the game anyhow. I've been slowly trying to die the walls down but there has been no relent.<br><br>I plan to give reads late late tonight or tomorrow and respond to a few then. I'm just out of steam."}

As with several players thusfar, he made a list of reads in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4454299#p4454299\" class=\"postlink\">176</a>, but didn't explain them.  This is a pet peeve of mine, because it doesn't contribute to the town, but I'll let it slide since it's all over the place and therefore not necessarily indicative of alignment.  However, Sherlock also voted for Radelle without giving any kind of explanation other than gut.  This is scummy, but since he admitted to being new to online Mafia I'm going to let it slide for now.

He continues this in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463890#p4463890\" class=\"postlink\">262</a>.  His arguments for how people are playing match his reads in 176, so at least he's consistent.<br><br>A lot of his playstyle seems to be based on feeling.  For example, his gut reads, and his talk about Sable's 57 and Tommy's 115 feeling genuine.  I'm going to assume this playstyle is a holdover from playing mafia in real life.  This is also why he claims to have a town read on Trollie, saying that Trollie seems to be genuine about what he's saying, but is making weak arguments (see <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463890#p4463890\" class=\"postlink\">post 262</a>).  All in all I get a town feel from Sherlock, since he does seem to be trying to contribute, and the only slips that I can see (his gut reads) are easily explained as playstyle.

Or at least that's where I'm going to say RVS is over for him, because I still can't tell where RVS stopped.  There should be an announcement or something.  Anyway, that is when he in his argument against CD about whether CD is scum or an idiot.  His arguments with CD are very short posts that are based largely on assumptions (\"I'm assuming CD is new town because of his play\", when he could have just glanced at CD's wiki to see how many games CD's played) and game theory.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442557#p4442557\" class=\"postlink\">62</a> he rightly calls out toxictaipan for fishing for explanations for why Sable is scum instead of just doing it himself.  This is toxic's so-called reaction test, which I'll look at more when I do my read on toxic.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4445512#p4445512\" class=\"postlink\">86</a> Abaddon says he doesn't buy toxic's explanation for the test, but doesn't push him.  This confuses me.  He had is vote on Radelle ever since the RVS, but didn't put it on toxic, even though he had a much stronger reason to vote for toxic (or at least, Abaddon hadn't explained his post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440248#p4440248\" class=\"postlink\">19</a> vote on Radelle beyond saying that Radelle's post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4439999#p4439999\" class=\"postlink\">15</a> was fake and overdoing it).  This is unusual behavior, especially considering the fact that he also left his RVS vote on toxic while arguing against Radelle.<br><br>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448870#p4448870\" class=\"postlink\">121</a> he does the \"post your reads on everyone\" thing, and while he gives some sort of explanation for some of his reads, they're all weak (for example, his read on me, which he says is \"positive behavior.\"  What does that mean?).  Fortunately his scumreads are explained more fully, but I'd prefer to see specific examples.  He goes on to argue against Tommy's case on Parama and arguing with pretty much everyone over the next few days.  After November 2nd his activity takes a nosedive.<br><br>Abaddon's play is mostly laconic.  He doesn't go into long arguments about things, and seems to be poking his head here, there, everywhere, making short statements about everything.  He also talks a lot about playstyle and game theory, which is nice, but shouldn't get in the way of analysis.  He does seem to have a slight relation to Parama.  He defends Parama against Tommy in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4449024#p4449024\" class=\"postlink\">post 123</a> by arguing against Tommy's case.  His actions in conjunction with Parama during the RVS also seem cooperative, but that's mostly a feeling, and I feel hypocritical even mentioning it.<br><br>Null/Leaning Scum<br><br><br>-----<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">absta101</span><br><br>(note that because I am currently pissed at absta this will probably be harsher than it would have been under normal circumstances)<br><br>Replaced Parama in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450164#p4450164\" class=\"postlink\">post 127</a>.  His <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452192#p4452192\" class=\"postlink\">post 157</a> consists mostly of agree/don't agree statements, and isn't very useful.  As with several other players, he has a problem of not explaining his reads until questioned, and frankly you shouldn't have to be asked.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4458616#p4458616\" class=\"postlink\">post 200</a> he argues that Abbadon is faking <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4444871#p4444871\" class=\"postlink\">82</a>.  I don't necessarily buy that, because it may have just been bad phrasing on Abbadon's part.  Then absta does very little of note until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4467651#p4467651\" class=\"postlink\">post 294</a>, where he votes Cheery but doesn't give an explanation, instead asking Cheery to answer two questions.  Asking questions isn't an explanation for a vote.  It's scumhunting, sure, but I want reasons for votes.<br><br><br>Absta asks a lot of questions but gives very, very little substance.  Also, in post 200, he also acts like townie players shouldn't call out bad play if said bad play was in line with one of their own statements (player A and player B agree that player C is scummy, but B's argument is crap.  Even so, A can't call B out for crap arguments).  This is retarded, and absta should be flogged for saying it.  BAD PLAY IS BAD PLAY, and should be called out whenever it happens.  This makes me think that absta is new (plus his blank wiki and join date), so it may just be newbishness talking, but still.<br><br>Scum<br><br><br>-----<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cheery Dog</span><br><br>Opted not to join in the RVS, then voted for Abaddon for not voting Radelle while seeing her as scum, as noted above.  He says that Abaddon was likely intentionally leaving his vote off of Radelle for appearance's sake, but then doesn't really develop it any further and then drops it in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448174#p4448174\" class=\"postlink\">post 110</a>.  Then he votes for Parama for lurking (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448820#p4448820\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a>) after Parama already replaced out.  He has also repeatedly suggested that people lynch him for his playstyle  (for example, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4453457#p4453457\" class=\"postlink\">post 167</a>).

Then he votes Sable Tip, also calling him out for improperly attacking inactives.  His next post, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452439#p4452439\" class=\"postlink\">post 161</a>, attacks CD for coasting and not being very useful (this is something I also noted, see above), and votes for him.  He also complains about Sable \"chainsawing\" him in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4447832#p4447832\" class=\"postlink\">post 109</a>.  Deltabacon then argues back and forth for a bit with CD and his gallant defender Trollie.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4458814#p4458814\" class=\"postlink\">post 203</a> his attention shifts over to Trollie for defending CD.  Deltabacon argues that Trollie has been shifting his view on CD back and forth between town (defending him) and building a half-assed case against him.  Deltabacon later discounts the meta-defense for CD, saying that in previous games CD was more coherent in his posts, and continues to call Trollie out for defending CD with insufficient evidence.  He keeps hammering Trollie from then on.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4465162#p4465162\" class=\"postlink\">post 275</a> he again calls Trollie out for being inconsistent, citing his constant defense of CD while having him as a scumread.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4465915#p4465915\" class=\"postlink\">post 280</a> he makes what seems to me the most damning argument against Trollie.<br><br>Deltabacon has certainly been less active than some, but his posts are invariably substantive.

His biggest scumreads at this point are CD and Trollie, though he does not explain why until later, and then it's mostly just feeling.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4458707#p4458707\" class=\"postlink\">post 202</a> he posts an update on his spreadsheet and gives full explanations for his reads.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4459870#p4459870\" class=\"postlink\">post 218</a> he votes Trollie.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463937#p4463937\" class=\"postlink\">post 263</a> he unvotes, saying he buys Trollie's more recent statements as being town.  He latersays we should hold off on attacking CD until later, and says he doesn't really endorse any lynches at the moment.<br><br>I have mixed feelings about Jacob, mostly because his posts were largely insubstantial until 202 (even his 138 post with the spreadsheet was lacking, because it was essentially no different from listing reads without reasons).  Then post 202 happens, and he swings hard over to the townie side.  Unfortunately all of his posts are based around his spreadsheets and contain remarkably little analysis.  I would have a more positive read on Jacob if he gave more posts like 202.  Then again, he currently does not want to lynch anyone, which is strange, given he's repeatedly expressed scumreads on CD and Trollie, and didn't explain in detail why they changed.

She continues working on toxic through to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442842#p4442842\" class=\"postlink\">post 68</a>, also questioning toxic's reaction test, and getting into a big semantic argument with a lot of players over either/or and game theory.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4444842#p4444842\" class=\"postlink\">post 80</a> she gets into a pointless fight with toxic over who gets credit for ending RVS, and says toxic is overthinking where his vote goes, and says Jason is town. Later Radelle calls out Parama for being active in other threads but not this one, and argues with Abaddon over whether the town is justified in arguing against bad arguments, even if said bad argument is against someone you find scummy.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4446523#p4446523\" class=\"postlink\">post 97</a> she votes for Abaddon, arguing that he is somehow not being aggressive enough in going after her (?) while attacking other players.  This is what Abaddon calls a strawman argument.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450509#p4450509\" class=\"postlink\">post 131</a> she lays down her case against Abaddon while responding to Abaddon's argument against her.  Her argument mostly rests on Abaddon being entirely reactionary in his responses and not seriously pursuing his argument against Radelle.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450743#p4450743\" class=\"postlink\">post 135</a> she defends her argument against Abaddon (which as toxic points out only used posts prior to 97 and ignored all subsequent posts).  This defense continues in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4451124#p4451124\" class=\"postlink\">post 142</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4455120#p4455120\" class=\"postlink\">post 184</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4463623#p4463623\" class=\"postlink\">post 259</a>.  This defense is also a sort of passive attack against toxic, who was her biggest critic.  She has been MIA since November 7th.<br><br>Radelle has been on the defense ever since 97, going over the same stupid points about the timing over her argument and whether toxic is scummy for his reasoning concerning Radelle's argument being scummy.  While I agree with toxic that Radelle should have been quicker in explaining her argument and should have used more recent information in it, this entire argument makes my head hurt, so instead I'm going to focus on the fact that Radelle hasn't posted anything original (repeating old points doesn't count) since 97, and therefore has stalled scumhunting.

In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452318#p4452318\" class=\"postlink\">post 160</a> he quotes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448820#p4448820\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a> as CD's scummiest post, saying that CD is illogical and lacking good judgment, but then makes a big deal about how players like that always turn out to be town.  His <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very next post</span>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452515#p4452515\" class=\"postlink\">post 162</a>, says that there is no good case on CD, exclusively using assumptions on CD's playstyle and meta as a defense.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4453341#p4453341\" class=\"postlink\">Post 166</a> basically says that it's OK for townies to forego scumhunting.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4457568#p4457568\" class=\"postlink\">post 196</a>, he votes for Radelle, having never made a single argument ever against Radelle, and saying that he's explained the reads he felt were important (when he obviously hadn't, given his vote). <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460503#p4460503\" class=\"postlink\">Post 229</a> did a fantastic job of not answering my question about what his reads meant, all the while saying that he thought CD was scum, but that there was no reason to see CD as scum.  Once I finished picking up the pieces of my shattered psyche and went on, I hit <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460750#p4460750\" class=\"postlink\">post 233</a>, which basically reiterates that the case against CD is bad.  After that he gets in a brief discussion with Jacob over how Jacob's spreadsheet worked, until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4464417#p4464417\" class=\"postlink\">post 266</a>, when he digs back into his meta defense of CD, again insisting that there is no good argument against CD, and claiming that it is his personal crusade against all of MafiaScum's \u201cfaulty logic.\u201d  Note that in all this time Trollie has never even mentioned Radelle.  Then, finally, in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4467469#p4467469\" class=\"postlink\">post 291</a>, he lists a few words that he mistakes for being a case against Radelle.  Later he says that he has a null read on CD (without giving a reason).<br><br>Trollie is by far the scummiest player thusfar, doing his best to both buddy and distance CD, and failing miserably at both. His defense of CD is entirely based on meta, acting like it gives CD free reign to be as scummy as he damn well pleases, because all of MafiaScum must be wrong and that meta must be an invariably solid defense for everything anyone ever does.  But in my mind even this pales in comparison to his utterly unexplained vote on Radelle, when he insisted that he had explained all of his important reads.  I absolutely refuse to believe that he didn't think his read on Radelle wasn't important <span style=\"font-style: italic\">when his vote was on Radelle</span>.  Trollie is completely, obviously, blatantly<br><br>Scum<br><br><br>-----<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tommy</span><br><br>Voted for Parama in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440469#p4440469\" class=\"postlink\">post 37</a>, in response to Parama's unexplained read on Radelle and misinterpretation of CD's case against Abaddon. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440772#p4440772\" class=\"postlink\">Post 50</a> continues this case against Parama, and includes Parama's unwillingness to defend his votes.  Tommy also says he has a town read on CD because CD admitted to maybe being mistaken (this isn't a towntell, it's just someone being waffly). <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4443178#p4443178\" class=\"postlink\">Post 75</a> is another rejection of toxic's reaction test.  Tommy afterwards puts out a few feelers against Jason, Jacob, and Sable, and calls out Deltabacon for being inactive, though retracts that after a while.  Then in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4448651#p4448651\" class=\"postlink\">post 115</a> Tommy lays out his full case against Parama (the one Abaddon dismissed).  The arguments are based mostly on the fact that Parama didn't do anything at all useful throughout his entire stay, but as I mentioned above, I see them as mostly just Parama being bad at the game.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4453748#p4453748\" class=\"postlink\">post 169</a> Tommy calls Trollie town without giving an explanation, and sides with Deltabacon's case against CD.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4459924#p4459924\" class=\"postlink\">post 219</a> Tommy calls absta out for supposedly making a bad case against Abaddon, then assumes that absta has ulterior motives.  He doesn't explain why the case against Abaddon is bad, he just says it is.  He does this again in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4461029#p4461029\" class=\"postlink\">post 242</a>, saying absta's argument was made up, but not presenting any evidence for it.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4462446#p4462446\" class=\"postlink\">post 252</a> he unvotes absta (he had never voted for absta), even though absta was his strongest scumread, and switches over to Radelle.  <br><br>Tommy makes broad statements, like \u201cthis is good, this is bad, this is bad because {assumption}\u201d, none of which are very useful.  Admittedly Tommy's been active, but activity isn't a good measure of someone's alignment.  I am annoyed by his lack of explanation for why he thinks the way he does about things (why is Trollie town, for example).  I am also annoyed by how in 252 he dropped his biggest scumread (absta) in favor of Radelle, saying that Radelle was one of the only three lynch choices.  That's blatantly retarded.  As of this post we're still about 6 days away from the deadline, there's still plenty of time to make cases for people that we think are scummiest.  Why then does Tommy want to begrudgingly hop on a wagon so early?  This is just bad.  Tommy is<br><br>Scum<br><br><br>-----<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">toxictaipan</span><br><br>Voted for me in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440397#p4440397\" class=\"postlink\">post 32</a>, saying that I should have noticed that RVS was over by then.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4441014#p4441014\" class=\"postlink\">post 53</a> he sides with Abaddon in the CD vs Abaddon argument, saying that scum wouldn't argue against someone without voting for them since there is no motivation to do so.  Toxic also points out that his earlier statements, which Parama quoted in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\" class=\"postlink\">post 47</a>, didn't contradict, and continues his argument that I should have been more useful and not made a random vote so late.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442531#p4442531\" class=\"postlink\">post 61</a> toxic makes his famous reaction test. Apparently the point of the reaction test was to see who would jump on him for making such a post, implying that those people were cautious town.  Starting in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4442897#p4442897\" class=\"postlink\">post 73</a> he gets into his stupid argument with Radelle about who gets credit for getting us out of RVS, or in what way RVS should end, or some other nonsense that is essentially a game theory discussion.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4445409#p4445409\" class=\"postlink\">post 85</a> toxic explains his reaction test, saying that smart or cautious townies would act like Abaddon did (calling out toxic's bluff).  He also calls out Sable for having Radelle as a null read when Sable's three scumreads all listed Radelle as scum.  Later he states town reads on Abaddon and Tommy, thanks to their reactions to his test.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450565#p4450565\" class=\"postlink\">post 133</a> toxic says that the alignment of players responding to his reaction test is irrelevant, it's the reactions themselves that are important.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450621#p4450621\" class=\"postlink\">post 134</a> he points out that Radelle's case against Abaddon exclusively relies on posts before 97 and ignores all subsequent posts, in addition to waiting to post a reason for the vote.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4450838#p4450838\" class=\"postlink\">post 139</a> he elaborates on this reasoning and votes for Radelle.  For the next little while he continues his back and forth with Radelle.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4452071#p4452071\" class=\"postlink\">post 154</a> he argues against Tommy's case on Parama, while continuing his argument with Radelle.  In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4470806#p4470806\" class=\"postlink\">post 317</a> he says he doesn't like the wagon on Trollie, claiming that he read Trollie's ISO and found his reaction to CD reasonable (he didn't respond to the argument against Trollie's unexplained vote on Radelle).<br><br>While I absolutely love the fact that toxic is talkative and explains most of his thoughts when appropriate, I can't say that I have a town read on him.  I don't like toxic's argument that Sable should have seen Radelle as town in post 85.  I'm assuming what he's going for is \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend\u201d, and that Radelle should have been a town read, but that's just bad, because it requires you to ignore your own read and base your reads on what your suspects think.  I'm guessing that this is also why he didn't mention the argument against Trollie's vote on Radelle.  I also don't think his reaction test is useful at all, since he says both that alignment doesn't matter and that the test helps you figure out who is town.  That's idiotic, but it's not a scumtell, since I can't imagine scum coming up with such an elaborate ruse for doing post 61.  Then again, I agree with him that Radelle should have been more forthcoming in her reasons for voting for Abaddon and should have used more recent evidence when she finally did explain it.  Overall I don't really have any strong feelings about toxic's alignment.<br><br>Null"}

The reaction test, as stated, has very little to do with Sable Tip's alignment, or with which alignment Toxic assigned to him.

The reaction test was for peoples' reactions to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Toxic's</span> actions, not Sable Tip's post.

However, I want to see if our thoughts corroborate. What are you seeing?\" or perhaps, \"I've went back over his post and I still don't see anything. I'm calling your bluff.\" (Though I have a feeling the general reaction from the town was less, \"I've went back over his post,\" and more, \"I'm calling your bluff anyway.\") I expected some comments about having my case made for me, but I thought a reasonable town would try to work with me a little bit without handing me a case -- especially from those who had a town read on me. It was well within reason to put the burden of proof on me and still have this work, but I digress.<br><br>I figured scum would be more apt to just blurt out what they saw wrong with the post, looking for approval and hoping to get easy town points. Alternatively, I was expecting scum to be critical of my approach without much consideration of what Sable Tip's post actually says. Why pretend to go scum hunting when you can just attack a player for his strange approach to the situation and get away with it? The drawback is that you have to take this with a grain of salt because a townie that doesn't know any better could easily do these same things, but nothing is ever concrete in scum hunting. Still worth it to see who does what, though. I was trying to get everyone's reaction to both Sable Tip's post and my own, though I mostly got the latter. Regardless, I still think there's a bit of good information here we'll be able to use.</div></div></div><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I do not buy this though, there is NO WAY that post was a reaction test.  Maybe it was retrospectively one, but there are so many better ways to reaction test than this.  The question \u201cdoes anybody else see\u2026\u201d means either (1) that he wants us to say, \u201cno, show us\u201d or (2) that he has a good reason to refrain info, or (3) that he isn\u2019t actually sure there is something off.  SO I have a few problems with this.  First, if this was a reaction test, as he claims, then why is he able to so perfectly explain what is wrong below?  If what he says below is true, then why would he find it scummy for someone to say \u201cyes, blab la bla\u201d  Second, If Toxic wants to reaction test based on sable tip\u2019s post, the way to do it would be to get sable tip to say something showing that he did not consider the issue that Toxic is bringing up.  Something about his parama read, or even telling Sable tip what is wrong and seeing if Sable tip has a bad response to that.</span><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: part3</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">As for Sable Tip... Doesn't anyone find it odd that his 3 suspicions (Cheery Dog, Abaddon, and Parama) are all suspicious of Radelle (to varying degrees), but he lists Radelle as a neutral read? If I had any confidence whatsoever in my reads, and all 3 of my suspicions were expressing doubt over the same player, that player would be pretty far up my town reads list. I'd expect him to list Radelle as leaning town at the very least. He's not being consistent with his reads, and that's scummy. Also, he hasn't really provided <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> Parama and Abaddon are scummy, unless I am to take it that being aggressive and harsh is somehow scummy. <br><br>Another thing that bothered me was his reference to Parama's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4440739#p4440739\">Post 47</a>. I can't tell if Sable Tip is trying to buddy me here or what. That part of his post altogether doesn't make much sense to me. It seems like he\u2019s trying to use it as a lame excuse to vote Parama, but at the same time it reads sort of like a defense so I\u2019m wary of buddying. Maybe I'm biased here because it's something concerning me, but it really rubbed me the wrong way.</div></div></div> </div></blockquote><br><br>K, I kept reading the ISO: Toxic reads fairly town except for this one issue (the reaction test).

He's apparently read through Radelle's ISO, but nothing seems to be comment-worthy as to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> Radelle is town. However, he does have the ability to comment on details of one specific post by Abaddon. It doesn't add up that he's read Radelle's whole ISO, yet only uses one post as evidence for Abaddon being scum. Of course, this could be a play style issue, but the way this post was made seemed methodical, and it was like absta was intentionally not being transparent about his read of Radelle. The actual attack on Abaddon here makes no sense to me as well. He's accusing Abaddon's post of being \"fake bs,\" but nothing in his accusation seems to imply that Abaddon is anything but wrong in his opinion of scumhunting.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460419#p4460419\" class=\"postlink\">post 225</a>, absta101 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Radelle</span><blockquote><div><cite>Radelle wrote:</cite>@Absta: The game hasn't completed yet, to be honest.

For those who suspect Radelle, here's a good reason to suspect absta as a partner.

Interestingly, he votes for the same reason some people, specifically delta, are voting me.  That he feels Abb should not have defended a scum read of his.  I, of course, disagree, because bad arguments prevent scumhunting and allow opportunistic scum to push a mislynch, but it seems I am alone on that belief in this game (oh ,except for that Abbadon feels the same way but for some reason is voting me because of it.)  I would say this looks genuine, but again, there is a chance that absta noticed how much Parama and Abbadon were buddying and therefore chose to bus hard.  I don\u2019t think I agree with that theory, but it is a possibility.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4460358#p4460358\" class=\"postlink\">post 223</a>, Abaddon wrote:</cite>Slandaar, just because my scumhunting is not as one-dimensional as yours doesn't mean you get to apply your standards to me.<br><br>Quite frankly, I felt Radelle's early vote on Toxic for a nonsense reason was pretty obvious to anyone with experience, and you don't get Townpoints for pointing out the obvious.

It is slightly scummy that absta101 hasn't since been able to explain why he did it, but then I guess he's had quite a bit of explaining to do.

You're right that this wasn't a scum-tell and TheTrollie was wrong. I guess if I had an overall scummy view of TheTrollie, then his accusation in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4483068#p4483068\" class=\"postlink\">post 518</a> would count against him, but since I feel he's town I read it more like over-excitedness.

Anyway, none of that matters much for now, because of this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4483593#p4483593\" class=\"postlink\">post 564</a>, TheTrollie wrote:</cite>Im a fucking 1-shot Vig.</div></blockquote><br>Dammit, Slandaar. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Everybody off the Trollie wagon now</span>.<br><br>The biggest scum-tell you've dropped all game, absta101, is that you posted several times between the claim and your unvote.

Your reasons are unsubstantiated because even if you legitimately believe them, they rely on gut assumptions.  I do not make unfounded assumptions.  I don't do gut.  I analyze evidence presented in the game thread only.  I accept meta as part of defense only because there is widespread agreement that it is legitimate.  I completely ignore gut, because it's impossible to argue against.  If you want to change my mind on something, you have to argue in a way that I can agree with.  You haven't, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">can't</span> in this case because your assumptions <span style=\"font-style: italic\">are not based on game-related evidence</span>.  Like I said, that's the sort of thing that made Trollie look suspicious at first, and you're doing the same thing to defend him.  I'm a little more willing to accept it from you just because you're new to online mafia, but my patience is very limited.  Your specific defense of Trollie was:<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4483262#p4483262\" class=\"postlink\">post 524</a>, _Sherlock_ wrote:</cite>I know it's the worst timing, but I'm not going to have time to make a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">good</span> case for why Trollie is town. I can sum it up. Most of it is stuff that involves his motivations for posting, as a lot of his posts really don't make sense from a \"I'm trying to trick the town into thinking I'm town\" thought process. He's an experienced player; as scum, he would be putting more of an effort in to make himself look town. There's also the fact that I really don't like his wagon.</div></blockquote><br><br>There is no evidence for any of this.  It's 100% gut and assumption.  This exact same defense can be used to defend literally every player who does anything, ever, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">it will be just as bad, every time</span>.  And as I said above, it's honestly impossible to argue against.  Any attempt to do so would just turn into a theory discussion about how scum, experienced or not, would likely react under certain stimuli, as in my little exchange with Trollie over this.  If it's gut, I can't magically make you feel differently.  You've already seen all the arguments and tossed them aside because you don't think they feel right.  You don't like the wagon.  How do I argue against that?  \"No, Sherlock, you really <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do</span> like the wagon!\"  Do you see what I'm getting at?  This is pet peeve number 2 for me:  people mistaking gut for actual analysis."}

They are very stream-of-consciousness so sorry about that:<br><br>CD-thinking viging CD or Abb.  Their quarrel early D1 makes both being scum unlikely. <br>-definitely dont want him in LYLO even if town, and with the hype over CD there is no reason for mafia to kill him.  This alone might be enough to warrant the CD vig.<br>- most ppl expressed interest in directing my shot to CD<br>- A CD flip would help us analyze the wagon that was on me. <br>-CD may not get any more readable. rather let town use the lynch on someone we can discuss more.<br>-he picks up on arguments very opportunistically (ie. parama and there was one other)<br>- post #167 is very scummy, with his \"you can string me up...\" paragraph.  Very scummy post<br>- his adamant stance on me is very strange because it stems from me wanting to gain town cred with his lynch.  I showed him why that made no sense, he agreed it made no sense but still wouldnt budge.   even after my claim he didnt budge.  That being said, scum cheery knows absta is town and doesnt switch over to that wagon.  maybe trying to gain town cred when absta is lynched? maybe trying to stay on the wagon of claimed PR?  idk, this is weird as scum.<br>-did more meta on CD, I am starting to think my defense was pre-mature, he is a lot derpier than in some of his other games.  Also makes references to his own townie-ness a lot more here <br>-If Cd flips town, Delta hopped on an easy target and then once I started in and recieved votes of my own, delta jumps on and becomes most vocal.<br>-CD jumps on right , then Abbadon<br><br>Side-note: need Kinetic action on D2 desperately, as I go through this stuff, I realize that Radelle is so crucial in this picture. <br>-not worth vigging Kinetic because it might be super easy to get a read on that slot once he starts participating<br><br><br>Abb-i have explained the scum-read, Absta and his town read slandaar start a Abbadon counterwagon.  worry is that scumSlandaar is trying to gain town cred by preventing Absta lynch and at the same time directing our D2 mislynch<br>- total lurker<br><br>Side note: since Absta flipped Town, anyone against my lynch from the begining and on absta probtown<br><br>sidenote: CD and Abaddon are the two ppl still on my wagon in VC 1.14<br><br>Abadd wasnt active, slandaar and town absta on abaddon<br><br>any other good vigs?<br><br>_Sherlock_ - TOWN dont see him actively starting the absta wagon while there is already a huge town wagon.  I understand him staying off of a town wagon, but starting a new one rather than going with one already in existance makes no sense as scum<br><br>Tommy - probtown - i like his analysis in post #454.  i dont like that he doesnt support my abaddon wagon.  Tommy's been giving me a lot of trouble from the beginning.  Whenever logic says scum on him, my gut says town, and whenever logic says town, gut says scum.  I think this will be easy to clarify as we see more flips though, since he is actually doing quite a lot of work in his posts.<br><br>Kwll - unsure - i had a gut town read at first but now not sure, he does switch from me to absta fairly quick, think that might be more likely town but idk, have to look at where that is in relation to my claim.  I feel that most of the reasons to kill him would be the same as some of the reasons to kill CD, but I also think Kwll may get easier to read as the game goes on, and I think his flip would be less helpful than CD's flip.<br><br> JacobSavage - town - His one scummy thing is starting the wagon then hopping right off of it as it gains steam. overall though, i was pretty confident he was town, and I think his flip would be way less usefull than other's flips, plus hes a pretty solid town read so if hes town he might get NKed, definitely not killing him.  <br><br>Idiotking - null - the only reason I think he is town is because of that one post where he calls everyone scummy.  That seems likely to come from town, but can also be scum throwing shit at the walls to see what sticks.  Hes certainly not the best kill target but i think D2 needs more Idiotking examination.<br><br>Absta-conftown-DEAD<br><br>CD- already discussed in full<br><br>Abadd- already discussed<br><br>Slandaar - Needs to be a focus of D2, he weilds a lot of town conrol for no apparent reason.  Dont trust him.<br><br>Kinetic - Need to keep him alive to get info from him D2.  unfortunately we have no idea what his play will be like but its not worth vigging someone before we know what their deal is.<br><br>Delta - I need to review delta.  I have only one reason to think he is town and that may not have been a good one.  If I vig CD though, we will get info on delta.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Got lots of places to go for D2.  vig of CD is best because<br>(1) good chance scum<br>(2) this is where town wanted to direct my kill (including absta who is now conftown)<br>(3) Given CD's posts, and voting patern (like not unvoting me ever D1), even a townCD is probably a detriment to town<br>(4) CD flip will be relatively informative.<br><br>Reasons not to vig CD<br>(1) Scum is going to expect CD vig.<br>not seen many scum docs in this forum.  <br><br>k vig CD"}

I got a minor town read from the way he bluntly showed an opposite view from me as far as Trollie's alignment. This view remains consistent throughout Day 1, as he stay's on Trollie's ass to the end. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> The sense I got from his Post #321 made me feel that he's actually going through his reads with some serious effort. This makes me feel that he's either highly detailed scum putting effort into faking each of his reads in detail, or he's town. My only samples are one recently finished game and games from years ago, but his max posting quality seems to be higher as town, similar to his posting here. Along the same line, there's Post #331. As he claimed that his post took two days to assemble, it's less likely that he took two days faking a huge post when he hasn't had a history of doing that before as scum. It's more likely that he's doing things the same way he was doing them in his recently-finished game and making a legitimate read list. Someone mentioned when he made the post that he has way too many scum reads in his post to be scum, and I tend to agree with that. Add to that that he listed no one I see as potential scum as a town read, which either means he's not supporting his partners or he's town (or I'm wrong... nah). I disagreed with most of his reads, but he's been consistent with them since the reads post and seems to genuinely believe every point he makes. The fact that he's willing to put a huge post out there in the first place is also a slight towntell, as from a scum PoV, it creates connections between him and every other player. Him showing low confidence in some reads, such as at the end of his read on Abaddon, shows that he's posting all reads that come to his mind instead of finding what's good and making it fit into a read. In my experience, scum are less likely to gather reads in this way because they already know what they want their reads to be, while town are still trying to find theirs. His read on Delta seems to be mostly based on the fact that he attacked Trollie constantly, something terribly wrong, but not something I see Mafia basing a town read on, considering that he wanted Trollie-not-mafia dead. He's too confident about his read on Trollie to be faking it and expect a good reaction to it later, knowing he's not mafia. I also am a fan of the fact that he types up pretty big walls on some players just to end up giving them a null read. It again shows thought. That about wraps up why I got a huge town read on Idiot right after his reads post. The cherry on top of Idiot-town is his Neighbor claim. A two-man neighborhood is pretty likely to have two town, and Jacob's comment about forgetting to check the QT means that if there's scum in the Neighborhood, it's most likely Jacob, not Idiot. His confusion around his read on me is a town tell because, like I've said before, people are less likely to take things step-by-step like that as scum than as town. <span class=\"noboldsig\">TOWN</span><br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:80%\"></div><br><br>This is all I can get done tonight, sorry. I'll try to get more finished tomorrow and upcoming days.

I have some issues though with his large post (#331), as many of his reads are just... bad. He makes 7 solid \"scum\" reads, but so far 3 of those (Tommy, Absta/Parama, CD) have been confirmed town. Additionally, his other three scum reads (this slot, Slan, Trollie) don't feel like solid scum reads to me. The only scum read he has that I agree with is Abaddon. That is distressing, and I'm curious what the next couple pages reveal about more of his play.<br><br>Sable/Kwill: This read is almost solely based on Sable's early game play. #109 was a great post. This read is most likely to change though as I haven't seen many good posts yet from this slot and it is my weakest town read right now.<br><br>Neutral: Trollie, Slandaar (leaning town), Sherlock, Jacob<br><br>Trollie: I haven't quite caught up, but I think I remember him claiming vig. This might change my read eventually. At this point, IK's #222 is a good staple on Trollie's play at this point. As well, I really dislike #232 from Trollie. Seems to be an argument that he just... doesn't need to make. Maybe an IIOA tell. Delta's #265 is on point with how I feel about Trollie. However, despite IK and Delta's attacks on him, I'm hesitant to put a scum tag on him yet. His arguments and defense makes enough sense that I'm not sold on him being scum yet.<br><br>Slandaar: Shitposting #146, 147, 149, and #198. Seemed to be actively lurking. Comes back with a vengeance in #270 (my notes literally state \"HOLY SHIT, STOP THE PRESSES, SLANDAAR MADE A NON-SHIT POST\"). Makes another good posting at #290. Probably most \"townie\" person sitting on my neutral row right now.<br><br>Jacob: I simply do not have a lot of notes on him. His only post that is in my notes is he made a list in #202. His only other post that I made a comment on was #304, and that it was a bad idea.<br><br>Sherlock/Jason: This slot distresses me the most though. #211 echos some of what I feel about Toxic #67, but comes to the opposite conclusion. Specifically: \"I really don't like toxic's Post #67. He's completely avoiding the topic with Abaddon. He also bothered to comment on many other things before that. However, if he actually does end up commenting on it and has a decent reason to stall, he's probably town.\" #262 he makes a reads post, and so far his posts have been well-written and defended, but his reads are nearly exactly opposite mine at this point. Specifically:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kinetic's Notes wrote:</cite>Kinetic's Reads as of #262<br>Confirmed: Tommy, Parama/absta, CD, Radelle/Kinetic<br>Town: Delta, Sable/kwill, IK<br>Neutral: Trollie (leaning scum), Slandaar, Sherlock, Jacob<br>Scum: Toxic, Abaddon<br><br>Comparably, Sherlock has toxic/Jacob as strong town (S/N), Tom/Troll town (CT/N), Somewhat town Ab/Sable (S/T), while scum reads on this slot, CD (CT/CT), and neutral to scum on Absta, Delta, IK, and Slan (CT/T/T/N). That is nearly perfect variance. We agree mostly on Slandaar and Sable-kwill, but everything else is far off.</div></blockquote><br><br>Since then, my read on Slandaar has moved toward leaning town, but based on #318, Sherlock's reads haven't changed. He does not comment on Slandaar though.<br><br>Overall, I like Sherlock's posts, but I'm disagreeing with his conclusions.<br><br>Scum reads: Toxic and Abaddon<br><br>These reads are actually strongly tied together. At first, I have issues with Toxic's #53 and #67. Both seem very very scummy. Eventually Toxic #85 is somewhat redeeming. At this point, Abaddon even gets town points for #86 and 88 in my book for calling Toxic on his shitty logic.<br><br>Moving forward, Abaddon's #106 bugs me for calling something a strawman argument that wasn't technically a strawman, and then claiming that opinions are not something that could be defended against. In point in fact, Radelle's issue here was very much a meta argument, not an in game one, but nonetheless Abaddon fight he should not defend against it at all.<br><br>Abaddon #118 then really rubs me the wrong way for its strong defense on Toxic. This follows with Toxic #134 where Toxic appears to chainsaw into Radelle's attack into Abaddon's play. Radelle's #135/Toxic #139 also shows a rather weird argument. Specifically from my notes:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>#135/139 -(This Slot)/Toxic - Toxic asks for evidence, but is pushing for only a certain type of evidence. He's taking the initial vote, which being an early vote really doesn't have to have too much more than a gut reaction, and trying to twist it into a later vote, which certainly would require more evidence. Except, Radelle has provided some evidence to now support her initial gut, but because it isn't exactly as toxic wants it, Toxic ignores it. This reeks of a double chainsaw, scum-buddies attacking each other's wagons... The problem with that theory being both players are attacking Radelle. I don't think that's a double chainsaw technically. Although Radelle's play isn't the best, I'm finding Toxic/Abaddon's attacks to be falling flat.</div></blockquote><br><br>Toxic's #145 is a good post overall, but reinforces some of the buddying tells between him and Abaddon. Toxic's #154 shows a complete change of tone that he has used for the whole game when addressing Tommy. My own belief was that Tommy's case via #115 on Parama was more a note of Parama's bad play, rather than Parama's scummyness, but Toxic appears to be one of the few players giving Tommy's case a possible chance at success.<br><br>I don't like Toxic's #191 proficiency argument. I didn't like his reaction test when I first saw it, but his insistence that, obviously, only people who can read them accurately can understand his reaction test and the reactions he generated with them. Bugs me that even this far into the game he keeps repeating that point. IK's attack on this was fairly intuitive (that the reactions don't measure scumminess), but Toxic's response is pretty much \"Well I can find scumminess in them\".<br><br>Toxic's #277 insistence on this \"conflict\" is annoying, repetitive, and ultimately useless. Even if we take his word that there is a conflict, it doesn't indicate scumminess.<br><br>So that's what I have for now, hopefully that helps everyone who was waiting for something form me. I will try to find some more time later to pick up the rest of the read-through."}

Moreover, do you understand why Kinetic calls this \"baiting;\" do you see the motive he believes you are acting off of?  Finally, do you have a problem with Kinetic waiting until he has read the full thread to vote, or only with the fact that Kinetic labels your question as \"baiting?\"</div></blockquote><br>No, I was being sarcastic when I asked why he wasn't voting for me. I had already caught him not voting for a scum read. Also, you provided him that, \"belief,\" of my motives. When I questioned him about it, he couldn't explain what I had to gain. He says he's answered all my questions, but this one remains unanswered -- and it's arguably the most important factor regarding the, \"baiting,\" issue. So, no, I don't see it, because it's not his belief. It's yours.<br><br>Normally I wouldn't have a problem with a replacement waiting to catch up before voting. However, this is different. I don't understand what he's waiting for. If he hadn't provided any content, was still way behind on catching up, and didn't have a clue what was going on, then I could see it. But he's already provided his views on the game and declared some strong scum reads. You've been reading his posts. Do you honestly see any scenario where Kinetic doesn't end up voting for me? I was a major scum read of his for the first half of the game, and he believes I'm still currently acting scummy. Do you think he really believes there is going to be some hidden gem in the middle of the game that will totally change his mind about that?<br><br>There is no trap, there is no bait. I'm not trying to trick him into voting someone else. My point is, I think it is (and has been since the beginning) pretty obvious that Kinetic will end up voting for me when all is said and done, and I have nothing to gain from it. That's why the bait reference makes literally no sense. He's procrastinating on having to vote for his top scum read, and he's trying to leave his options wide open. If he changes his mind about me, or becomes more suspicious of another player, he can always change his vote. There's no logical reason for why he needs to wait to vote."}

I <br><br>also have difficulty with his jokes (for example, did you actually not read the thread, Thor, <br><br>or was that a joke?), but that's obviously not scummy.  I think I'm just going to wait and <br><br>watch more of his play.  Or at least wait until I can examine his play in the context of <br><br>Abaddon's play.  I would like to point out though that he's right, nobody has made an argument <br><br>about Thor's actual play since he replaced in.  They just want to go after him for his slot.  <br><br>That's fine and all, Abaddon was scummy, but you can't really say Thor's deflecting anything <br><br>when nothing has been firmly said against him.<br><br>Sherlock is most likely not scum, almost completely due to Trollie's claim that he isn't one-<br><br>shot.  The only way I can see for Sherlock to still be scum is if he had just decided to <br><br>protect Trollie for some reason or another (maybe just to irritate the town or something).  <br><br>Even then though, it would not make sense for him to be against Trollie shooting on N1 (unless <br><br>that was just a front, but then things are getting way too convoluted; he'd have to be faking <br><br>opposition to something that would directly benefit him and was being actively supported by <br><br>the town, all to build town props somehow).  I think Sherlock is best left alone for now.  If <br><br>he is scum, he is either a complete genius or a complete lunatic.<br><br>Kwll's play is still completely unreadable to me, as any new guy's play is.  I am still ok <br><br>with using him as a last resort for lynch, because as I've said before, we absolutely do not <br><br>want him around in LYLO.  I'd actually appreciate it if Trollie killed him, unless there's a <br><br>clearly better option.<br><br>Kinetic appears to have gotten into a big old slapfight with toxic.  Isn't this, like, the <br><br>fifth one of these toxic's been in this game?.  I get the feeling that toxic is kind of like <br><br>how I used to be, back when I got into arguments over ridiculous little things that lasted for <br><br>ages.  Anyway, I agree that regardless of whether Kinetic was correct in his read of toxic, he <br><br>should have had his vote on toxic if that was his strongest scumread.  I don't think it's <br><br>necessarily scummy, because he hadn't caught all the way up, but it is still something to <br><br>consider.  Then later he votes Thor after getting into his big thing with toxic, saying that <br><br>he was really waiting for his other major scumread to pop back in.<br><br>W... <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why?</span>  That's just... odd.

The fact that you're stalling is even scummier than anything else you've done. <br><br>You can straw man me and everyone else all you like, but the fact remains 5 people are voting for you. Even if you somehow assume that there are three scum, and all three are on you, at the minimum there are two townies voting you as well. We both know though that the likelihood of 3 scum on a single wagon is preposterous. Even if you assume I'm scum, and assume one of my \"buddies\" is on the wagon, that still means three townies are voting you. That is equal to the amount of people voting me, this all assuming your \"best case scenario\". <br><br>But we both know that isn't the case. Right now the \"numbers\" that you're so fond of show that the most likely scenario is IF there is scum on your wagon, at best it is one of your buddies hedging the best and voting you, putting 4 townies on your wagon at the worst. At best, there are currently 5 town holding you at lynch -1.

That's laughably bad.</div></blockquote><br><br>Lynch -1, regardless of \"hammer intent\" means you claim. That is how it has always been. The fact that you're stalling is even scummier than anything else you've done. <br><br>You can straw man me and everyone else all you like, but the fact remains 5 people are voting for you. Even if you somehow assume that there are three scum, and all three are on you, at the minimum there are two townies voting you as well. We both know though that the likelihood of 3 scum on a single wagon is preposterous. Even if you assume I'm scum, and assume one of my \"buddies\" is on the wagon, that still means three townies are voting you. That is equal to the amount of people voting me, this all assuming your \"best case scenario\". <br><br>But we both know that isn't the case. Right now the \"numbers\" that you're so fond of show that the most likely scenario is IF there is scum on your wagon, at best it is one of your buddies hedging the best and voting you, putting 4 townies on your wagon at the worst. At best, there are currently 5 town holding you at lynch -1. Meaning, there are only 2-3 members of the town NOT on your wagon, in the most likely scenario.<br><br>Under this scenario, I'm not even LOOKING at the people voting on me.<br><br>Frankly, if you were town and there were ANY scum not voting for you right now, they would have given an intent to hammer, just to stop this charade of you stalling for more time.

If he believes me that I'm town, then we also know for certain that the three remaining scum are Slandaar, Sherlock and kwll in this highly unlikely scenario, but I digress.<br><br>In the highly likely chance that Trollie hits scum, the town enters Day 3 with at most 3 scum remaining, an active Vig, 3 \"undecideds\" in the remaining players from {Slandaar, Sherlock, Kinetic, or kwll} and only 3 of {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa and IK} because the scum cannot kill from the \"Undecided Group\" or lose their shield. Thus leaving pretty much 2 Town within {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK} that are still alive, and Trollie is Vig in this scenario, and at worst Trollie hits the only townie in the three undecided, making it 3-4 town and 3-4 scum, with the likelihood that if there is 4 scum (or at the very least, he's a traitor, and may not count toward mafia win condition while the vig is alive because with two kills available and the mafia having a chance to either miss from a doc, hit their own traitor and Trollie to kill, plus not a sure thing to force a lynch, the game wouldn't end immediately), the fourth is NOT team scum, and thus we are not in endgame. <br><br>If Trollie hits a scum in this scenario, we enter the day with 4 town, and 2-3 scum. Two in the group of the three remaining from {Slandaar, Sherlock, Kinetic, and Kwill} and one in the group of the three remaining from {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa and IK}. <br><br>If Trollie is SK in this scenario, we enter day 3 with either 3-4 town, 1 SK, 2-3 Mafia, of which, most likely there are 2-3 mafia within {Kinetic, Sherlock, Slandaar, Kwll} but only two are alive (because in the event of Thor flipping town, Trollie's best shot at hitting mafia is killing in that group), and then 0-1 Mafia within {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK}. <br><br>If Trollie is SK, If he hits Mafia, its 4-1-2, with 1-2 Mafia in the two remaining alive from {Kinetic, Sherlock, Standaar, and Kwll} and 0-1 Mafia within {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK}. <br><br>Here: Town win is likely. Town still have majority, and with two major suspects in the two still alive, the likelihood is town hits scum. Assuming the town lynches town though it means that the other MUST be mafia, and Trollie MUST kill that person during the night making:<br><br><br><br>If Trollie is SK, If he hits town, than it pretty has that the last three within the group of {Sherlock, Slaandar, Kinetic, and Kwll} must be mafia, and there are no mafia within the remaining 3 from {Toxic, Jacob, Konowa, and IK}. <br><br>Here: Town win or Draw. <br><br>Town and Trollie lynch mafia Day 3. During night, town does not protect Trollie. Either:<br><br>He is immune, survives night kill, kills mafia and thus makes it 3 town, 1 mafia, 1 SK in endgame. Town Win.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">He is immune, survives night kill, kills town,</span> and this leads to an inevitable SK win, unless town spite Trollie, team up with Mafia to kill him and give the Mafia the win.<br>He is not immune, does not survive the night kill, kills mafia, makes it 4 town, 1 mafia in end game with the mafia known. Town Win.<br>He is not immune, is not targeted for night kill, kills mafia, makes it 3 town, 1 mafia, 1 SK. Again, Town Win.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">He is not immune, does not survive night kill, kills town,</span> makes it 2 town, 2 mafia. Mafia Win.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">He is not immune, is not tarted for night kill, kills town,</span> makes it 1 town, 2 mafia, 1 SK. Mafia Win.<br><br>THUS: The only way for Trollie to win this game if he is SK is if he is immune to night kills, and targets a town member during Night 3, AND the town decides not to screw him over. <br>THUS: The only way for the Mafia to win is if Trollie, on Night 3, kills a town member.<br>Therefore: If Town agrees if Trollie targets town during Night 3, we will throw the game to the Mafia, we force Trollie to have to attack Mafia in this event, and therefore, the only way Scum can win if Thor is Town is if Trollie is SK, and basically sacrifices himself to let the mafia win. This \"denial\" tactic forces Trollie to basically decide the game for Mafia or Town, no matter his immunity.<br><br>OK, I'm done going through all the possible contingencies. That is the absolute worst case scenario (Trollie is SK, Thor is not Scum). Even under that scenario, town still wins 50% of the time, and Trollie cannot win. Most likely though, the scenario isn't that bad, and frankly, Thor is scum, regardless of Trollies alignment. <br><br>I'm going to bed."}

That is analysis. Technically, there is also another conclusion in there (That dresses make people cuter), but that is much more advanced than I expect you to go. Just start with ONE fact, or ONE reason to support your conclusion. It isn't my job to support or prove YOUR case, it is my job to support and prove MY case, and I have done that. I've given reasons. If you don't agree with those reasons, tell me WHY. Don't just say I'm wrong because that doesn't help solve anything."}

The facts, based on the context of where Thor was, and based on Abaddon's play, indicate a motivation that is a motivation that is inherent with knowledge that Thor claims he does not have. As only scum would have that knowledge, it indicates scum. The ONLY thing elsewise that would prove that knowledge is if Thor claimed COP, and an innocent result on Toxic. But frankly, he had that opportunity, that was the ONLY claim I was looking for when he was supposed to claim and frankly, now it doesn't make sense. If Thor had that card he should have played it, if he plays it now its only because I told him that play."}

If two players, who have completely different styles, completely different knowledge (because, guess what, you're coming in the game with knowledge of 3 flips that Abaddon wouldn't have had if he were town at the beginning of the game), and completely different contexts enter the game at different times, and yet have EXACTLY the same play, reads, and move toward the same exact pushes, that indicates they have something in common. <br><br>Now, you could say \"Well, what if they're both town\", but that doesn't track, because town with no knowledge wouldn't HAVE that same read. They'd have no knowledge in common with their slot in that case.<br><br>The ONLY other possibilities are A) You read the game, agreed with your slot, and decided to continue to pursue. In that case, it makes sense, you know the alignment of your slot, you can see what they saw as you read the game. You admitted you didn't read though, so it can't be that. B) You are town with results that indicate something that your slot knows that no other slot knows. You had the chance to claim that, you scummily didn't. C) You're scum and your slot has knowledge that no other non-scum slot knows.<br><br>C is the only one that fits.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4518069#p4518069\" class=\"postlink\">post 973</a>, Kinetic wrote:</cite>And maybe its a personal thing, but I think its a scum tell when someone reaplces and doesn't read at least part of the game and makes it their business not to do so at all.</div></blockquote><br>I do believe I've mentioned that I actually don't read on replacing in.

You did EXCATLY what scum would do in that situation, and at that point it was perfectly clear in my mind, you were scum."}

I think it is someone who GENUINELY believes the things he is saying and is pleading with us to not stupidly lynch him when he is town.

We all do scummy things sometimes as town.  That does not make every one of us scum.  When pressured, Thor looks scummier than Kinetic.  There is no one argument or one post that should seal our reads. <br><br>Thor is acting scummy.  <br><br>Kinetic is acting like town who genuinely holds those theories that he is espousing to be true, though almost none of the other players in this game agree.  It is not THAT he is disagreeable that makes him scummy though.  This is the same issue I had with the case on CD yesterday.  Someone can think crazy things as town, the question is, do they believe what they are saying, or are they saying it to avoid getting caught.  Thor is avoiding, Kinetic is preaching.<br><br>p-edit: please check the syntax of that post.  I do not understand what you are saying"}

Kinetic is putting himself out there.  He has given us a ton of content since his feud with thor.  Is this scum trying desperately to avoid a lynch? No, i dont think so.  I think it is someone who GENUINELY believes the things he is saying and is pleading with us to not stupidly lynch him when he is town.  Thor, on the other hand, did not try as hard to kill his wagon, instead he kept asking questions so that he could convince us that the wagon on him was not well founded.  It is well founded, it is very well founded.  <br>(3) Thor is using a tactic (the one above) i see a lot of scum players use and that is very successful usually.  The one where you keep laughing off the case against you.  Now i dont know thor meta, and i dont have the time to check it, so maybe this is his town play as well, but I see no town motive from his defense.  He is 100% defensive and accusational.  He keeps saying kinetic is dodging and is making meaningless claims.  He is waiting for other people to fill in the spaces in his argument.  do not let him get away with this.  </div></blockquote><br>1) Kinetic, during the same period, kept saying 'I'll do the case when I have time, I'll do the case when I have time'...so...?</div></blockquote><br><br>So, you defend by saying \"Well Kinetic did that\", except, I have been saying from the beginning I don't have time, and you were using that to say I was scummy. I came into this game saying I had huge finals I was studying for (and effectively I'm neglecting right now), and I took the brunt of that because I had no choice. You don't get to fucking avoid it.

Also, even Kinetic has pointed out that I made an attack on Kinetic in like my 2nd or 3rd post.

You attacked me first. While I was defending from Toxic. You were \"100% defensive\" when your initial play was an offensive attack, calling me out for attacking, when I was in fact defending a post that was not even an attack on toxic. It was initial reads from half the game that I posted so there was SOME content from my slot while I caught up. Instead of waiting until Iw as completely caught up though, like I kept asking, I had to keep getting pulled to the front of the thread in order to defend myself and say: FUCKING WAIT. And what happens, while I'm doing that, you come and join the attack.<br><br>Right. You're \"100% on the defensive here\".<br><br>You call my actions scummy, but my actions up to that point were: Post initial reads so that everyone could get some more from my slot (town), trying to catch up on the game (town), defending myself from toxic's attacks which were based on preliminary, unfinished posts that I said weren't finished, yet he decided to take issue with (town). I fail to see how any of that is scummy, and you weren't being optimistic.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4518422#p4518422\" class=\"postlink\">post 994</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4518244#p4518244\" class=\"postlink\">post 982</a>, Kinetic wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4518237#p4518237\" class=\"postlink\">post 980</a>, Konowa wrote:</cite>Trollie, my problem with Kinetic is that his initial read on Thor scum was dependent on toxic scum.

We need to do an analysis of the NK's up to this point.  Given that night actions are definitely randomized if one isn't sent in, we need to figure out why only Thor died.<br>2.  It is possible that scum intentionally left their NKs unsent so that they would be random, and NK analysis would thus be useless.  However, this would intentionally be giving up their control over who dies, which trumps any benefit from truly randomized NKs.  Has anyone here ever seen scum who actually, truly just picked some random guy to NK?  All of them that I've ever seen had scum talking about who specifically to kill.<br>3.  Trollie claimed to kill Cheery N1, and we have no reason to doubt him.  Why, then, would scum kill Tommy?  He was hardly the most townie of players.<br><br>For the Thor thing, here's the possibilities that I can see.<br><br>1.  Scum and Trollie both targeted Thor.  This would be silly, since Thor was easily one of the most suspected players in the game.  However, I've seen scum do stupid things like this before, so it's not impossible.<br>2.  Scum targeted someone else, Trollie targeted the same person, and Thor protected that person.  This would lead to the question, who did they both target?<br>3.  Scum targeted Thor, Trollie targeted someone else, Thor protected that person.  Again, this would be stupid, but not unheard of.<br>4.  Scum targeted someone else, Trollie targeted Thor, Thor protected person that Scum targeted.  I could see this, because Trollie seemed to want to kill Thor yesterday.<br>5.  Scum targeted Thor, and Trollie is 1-shot.<br>6.  Scum targeted someone, Thor protected them, and Trollie is 1-shot.<br>7.  Scum targeted Slandaar, Trollie targeted Thor.  Why the hell would this happen?  Incredibly unlikely.<br>8.  Scum targeted Thor, Trollie targeted Slandaar.  The first part would be stupid, the second part would make sense, because Trollie would have an interest in confirming Slandaar's story.<br>9.  Scum targeted someone, Thor protected that person, Trollie targeted Slandaar.  This would make a lot of sense.<br><br>Most of these would be resolved by Trollie telling us who he targeted."}

You need a large sample size to draw those kinds of conclusions, and that's just something you don't have considering this is only his third game. It's like the scientific method. You can't just show something to be true once and go, \"Well, that's just how it is, obviously.\" You have to test it over and over, and show it to be true every single time. He's only got one scum game and one town game under his belt, and you're jumping to conclusions about his play based on very limited experience. He's too new -- his play is constantly evolving. Look at the difference between his Day 2 and Day 3 play. During Day 2, he was fairly active in the discussion, but avoided the subject constantly and commented on mostly irrelevant things. Today, he seems to be much more on the ball about everything. You can't even compare his play from one Day to the next <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in the same game</span>, much less over separate games entirely. Your attempt at clearing him by his meta is a flawed concept.<br><br>In fact, I'd say that if you actually analyzed his play, you'd see it's more indicative of scum than anything. He's shown that he is capable of applying thought and reason, but he's actively choosing not to in certain situations. Instead, he chooses to avoid the subject completely whenever he feels like it. It's obvious that he's active lurking.<br><br>Slandaar/kwll/JacobSavage seems like a much more likely scum team when you actually think about it."}

If Sherlock dies tonight and flips town it confirms Slaandar as scum, which scum don't really want.  So Sherlock has a chance to survive the night if he's telling the truth.  If he's not telling the truth, we lynch Slaandar, he flips town, and we're basically dead.<br><br>Going along with this, Konowa is off limits, because lynching him would be stupid without some sort of confirmation about Sherlock's alignment.  Even if Sherlock's right, Konowa might be a godfather, so I want to play it safe.<br><br>I don't want to kill Jacob, because doing so would be a complete shot in the dark from my perspective.  Scum in a single two-man neighborhood is extremely unlikely, and we'd be playing Russian Roulette with it.<br><br>Trollie should obviously not be lynched, because we need to assume he's not scum for now.  He also needs to do what the town as a whole agrees, because 1.  that would lead to more discussion, which we really damn well need right now, 2.  it would allow the town as a whole to decide rather than a single person, and crowdsourcing is actually a good thing, 3.  if he's a SK he needs to be chained.<br><br>This leaves toxic and kwll.  I do not at all buy Sherlock's argument that kwll is town, because from what I can see it's based on gut, and as I've said many times, I don't buy gut.  Since my reads up to this point have been complete crap, I'm going to just have to go on pure setup analysis, which is something I really hate doing.  I say we lynch kwll, partially because he's completely unreadable to me, and partially because of the process of elimination.<br><br>That leaves toxic, who may or may not be NK'd by Trollie.  I can't say I have a scumread on toxic, but as I've said, my reads up until now have been complete crap, so I don't know.  The only strong read I still have is on Slandaar.<br><br>So I suppose going against what I said up there, Slandaar may be the best bet for a Trollie NK, if kwll flips scum.  We'd definitely have survived the night, and it would give us a clear indication of Sherlock's alignment.  While we wouldn't know about Konowa (it's possible for scum claiming cop to buddy a townie in order to get props), it would at least cut down scum's numbers.<br><br>Assuming we lynch scum today, it will probably be in scum's best interests to kill Trollie, simply because regardless of his alignment, he's another night killer, and scum won't want more opportunities for him to kill them.  If he's vig, well, we'd really have no way of knowing.  If he's a SK, hooray.<br><br>Assuming we lynch kwll and he flips scum, Sherlock should investigate either Jacob or toxic.  Since Jacob's more up in the air for me, he may be the best bet, because like I said, I don't like Russian Roulette.<br><br>Assuming we lynch kwll and he flips <span style=\"font-style: italic\">town</span>, well, we need a backup plan for what Sherlock and Trollie should do.  Sherlock may still want to investigate Jacob, because hell, why not.  Trollie should still probably go after Slandaar.  We'd be in a far worse position, though.<br><br><br>Ok, so that was a lot of thoughts."}

I also dont believe that scum on thor's wagon wouldnt just bite the bullet and suggest switching over to kinetic for the town-cred.  There is enough that has gone on in the past few pages to warrant people switching sides, yet no one has.  The same thing is true for thor. no one bit when I made my points.  no one even probed me to explain more.  The only thing that happened was thor argued against it.  <br><br>scum v. scum actually does not make sense for the same reason.  whichever scum is on the wagon with 4 townies would jump at the opportunity to gain town cred by voting scum.<br><br>Ok, so scum v. scum = no sense<br><br>town v. town makes a ton of sense to me.<br><br>Kinetic scum v. Thor town<br>again, not all scum are going to be on kinetic's wagon if this is the case, that makes no sense.  meaning there would be at least 4 if not all 5 voters town.

I got a minor town read from the way he bluntly showed an opposite view from me as far as Trollie's alignment. This view remains consistent throughout Day 1, as he stay's on Trollie's ass to the end. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> The sense I got from his Post #321 made me feel that he's actually going through his reads with some serious effort. This makes me feel that he's either highly detailed scum putting effort into faking each of his reads in detail, or he's town. My only samples are one recently finished game and games from years ago, but his max posting quality seems to be higher as town, similar to his posting here. Along the same line, there's Post #331. As he claimed that his post took two days to assemble, it's less likely that he took two days faking a huge post when he hasn't had a history of doing that before as scum. It's more likely that he's doing things the same way he was doing them in his recently-finished game and making a legitimate read list. Someone mentioned when he made the post that he has way too many scum reads in his post to be scum, and I tend to agree with that. Add to that that he listed no one I see as potential scum as a town read, which either means he's not supporting his partners or he's town (or I'm wrong... nah). I disagreed with most of his reads, but he's been consistent with them since the reads post and seems to genuinely believe every point he makes. The fact that he's willing to put a huge post out there in the first place is also a slight towntell, as from a scum PoV, it creates connections between him and every other player. Him showing low confidence in some reads, such as at the end of his read on Abaddon, shows that he's posting all reads that come to his mind instead of finding what's good and making it fit into a read. In my experience, scum are less likely to gather reads in this way because they already know what they want their reads to be, while town are still trying to find theirs. His read on Delta seems to be mostly based on the fact that he attacked Trollie constantly, something terribly wrong, but not something I see Mafia basing a town read on, considering that he wanted Trollie-not-mafia dead. He's too confident about his read on Trollie to be faking it and expect a good reaction to it later, knowing he's not mafia. I also am a fan of the fact that he types up pretty big walls on some players just to end up giving them a null read. It again shows thought. That about wraps up why I got a huge town read on Idiot right after his reads post. The cherry on top of Idiot-town is his Neighbor claim. A two-man neighborhood is pretty likely to have two town, and Jacob's comment about forgetting to check the QT means that if there's scum in the Neighborhood, it's most likely Jacob, not Idiot. His confusion around his read on me is a town tell because, like I've said before, people are less likely to take things step-by-step like that as scum than as town. <span class=\"noboldsig\">TOWN</span><br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:80%\"></div><br><br>This is all I can get done tonight, sorry.

I got a minor town read from the way he bluntly showed an opposite view from me as far as Trollie's alignment. This view remains consistent throughout Day 1, as he stay's on Trollie's ass to the end. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> The sense I got from his Post #321 made me feel that he's actually going through his reads with some serious effort. This makes me feel that he's either highly detailed scum putting effort into faking each of his reads in detail, or he's town. My only samples are one recently finished game and games from years ago, but his max posting quality seems to be higher as town, similar to his posting here. Along the same line, there's Post #331. As he claimed that his post took two days to assemble, it's less likely that he took two days faking a huge post when he hasn't had a history of doing that before as scum. It's more likely that he's doing things the same way he was doing them in his recently-finished game and making a legitimate read list. Someone mentioned when he made the post that he has way too many scum reads in his post to be scum, and I tend to agree with that. Add to that that he listed no one I see as potential scum as a town read, which either means he's not supporting his partners or he's town (or I'm wrong... nah). I disagreed with most of his reads, but he's been consistent with them since the reads post and seems to genuinely believe every point he makes. The fact that he's willing to put a huge post out there in the first place is also a slight towntell, as from a scum PoV, it creates connections between him and every other player. Him showing low confidence in some reads, such as at the end of his read on Abaddon, shows that he's posting all reads that come to his mind instead of finding what's good and making it fit into a read. In my experience, scum are less likely to gather reads in this way because they already know what they want their reads to be, while town are still trying to find theirs. His read on Delta seems to be mostly based on the fact that he attacked Trollie constantly, something terribly wrong, but not something I see Mafia basing a town read on, considering that he wanted Trollie-not-mafia dead. He's too confident about his read on Trollie to be faking it and expect a good reaction to it later, knowing he's not mafia. I also am a fan of the fact that he types up pretty big walls on some players just to end up giving them a null read. It again shows thought. That about wraps up why I got a huge town read on Idiot right after his reads post. The cherry on top of Idiot-town is his Neighbor claim. A two-man neighborhood is pretty likely to have two town, and Jacob's comment about forgetting to check the QT means that if there's scum in the Neighborhood, it's most likely Jacob, not Idiot. His confusion around his read on me is a town tell because, like I've said before, people are less likely to take things step-by-step like that as scum than as town. <span class=\"noboldsig\">TOWN</span><br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:80%\"></div><br><br>This is all I can get done tonight, sorry.

Maybe because he is worried someone will think there cannot be a vig and a cop in the game.  This is maybe why scumlock would feel comfortable claiming cop, cause he thinks that Vig-me makes a cop unlikely.  He then pre-empts the argument he thinks will be made about the PRs in the game, an argument he only thought about in the first place because it is what gave him confidence to claim cop.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4534462#p4534462\" class=\"postlink\">post 1261</a>, _Sherlock_ wrote:</cite>Delta was my N1 inno.<br><br>I'll wait for toxic to claim, I guess.</div></blockquote><br>Lets say delta is town and Sherlock scum.

I messed up because I figured that if I claimed I shot slandaar it would confirm his claim and make him look town, but then we realized that the claim is just as likely to be a scum role.  Then I realized what I should have done is claimed a shot on some rando to get a better reaction test, so I figured I got what I needed from the slandaar claim, now ill claim I shot Sherlock.  THE VERY OBVIOUS EXPLANATION FROM TOWN SHERLOCK IS THAT THOR PROTECTED HIM.  HE HAD ALREADY SAID THAT THOR HAD A TOWN READ ON HIM.  But he goes STRAIGHT to calling me a liar.  Why? Because Scumlock knows that SCUM SHOT ME last night, so if I didn\u2019t die that must mean that Thor protected me, and that I shot either Thor or Slandaar (who claimed 1shotbp).  If Sherlock did not know the truth of the scumkill last night, the VERY OBVIOUS explanation would have been that thor protected him.  <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">this is the main problem I have with Sherlock right now</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4539666#p4539666\" class=\"postlink\">post 1462</a>, _Sherlock_ wrote:</cite>@Trollie: Here's a possibility:<br><br>Thor sees me as town, wants to protect me from the NK because I may get killed if the Mafia think he's on Trollie (or, he's protecting me from Trollie - less likely).

Scum were not going to shoot claimed Vig in Trollie since it would fail anyways.  Also the fact that Thor never claimed who he was going to protect leaves it open to the possibility that maybe he wouldn\u2019t protect Trollie, but I digress.  Easiest way out of this situation is for scum to shoot Thor in the face, eliminating that problem.<br><br>Now.<br><br>Trollie, we don\u2019t know who Thor protected, so the fact that you shot Sherlock and him still being alive is not indicative of him being scum.  Thor could have protected Sherlock.  So you shooting him would have been cancelled out by Thor\u2019s BG.  Also, think about this, if scum do indeed have a RB\u2019er then why not RB Thor \u2013and then- shoot you.  This would have left Thor alive today when he most likely would have been a prime mislynch target.<br><br>Point in fact is that we have a cop claiming a guilty on Slandaar.  This is an easy one for one.  There is no RB\u2019er, get that notion out of your head.  Lynch Slandaar, if he is town, Trollie shoot Sherlock."}

I looked at Slandaar, toxic, and kwll vs. Slandaar, toxic, and Jacob in ISO. Slandaar and toxic have a huge argument with each other early-game, showing that they both have the capability of distancing/bussing effectively. toxic also attacks both Sable Tip and kwll at times, and Slandaar votes kwll once or twice. However, their interaction with Jacob is extremely minimal over the course of the game.

This is because on N2 his scumlist included two confirmed scum, and only a truly desperate scum would do that (on N2 they had no reason to be desperate).<br><br>We've also basically confirmed that I'm town, so that's nice.  Either Sherlock correctly identified me as town or Sherlock is scum claiming cop, and I am therefore town.  Konowa is in a more curious position.  Either Sherlock correctly identified him as town, he is the Godfather, or he is town and Sherlock is scum claiming cop with a townread on him to gain confidence.  2/3 of these scenarios have him as town, and his play combined with his predecessor's play has me fairly sure that he's town.<br><br>This leaves Kwll and Sherlock.  I'm certainly willing to give Sherlock the benefit of the doubt now, so Kwll should probably be the lynch today.  However, I don't at all like him investigating me last night, because seriously, why the hell would he do that?  He'd have been far better off investigating Jacob, because if Jacob flipped scum then we'd have our scum neighbor, and if Jacob flipped town then that means we're not two scum fakeclaiming neighbors together.  I was basically universally seen as town, so doing so fits the \"scum trying to hide a bad investigation\" thing.<br><br>And more:  If he knew Trollie was going to shoot his buddy, then he'd have at least one mislynch in his way beforehand.  Thus, claiming to have found scum last night would be impossibly dangerous, because when we lynched that person and they flipped town he'd be dead within moments.  So, he would have had to fake an investigation on someone who was seen as obvious town, leaving the possibility that the not-obviously-town people would be available for lynching.<br><br>On the other hand, kwll is independently scummy.<br><br>So here's what I'm thinking:  We kill kwll, and if that's not game over, Sherlock investigates Jacob.  If Sherlock gets a town read on him, we have a seriously high probability of there being a Godfather.  In that case, I think Konowa would be the Godfather, because as Sherlock said, neighbor Godfather would be silly.  OR, we lynch Sherlock tomorrow, and cross our fingers.<br><br>I want to wait at least a few hours before lynching Kwll so that we can discuss this stuff and so that the Mod can respond to Jacob's second question."}

So I guess he played just right as scum, especially since townies were lurking like hell too.  I was pretty much sure that Toxic was town all the way up until I threw out my reads altogether, so definitely good play from him.  As for kwll, to be honest, I didn't try to get any sort of read on him, just because I know I can't read players like him.  That's why I was \"shoot kwll, shoot kwll\" since he replaced in.  Of course, congratulations are in order for surviving until D4.  Having the cop completely on your side is awesome when you're scum."}

With 3 townies 1 vig vs 1 scum you would have been completely boned on D4, because we were obviously not going to kill Trollie, Konowa would have been basically confirmed, and I was almost certainly not going to be shot or lynched, meaning at worst kwll and Jacob would have died (lynch one, shoot the other).  There was the possibility that Sherlock would investigate someone other than kwll (which happened), and the WIFOM over his role might have been useful (as evidenced in my flailing just before I hammered kwll).  And as you said, there was the possibility that Trollie's anti-Sherlock rampage might have been real or whatever, and if he shot Sherlock you'd be in a wonderful position.  Ultimately you did the right thing."}
