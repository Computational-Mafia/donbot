As has been evident by my involvement in the game so far I wouldn't have had the time to pursue one of my preferred ways of getting the game going, along with probably teaching them to a crowd that's used to the RVS. And the RVS does at least does the trick, even if I find it leaves the least amount of information of any methods I know to start a game of mafia off.<br><br>I would be more than willing to explain my position on the RVS, provide examples and explanations if anyone is intrigued, but that would be for outside of the game.</div></blockquote><br><br>That post seems genuine and town in my opinion, just based off gut.<br><br>Going over to my strongest scum read now.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Palmar</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Zhero</span><br><br>For reasons I posted earlier.<br><br>On my phone btw.</div></blockquote><br><br>Of the three posts I wrote, this one should be the least towny looking to you if you were actually analyzing their contents. The only relevant point to this game is that I simply said that disagreeing with a method doesn't mean shunning it. The rest of my post has nothing that can even come close to revealing my alignment.<br><br>I would think my point about zhero and my townread on horus would provide a much stronger basis for you to form an opinion on my alignment.<br><br>Incidentally I don't think Zhero is a good lynch based on what I mentioned how he's at least reading the game in detail. That makes two bad wagons you have been on, and neither of them with particularly good reasoning.<br><br>My problem is not that you backed off the wagon on me, that's sensible, my problem is that you did it in the most lazy and apathetic way, and gave the absolute lowest amount of reasons you seem to think you could get away with. It's not what you did, but how you did it.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fegelein</span></div></blockquote><br><br>So you measure how towny your own posts are? That seems very odd, why would you need to do that as town? Also, yes, I'll freely admit that I didn't really read your other 2 posts as carefully, but that's mainly because I saw your first defence as satisfactory for an unvote, as I had Zhero as another scum read.<br><br>I have to say though, looking closer, your points on HD are strong, although it strikes me as a minor chainsaw defence, attacking HD for attacking Zhero. I agree with the main point of your post though: One player cannot vouch for the feelings of another.<br><br>Why were you a bad wagon at that time, bearing in mind this was before you explained? Also, just because Zhero is reading the game in detail does not make him Town. It doesn't make anyone more Town. In fact, scum are far more likely to be immersed into the game itself instead of lurking. Scum love to manipulate.<br><br>I was on the phone at the time. I couldn't make a big post on it, and I'd just be parroting my own reasons, so I will refer you back to my original argument.<br><br><br><br>Your second post seems scummy though. What it comes across as is that you thought of another possible point against me, and just added it to reinforce your argument. Also, why the hell would I keep my vote on someone that provided a good defence?"}
