It gives us all a warm fuzzy feeling when someone realizes we're town.

Yes, I know I'm using your newbie game meta from PO, but it does seem to correlate quite strongly. The point is, you're giving me scum vibes.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not saying that you're scum for sure, I don't know that. I'm saying that you are my strongest scum read. You seem to have it in your head that I'm labelling you as 100% confirmed scum. Also, I am not saying helping the Town is scummy. To me though, you seem overly cautious and overly reasonable. But now your game style flips around as soon as you get the slightest bit of pressure? Suspicious.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> <br>\n<br>\nI can agree with you that Meta is a somewhat shaky argument, but that doesn't discredit it as an argument altogether. My vote on you is not just based off Meta, it's based off you being overly cautious and refusing to put a vote on a scum read of yours (until you were prompted, which makes it worse). Also, how are my reasons broken? <br>\n<br>\nYou're voting me because I used Meta as an argument, \"faulty logic\", and me not paying attention to the game (?).  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> .
