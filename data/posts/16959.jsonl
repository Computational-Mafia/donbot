Had.<br><br>Last night, a <strike>wonderful event</strike> terrible tragedy had occured.<br><br><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OvmuvHN8HnM/SjaCJKdsj3I/AAAAAAAABMc/UfsRcAh39gQ/s400/FishSlap.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fate, Town Mason, has been slapped in the face with a fish on Night Zero, then shot.</span></span></span></span><br><br><br><br>After some investigation, you conclude as a town that, unbelievably enough, the attack on Fate wasn't personal at all.<br>There are those among you who wish to slap each of you in the face with a fish, then shoot you.<br><br>Stop them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Rules</span></span></span> (stolen from Faraday who stole them from Hoopla with some modifications).<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Fundamental</span> <br>1) The site-wide rules apply, please read them and don't do anything stupid. <br>2) Unless it is explicitly stated in your role PM that you can do so, do not talk about this game outside of the game thread. <br>3) Do not quote any communication you have with me, the moderator of the game. Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. This includes timestamps of role pm's. You may share the quotation in your role pm, if there is one, however. This doesn't have to be paraphrased.<br>4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. <br>4a) No Sig/Avatar bets, I can't have someone having an awful avatar as a result of my game. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death</span><br>5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Hoopla</span>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. <br>6) Unvotes aren't necessary, but will be appreciated. <br>7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% rounded up of the votes. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. <br>8) You may vote for a \u2018no lynch\u2019 if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch. <br>9) Once you're dead, you are dead. You are allowed one contentless \"bah\" post which may only contain the letters \"F\" and \"U\". You may use as many of each letter as you want.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines</span><br>10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>11) Prods will be issued after 48 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod you I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too, I'm human I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me. <br>11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement. <br>12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 17 days unless specified as otherwise</span><br>14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch.<br>15) Nights will have a 72 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. <br>16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Other Information</span> <br>pre-17) No mechanism or website may be used to prove that a decision was achieved randomly. I.e. you may chose who claims first by rolling a dice, but you'll have to trust the person who rolled the dice not to lie.<br>17) <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">RED</span></span> and <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">GREEN</span></span> font are my colours I will use for modly purposes. All other colors are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself. I'll not modkill you if you happen to use them, but try not to please. <br>18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. If you feel a vote count is needed, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for one, and I\u2019ll provide one at the next opportunity. <br>19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will punish you. If something is fuzzy for you, please ask! <br>20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know in thread.<br>21) The penalty for faking violation of a rule will be the same as actually violating the rule.<br>22) Have fun!<br>23) No slapping the moderator with fish.<br>Sample Vanilla townie role pm:<br><blockquote><div><cite>chesskid3 wrote:</cite>Welcome to \"don't get slapped in the face by a fish\" Mafia, XXX.

Townies can be cautious about early wagons, scum can pretend to be cautious about early wagons.  Not seeing the scumminess there--it's more likely a null tell.  Also, Shift, why do you think it should be automatic to claim at L-1?  I mean, aside from being used to that format--do you have reasons for thinking that?<br>  <br>-Otolia's offer to claim is really anti-town; I'm partly inclined to give him a pass on communication differences, but, still, really not good.  I do want to know, Otolia, why are you proclaiming that you will probably unvote before you have done so?<br><br>-Gorilla, you state you're reluctant to vote Shift to L-1, but you don't say directly whether you find him suspicious.  Do you?  If not, who do you suspect at the moment?<br><br>-Coyote, on a similar note, is your vote of Shift in #44 random or not?  I can't tell looking at it.<br><br>-Gandalf's recent unvote raised my eyebrows.  His vote on CoolDog was doing no harm where it was at--indeed, I think it was the only one--so why the seemingly urgent necessity to unvote?  If CoolDog had been wagoned, I might understand, but unvoting without revoting in this sort of circumstance looks much more suspicious.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Vote: Gandalf.</div></blockquote>"}

I don't know. I have played this game with a lot of different people but never a Frenchmen (reads go to the all mighty pot...). First I want to say that hate, to use the word in your post, is used as a scum hunting tool to break scum. It works better in real life when you can pick up facial expressions, but it is still very effective in this type of game. Building pressure on somebody forces them to post content, and when scum do that they sometimes (most of the time) make contradictions or slips. People pressure other people with strong wording all the time, this is a game for men/adults (sorry in advance) and rest assure that it is not personal at all. However, I don't think you are scum at the moment. Your posts seem consistent and all are worded oddly (from what I'm used to), but they asre worded oddly constantly (if that means anything at all). <br><br>@gandy, okay we unvoted from an rvs vote and then didn't vote anybody. Whats the point? You could have simply kept your vote on me until you found a wagon that you liked (AKA you personally getting out of rvs). Question: Are you personally still in the RVS phase? And If you aren't, why didn't you vote for the person that brought it out of that phase?

And logically think about it why should I be forced to claim at l-1?

Me vote stays, unless gandy makes an ass of himself."}

Once that happens \"real\" votes are placed, because we have something to go on. You can't have any \"real\" reads in rvs, and you must have some \"real\" reads out of rvs, because you have content that allows you to make a real vote, otherwise you would just random vote because there isn't enough content to form a read for a  \"real\" vote.

You both vote without really giving reasons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gandalf wrote:</cite>I think you guys are missing a key concept of playing <strike>town</strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">scum</span>: ATTRACTING ATTENTION IS BAD. <strike>Town</strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">scum's</span>'s job is to blend into the herd... </div></blockquote><br><br>FTFY.<br><br>But srsly, this post is seven flavors of awful.  Town has to be proactive first--that necessarily entails some degree of detaching from the herd (looks like Vox already said this.  Oh well).

His iso #2 is terrible and can't be explained away by language barrier.

Your post had NO traces of sarcasm or joking in it. Thus when you try to play it as a joke, it looks suspicious.<br>#4 - And I already told you I don't like it. That isn't going to change.<br>#5 - This is the first response you've made to my point about your overcautiousness. Please point out where it has \"already\" been covered? If you mean in your response to RC below, and the supposed \"fallacy\" then this is my retort;<br><br>I say you're being too defensive and cautious.<br>RC agrees and says you should be more aggressive.<br>You think those things contradict.<br>They clearly don't.<br><br>Otherwise, no, I don't think you have covered my #5 at all?"}

Here is why, in bullet point form:<br><br>-Bvoigt\u2019s case on me boils down to: he doesn\u2019t like people using terms like OMGUS.  I have explained over and over again why seeing OMGUS was a reasonable interpretation of Gandalf\u2019s behavior.  More than one person has basically said that he isn\u2019t really explaining a case on me.  I have explained my motive multiple times.  And, it must be noted that Gandalf never denied my accusation that his suspicion on me was OMGUS, so really, I think the characterization is fair.<br><br>-Gandalf says little, and is basically sheeping bvoigt, who was his number one scumread\u2014he even moved his vote from bvoigt to me.  Why would town sheep from someone they thought was scum?  (Looks like Gorilla already picked up on this.)  BTW, I want to remove myself from the spotlight?  I\u2019m trying to remain as active as I can, even though I\u2019m LA right now.<br><br>-Additionally, Gandalf\u2019s statements imply he is basically voting me because of a connection between me and Amrun, which until there have been flips, is a fool\u2019s errand to try and interpret.  I\u2019ve said this to him already.<br><br>-VV says that bvoigt\u2019s argument is \u201cconvincing,\u201d but then says that he doesn\u2019t understand it.  How can you claim to be convinced by something you don\u2019t understand?  This is the second consecutive awful post from VV.<br><br>In short, two players are sheeping off of what is obviously a flawed case, to which I have already explained my motives multiple times, and both of those two players are doing so after I put some heat in their direction, so their motives seem pretty obvious.  Now for a few particular responses to bvoigt\u2026<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>a (probably) gut-based read without any reasons isn't going to put any suspicion on you or discredit your scumhunting.</div></blockquote><br><br>Rly?  You don\u2019t think anyone would be like, even for a bit, \u201cMmm, maybe I should re-read Yoshi?\u201d  You clearly have more faith in mafia players than I do.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And yeah, I haven't posted a big case because really, no one has been majorly scummy except for Otolia.</div></blockquote><br><br>So, your vote isn\u2019t even on the person you think is scummiest?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>BTW, is it just me or do Amrun and Yoshi both seem very eager to stop my questioning of them as soon as possible?</div></blockquote><br><br>It\u2019s just you.  BTW, you call me paranoid below?  Pot, kettle, black, etc.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This reaction to my vote seems pretty angry and paranoid. A townie simply should not be worried about one vote.</div></blockquote><br><br>This response indicates the opposition has probably more to do with personality than alignment.  Meta me, I\u2019m aggressive in defending myself whenever votes are placed on me.  My first game here, I was town, was quickly wagoned on D1 (not unlike here), and fought tooth and nail against being lynched, and ended up surviving the game.  BTW, I 100% disagree with you that townies should not be worried about one vote.  In my experience, townies are more likely to be more vocal towards their accusers because scum want to be more diplomatic so as to avoid irking more people and motivating them to join their wagon."}

My first game here, I was town, was quickly wagoned on D1 (not unlike here), and fought tooth and nail against being lynched, and ended up surviving the game.  BTW, I 100% disagree with you that townies should not be worried about one vote.  In my experience, townies are more likely to be more vocal towards their accusers because scum want to be more diplomatic so as to avoid irking more people and motivating them to join their wagon.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is somewhat reasonable.

Otolia is clearly not scum(I have argued about this for a while now, no one listened. &gt;.&gt;). and if you are a Town victim, then speak now and forever hold your peace. (If you're scum, then spare us the WIFOM.)</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, this is a good post. Empking is just upset. I don't blame him, but clearly Otolia is looking more town-like. As Vas says, PRs tend to get a little more itchy than usual as a lynch closes in. And Otolia's argument that he felt like he wouldn't have been doing \"his job\" had he not shot does make sense to me. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Vas 246 wrote:</cite>Previous voters of Shift: Would you be willing to re-vote shift?

I was tempted to look the other way in gandalf's whole \"unvoting without revoting\" scandal, but he's really latching onto this white knight role for Otolia. He did it <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2931200#p2931200\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2931327#p2931327\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2933216#p2933216\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. <br><br>It's different from Vas because Vas seems a little more genuine about it. Vas didn't threaten to hammer Otolia like gandalf; he actually was always against the wagon. Couple this with gandalf acting up in arms over some supposed anti-Otolia mob, and I think you've got someone who's trying to make something out of nothing. It certainly is a distraction. <br><br>Perhaps the Empking's bloc will live on even after his passing...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: gandalf5166</span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">well what did we expect?

It's currently the last week of semester and I have barely enough time to read the thread, let alone check post histories so I've been taking the walls at face value, and just glancing at the histories. Gandalf's didn't do anything to counter my feeling that he hadn't been particularly pro-town throughout. The posts of his in the past couple of pages haven't changed my mind. It is about the voting pattern so much as the posts - he has posted much more than I have, but I don't think he's actually said much more. If you feel I'm wrong on that count could you explain? (Every game is a learning experience, where I try to not make  at least one mistake I've made before and so far this game has given me: Do not trust workload when signing up as indicative of workload during, I'd like to add in some other insights if you have some to share).<br><br>Mafia is like chess: the endgame is the simplest to learn and has the simplest aim; the middle is too complex to be easily defined as a series of moves; and the early game can be defined as well as chess openings and has many different objectives - scumhunting while not drawing power roles into the spotlight being one. I am not yet good at the early game (so I can't and won't claim to be certain about another player on day 1 unless they do something which obviously and strongly leans one way or the other), and will not have the time to go through the thread post by post in the mindset of \"What would scum do? until Saturday-ish when I get home for a week. (I really did think I would have time last weekend, but I had forgotten a differential equations assignment and hadn't banked on one of my friends destroying my account on the university computers for lols.) Proper defence and my own personal wall coming up on Saturday the 9th.<br><br>I still think that you are probably town, and that my vote belongs on gandalf who seems less so."}

I'm saying that if Vox is right, that I had scum motive for not moving my vote back to Gandy, then I, (1) would also have had scum motive to jump on the VC reset opportunity immediately, and (2) would have been paying close enough attention to not proclaim that I liked my non-existent Gandy vote.<br><br>BTW, \"wanting to redeem myself\" sounds much more like scum motive to me, so you saying that I should have voted Gandy again for those reasons is pretty bad.  And It isn't that I think Vox's point is incredibad, it's that I think he's looking for scum motive in an action progression that doesn't really suggest scum motive.  I wouldn't characterize that as a \"technicality,\" but that's just me.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What about CD? You're both forgetting to acknowledge that he directly asked Ot to fullclaim (twice) before Amrun even mentioned anything.</div></blockquote><br><br>You're right.  When I have a bit more time, I'll go back to re-read CD.  TBH, I just skimmed his plethora of walls and I don't exactly relish going back into them, but...yeah.  I think on the basis of wanting a fullclaim, I think CD iz scummier than Amrun.<br><br>That being said, deadline is in four days, and I want us to have a bit of time to allow for claims/CC's if need be, which means that we have two viable wagons atm--Gandy and RC.  I gots a midterm to take, and after that, I'll do some meditating/osmosis/psychic whatnot and re-allocate my vote.  Tarson can wait.<br><br>Also, this thread needs more bvoigt.  I feel like we haven't heard from him in a while.<br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DarthYoshi trips over his own feet and faceplants in the lava.

My vote has been on Gandalf for about 2 days now, constantly,  and I'm not sure that counts as getting on 2 wagons.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, she fails to scumhunt, instead focusing on a point accusing her of wagoning. I don't really think a townie would be concerned about how AV defined wagoning.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>tarsonisocelot wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>Derp, you're right, Tarson, it was CD.  Although Amrun also seems to want a fullclaim.  In any case, demanding a fullclaim from Otolia is, IMO, scummy.  We already know he's a dayvig, knowing whether he is multi-shot will probably not do much to tell town his alignment, as scum dayvigs are considered normal, but will tell the scum plenty about how much of a threat he remains to them.<br><br>So...Tarson, in 1-2 sentences, what's your read on Amrun so far?</div></blockquote><br>I'm not sure about them. They seem defensive but not overly so about what they feel are misreps - in the cases where people have attributed quotes of other people to them I can understand that.<br><br>Amrun made one slightly unexpected claim request of Otolia which Amrun says was in response to Otolia's \"one-shot or am I?\" comment, though there appears to have been a time delay between them. CoolDog later directly requested for Otolia to fullclaim. As this could be considered to be quite scummy especially if it was by someone who had already asked, I can see why Amrun would not want it mistakenly attributed to them. <br><br>At present Amrun is not one of my top suspects. I'd need more than the Otolia claim thing to decide they were scummier than Red or gandalf.<br><br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">tarsonisocelot tried to jump up onto a chair, but his legs were chained to the floor, so now he's only got a torso</span></span></div></blockquote><br><br>This post isn't as defensive, but it doesn't give any real reads, either.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>tarsonisocelot wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>Bitter much?<br><br>Yes, I wanted to lynch you for joking.

I was just getting a VI-read at first, but Tarson doesn't really seem like a VI after all. Instead, she just seems like a newbie scum who is more focused on defense than scumhunting. I don't know if we have time to wagon her before the deadline, but I'll move my vote if necessary (and would prefer a Red lynch over a Gandalf lynch)."}

Out of 82 posts between them 11 had some mention of or interaction with the other (7AV posts, 4DY posts) not including the 2 vote history posts by AV.

You both vote without really giving reasons.]<br>#133 AV [I've got several reasons.<br>              #1 - wagonning is pro-town in RVS, she didn't wagon, so that's a (admittedly weak) starter<br>              #2 - overdefensiveness, claiming people hate her the most when she's not the leading wagon<br>              #3 - that she was joking seemed disingenuous<br>              #4 - now there's the unvote to get out of RVS which I've already said I don't like<br>              #5 - there's also the caution I talk about below]<br><br>#266 AV [Votes were reset, you're not voting anyone atm. Come on, read the mod's posts now.]<br><br>#374 AV [AV's random vote analysis of the day: To me this screams of scum using the reset vote count to remain off their buddy's wagon <br>              that they got on for distancing reasons earlier in the day. People that are most suspicious for doing this are DY and VV.<br>              DY has moved onto lurker pressure despite saying he still finds Gandalf suspicious, thereby abandoning a decent wagon <br>              on one of his supposedly top scumspects.]<br><br>#378 DY [In my #249, I mistakenly thought my vote was still on Gandy even though the VC had been reset after Otolia offed Empking. <br>              I think you're giving me entirely too much credit in paying attention enough to be able to use the reset VC for nefarious purposes. <br>              In any event, I think using one's vote to get reactions out of a player that has flown under the radar is a pretty good use of <br>              one's vote.]<br><br>#379 AV [^Not a legitimate rebuttal. You voted for TO after I'd told you that the vote count was reset so whether you realised or not in<br>             your #249 is irrelevant.]<br><br>#384 DY [It's not irrelevant. I'm saying that if I were paying close enough attention to the VC to want to manipulate it like that, I would <br>              have probably not had an oversight like that. Either way, I didn't re-issue a vote immediately after you pointed it out anyways, <br>              and if I had wanted to deploy it elsewhere, I could have long before I pounced on Tarson for her latest wagon vote.]<br><br>#391 AV [@Otolia, DY: What about CD? You're both forgetting to acknowledge that he directly asked Ot to fullclaim (twice) before Amrun <br>              even mentioned anything.]<br><br>#419 AV [You've had documented suspicions of Gandalf for a long time now. Why do you need time to decide between him and <br>              RC? &lt;--- Translation: if Gandalf is scum then this is DY trying to not bus his buddy. Lynch Gandalf and ride with me to victory.<br><br>              RE: the vote shift, even without taking the vote reset into account, abandoning a Gandalf vote to pressure a lurker has mostly <br>              the same effect.]<br><br>#421 DY [Because I've been letting RC skate by for most of the day on a neutral read, and given the vehemence of some of the other <br>              players in his scumminess, I want to make sure I'm putting my vote in the right place before deadline. This has more to do with <br>              RC than with Gandalf.]<br><br>#428 AV [My lynch preference is:<br><br>             Gandalf<br>             DY/Tarson<br>             RC<br>             I would join DY or Tarson's wagon if those had the support.]<br><br>Posts omit sections not dealing with the other player.<br><br>In some places while not talking to each other they have seemed to echo each others logic, but I don't think in a way that indicates anything other than it being plausible.<br><br>I don't think they are a scum team and I think DY substatially more likely to be scum than AV who I think is town. But you should read and see if you come to the same conclusions or if there are any interactions I've missed.<br><br>I'm still happy with my gandalf vote. especially after re-seeing posts like :<br><blockquote><div><cite>gandalf wrote:</cite>I think you guys are missing a key concept of playing town: ATTRACTING ATTENTION IS BAD.

I don't understand why you even bothered to acknowledge it if you weren't interested in following through. Well, at least I'll know that for any future games I happen to come across with you guys, because now I'm getting the full load of crap by CD over it and neither of you have enough balls to stand up to him with me. <br><br>Of course I'm not scum. AV knows that, he was pretending to drunk vote me so he could force me out. That doesn't look good on him. He also helped point me to DY, and then he abandons the case entirely for no reason? That doesn't make any sense at all. Amrun has contributed nothing of value here. She's just riding on CD's coattails. Scum points, but, I wouldn't call her scum necessarily. Shift is avoiding the thread. People are letting him avoid the thread. I like how CD attacks me for \"following AV\", but when Shift follows him around it's not big deal. Frankly, I'd be more inclined to call him scum than not at this point. Otolia is being Otolia. He doesn't like me personally so he's taking out that dislike by voting me (just like how he shot Empking because he disliked him). I mean, there was reasoning to shoot Empking because of the whole \"shoot yourself\" comment, but he acted far too rashly. That shot could've been much better served. Still, he's town, so there's not much sense in arguing the point. CD is still town, just misguided and stubborn. <br><br>So, I would say, if we're doing a traditional three scum situation, a team of AV, Shift, and DY right now. gorilla, Amrun, and gandalf are other possibilities that may plug in there, but those are all weaker scumreads for me at this point. Vas, CD, Otolia, and bvoigt all strike me as pretty firmly town. tarsonis is still so-so. She doesn't seem like much of a factor, but not in a sinister way like Shift.<br><br>I'm a Jailkeeper, btw.

She's still my #1, but seems to be the #2 or 3 of a lot of people and I still strongly feel she would be a good lynch candidate for the town, albeit a compromise one at this point.

If Tarson is scum and she doesn\u2019t hang, I blame you.<br><br>@bvoigt: Yeah, obv it\u2019s a contradiction, but you\u2019re taking my two statements completely out of chronological context\u2014one came after another player (Vox) basically says that any scum should claim PR because, hey, it works.  Then, a scummy-looking player makes a PR claim that can\u2019t possibly be counterclaimed.  That would be one hell of a coincidence.<br><br>@Otolia: Yeah, no shit, they\u2019re alternating letters.  If I just lined up \u201cDOCTOR\u201d in a nice little column like that, I\u2019m pretty sure at least one of the scum would notice.  Also, I don\u2019t believe Tarsonis\u2019s softclaim at all.<br><br>@Gandalf: Voting me because of mod meta?  Of a mod that hasn\u2019t modded before?  Hahahahahaha.  Moving on\u2026<br><br>@Hito: As you\u2019ll see when you continue reading, my \u201cDone catching up\u201d phrase was there very deliberately, it was breadcrumbing my role.<br><br>Finally, @ Tarsonis: You don\u2019t claim before L-1, you try to get the bandwagon off of you before L-1.  Yeah, I already thought you were scummy, but when you give up and claim THAT early, to me that says you don\u2019t think you can adequately defend yourself or explain your actions, which makes it even more likely to me that you are scum.  Softclaiming also makes it super convenient that you cannot possibly be CC\u2019ed.  And, if you actually are town, then way to hand the scum another target who I cannot protect tonight, which is exactly why there is no town motive in a claim like that, only scum motive.  I just can\u2019t see a town PR endangering themselves like that over an L-3 wagon, even close to deadline, when there are so many other rival wagons.<br><br>Does nobody else get how awful Tarsonis\u2019s claim was?  Ugh.  Plus, riddle me this\u2014if I were scum, and presumably purely in survival mode, why would I draw this kind of attention to myself in trying to get the town to lynch a softclaimed PR, rather than trying to bandwagon someone else?  Tarsonis\u2019s claim is THAT fucking bad.<br><br>Everyone else needs to take a step back and take a reality check.  The contradictions you\u2019re pinning on me don\u2019t fly because Vox basically gave scum carte blanche to claim whatever PRs they might feel like, and if you re-read Tarsonis\u2019s softclaim, you\u2019ll see how virulently anti-town it is.  If you kill me now, there\u2019s probably no way town can protect the rest of its PRs.  It will be far better to keep me around and if you still feel the need to lynch me later, then policy lynch me before LyLo.  At least then I\u2019ll either have a shot at helping the town out for a few nights, or I\u2019ll force the scum to use their NK on me rather than on a PR who isn\u2019t as suspicious as I currently am."}

I never had much of any read on her, and I don't see how other people could've prior to a few pages ago. Two, she implied she was an investigative role, which is basically the only other type of common \"role type\" left to claim. It's not worth the risk. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AV 614 wrote:</cite>Does anyone OPPOSE the DY lynch?</div></blockquote><br><br>I do. It's unnecessary. Having a claimed VT out and stay alive is pointless on D1. The scum won't touch hito if he's not scum. We'll have to investigate him (assuming we have an investigative role). He's not particularly townie, certainly not above lynching. <br><br>I mean, I don't know how you can say, after Shift's performance, you must have some super townread on hito here.

I mean, even him voting bvoigt I'm not too comfortable with, but I can't expect him to vote himself. Anyone else voting bvoigt over hito is beyond me. I was not raised to give the entire scumteam a full mass claim on the first day. This is unprecedented for me. We did extremely poorly to out the players we have already outted, to make matters worse is just an entire game in denial. We need to take our lumps. We're just making matters worse to go down the line asking for claims. <br><br>Let's look at two different scenarios, okay? I want everyone voting bvoigt to answer for these scenarios:<br><br>If bvoigt claims a PR, what will do do? Go to gorilla next? Then AV?

Prefer Shift/hito over DY. I liked hito's content, though.</div></blockquote><br><br>I like hito myself, but this isn't picking a partner for playtime, this is we need to preserve what little we have left that the scum don't know about. Forcing another claim is just not something we want to do right now. No one can tell me they have a good enough read on the hito/Shift slot to convince me otherwise. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>You seem to think fakeclaiming a PR is free. It's not.<br><br>If scum fakeclaim a PR D1, it's HARD to keep the lie alive.</div></blockquote><br><br>I understand this, but that doesn't change the fact that you're out. I mean, I get it, you're playing to your win condition here regardless of your alignment, but the town doesn't need the liabilty of having an outted VT sitting around. If we don't lynch you today, the scum won't kill you, and we'll have outted yet another player. <br><br>No one can sit here and say, after Shift's performance, that they have some sort of super townread on you, in my opinion. Not enough to justify doing more damage to the town PRs. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>I don't want to give the scum a fucking roadmap here but I know what I'm doing. Trying to force my lynch because I'm the only claimed VT is a little suspect, man. It's like you're trying to get me lynched while the stars are aligned for it, because you KNOW you can't use this shit excuse tomorrow and maybe also you know that when I'm town I'm pretty good about showing it.</div></blockquote><br><br>Well, I happen to know you play a mean scum game, but that's beside the point. I'd want this slot lynched regardless of who took it. Frankly, I don't see why people ever left the wagon. SOP for town is not to bring someone to L-1, force a claim, and then try it again if they claim VT. That's not smart play. <br><br>Trust me, had I been around when they did this to tarsonis, I would've been all up in their collective grills.<br><br>I will not allow them to do it again to bvoigt if I can help it. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>We shouldn't be paralyzed in fear of voting for someone who hasn't claimed.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is hyperbole, but on D1, yes, it is poor play to jump from wagon to wagon forcing people to claim and then, after they claim, decide that they sound townie \"after all\". <br><br>I mean, if that's the case, we might as well all claim and get it over with. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>Because I'm not scum and he probably is. I think you are forgetting that some people are scum and some people are not scum, and the distinction between them is sliiiiightly more important than whether or not they're a power role.</div></blockquote><br><br>I actually have a townread on bvoigt, thank you very much. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AV 631 wrote:</cite>You were into RCscum for a long time. Why are you more prepared to vote DY at deadline than RC, who you find scummier according to your posts?<br>You were willing to wagon Shift when DY claimed doctor. Why did you change wagons back then after Shift's VT claim? Are you only interested in outing claims from players?</div></blockquote><br><br>I know it sounds ridiculous to say this out loud, but this is really what I'm thinking, AV. It boggles my mind that people are jumping from wagon to wagon so willy-nilly. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hito 642 wrote:</cite>We are significantly LESS likely to have a PR claim from bvoigt than an average wagon in an average game. Ergo not wanting to lynch someone because they're unclaimed is LESS of an issue in this D1 than in 95% of game D1's. This is common sense. Scum already HAVE at least one PR claim to shoot. Savvy?</div></blockquote><br><br>This is unfair. It doesn't matter if bvoigt is a PR or not, the damage is done if he claims regardless. His anonymity, role-wise, is what we're trying to preserve here. <br><br>Additionally, scum have to face a certain degree of WIFOM at the moment in regards to their shot. Outting another PR would only increase their chances. Outting a VT would only help them plan their strategy more effectively. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hito 653 wrote:</cite>It was bad to force so many claims, but <span style=\"font-style: italic\">now that it's already been done</span>, going for another is LESS bad than usual, because scum freedom to fakeclaim is remarkably diminished and scum already know PR's to shoot. To rephrase it another way: it's not a good thing to drink poison, but if you're already drunk five gallons that sixth gallon isn't nearly so bad as it is to go from 0-1.</div></blockquote><br><br>I understand this point. It's a good one and a rational one, it's just not strong enough. <br><br>You and bvoigt are on the same level here. Take \"reads\" out of it. One of you is a claimed VT. A VT is only good to have around as mafia kill fodder and for his ability to avoid eating a lynch from the town. Remember, this is taking personalities out of the equation. You cannot uphold the first part of your expectations here. That's not your fault, of course, but that's just what you're dealt with. bvoigt is still able to meet both of these expectations, especially given that we have two protective roles out. <br><br>Now, I mean, should the scenario that we face be something like, I don't know, 4 Cop claims, then your argument may carry enough weight to justify losing bvoigt over you. As it stands, we need to hold on to every scrap of anonymity we have D1. Once the chips fall over the course of tonight and possibly tomorrow night, we'll be more flexible to lynch whomever we wish. Until then, however, we've got to move with what Shift left you and what all the people who forced tarsonis out left us. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>gorilla 657 wrote:</cite>in other news, am i the only one who thinks the logic of \"we should lynch hito because he's a claimed VT\" sounds a bit like scum logic? I'm honestly not finding hito as scummy as any of the PR claims and I didn't think shift was that scummy, only voted him because I thought we were doing a deadline scramble. I feel like a few people are really trying to railroad things here</div></blockquote><br><br>Come off it, gorilla.<br><br>You were a serious factor in all of this nonsense.

And it looks like at least some of the town is falling for it already.<br><br>So yeah, I think it is pretty clear that scum left me out to hang because clearly I am an easier mislynch than TO proved to have been, and they're gambling that y'all will do the job of disposing of me for them so that they don't have to use a NK on me, and this makes me fairly confident that my wagon is being scum-driven atm.<br><br>bvoigt's reactions at the end of D1 are scummy as fuck.  Gives us no thoughts to help us out in case he flips town, basically asks us what we want from him.  That be appeasement, dude.<br><br>Otolia's point about Vas is, I think, actually pretty compelling, and Vox says as much why.  I'm also remembering how easily I let Vas convince me that Gandy was town on the basis of one post, then Gandy comes out of the gate and doesn't even think to explain his vote, just hops right on with bvoigt.  Hito was right, those two are freaking joined at the hip.  Then Vas does it too.<br><br>And, Vas, you're full of shit.  One of the games I declared V/LA in is one that you're freaking in.

The day is young and yet this is the second time Vas has already been caught red-handed in a demonstrably disprovable argument.  His first defense is weak--no way scum would be caught in a lie like that (when scumslips happen all the time)--and the scum motive in his early D2 actions is blatantly apparent.  He needs to die.<br><br>If hito was right (and I'm beginning to think he was) that bvoigt and Gandy are scum together, I'm gonna list my top scumspects atm as being vas, bvoigt, and gandy.

I'm a doctor.<br><br>---<br><br>Okayy, I think it has come to a point that I don't even know where I'm going with this. (Plus this is fun. Tee hee)<br><br>TLDR:<br>During the DY wagon, our threesome here have been interacting with each other in a very orchestrated way. It's almost like they are completing each other's sentences. Seriously. Scroll through Page 20-22. See how DY/AV/Amrun interact. Now look at how everyone else interacts.<br><br>Here's a quick version:<br>DY was in trouble, yes? AV took it as an opportunity to distance via #482. After the vote he then inexplicably votes RC at his #491. Later at #503, proceeds check specifically with Amrun on what they should do. <br><br>DY is at L-2. Amrun says that she has intent to hammer, but doesn't. AV puts DY at L1.<br>AV and Amrun now explicitly talks to one another about how they should handle this situation <span style=\"font-style: italic\">pre DYclaim.</span> with their #509-#511.<br><br>DY finally claims at #514. Amrun tests waters with her #519 to see if anyone would hammer since RC and DY are supposedly JK and doc. GAndalf talks about chess, and then she specifically states chesskid as the reason on why JK/Doc is possible.<br><br>The crux of this: DY's #543 also states chesskid as a reason.<br><br>Now let's put this into perspective.<br>AV Town would have no reason to be needlessly specific and call out sAmrun to talk about DY in his #503. Townies don't just call up random people to discuss wagons. They discuss with everyone.<br>Amrun Town would have no reason to not put DY at L-1 in her #506. If she were an honest true Townie, she'd keep her own count and see that DY was at L-2 when she said she had intent to hammer in her #506.<br>DY is 100% scum because there are two people who are obviously conspiring with him. I don't need to put a situation with DY Town, simply because consiprations are the stuff scum do, not Town.<br><br>DY/AV/Amrun are scum. BANK IT.<br><br>Note to self: HOLY SHIT. IF I'M ACTUALLY RIGHT ABOUT THIS, I JUST MADE THE BEST CASE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.<br>I'LL BE SO PROUD OF MYSELF, I MIGHT ACTUALLY CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY OR SOMETHING.

I just explained why it is bad to say that and moved on. You aren't wise enough to go by as the insults fly and that is your responsibility (and mine for saying it) You can't deny that you have been putting oil on the fire. I acknowledge VV's post on his scumlist and both of you restarted the stupid mocking machine. I have tolerated your behavior too long to shut up now.

Unlike AV, DY's associative tells seem to be LACK of mention.  DY barely talks to/of AV at all; addresses RC a couple of times, which is inevitable since he was forced to claim d1, but he NEVER takes a firm stance on RC, even when putting him at L-1.  He answers some questions of RC's and even mentions some things he \"doesn't like\" about those, but never expresses any suspicion at all of RC.

I'm saying that if Vox is right, that I had scum motive for not moving my vote back to Gandy, then I, (1) would also have had scum motive to jump on the VC reset opportunity immediately, and (2) would have been paying close enough attention to not proclaim that I liked my non-existent Gandy vote.<br><br>BTW, \"wanting to redeem myself\" sounds much more like scum motive to me, so you saying that I should have voted Gandy again for those reasons is pretty bad.  And It isn't that I think Vox's point is incredibad, it's that I think he's looking for scum motive in an action progression that doesn't really suggest scum motive.  I wouldn't characterize that as a \"technicality,\" but that's just me.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>^ That basically looks like 3-way scum-coaching to me...

If they were both scum, they'd both know that.  (That's arguable, just throwing it out there.)  DY even goes so far as to defend RC's claim, not once but several times.<br><br><br>RC's ISO:<br><br>Some of the exchanges between RC and AV are suspect, which is something I noted as far back as D1, when I was convinced RC was scum.  RC agrees with AV a LOT and they vote extremely similarly, which CD attacks them for and what helped put RC at L-1.  AV defended RC vigorously on these points, quoted above.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>AV, gorilla... nice voting bloc. I don't understand why you even bothered to acknowledge it if you weren't interested in following through. Well, at least I'll know that for any future games I happen to come across with you guys, because now I'm getting the full load of crap by CD over it and neither of you have enough balls to stand up to him with me. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Of course I'm not scum. AV knows that, he was pretending to drunk vote me so he could force me out. That doesn't look good on him. He also helped point me to DY, and then he abandons the case entirely for no reason? That doesn't make any sense at all. </span>Amrun has contributed nothing of value here. She's just riding on CD's coattails. Scum points, but, I wouldn't call her scum necessarily. Shift is avoiding the thread. People are letting him avoid the thread.<span class=\"noboldsig\"> I like how CD attacks me for \"following AV\", but when Shift follows him around it's not big deal. </span>Frankly, I'd be more inclined to call him scum than not at this point. Otolia is being Otolia. He doesn't like me personally so he's taking out that dislike by voting me (just like how he shot Empking because he disliked him). I mean, there was reasoning to shoot Empking because of the whole \"shoot yourself\" comment, but he acted far too rashly. That shot could've been much better served. Still, he's town, so there's not much sense in arguing the point. CD is still town, just misguided and stubborn. <br><br>So, I would say, if we're doing a<span class=\"noboldsig\"> traditional three scum situation, a team of AV, Shift, and DY</span> right now. gorilla, Amrun, and gandalf are other possibilities that may plug in there, but those are all weaker scumreads for me at this point. Vas, CD, Otolia, and bvoigt all strike me as pretty firmly town. tarsonis is still so-so. She doesn't seem like much of a factor, but not in a sinister way like Shift.<br><br>I'm a Jailkeeper, btw. Planning on jailing Otolia tonight.</div></blockquote><br><br>^The above post is all kinds of bad I didn't notice before.  How does RC know that AV \"knows\" RC isn't scum?  This sounds like an RC-annoyed-with-his-scumteam.  Then a little bit of \"why me?\" with the attack on CD and then the strangest thing of all:  the declaration of 3 scum and an AV, Shift, DY scumteam.  We know that AV/DY are definitely 2/3 of the scumteam (3 because if it were 2, the game would be over), but where did AV come from in this situation?  RC had been taking heat all day for his \"conditional townread\" on AV.  This looks like busing to me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>Come off it, AV. You're still voting me when obviously the vote count has just shown you that there is clearly enough support.</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh, yes.  An angry RC is yelling at his scumbuddy AV for being Bussy McBuserson.<br><br><br>Then he never suspects AV again until it's serious wagon time, only agrees with him some more, but does throw him in a random scumteam list again for no discernible reason.<br><br>Also very worthy of note is that RC was really the only one besides me that believed DY's claim and went beyond that to defending him.  (Obviously, this is the part about the case against me that I understand perfectly.)<br><br>He calls AV scum when he's being seriously wagoned, but NEVER VOTES AV, just as he NEVER VOTED DY on the wagon that led to his lynch, despite professing suspicion of DY heavily on D1 and professing ambivalence the day of.<br><br><br>And then we find out that RC was lying all along -- and I CAN see a town motivation for this, if RC wasn't scummy at all.  But I thought RC was scum on d1 and the ONLY thing that deterred me was the JK claim.  Claimed BPs are useless to town anyway, and I don't feel nervous about lynching a claimed BP that is extremely scummy both through his own play and through associative tells of flipped scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>Oh, bvoigt, you may be right. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">CD is talking about me in that sentence, isn't he?

There were several posts you made, Amrun, where you said stuff along the lines of \"AV is scummy... but I'm not sure\" or \"DY is scummy, but then again, let me think about it\". You switched your vote a lot as well. I'm not just saying this to be critical, just that you're generally not going to be given top honors for town play with those kinds of posts. There was no big leadership aura coming from you for most of the game. <br><br>Understand I'm saying this with respect. That's how I am in a lot of games too, you know? Some games, as town, you're on top of everything, and some you just can't get it to happen. This game serves as a really interesting division between playstyles now that everything is concluded. CD and Vas were both fairly consistent throughout the game (one being right a majority of the time and the other being wrong a majority of the time read-wise), while I feel like us two were both inconsistent (you being right, me being wrong read-wise). I straightened up in the end when it mattered, but, if you take that and the claim situation away, I don't think I had a particularly great performance. I don't mean playstyle in the permanent sense either, I just mean for this specific game. That's why I don't put too much stock in meta arguments (but that's a whole different discussion). <br><br>I don't know if that all makes sense. I'm just trying to say that you shouldn't fret because if you play enough you'll hit that game where you just are really on top of it. If it can happen to me, it will definitely happen to you (if it hasn't already). I've had games where I was an <a href=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/archive/viewtopic.php?p=1703352#p1703352\" class=\"postlink\">absolutely rock solid scumhunter</a>, and games where the scum <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2210463#p2210463\" class=\"postlink\">played me like a fiddle</a>. Most of the time you just end up somewhere between those extremes. All things being equal, I only play mafia for the chance at being scum anyways. Honestly, as rewarding as it is to have a win like this, I get much more joy out of playing the bad guy.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\">"}
