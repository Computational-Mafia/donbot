Had.<br>\n<br>\nLast night, a <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">wonderful event</div> terrible tragedy had occured.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OvmuvHN8HnM/SjaCJKdsj3I/AAAAAAAABMc/UfsRcAh39gQ/s400/FishSlap.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fate, Town Mason, has been slapped in the face with a fish on Night Zero, then shot.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter some investigation, you conclude as a town that, unbelievably enough, the attack on Fate wasn't personal at all.<br>\nThere are those among you who wish to slap each of you in the face with a fish, then shoot you.<br>\n<br>\nStop them.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rules</div></div> (stolen from Faraday who stole them from Hoopla with some modifications).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Fundamental</div> <br>\n1) The site-wide rules apply, please read them and don't do anything stupid. <br>\n2) Unless it is explicitly stated in your role PM that you can do so, do not talk about this game outside of the game thread. <br>\n3) Do not quote any communication you have with me, the moderator of the game. Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. This includes timestamps of role pm's. You may share the quotation in your role pm, if there is one, however. This doesn't have to be paraphrased.<br>\n4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. <br>\n4a) No Sig/Avatar bets, I can't have someone having an awful avatar as a result of my game. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death</div><br>\n5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Hoopla</div>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. <br>\n6) Unvotes aren't necessary, but will be appreciated. <br>\n7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% rounded up of the votes. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. <br>\n8) You may vote for a &#8216;no lynch&#8217; if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch. <br>\n9) Once you're dead, you are dead. You are allowed one contentless \"bah\" post which may only contain the letters \"F\" and \"U\". You may use as many of each letter as you want.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines</div><br>\n10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>\n11) Prods will be issued after 48 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod you I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too, I'm human I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me. <br>\n11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement. <br>\n12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 17 days unless specified as otherwise</div><br>\n14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch.<br>\n15) Nights will have a 72 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. <br>\n16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Other Information</div> <br>\npre-17) No mechanism or website may be used to prove that a decision was achieved randomly. I.e. you may chose who claims first by rolling a dice, but you'll have to trust the person who rolled the dice not to lie.<br>\n17) <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">RED</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">GREEN</div> font are my colours I will use for modly purposes. All other colors are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself. I'll not modkill you if you happen to use them, but try not to please. <br>\n18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. If you feel a vote count is needed, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for one, and I&#8217;ll provide one at the next opportunity. <br>\n19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will punish you. If something is fuzzy for you, please ask! <br>\n20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know in thread.<br>\n21) The penalty for faking violation of a rule will be the same as actually violating the rule.<br>\n22) Have fun!<br>\n23) No slapping the moderator with fish.<br>\nSample Vanilla townie role pm:\n<blockquote><div><cite>chesskid3 wrote:</cite>Welcome to \"don't get slapped in the face by a fish\" Mafia, XXX.

Townies can be cautious about early wagons, scum can pretend to be cautious about early wagons.  Not seeing the scumminess there--it's more likely a null tell.  Also, Shift, why do you think it should be automatic to claim at L-1?  I mean, aside from being used to that format--do you have reasons for thinking that?<br>\n  <br>\n-Otolia's offer to claim is really anti-town; I'm partly inclined to give him a pass on communication differences, but, still, really not good.  I do want to know, Otolia, why are you proclaiming that you will probably unvote before you have done so?<br>\n<br>\n-Gorilla, you state you're reluctant to vote Shift to L-1, but you don't say directly whether you find him suspicious.  Do you?  If not, who do you suspect at the moment?<br>\n<br>\n-Coyote, on a similar note, is your vote of Shift in #44 random or not?  I can't tell looking at it.<br>\n<br>\n-Gandalf's recent unvote raised my eyebrows.  His vote on CoolDog was doing no harm where it was at--indeed, I think it was the only one--so why the seemingly urgent necessity to unvote?

I don't know. I have played this game with a lot of different people but never a Frenchmen (reads go to the all mighty pot...). First I want to say that hate, to use the word in your post, is used as a scum hunting tool to break scum. It works better in real life when you can pick up facial expressions, but it is still very effective in this type of game. Building pressure on somebody forces them to post content, and when scum do that they sometimes (most of the time) make contradictions or slips. People pressure other people with strong wording all the time, this is a game for men/adults (sorry in advance) and rest assure that it is not personal at all.

Here is why, in bullet point form:<br>\n<br>\n-Bvoigt&#8217;s case on me boils down to: he doesn&#8217;t like people using terms like OMGUS.  I have explained over and over again why seeing OMGUS was a reasonable interpretation of Gandalf&#8217;s behavior.  More than one person has basically said that he isn&#8217;t really explaining a case on me.  I have explained my motive multiple times.  And, it must be noted that Gandalf never denied my accusation that his suspicion on me was OMGUS, so really, I think the characterization is fair.<br>\n<br>\n-Gandalf says little, and is basically sheeping bvoigt, who was his number one scumread&#8212;he even moved his vote from bvoigt to me.  Why would town sheep from someone they thought was scum?  (Looks like Gorilla already picked up on this.)  BTW, I want to remove myself from the spotlight?  I&#8217;m trying to remain as active as I can, even though I&#8217;m LA right now.<br>\n<br>\n-Additionally, Gandalf&#8217;s statements imply he is basically voting me because of a connection between me and Amrun, which until there have been flips, is a fool&#8217;s errand to try and interpret.  I&#8217;ve said this to him already.<br>\n<br>\n-VV says that bvoigt&#8217;s argument is &#8220;convincing,&#8221; but then says that he doesn&#8217;t understand it.  How can you claim to be convinced by something you don&#8217;t understand?  This is the second consecutive awful post from VV.<br>\n<br>\nIn short, two players are sheeping off of what is obviously a flawed case, to which I have already explained my motives multiple times, and both of those two players are doing so after I put some heat in their direction, so their motives seem pretty obvious.  Now for a few particular responses to bvoigt&#8230;<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>a (probably) gut-based read without any reasons isn't going to put any suspicion on you or discredit your scumhunting.</div></blockquote>\n\nRly?  You don&#8217;t think anyone would be like, even for a bit, &#8220;Mmm, maybe I should re-read Yoshi?&#8221;  You clearly have more faith in mafia players than I do.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And yeah, I haven't posted a big case because really, no one has been majorly scummy except for Otolia.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo, your vote isn&#8217;t even on the person you think is scummiest?<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>BTW, is it just me or do Amrun and Yoshi both seem very eager to stop my questioning of them as soon as possible?</div></blockquote>\n\nIt&#8217;s just you.  BTW, you call me paranoid below?  Pot, kettle, black, etc.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This reaction to my vote seems pretty angry and paranoid. A townie simply should not be worried about one vote.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis response indicates the opposition has probably more to do with personality than alignment.  Meta me, I&#8217;m aggressive in defending myself whenever votes are placed on me.  My first game here, I was town, was quickly wagoned on D1 (not unlike here), and fought tooth and nail against being lynched, and ended up surviving the game.  BTW, I 100% disagree with you that townies should not be worried about one vote.  In my experience, townies are more likely to be more vocal towards their accusers because scum want to be more diplomatic so as to avoid irking more people and motivating them to join their wagon.", "time": "Sat Apr 02, 2011 7:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16959&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "16959"}

Vas didn't threaten to hammer Otolia like gandalf; he actually was always against the wagon.

I don't understand why you even bothered to acknowledge it if you weren't interested in following through. Well, at least I'll know that for any future games I happen to come across with you guys, because now I'm getting the full load of crap by CD over it and neither of you have enough balls to stand up to him with me. <br>\n<br>\nOf course I'm not scum. AV knows that, he was pretending to drunk vote me so he could force me out. That doesn't look good on him. He also helped point me to DY, and then he abandons the case entirely for no reason? That doesn't make any sense at all. Amrun has contributed nothing of value here. She's just riding on CD's coattails. Scum points, but, I wouldn't call her scum necessarily. Shift is avoiding the thread. People are letting him avoid the thread. I like how CD attacks me for \"following AV\", but when Shift follows him around it's not big deal. Frankly, I'd be more inclined to call him scum than not at this point. Otolia is being Otolia. He doesn't like me personally so he's taking out that dislike by voting me (just like how he shot Empking because he disliked him). I mean, there was reasoning to shoot Empking because of the whole \"shoot yourself\" comment, but he acted far too rashly. That shot could've been much better served. Still, he's town, so there's not much sense in arguing the point. CD is still town, just misguided and stubborn. <br>\n<br>\nSo, I would say, if we're doing a traditional three scum situation, a team of AV, Shift, and DY right now. gorilla, Amrun, and gandalf are other possibilities that may plug in there, but those are all weaker scumreads for me at this point. Vas, CD, Otolia, and bvoigt all strike me as pretty firmly town. tarsonis is still so-so.

After what you said in #553, you seriously wouldn&#8217;t expect someone as scummy as Tarson to try to squeak by with a PR softclaim like that?  If Tarson is scum and she doesn&#8217;t hang, I blame you.<br>\n<br>\n@bvoigt: Yeah, obv it&#8217;s a contradiction, but you&#8217;re taking my two statements completely out of chronological context&#8212;one came after another player (Vox) basically says that any scum should claim PR because, hey, it works.  Then, a scummy-looking player makes a PR claim that can&#8217;t possibly be counterclaimed.  That would be one hell of a coincidence.<br>\n<br>\n@Otolia: Yeah, no shit, they&#8217;re alternating letters.  If I just lined up &#8220;DOCTOR&#8221; in a nice little column like that, I&#8217;m pretty sure at least one of the scum would notice.  Also, I don&#8217;t believe Tarsonis&#8217;s softclaim at all.<br>\n<br>\n@Gandalf: Voting me because of mod meta?  Of a mod that hasn&#8217;t modded before?  Hahahahahaha.  Moving on&#8230;<br>\n<br>\n@Hito: As you&#8217;ll see when you continue reading, my &#8220;Done catching up&#8221; phrase was there very deliberately, it was breadcrumbing my role.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, @ Tarsonis: You don&#8217;t claim before L-1, you try to get the bandwagon off of you before L-1.  Yeah, I already thought you were scummy, but when you give up and claim THAT early, to me that says you don&#8217;t think you can adequately defend yourself or explain your actions, which makes it even more likely to me that you are scum.  Softclaiming also makes it super convenient that you cannot possibly be CC&#8217;ed.  And, if you actually are town, then way to hand the scum another target who I cannot protect tonight, which is exactly why there is no town motive in a claim like that, only scum motive.  I just can&#8217;t see a town PR endangering themselves like that over an L-3 wagon, even close to deadline, when there are so many other rival wagons.<br>\n<br>\nDoes nobody else get how awful Tarsonis&#8217;s claim was?  Ugh.  Plus, riddle me this&#8212;if I were scum, and presumably purely in survival mode, why would I draw this kind of attention to myself in trying to get the town to lynch a softclaimed PR, rather than trying to bandwagon someone else?  Tarsonis&#8217;s claim is THAT fucking bad.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone else needs to take a step back and take a reality check.  The contradictions you&#8217;re pinning on me don&#8217;t fly because Vox basically gave scum carte blanche to claim whatever PRs they might feel like, and if you re-read Tarsonis&#8217;s softclaim, you&#8217;ll see how virulently anti-town it is.  If you kill me now, there&#8217;s probably no way town can protect the rest of its PRs.  It will be far better to keep me around and if you still feel the need to lynch me later, then policy lynch me before LyLo.  At least then I&#8217;ll either have a shot at helping the town out for a few nights, or I&#8217;ll force the scum to use their NK on me rather than on a PR who isn&#8217;t as suspicious as I currently am.", "time": "Tue Apr 12, 2011 4:12 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16959&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "16959"}

He's not particularly townie, certainly not above lynching. <br>\n<br>\nI mean, I don't know how you can say, after Shift's performance, you must have some super townread on hito here.

Forcing another claim is just not something we want to do right now. No one can tell me they have a good enough read on the hito/Shift slot to convince me otherwise. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>You seem to think fakeclaiming a PR is free.

I mean, I get it, you're playing to your win condition here regardless of your alignment, but the town doesn't need the liabilty of having an outted VT sitting around. If we don't lynch you today, the scum won't kill you, and we'll have outted yet another player. <br>\n<br>\nNo one can sit here and say, after Shift's performance, that they have some sort of super townread on you, in my opinion. Not enough to justify doing more damage to the town PRs. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>I don't want to give the scum a fucking roadmap here but I know what I'm doing. Trying to force my lynch because I'm the only claimed VT is a little suspect, man. It's like you're trying to get me lynched while the stars are aligned for it, because you KNOW you can't use this shit excuse tomorrow and maybe also you know that when I'm town I'm pretty good about showing it.</div></blockquote>\n\nWell, I happen to know you play a mean scum game, but that's beside the point. I'd want this slot lynched regardless of who took it. Frankly, I don't see why people ever left the wagon. SOP for town is not to bring someone to L-1, force a claim, and then try it again if they claim VT. That's not smart play. <br>\n<br>\nTrust me, had I been around when they did this to tarsonis, I would've been all up in their collective grills.<br>\n<br>\nI will not allow them to do it again to bvoigt if I can help it. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>We shouldn't be paralyzed in fear of voting for someone who hasn't claimed.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is hyperbole, but on D1, yes, it is poor play to jump from wagon to wagon forcing people to claim and then, after they claim, decide that they sound townie \"after all\". <br>\n<br>\nI mean, if that's the case, we might as well all claim and get it over with. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hito 629 wrote:</cite>Because I'm not scum and he probably is. I think you are forgetting that some people are scum and some people are not scum, and the distinction between them is sliiiiightly more important than whether or not they're a power role.</div></blockquote>\n\nI actually have a townread on bvoigt, thank you very much. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AV 631 wrote:</cite>You were into RCscum for a long time. Why are you more prepared to vote DY at deadline than RC, who you find scummier according to your posts?<br>\nYou were willing to wagon Shift when DY claimed doctor. Why did you change wagons back then after Shift's VT claim? Are you only interested in outing claims from players?</div></blockquote>\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous to say this out loud, but this is really what I'm thinking, AV. It boggles my mind that people are jumping from wagon to wagon so willy-nilly. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hito 642 wrote:</cite>We are significantly LESS likely to have a PR claim from bvoigt than an average wagon in an average game. Ergo not wanting to lynch someone because they're unclaimed is LESS of an issue in this D1 than in 95% of game D1's. This is common sense. Scum already HAVE at least one PR claim to shoot. Savvy?</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is unfair. It doesn't matter if bvoigt is a PR or not, the damage is done if he claims regardless. His anonymity, role-wise, is what we're trying to preserve here. <br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, scum have to face a certain degree of WIFOM at the moment in regards to their shot. Outting another PR would only increase their chances. Outting a VT would only help them plan their strategy more effectively. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hito 653 wrote:</cite>It was bad to force so many claims, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">now that it's already been done</div>, going for another is LESS bad than usual, because scum freedom to fakeclaim is remarkably diminished and scum already know PR's to shoot. To rephrase it another way: it's not a good thing to drink poison, but if you're already drunk five gallons that sixth gallon isn't nearly so bad as it is to go from 0-1.</div></blockquote>\n\nI understand this point. It's a good one and a rational one, it's just not strong enough. <br>\n<br>\nYou and bvoigt are on the same level here. Take \"reads\" out of it. One of you is a claimed VT. A VT is only good to have around as mafia kill fodder and for his ability to avoid eating a lynch from the town. Remember, this is taking personalities out of the equation. You cannot uphold the first part of your expectations here. That's not your fault, of course, but that's just what you're dealt with. bvoigt is still able to meet both of these expectations, especially given that we have two protective roles out. <br>\n<br>\nNow, I mean, should the scenario that we face be something like, I don't know, 4 Cop claims, then your argument may carry enough weight to justify losing bvoigt over you. As it stands, we need to hold on to every scrap of anonymity we have D1. Once the chips fall over the course of tonight and possibly tomorrow night, we'll be more flexible to lynch whomever we wish. Until then, however, we've got to move with what Shift left you and what all the people who forced tarsonis out left us. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>gorilla 657 wrote:</cite>\nin other news, am i the only one who thinks the logic of \"we should lynch hito because he's a claimed VT\" sounds a bit like scum logic?

I feel like a few people are really trying to railroad things here</div></blockquote>\n\nCome off it, gorilla.<br>\n<br>\nYou were a serious factor in all of this nonsense.

The people who put tarsonis at L-1 need to be held accountable for their irresponsible behavior and poor judgment, because not all of them were doing it with good intentions.

He's pushing false arguments (one of RC and DY has to be scum) and was absent from giving any meaningful opinions yesterday when we needed him to.

And it looks like at least some of the town is falling for it already.</div></blockquote>\n\nFigures. I'm still not sold on you, but this actually adds up. You were pretty harshly going after tarsonis yesterday, so, I mean, unless that was a strategy, it fits with what you're saying here. Scum likely saw the same stuff. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DY 755 wrote:</cite>If hito was right (and I'm beginning to think he was) that bvoigt and Gandy are scum together</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't understand why there's anything special about bvoigt and gandalf. He brought this up twice. gandalf is the clearer scum here. bvoigt doesn't really play into it at all. I mean, are you taking the Amrun approach? bvoight voted for hito rather than himself = he's scum? I just don't see what else bvoigt was supposed to have done. If he had typed up a wall and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">then</div> voted hito, it would've been okay? <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>gandalf 757 wrote:</cite>DY, you knew tarson was an informational power role(there was already a claimed vig, and two protective power roles, so inf was all that's left) and thus KNEW that RC shouldn't protect him. And yet you decided that RC was a smarter choice? I went into night KNOWING that either you or tarson was going to die. There was NO doubt about that. TBH, I was thinking you were going to come in claiming to be roleblocked or something, because that at least would have been PLAUSIBLE. That said, I'm glad that you got Amrun to claim scum with you. Come on, don't buy this bullshit. I'm not voting you because you didn't die, I'm voting you because TARSON died.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe thing is that DY was very clear that he didn't believe tarsonis and wanted her lynched yesterday. Top that with the fact that DY said he believed me in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2952189#p2952189\" class=\"postlink\">post 543</a> and the story checks out here.  <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>VV 761 wrote:</cite>See here:<br>\nWe have RC, a protective role.<br>\nDY claimed Doctor.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, one of them is lying.</div></blockquote>\n\nUh, no.

It's more like a roleblocker than anything. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Amrun 764 wrote:</cite>Mostly I just wanted to hear DY's explanation to get it on the record.

Every players has \"scumhunted\" plenty at this point in the game, even the players I have scumreads on. Your points are so outlandish and erroneuous that you'll only cause more trouble than you already have. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DY 771 wrote:</cite>@Gandalf: YES. There was no guarantee that TO was going to be L-1ed, and if she wasn't, she'd probably be alive today, potentially with a guilty. You srsly don't see how what she did hurt the town?</div></blockquote>\n\nThis. This, this, this. The people who put tarsonis at L-1 need to be held accountable for their irresponsible behavior and poor judgment, because not all of them were doing it with good intentions. Shift was our lynch yesterday after the unfortunate claims, and the shift (heh) away from him because he claimed VT was a bad, bad, bad call. <br>\n<br>\nAV, gandalf, and bvoigt all knew better than to move that wagon. Therein lies maybe a better connection between gandalf and bvoigt than I gave credit for. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nVV's defense that he \"never slips up as scum\" is an absolute joke. He's pushing false arguments (one of RC and DY has to be scum) and was absent from giving any meaningful opinions yesterday when we needed him to. Not just the V/LA, but it was clearly shown that he made a post after both claims were out and, further, tried to pretend like he didn't. <br>\n<br>\nVV and gandalf are scum with a possible third being a bvoigt or AV, but I'm not prepared to really speculate at the third here when we don't need to. It'll get give scum ammunition for misdirection. I would be content with either wagon. <br>\n<br>\nOtolia, do you have another shot today?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: VasudeVa</div></div></blockquote>\nYou see RC the problem I have with you is that you don't scum hunt. Show me where you aggressively go after a player that you want lynched. There be a difference between \"I think he is scummy\" and \"Answer my questions\". And your above post is a massive defense of DY.<br>\n<br>\n@whoever asked about not lynching dy, simply put dy is not RC or VV. And because of that they aren't on the table atm.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>bvoigt wrote:</cite>Let's talk about it after the game.</div></blockquote>\nIn my personal opinion this is how talking about peoples play should happen. I actually want your input after the game as well.<br>\n<br>\n@VV, so you would lynch DY over rc solely based on the provability of a power role that he has claimed?

Tee hee)<br>\n<br>\nTLDR:<br>\nDuring the DY wagon, our threesome here have been interacting with each other in a very orchestrated way. It's almost like they are completing each other's sentences. Seriously. Scroll through Page 20-22. See how DY/AV/Amrun interact. Now look at how everyone else interacts.<br>\n<br>\nHere's a quick version:<br>\nDY was in trouble, yes? AV took it as an opportunity to distance via #482. After the vote he then inexplicably votes RC at his #491. Later at #503, proceeds check specifically with Amrun on what they should do. <br>\n<br>\nDY is at L-2. Amrun says that she has intent to hammer, but doesn't. AV puts DY at L1.<br>\nAV and Amrun now explicitly talks to one another about how they should handle this situation <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">pre DYclaim.</div> with their #509-#511.<br>\n<br>\nDY finally claims at #514. Amrun tests waters with her #519 to see if anyone would hammer since RC and DY are supposedly JK and doc. GAndalf talks about chess, and then she specifically states chesskid as the reason on why JK/Doc is possible.<br>\n<br>\nThe crux of this: DY's #543 also states chesskid as a reason.<br>\n<br>\nNow let's put this into perspective.<br>\nAV Town would have no reason to be needlessly specific and call out sAmrun to talk about DY in his #503.

Unlike AV, DY's associative tells seem to be LACK of mention.  DY barely talks to/of AV at all; addresses RC a couple of times, which is inevitable since he was forced to claim d1, but he NEVER takes a firm stance on RC, even when putting him at L-1.  He answers some questions of RC's and even mentions some things he \"doesn't like\" about those, but never expresses any suspicion at all of RC.  DY tries his very best to stay neutral on RC and it looks quite bad.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>RC wrote:</cite>No, I went back and read over what AV was talking about. I don't see why you're trying to twist this issue around. You're acting like you should be immune from suspicion by giving us all this WIFOM, but, in reality, if you wanted to redeem yourself, you'd either change your vote back to gandalf or you'd at least recognize the point AV is trying to make here. Instead, this reads like you're trying to excuse yourself on some technicality. It's just very icky sounding.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt isn't WIFOM.  I'm saying that if Vox is right, that I had scum motive for not moving my vote back to Gandy, then I, (1) would also have had scum motive to jump on the VC reset opportunity immediately, and (2) would have been paying close enough attention to not proclaim that I liked my non-existent Gandy vote.<br>\n<br>\nBTW, \"wanting to redeem myself\" sounds much more like scum motive to me, so you saying that I should have voted Gandy again for those reasons is pretty bad.  And It isn't that I think Vox's point is incredibad, it's that I think he's looking for scum motive in an action progression that doesn't really suggest scum motive.  I wouldn't characterize that as a \"technicality,\" but that's just me.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^ That basically looks like 3-way scum-coaching to me...

If they were both scum, they'd both know that.  (That's arguable, just throwing it out there.)  DY even goes so far as to defend RC's claim, not once but several times.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRC's ISO:<br>\n<br>\nSome of the exchanges between RC and AV are suspect, which is something I noted as far back as D1, when I was convinced RC was scum.  RC agrees with AV a LOT and they vote extremely similarly, which CD attacks them for and what helped put RC at L-1.  AV defended RC vigorously on these points, quoted above.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>AV, gorilla... nice voting bloc. I don't understand why you even bothered to acknowledge it if you weren't interested in following through. Well, at least I'll know that for any future games I happen to come across with you guys, because now I'm getting the full load of crap by CD over it and neither of you have enough balls to stand up to him with me. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Of course I'm not scum. AV knows that, he was pretending to drunk vote me so he could force me out. That doesn't look good on him. He also helped point me to DY, and then he abandons the case entirely for no reason? That doesn't make any sense at all. </div>Amrun has contributed nothing of value here. She's just riding on CD's coattails. Scum points, but, I wouldn't call her scum necessarily. Shift is avoiding the thread. People are letting him avoid the thread.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> I like how CD attacks me for \"following AV\", but when Shift follows him around it's not big deal. </div>Frankly, I'd be more inclined to call him scum than not at this point. Otolia is being Otolia. He doesn't like me personally so he's taking out that dislike by voting me (just like how he shot Empking because he disliked him). I mean, there was reasoning to shoot Empking because of the whole \"shoot yourself\" comment, but he acted far too rashly. That shot could've been much better served. Still, he's town, so there's not much sense in arguing the point. CD is still town, just misguided and stubborn. <br>\n<br>\nSo, I would say, if we're doing a<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> traditional three scum situation, a team of AV, Shift, and DY</div> right now. gorilla, Amrun, and gandalf are other possibilities that may plug in there, but those are all weaker scumreads for me at this point. Vas, CD, Otolia, and bvoigt all strike me as pretty firmly town. tarsonis is still so-so. She doesn't seem like much of a factor, but not in a sinister way like Shift.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a Jailkeeper, btw. Planning on jailing Otolia tonight.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^The above post is all kinds of bad I didn't notice before.  How does RC know that AV \"knows\" RC isn't scum?  This sounds like an RC-annoyed-with-his-scumteam.  Then a little bit of \"why me?\" with the attack on CD and then the strangest thing of all:  the declaration of 3 scum and an AV, Shift, DY scumteam.  We know that AV/DY are definitely 2/3 of the scumteam (3 because if it were 2, the game would be over), but where did AV come from in this situation?  RC had been taking heat all day for his \"conditional townread\" on AV.  This looks like busing to me.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>Come off it, AV. You're still voting me when obviously the vote count has just shown you that there is clearly enough support.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOh, yes.  An angry RC is yelling at his scumbuddy AV for being Bussy McBuserson.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThen he never suspects AV again until it's serious wagon time, only agrees with him some more, but does throw him in a random scumteam list again for no discernible reason.<br>\n<br>\nAlso very worthy of note is that RC was really the only one besides me that believed DY's claim and went beyond that to defending him.  (Obviously, this is the part about the case against me that I understand perfectly.)<br>\n<br>\nHe calls AV scum when he's being seriously wagoned, but NEVER VOTES AV, just as he NEVER VOTED DY on the wagon that led to his lynch, despite professing suspicion of DY heavily on D1 and professing ambivalence the day of.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd then we find out that RC was lying all along -- and I CAN see a town motivation for this, if RC wasn't scummy at all.  But I thought RC was scum on d1 and the ONLY thing that deterred me was the JK claim.  Claimed BPs are useless to town anyway, and I don't feel nervous about lynching a claimed BP that is extremely scummy both through his own play and through associative tells of flipped scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>Oh, bvoigt, you may be right. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">CD is talking about me in that sentence, isn't he?

I even started a <a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?msg=Ranmaru%3A+Where+are+you%3F&amp;month=4&amp;day=25&amp;year=2011&amp;hour=2pm&amp;min=37&amp;sec=00&amp;p0=24\" class=\"postlink\">timer</a> over how long we've waited for Ranmaru to give us a decent post. He doesn't want to play this game, and he tricked the Mod by saying he did. <br>\n<br>\nWe're almost at three weeks he's been in this game without giving a solid post. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble 1089 wrote:</cite>Unless somebody else claims a role that could have stopped the kill, town is substantially underpowered without him and him being bulletproof explains the nokill way better than him choosing not to submit one.

So I am definitely ready to lose if RC is scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hopefully this will seep through CD's thick skull better than my increasingly hostile snaps do.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Llamarble 1091 wrote:</cite>I kinda hope Amrun is scum for the greater glory of Vasudeva.

Amrun is tempting given the fact that she claimed and she seems to fit alongside of DY in a lot of ways, but, especially in the context of the vote counts, I really don't see her as a fit for this scumteam. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Amrun 1095 wrote:</cite>As much as this is an unpleasant plan to me, maybe it's time to lynch Ranmaru out and hope we've caught lurking scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, Amrun, stick to the plan. Ranmaru is a bad player, but it's unlikely he's scum. I sincerely doubt that DY, AV, and gorilla all teamed up to try and get gandalf lynched on D1. Also, if you remember the original voting bloc, gorilla could've used that excuse to lynch Otolia early on D1. He hesitated and that let Otolia use his power.", "time": "Fri May 13, 2011 8:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16959&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "16959"}

There were several posts you made, Amrun, where you said stuff along the lines of \"AV is scummy... but I'm not sure\" or \"DY is scummy, but then again, let me think about it\". You switched your vote a lot as well. I'm not just saying this to be critical, just that you're generally not going to be given top honors for town play with those kinds of posts. There was no big leadership aura coming from you for most of the game. <br>\n<br>\nUnderstand I'm saying this with respect. That's how I am in a lot of games too, you know? Some games, as town, you're on top of everything, and some you just can't get it to happen. This game serves as a really interesting division between playstyles now that everything is concluded. CD and Vas were both fairly consistent throughout the game (one being right a majority of the time and the other being wrong a majority of the time read-wise), while I feel like us two were both inconsistent (you being right, me being wrong read-wise). I straightened up in the end when it mattered, but, if you take that and the claim situation away, I don't think I had a particularly great performance. I don't mean playstyle in the permanent sense either, I just mean for this specific game. That's why I don't put too much stock in meta arguments (but that's a whole different discussion). <br>\n<br>\nI don't know if that all makes sense. I'm just trying to say that you shouldn't fret because if you play enough you'll hit that game where you just are really on top of it. If it can happen to me, it will definitely happen to you (if it hasn't already). I've had games where I was an <a href=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/archive/viewtopic.php?p=1703352#p1703352\" class=\"postlink\">absolutely rock solid scumhunter</a>, and games where the scum <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2210463#p2210463\" class=\"postlink\">played me like a fiddle</a>. Most of the time you just end up somewhere between those extremes. All things being equal, I only play mafia for the chance at being scum anyways. Honestly, as rewarding as it is to have a win like this, I get much more joy out of playing the bad guy.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\">", "time": "Mon May 16, 2011 9:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16959&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "16959"}
