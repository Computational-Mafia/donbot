All the other random votes were ignored by the votees, I believe.

Why discredit my attempt to get the game out of RVS when you display no better method of doing so? Paschendale felt the need to defend against my random vote- I questioned it because I saw it as the most suspicious action at the time.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>In my experience, limited though it may be, the kind of questioning you were doing is entirely useless except for giving the questioner something to do. I don't think asking people questions like that is a good way to find scum because there's no logical reason why it should. Anyone with a brain can answer questions like yours in the approved townie way, and if anyone doesn't, therefore, his brain-ownership is called into question, which is just as useless because stupid people easily act like scum when they are not. Therefore -----&gt; useless!<br><br>Of course you can go on and on about \"getting out of RVS\" but it's not like if it weren't for silly questions games would be stuck there forever, lol.

If you feel someone is asking questions just for the sake of asking questions, asking this question will require them to either say 'for shits and giggles' or fabricate a reason, making it possible for town to see through it if they are scum.

The actual questioning didn't begin until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4244407#p4244407\">Post 19</a>. To which Pasch's \"just being truthful\" response seems odd as well. The truthfulness of Pasch's initial response was not in question...it was the fact he decided to defend himself to begin with that caught our attention. Now the unnecessary clarification that he was being truthful calls his play into even more question. And saying you were truthful did not answer our question. I would think a more appropriate response to the follow on question we asked Pasch in Post 19 would have been \"I thought you were interested in knowing why I haven't been around too much\" etc. Not to affirm your response's truthfulness. &lt;_&lt;<br><br>Re: Gutter's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4245842#p4245842\">Post 55</a>...so you vote us for no reason.

You then go on to say you don't think we are asking question's for the sake of asking questions (agreed...so what is the problem?) and then further state that you think we are asking questions to find scum (agreed...so WTF is the problem?????).

After all, no vote is really random unless you use an RNG, right?</div></blockquote><br>I guess we have different meanings for \"calling somebody out\", then. I don't think it was a ridiculous assumption on my part that the bandwagon on me had serious reasoning behind it. Take a look at the way my bandwagon formed on page 2. AngryPidgeon, Guttersnipe, uctriton00, and ChaosOmega all removed their random votes before voting me. AngryPidgeon's only relevant comment along-side his vote was that he wanted a bandwagon on me- he had moved his vote from ChaosOmega, who already had another vote, to me, who had no votes. If his vote was completely random and just for bandwagoning purposes then it would have made more sense for him to keep his vote on Chaos, so I assumed he wanted a bandwagon on me because he saw something somewhat suspicious in my posts at the time. Then Guttersnipe switches his vote- I assume his vote had serious reasoning behind it because he had just called my questions pointless and if he was just interested in a bandwagon he probably would have voted AP rather than Toro. uctriton votes me and actually gives reasons for suspecting me- the vote remains and is obviously serious. Given that the first three votes on my bandwagon were serious, I assumed the rest were as well. I believe Chaos's claim that he was just supporting a bandwagon, but before he had mentioned that, I don't think it was wrong of me to assume otherwise. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>theplague42 wrote:</cite>Maybe it's just a matter of perspective, but <span class=\"noboldsig\">I tend to think that all PR claims (well, miller isn't really PR, but whatever) should be questioned in one way or another</span>.

Why wait to call him out for it now? You said the bolded in the same post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>CooLDoG wrote:</cite>Why is your avatar blue? What is your time zone?

Are these the questions I should be asking? <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't really have anything to ask or pressure because I don't see anything scummy.</span> Give me a bit and I will push my reads like a bat out of hell.

And the justification for your current uncertainty of uctriton's allignment (underlined) is based on something he said very recently (so, if anything, you should have been more suspicious of his behavior earlier)! So it makes no sense that, if you honestly find his behavior suspicious, that you would wait until now to say something. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Paschendale wrote:</cite>I was not sitting on the fence about Mansev.

Why do you need to add the fact that you are uncomfortable putting us at L-1? Rereading, you mentioned this point before establishing that you didn't necessarily find me suspicious, as if it was more important to you. Regardless of where your priorities lie, however, your \"perspective\" in this case seems to resemble a scum's perspective rather than a town's perspective. Scum are trying to please town, but town are trying to lynch scum. <br><br>Also, please respond to my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4246808#p4246808\" class=\"postlink\">post 81</a>. This my second time reminding you. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Paschendale wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Now that I'm calm, I will make this last effort to remain in this game.</span> I don't like bully tactics, both because it makes it not fun, and because I think it is detrimental to town. Assertiveness is good. Lashing out and being trigger happy are not. Those tactics don't kill scum. They kill the less bloodthirsty players, regardless of their alignment. Also, if I am lynched, that kind of play also usually results in laughing off my townflip, saying I was bad or weak or something like that, rather than explaining why you killed a townie who simply wasn't as sure as you were. Doubly so if Masnev later flips town. Playing like a bully hurts town. Don't do it.

A townie should fight to prevent their lynch until they are lynched.

While it is clear theplague42 wouldn't have voted Pressed Bunson in the post that he did, he has claimed (or at least implied) that he believes in the vote. He justified his vote with a point against Pressed Bunson and even questioned me for not focusing any attention on Pressed Bunson. I disagree that theplague42's attention isn't on Pressed Bunson, because he has implied suspicion of her and directed a question to her (I don't see why Pressed Bunson would have to be here for theplague42 to be paying attention to her). I agree that the vote is bad because Pressed Bunson was not present (as I mentioned in the post in which you believe I \"let it slide\"). However, I am satisfied because I believe theplague42 had focused on Pressed Bunson by placing a vote on her and also because I now know that he found voting a lurker in order to \"prove a point to me\" as the best use for his vote at the time.      <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>image wrote:</cite>I mention this because your original response of saying you were satisfied seemed off to me; while he may technically have given you what you asked for, it was something of a dodge and you let it slide.</div></blockquote><br>Firstly, I think you are wrong to say I \"let it slide\". At the bottom of the post in question, I said:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Masnev wrote:</cite>theplague42 is just looking even worse with his last post. The vote for Pressed Bunson feels very easy.</div></blockquote><br>Secondly, I'll admit I didn't really give his question much thought. That's not to say that I regret or deny the answer I gave, but I thought the question itself was pointless and suspicious on its own:<br><blockquote><div><cite>theplague42 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Pressed Bunson</span>. Does that make you happy, Masnev?</div></blockquote><br>He's attempted to undermine my complaint and even prove a point to me (speaking of which I still fail to see what point has been proven considering he simply voted for somebody in response to my request for him to vote) when I don't think there was anything wrong with my complaint. I quickly answered his question, seeking answers from him in return regarding what I believed to be a stupid question from him. Thirdly, what is the hypothetical motivation for me as scum to \"let this slide\" when I have proceeded to ask him several questions and establish my suspicion of him? Also, image, what is your current read on theplague42? And what did you think of his vote for Pressed Bunson?<br><br>More later...<br><br>-W"}

Right here.  This is the bullying that I was talking about.  Not targeting the people who look like scum, just targeting the people who look like they might be easier to lynch.

It really does read like AP is making up scum motivations for things that aren't necessarily scummy.  His running theme seems to be forgetting that townies aren't 100% certain of anything.  He not only seems to think that he can be and is 100% certain in his reads, but that everyone should be that way.  He claims Image is scummy for voting UCT for using contradicting logic, and then not changing his vote to AP for doing the same thing.  Silly me, I thought that you shouldn't just use a single criterion for determining your votes.  The aggregate of UCT's actions might still be scummier than AP's.<br><br>Also, why the hell is UCT confirmed town at this point?  He could be, you know... lying.  That's what scum do.  I agree that it's silly to claim anything unless you're under pressure, but as I said earlier, EVERYONE is essentially claiming VT.  It just goes without saying.  That's the default position for every player.  What possible difference does it make if he says it?  Will it make him harder to believe later if he claims a power role?  Why should it?  It would have been remarkably stupid to claim a PR at the time.  And how does it make him not scum?  Do scum somehow not lie about their roles?  No, claiming VT is just stating the obvious.  You ignore it for the meaningless statement it is and move on."}

If people did that, then we wouldn't be able to identify scum players ever because everyone would be voting / playing with perfect randomness.  Theoretically, everyone should be playing like a VT at the beginning, yes.  Anyone is capable of making it.  We can't be 100% sure of ANYTHING because people could just be playing perfectly random.  In my experience, however, this unnecessary early claim is more likely to come from a townie, statistically speaking.

I thought Pas was just some bitter person, but now I'm thinking Pas could have been trying to act defensive, and when it wasn't working, he bailed on the game.

He's stated three scum reads this game (Masnev for appearing pro-town; Pas for replacing out; and theplague42, for advocating a lynch all lurkers policy). He has given himself openings to attack two of the likely lynches thus far without committing to either, and has now stated that his next read will be a player who has made two posts with eight words between them, giving him an excuse to continue posting useless things for a while. There is no town reason to attempt to read Toro's slot; we need to wait for him to either start posting or get replaced.

This game only his meta has been discussed so far I believe, so its obviously not likely that meta will come up.  Hence I felt that his scum game would likely mimic his previous one.  Why?  Because it clearly worked for him before and he can always pass it off as just his playstyle if people bring it up.<br><br>The recent UCT posts have convinced me that we are not even remotely looking at the same UCT from his scum game.  And not in a \"oh well he isn't scum he must be town\" way.  He played a great game in his scum game.  Now he is claiming VT out of nowhere which is something I am CERTAIN he knew was a bad idea in his other game.  Why do it then?  I really can't think of any reason other than town cred for \"being different\" than his scum game THAT HE ORIGINALLY REFERRED TO AND RECOMMENDED THAT WE READ.  I thought Vector was the first to ask for UCT's meta, but really UCT was the first to bring up his meta.  That changes everything.  Now UCT is definitely playing around his meta intentionally.  Side-note: Vector/UCT scumteam suspected.<br><br>Also, image, your analysis of me is very town.  And evidently you DO put stock into judging people's motives based off of their meta reads.  I guarantee you that you are mistaken about me having any connection with UCT or me being scum, but the fact that you found a connection that is logically reasonable using my meta-read tells me that you do put stock in it.<br><br>Side note: If (when) UCT flips scum, I think the Pasch slot can be considered conf-town.  UCT trying to throw suspicion on that slot is giving me all sorts of alarm bells.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4257536#p4257536\" class=\"postlink\">post 218</a>, uctriton00 wrote:</cite>I thought Pas was just some bitter person, but now I'm thinking Pas could have been trying to act defensive, and when it wasn't working, he bailed on the game.

How do you know me better?  Have you played with me before?  Because if not, then this statement is bullshit.  And it lacks conviction.  Its like \"Well AP is definitely buddying me.

He is quoting TP's scummy sounding posts and doesn't appear to care about finding TP's motivation behind saying something that looks so scummy.  Vector's posts about TP are basically \"Hey!  Look how scummy this post is!  Vote TP!\".  Example:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4252755#p4252755\" class=\"postlink\">post 142</a>, Vector wrote:</cite>I still really don't like this post.

Let's attack someone who is not gonna talk back, lynch lurkers and get pressure off me kthanks'<br><br>I hope Tor gets in here soon and we can vote this guy.</div></blockquote><br><br>Also dislike him calling for a PL twice on CoolDog for Cooldog not supporting meta reads (Why not call for a PL on image?) and CoolDog not posting many responses/reads.

While most of your earlier posts were fluff you have taken a stance on things and after ISOing you it doesn't feel anything like active lurking, just indecision.</div></blockquote><br>What?  You called for a PL for him not liking meta reads and for him not commenting/responding to many people.  Whether active lurking or indecision, that doesn't matter: he still is not posting many responses/reads.  So both of your reasons for wanting to PL him should still stand.  Why so quick to call a PL 2 times on CoolDog just to backpedal like mad next post for reasons that don't even revoke his original reasoning for wanting to PL cooldog?  Also, why do you want to PL CoolDog for not putting stock in meta but you have no problem with Image saying the same thing?<br><br>Post 149 is very important since that is apparently when TP42 first realized there is a difference between anti-town and scummy, not relevant to this Vector case though.<br><br>I also just generally dislike his TP42 case.  And his posts have a lot of fluff and filler which isn't scummy on its own, but it is contributing to my overall opinion that he isn't really scum hunting."}

Furthermore, Guttersnipe has not voted anyone, I don't know who he currently suspects, and he's been coasting. He's been getting away with not participating. It's bothersome that he's been ignored. Recently he's shown no interest in hunting mafia. Finally, read him in iso and you'll see that there's a lot of IIoA in his posts- a pretty strong scumtell imo: it's the equivalent of fence-sitting.<br><br>More later...<br><br>-W"}

UCT implied that Pasch quit out of anger by saying that Pasch RQ'd, but then went on to say that Pasch was probably scum trying to hide his meta.  If Pasch were scum trying to hide his meta, then could his actions be defined as an RQ?  Was he angry in this hypothetical reason for quitting?  Eh?  More selfish and calculated than anything.

Honestly, I just kinda put him on my town list by default when I replaced in because I tend to think that D1 miller claims should be given the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps this is not a responsible attitude for me to take.  At the very least, he certainly isn't being helpful.<br><br>Cooldog's analysis of plague is good.  <strike>His [plague's] last post a little less terrible than his first few but yeah he's still pretty slimy.</strike>  The idea that his vote was meant to prove a point is just blatantly not what was going on.  Would like to see a rebuttal from plague (an actual rebuttal to the general thrust of the case made on him rather than merely nitpicking at individual points).  Crossed out a sentence just there because I went and reread his last post and nope it's pretty bad, I'm not sure why I remembered it not being bad, although I don't think I have anything to say about it that others haven't said already.<br><br>--<br><br>@Guttersnipe: Which part of the argument against triton do you find convincing?  Also, is there any particular reason you're not voting him?<br><br>@Snifit: Echoing fatlikepig's questions - in particular, why was Paschendale obvtown?<br><br>@Pidgeon: Why Vector?  None of his/her/its posts have really left a strong impression on me.<br><br>--<br><br>Plague seems like a good place to drop my vote for now.

He still wouldn't be the worst lynch in that it seems likely that he'll continue to be a distraction through the rest of the game if he stays alive (i.e. utility lynch) - but there are considerably better choices for today.<br><br>3. image... eh, pretty much the same as what I said a few posts ago.  I don't like his push on triton but have no other serious problems with him.  Unless there is an argument I've missed, I don't see any reason to lynch him today.<br><br>4. The one thing that has changed is that I think I could support a Guttersnipe lynch.  After showing little interest in scumhunting for most of the day, he's finally supplied a list of reads, but the only people he calls scum are the person who already has the biggest wagon (plague) and a person who has barely posted (toro).  However, this wagon doesn't seem likely to gain momentum today.<br><br>I think my vote is in the right place.  I, too, would like to see a claim from plague."}

When you're weighing up something as being either town or scum, it's a very internal, intuitive process. The only questions I'm asking myself is how likely it seems that he'd be given a Miller role, as opposed to how likely he is to gambit as scum. This has nothing to do with math - there is an element of deciding which is more likely, but you do this with every single read, tell and post you look at it in the game, ie; \"is X more likely to come from town or scum?\"<br><br>I'm relaying from my experiences, when D1 Miller claims have come from gambitty or creative players, they tend to be scum.

I don't claim that the individual act of claiming is likelier to come from scum - there have definitely been more real Millers than fake, but of all the fakeclaims, they come from a certain type of player. <br><br>You're right that I am guessing how likely Guttersnipe is to do this as scum - my guess is that he'd do it more than the average player. I don't think you can criticise me for guessing though, when everyone else that has had an opinion about the validity of Guttersnipe's claim has been guessing too. Cooldog, fatlikepig, amongst others have all believed the claim - they're going through the exact same internal processes as me, though: remembering back through their experiences with Miller claims and what they've seen and heard. <br><br>I think many people never knew how rare actual Millers are though, so I think I was right to show people.<br><br>~~<br><br>OKAY ENOUGH MILLER CHAT. I've managed to set aside a decent chunk of time for this game, so I'll say some other stuff:<br><br>Someone was asking about my Cooldog gut scumread, and it seems arbitrary, but the first thing that caught my eye was:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4246738#p4246738\" class=\"postlink\">post 80</a>, CooLDoG wrote:</cite>For the record, it is 100% correct miller play to claim in your first post.</div></blockquote><br><br>Which just seemed like an irrelevant piece of authority/endorsement for Guttersnipe's play. I think scum tend to like making these sort of assertive declarations - it's just an easy way of saying something town-looking with no consequences. Some follow up work: from CooLDoG's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3583170#p3583170\" class=\"postlink\">Liar Vigs Personality Test</a> in MD, he only \"slightly agrees\" Millers and anti-town roles should claim in their first post. <br><br>Another standout was his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4249267#p4249267\" class=\"postlink\">#111</a>, which is weird and scummy, in the way he defends his vote on UTC as being a pressure vote and fencesits nicely on UTC's alignment. Just seems like flimsy posturing. <br><br>I don't know enough about CooLDoG, because I haven't played with him in a long time, but I got the distinct impression when I was reading the game he was very reactive and very eager to cooperate with people when they were questioning - people should be doing their best to cooperate, but it looked like he was stepping on eggshells and trying not to offend or be called out. I kinda think he'd be a bit more laid back and aggressive as town.<br><br>I might be wifom'ing myself, but his reaction to theplague's claim looked good, because it carried an air of suspicion about it, which I like. He didn't just accept it, and didn't automatically think it scummy - I think in those situations where the game can change rapidly, scum will either make a definitive read or be super fence-sitty. The trying to get another Doc to counterclaim was a proactive town action, I think.<br><br>~~<br><br>I'm a sucker for premature VT claims, especially ones out of nowhere. It's annoying when it happens because it narrows down the PR pool, but it really is only newb-town players that make this play. Newb-scum tend to like keeping their options open rather than committing to something untruthful for the sake of it - as a general rule, it's much easier to tell the truth, and there needs to be some reason to fabricate a lie unnecessarily, and this instance, for scum to fakeclaim VT, they need a reason to do it - and most newb-scum won't be savvy enough with this site's meta to realise it looks really town (which is the only reason to do it as scum), whereas town will often leak this information out of boredom or not realising the consequences of what they're doing. It's so much easier to tell the truth than to lie, and I think I've seen enough of UTC to say he has little idea what he's doing, which makes the tell much more reliable to me.<br><br>~~<br><br>Don't know how I feel about AngryPidgeon, but I probably lean town if anything just by the sheer amount of effort he's been putting in so far. I can sort of understand why he's voting me - I haven't presented my thoughts about Guttersnipe's claim eloquently. I feel like he's one of those players I'm going to need to invest a good, solid hour or two to read properly, and I can't do it now, but regardless, I'm generally opposed to chasing after such active players early in the game.<br><br>Right now, I'd prefer to lynch someone who hasn't done much. I know this logic applies to my slot, given I've replaced a chronic lurker - all I can say to that, is that once I'm all up to date and invested in the game, I do a good job in staying active and working things out when we have a smaller roster.<br><br>Image is a totally acceptable lynch for me - he's been relatively quiet and has spent the back half of this day with his vote rested on UTC, who is an extremely easy target. I'd be willing to lynch CooLDoG, but I don't think it'll happen. I keep flip-flopping on what I want to do with theplague - I kinda don't believe him, but if I'm wrong, there's a decent chance we can save a lynch by keeping him alive and letting scum do the work.

If he is lynched I will be extremely frustrated. Guttersnipe claimed scum. If Guttersnipe is town, he's already claimed miller. If we lynch Guttersnipe we can avoid having a fourth player claim (and a second potential power role). Guttersnipe was suspicious prior to the scum claim (see my case). His presence poses a huge distraction for later in the game. <br><br>The argument towards keeping Guttersnipe alive is that future flips will make it easier to determine his alignment. But this argument is weak and I don't put much faith in its validity. Obviously the only flips that could help us in this way are roles that affect night investigation. If there are any town roles that suggest Guttersnipe's miller claim doesn't fit in with this setup (for example: tracker, watcher...) then they probably would/should have claimed by now, so I assume there aren't any. Alternatively, if there is a cop in the game, then its presence in the setup shouldn't force us to believe Guttersnipe is telling the truth. Cops are pretty common, and, as I believe image pointed out, Guttersnipe might have known there was a cop if somebody on his hypothetical scum team was a Godfather: a cop flip proves nothing. You may argue \"there's no godfather!\", but if theplague42 is telling the truth and there is a doc to protect the hypothetical cop each night, then a cop is extremely powerful in this game unless there's a scum role to counteract it: for example, a godfather. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TL;DR- WAITING FOR FUTURE FLIPS WILL NOT STRENGTHEN OUR READ ON GUTTERSNIPE</span><br><br>Somebody please hammer him...<br><br>P-edit 1: NO. image not claiming for an hour is not at all disturbing. <br>P-edit 2: Great, nearly half the players in the game have claimed. bleh<br><br>-W"}

I've never seen a vig with knife flavour, so an SK looks pretty likely, given that if triangle <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> aware that he shouldn't be hinting at killers' roles, he wouldn't have used knife red-herring flavour for the sake of it. The funny thing is, the SK probably killed image to shape for a vig claim deeper in the game - there'd be no other reason to kill someone who would probably be a mislynch target in the future."}

That would mean she would be one scum member down for tommorrow, gains a bit of towncred but ultimately this would be crushed when TP turns up town (assuming a Hoopla/Shamrock/TP scumteam is ridiculously impossible, which it is). <br><br>So basically, she would be hardbussing a scumbuddy for absolutely no gain. Rather, I would see scum-Hoopla as wanting a mislynch on Shamrock that ends in a possible tripletown death and leaves us in lylo with a choice between her and town-TP. I think it is more likely her scumbuddy would be snifit or triton, than Hoopla; or even POSSIBLY she is pushing the bandwagon analysis idea because for some 'lucky-for-her-scumteam' bizarre reasoning her entire team managed to be on the image wagon, and she is pushing a deadend case.<br><br>Ergo sum, I think scum-Hoopla would be stupid to push on scumbuddy Shamrock, and Hoopla isn't stupid.

Using an argument like \"Hoopla is in a good position to win if scum\" makes little sense, when it does nothing to address the likelihood of me being scum - you only need to worry about me winning as scum if I am scum, but again, there are many other players who we will need to invest trust in tomorrow and the days followings - one could easily use a similar argument for them.<br><br>I'd argue that I've been in a pretty excellent position to win as scum all game, even (or especially) before my claim.

Lets use Occam's Razor here; do you think this is the simplest possible explanation for what is happening? Remember, any of those variables being wrong robs you of an endgame where I can collect anything close to an autowin as scum. The odds of all scum being on one wagon D1 is very low all on its own (relatedly, I remember looking into this about 2-3 years ago in Minis and 3 scum on a single wagon D1 was very low - like 5-10%), and this doesn't even take into account the plethora of possibilities in which I am town regardless of all 3 scum being off the wagon D1.<br><br>Another point I should address: you're not really in the position to be trying to damage-control against low percentage possibilities, when there is an outside chance you are an SK.

So, I don't think a TP42 townflip puts us in a good position at MyLo.  Especially since if I am correct, then you will die tonight without vigging anyone.  If we lynch outside of TP42/Hoopla though that puts the pressure back on the scum team to analyze the best play and try not to out-WIFOM themselves.  It also makes the potential cop a little safer since we will have a doc around (assuming TP42 town)."}

It's ridiculous.  Most of this game has scumreads on him.  His wagonhop to FLP sure hasn't made him look any better.

I can't see town CO saying this.  Its kind of an appeal to emotion in a sense.  Clearly people are frustrated over UCT's playstyle and unsure what to make of it at this point.  This sentence is light buddying onto everyone that feels that way (It shows CO's own uncertainty of the situation and shows that he is willing to take a *somewhat* firm stance on it).  It doesn't really accomplish anything though...<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4273444#p4273444\" class=\"postlink\">post 400</a>, ChaosOmega wrote:</cite>If you think he's town, why do you want him to claim?<br><br>Speaking of him claiming, unvote, vote: theplague42, L-1.</div></blockquote><br>This...This is just dumb.

It made you somwhat transparent town, though your meta was making me worried you were just playing a clever scumgame. I think you did well in the end to semi-sheep, IMO. Hopefully this game has taught you a few things about being town! By the by, how confident were you in tech/AP/Hoopla-town?<br><br>About the VT claim; it wasn't SUPERBAD. But yeah, I would personally advise not to do it. Some people do it in games because it's considered a towntell when people claim VT early, without any need to; and I would say most of the time it is (for scum, it eliminates their ability to fakeclaim, so it's usually not worth the weak town-cred it dishes out). Not to say though that scum couldn't abuse it.<br><br>Hoopla paranoia was a big thing for me this game. I nearly wanted to push a semi-pseudo policy lynch just because I couldn't trust that I could trust her, etc. I'm glad she came down with the Occam's Razor reasoning/post when she did. I even thought she might have been the last scum there. If I had still been in the game, I would have been leaning CO but creating WIFOM around Hoopla's conf-status (IMO, she WASN'T conf - she could have been CCing scumbuddy TP for massive towncred; high risk high reward stuff). <br><br>Nice case by AP in the end though. It nailed the coffin on CO. Also glad the night actions worked out the way they did N2; as it was, I could have ended up vigging Sham at the same time as Coolio innoed him. I felt TP was more of a big dog that was harder to lynch for his claim, so was a better vig; but Cool may have been thinking the same thing and decided to inno TP for that reason. IMO, I was a little angry at snifit for not allowing me to post my vig choice before he hammered, but eh, it worked out ok.<br><br>I would also like to apologise to Gutter if he is reading this. I felt I was a bit harsh on him for calling me stupid. Particularly when I didn't know his alignment (it's much more acceptable as scum!) <br><br>I would like mafia QT please, kthanks."}

This is something I should have put in the rule set before the game even started, and it will be in the rule sets of future games I mod, but I definitely have a problem with claiming scum partners. Claiming scum and/or self-voting, while their effectiveness is questionable, seems perfectly legal to me, but consider if the actual scum team outed itself. That would be an issue taken very, very seriously, so if a town player pretends to out his scum team, the mod doing nothing would be taken as a sign that the town player is bluffing."}
