I don't think asking people questions like that is a good way to find scum because there's no logical reason why it should. Anyone with a brain can answer questions like yours in the approved townie way, and if anyone doesn't, therefore, his brain-ownership is called into question, which is just as useless because stupid people easily act like scum when they are not.

The actual questioning didn't begin until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4244407#p4244407\">Post 19</a>. To which Pasch's \"just being truthful\" response seems odd as well. The truthfulness of Pasch's initial response was not in question...it was the fact he decided to defend himself to begin with that caught our attention. Now the unnecessary clarification that he was being truthful calls his play into even more question. And saying you were truthful did not answer our question. I would think a more appropriate response to the follow on question we asked Pasch in Post 19 would have been \"I thought you were interested in knowing why I haven't been around too much\" etc. Not to affirm your response's truthfulness. &lt;_&lt;<br>\n<br>\nRe: Gutter's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4245842#p4245842\">Post 55</a>...so you vote us for no reason.

I don't think it was a ridiculous assumption on my part that the bandwagon on me had serious reasoning behind it. Take a look at the way my bandwagon formed on page 2. AngryPidgeon, Guttersnipe, uctriton00, and ChaosOmega all removed their random votes before voting me. AngryPidgeon's only relevant comment along-side his vote was that he wanted a bandwagon on me- he had moved his vote from ChaosOmega, who already had another vote, to me, who had no votes. If his vote was completely random and just for bandwagoning purposes then it would have made more sense for him to keep his vote on Chaos, so I assumed he wanted a bandwagon on me because he saw something somewhat suspicious in my posts at the time. Then Guttersnipe switches his vote- I assume his vote had serious reasoning behind it because he had just called my questions pointless and if he was just interested in a bandwagon he probably would have voted AP rather than Toro. uctriton votes me and actually gives reasons for suspecting me- the vote remains and is obviously serious. Given that the first three votes on my bandwagon were serious, I assumed the rest were as well. I believe Chaos's claim that he was just supporting a bandwagon, but before he had mentioned that, I don't think it was wrong of me to assume otherwise. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>theplague42 wrote:</cite>Maybe it's just a matter of perspective, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I tend to think that all PR claims (well, miller isn't really PR, but whatever) should be questioned in one way or another</div>.

It is not town motivated to sling votes around to prove one's own townieness over lynching scum. Also note that he is okay with lynching bad townies possibly over scum. This is setting himself up to push an easy VI/lurker lynch later. That's the main reason why I think he is scummy, yes. <br>\n<br>\nThere are other things that irk me about TP.

Town will be forced to use meta-reasoning sometimes. How could someone not, if they strongly believe someone is scum or town based off meta? So this establishes that meta is intrinsic to games and always will be.

Sure, scum can abuse meta. But what does town do in response? Use this as an imperative to try HARDER and see if the person is in fact lying or abusing meta. This is standard in all types of games.

While it is clear theplague42 wouldn't have voted Pressed Bunson in the post that he did, he has claimed (or at least implied) that he believes in the vote. He justified his vote with a point against Pressed Bunson and even questioned me for not focusing any attention on Pressed Bunson. I disagree that theplague42's attention isn't on Pressed Bunson, because he has implied suspicion of her and directed a question to her (I don't see why Pressed Bunson would have to be here for theplague42 to be paying attention to her). I agree that the vote is bad because Pressed Bunson was not present (as I mentioned in the post in which you believe I \"let it slide\"). However, I am satisfied because I believe theplague42 had focused on Pressed Bunson by placing a vote on her and also because I now know that he found voting a lurker in order to \"prove a point to me\" as the best use for his vote at the time.      <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>image wrote:</cite>I mention this because your original response of saying you were satisfied seemed off to me; while he may technically have given you what you asked for, it was something of a dodge and you let it slide.</div></blockquote><br>\nFirstly, I think you are wrong to say I \"let it slide\". At the bottom of the post in question, I said:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Masnev wrote:</cite>theplague42 is just looking even worse with his last post. The vote for Pressed Bunson feels very easy.</div></blockquote><br>\nSecondly, I'll admit I didn't really give his question much thought. That's not to say that I regret or deny the answer I gave, but I thought the question itself was pointless and suspicious on its own:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>theplague42 wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Pressed Bunson</div>. Does that make you happy, Masnev?</div></blockquote><br>\nHe's attempted to undermine my complaint and even prove a point to me (speaking of which I still fail to see what point has been proven considering he simply voted for somebody in response to my request for him to vote) when I don't think there was anything wrong with my complaint. I quickly answered his question, seeking answers from him in return regarding what I believed to be a stupid question from him. Thirdly, what is the hypothetical motivation for me as scum to \"let this slide\" when I have proceeded to ask him several questions and establish my suspicion of him?

Right here.  This is the bullying that I was talking about.  Not targeting the people who look like scum, just targeting the people who look like they might be easier to lynch.  That's why playing like a bully hurts town.  You end up just killing people for playstyle, effectively turning lynches random.  When you lynch someone for reasons other than what you think their alignment is, you're going to lose.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, on Image.  I don't see much merit in AP's attacks on him.  It really does read like AP is making up scum motivations for things that aren't necessarily scummy.  His running theme seems to be forgetting that townies aren't 100% certain of anything.  He not only seems to think that he can be and is 100% certain in his reads, but that everyone should be that way.  He claims Image is scummy for voting UCT for using contradicting logic, and then not changing his vote to AP for doing the same thing.  Silly me, I thought that you shouldn't just use a single criterion for determining your votes.  The aggregate of UCT's actions might still be scummier than AP's.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, why the hell is UCT confirmed town at this point?  He could be, you know... lying.  That's what scum do.  I agree that it's silly to claim anything unless you're under pressure, but as I said earlier, EVERYONE is essentially claiming VT.  It just goes without saying.  That's the default position for every player.  What possible difference does it make if he says it?  Will it make him harder to believe later if he claims a power role?  Why should it?  It would have been remarkably stupid to claim a PR at the time.  And how does it make him not scum?  Do scum somehow not lie about their roles?  No, claiming VT is just stating the obvious.

FoS random people, vote random people, maybe even slam their heads into their keyboards and hit submit.

Theoretically, everyone should be playing like a VT at the beginning, yes.  Anyone is capable of making it.  We can't be 100% sure of ANYTHING because people could just be playing perfectly random.

This is my major problem currently with my town play (and to some extent my scum play) right now. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TP wrote:</cite>And how exactly are \"scummy\" and \"anti-town\" different? You can't really call a pro-town player scummy, so who else are you supposed to lynch?</div></blockquote>Lynch now. Really, lynch now. He has just condoned the lynch of town people in this post. Seriously.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TP wrote:</cite>\"Does that make you happy, Masnev?\" as an actual attempt to appease </div></blockquote><br>\nFair.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>angry wrote:</cite>Look up Space Mafia 1355</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is my problem with meta. You can never get a big enough sample size to make any sort of determination. One game isn't enough to find what my \"normal\" town play style is. If you go back further in my record you will see that I was a complete VI that had no intelligent posts as town what so ever as town. <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>angry wrote:</cite>Someone who doesn't put stock in meta isn't going to waste time linking the meta so that others can waste time reading it.</div></blockquote>Except for the fact that it is helpful to townies who to heavily subscribe to meta arguments. Your games are public record, but it can be hard to find them I would say that it is pro town to link to game for meta even if you don't put much stock in it just so that the town can run smoother. I'm not buying your argument that linking to meta even though one doesn't subscribe to it is scummy. I fail to see why scum would be motivated to do such a thing.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>angry wrote:</cite>would TP42 throw down a useless vote on PB and ask if it satisfied Masnev if he were scum??</div></blockquote><br>\nPossibly yes. If TP thought that it would gain him town cred and get what he perceives as one of the stronger town players off of his case, then yes he would.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>angry wrote:</cite>There is no way he would say something guaranteed to get him so much attention and suspicion as scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou have to do a risk reward analysis. Get chased to the ends of the earth by a witch hunter or take on some scum points. It depends on how TP views the current climate of the game, he may have decided that making a tough enemy this early is not the best plan... <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mas wrote:</cite>1: I don't believe that you \"just thought about him then\". You voted him for something he had said several times and had been voted and suspected for by several people. I don't believe that you could have overlooked it until the time of your vote. </div></blockquote><br>\nI can not combat this point. If you don't believe me to not be genuine then that is your choice. I can't refute it, you must trust me.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mas wrote:</cite>2: You shouldn't have to wait for somebody to tell you to start scumhunting. As a townie, you should already be doing it.</div></blockquote><br>\nProbably correct. However, I would argue that there is very little scum hunting that can be done very early in the game.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mas wrote:</cite>3: I find it suspicious how you try to defend my point against you using two completely different ideas. You say you didn't vote uctriton00 before the time of your vote both because: a.) you just hadn't thought about uctriton before then and b.) your scumread wasn't strong enough, but you've now decided to see how he handles the pressure</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, because I didn't do enough thinking on triton I didn't view him as scummy enough to vote. Pretty logical if you ask me. If you never think about the game then all of your reads should be neutral or random. Would you disagree?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mas wrote:</cite><br>\n...I'm not sure how you could even suggest this considering you only recently developed any reads... </div></blockquote><br>\nMaybe I'm missing something that everybody else is seeing. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mas wrote:</cite>But, CooLDoG, it would be helpful if you gave us some of your reads with brief explanations.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't think I will have the time to do this today, as I am running in catch up mode already... tomorrow, I will.", "time": "Mon Aug 13, 2012 9:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22984&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "22984"}

All I'm saying is that anti-town players are far more likely to be scum than pro-town players, and should therefore be viewed as a possibility for a lynch. Am I pushing for a unctriton lynch, when he's obviously an anti-town VI? Nope. I've never said that obv-town, yet anti-town players should be lynched. I said that lynching anti-town is reasonable, especially for hardcore lurkers. Maybe it's that I haven't played in awhile, but I see anti-town as generally scummy when it comes from anything else than an obvious VI. I think this entire argument can be summed up in three points.<br>\n<br>\n1. The vote on Pressed Bunson was to make a point about masnev's argument. The only reason I picked PB was because of his lurking.<br>\n2. Yes, surprisingly I know that anti-town and scummy can be and often are different. In the case of lurking, especially with a person with a grand total of FIVE words, I say they're not too far apart.

I thought Pas was just some bitter person, but now I'm thinking Pas could have been trying to act defensive, and when it wasn't working, he bailed on the game.

Given how you have treated other players with far more scrutiny and been more willing to reevaluate your reads, this strikes me as scummy.

This will be more worth looking into when and if one of you flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nIn summary, I think you are scummy but I'm not yet going to say outright scum.

He's stated three scum reads this game (Masnev for appearing pro-town; Pas for replacing out; and theplague42, for advocating a lynch all lurkers policy). He has given himself openings to attack two of the likely lynches thus far without committing to either, and has now stated that his next read will be a player who has made two posts with eight words between them, giving him an excuse to continue posting useless things for a while.

This game only his meta has been discussed so far I believe, so its obviously not likely that meta will come up.  Hence I felt that his scum game would likely mimic his previous one.  Why?  Because it clearly worked for him before and he can always pass it off as just his playstyle if people bring it up.<br>\n<br>\nThe recent UCT posts have convinced me that we are not even remotely looking at the same UCT from his scum game.  And not in a \"oh well he isn't scum he must be town\" way.  He played a great game in his scum game.  Now he is claiming VT out of nowhere which is something I am CERTAIN he knew was a bad idea in his other game.  Why do it then?  I really can't think of any reason other than town cred for \"being different\" than his scum game THAT HE ORIGINALLY REFERRED TO AND RECOMMENDED THAT WE READ.  I thought Vector was the first to ask for UCT's meta, but really UCT was the first to bring up his meta.  That changes everything.  Now UCT is definitely playing around his meta intentionally.  Side-note: Vector/UCT scumteam suspected.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, image, your analysis of me is very town.  And evidently you DO put stock into judging people's motives based off of their meta reads.  I guarantee you that you are mistaken about me having any connection with UCT or me being scum, but the fact that you found a connection that is logically reasonable using my meta-read tells me that you do put stock in it.<br>\n<br>\nSide note: If (when) UCT flips scum, I think the Pasch slot can be considered conf-town.

TP took the same angle, but gave dodgy excuses ('I've been too busy posting fluff and talking to two players and admittedly it was useless and lolrofl I'm scum lynch me because I'm fake').

Fail harder. Get it right; either you don't like my push on TP42 or you are retarded and somehow think I didn't push on TP at all and I'm just posting fluff. Which is it, AP? And assuming you choose the former; you are basically calling me scum for not liking a case I have on a player. You yourself even said TP contradicted himself.

You're case on him is paranoia based and requires you to be right on every premise (uct intentionally decided to act scummy and use meta to show he plays better as scum and hope to god everyone believed his meta and to top it off his 'scumbuddy' is gonna lie about loving metatells (I'm gathering this is the connection you are making between me and him??) and also draw attention to himself but yeah hopefully it might somehow work out in towncred even though it will draw intense discussion away from mislynches).

Biased much?<br>\n<br>\ntriton's comments about feeling more free to say what he wants and enjoying the game etc etc sound like first time town to me.

I assumed everyone claims VT, all day every day. The logic is that \"oh well now you've just narrowed it down for the Mafia\"; is that not nullified if everyone else and their mama claims VT?

I've claimed myself, but that's what, only 1 out of 13 people? That doesn't help town much. Too much talk about myself, not enough analysis to share with everyone. Here again are the reads I have that have any kind of substance:<br>\n<br>\n1. Toro's (possibly purposeful?) misinterpretation of my words, jumping on the typo. That type of jumping on a typo makes it look like a scum attempt to have something to latch onto. Why don't you look at the way I tried to fix it? I was typing it on my phone for what it's worth.<br>\n<br>\n2. image saying there is no town reason to look at the Toro slot. I still don't understand it; the Toro slot was inactive, so how could we write it off as either town or scum? We need to look at the slot, meticulously, and ask it questions, to gain information on it. Again, it's a misinterpretation of the words.<br>\n<br>\n3. AngryPidgeon, I've noticed posts a lot in every game he is in. He posts, by far, the most messages out of anyone. And he defended me against any accusation on his soap box. I was thinking, yeah well this guy knows his stuff. He can understand my background, knowing that this is my first time as a town. He seems to \"get\" it. But now he's turning on me, because he believe's image's argument.<br>\n<br>\nI don't see image and AngryPidgeon as being scumbuddies, but I see one of them definitely being scum. It's worse for AngryPidgeon who is basically screwed, because by me being a VT, his case definitely looks like he was on my slot's side, but then saw that someone (image) has me as an obv scum slot. He then made a conscious decision to 180 it and is trying to distance himself from my slot as far as possible.<br>\n<br>\nMy conclusion: it's either Toro and Image, or it's just Angry Pidgeon who is scum (with the other two being town).

Again, if I tell you these town tells, and then other players begin using them, that makes my tells worthless.

{"number": 322, "id": "4265535", "user": "Shamrock", "user_id": "1604", "content": "I feel like this game is getting a bit bogged down by the triton/AP mess.<br>\n<br>\nStill think triton is likely town despite a few... interesting... posts in the last few pages.  The case on him seems generally far-fetched.  I can't remember ever actually seeing scum deliberately pretend to be bad (I'm sure it's happened, there's no need to dig up an example for me, but I'm just saying it doesn't happen often in my experience).<br>\n<br>\nI also have to say that \"buddying\" accusations aren't tremendously helpful on D1.<br>\n<br>\nAs I said earlier, can't agree at all with the argument that town-Paschendale is more likely to replace out than scum-Paschendale.  I've seen scum replace out of slots under pressure plenty of times, and his replace out seemed like it was more of a personality conflict than anything.  (I didn't think the post I made directed at him just before he replaced was that harsh, but...)  Want to keep my eye on his replacement.<br>\n<br>\nI don't see any pressing reason to leave my vote on image at this point.  I'm still a little uncomfortable with his pushing the triton wagon, but taking a look over what he's posted since I voted him, I can at least see a reasonable thread of logic behind his actions.  (@Masnev- look at my post where I voted image, I already explained why I was doing it there.)<br>\n<br>\nI guess I should take a second look at Guttersnipe given the arguments being made against him.  Honestly, I just kinda put him on my town list by default when I replaced in because I tend to think that D1 miller claims should be given the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps this is not a responsible attitude for me to take.  At the very least, he certainly isn't being helpful.<br>\n<br>\nCooldog's analysis of plague is good.  <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">His [plague's] last post a little less terrible than his first few but yeah he's still pretty slimy.</div>  The idea that his vote was meant to prove a point is just blatantly not what was going on.  Would like to see a rebuttal from plague (an actual rebuttal to the general thrust of the case made on him rather than merely nitpicking at individual points).  Crossed out a sentence just there because I went and reread his last post and nope it's pretty bad, I'm not sure why I remembered it not being bad, although I don't think I have anything to say about it that others haven't said already.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n@Guttersnipe: Which part of the argument against triton do you find convincing?  Also, is there any particular reason you're not voting him?<br>\n<br>\n@Snifit: Echoing fatlikepig's questions - in particular, why was Paschendale obvtown?<br>\n<br>\n@Pidgeon: Why Vector?  None of his/her/its posts have really left a strong impression on me.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nPlague seems like a good place to drop my vote for now.  The case against him is strong and I want to hear some answers, if he's got any.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: image</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: theplague42</span>", "time": "Thu Aug 16, 2012 4:06 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22984&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "22984"}

Granted, that game was over a year ago, but I still think his play in that game was better than the play he's demonstrating in this game.

Looking him over in isolation, he has indeed had some very strange reactions and reasonings; however, I don't see anything wildly inconsistent with my townish read on him (although, as AP points out, his recent comments do make him more likely to be scum if this game turns out to be 2:2:9, but this seems unlikely).  He still wouldn't be the worst lynch in that it seems likely that he'll continue to be a distraction through the rest of the game if he stays alive (i.e. utility lynch) - but there are considerably better choices for today.<br>\n<br>\n3. image... eh, pretty much the same as what I said a few posts ago.  I don't like his push on triton but have no other serious problems with him.  Unless there is an argument I've missed, I don't see any reason to lynch him today.<br>\n<br>\n4. The one thing that has changed is that I think I could support a Guttersnipe lynch.  After showing little interest in scumhunting for most of the day, he's finally supplied a list of reads, but the only people he calls scum are the person who already has the biggest wagon (plague) and a person who has barely posted (toro).  However, this wagon doesn't seem likely to gain momentum today.<br>\n<br>\nI think my vote is in the right place.

When you're weighing up something as being either town or scum, it's a very internal, intuitive process. The only questions I'm asking myself is how likely it seems that he'd be given a Miller role, as opposed to how likely he is to gambit as scum. This has nothing to do with math - there is an element of deciding which is more likely, but you do this with every single read, tell and post you look at it in the game, ie; \"is X more likely to come from town or scum?\"<br>\n<br>\nI'm relaying from my experiences, when D1 Miller claims have come from gambitty or creative players, they tend to be scum. I'm not sure how influential this tell is, because Miller claims D1 (whether true or false) are quite rare to begin with - if it was something I felt stronger about, I'd be pushing harder.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4275906#p4275906\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4275906#p4275906\" data-post-id=\"4275906\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 472</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19184\">AngryPidgeon</a> wrote:</cite>And, no, I already made a wall post about image.

I think the idea behind the case is ok, but it IS HEAVILY based on numbers.  They can be educated guesses or whatever, but the fact that Hoopla made a case based on probabilities, refused to come up with estimates for these probabilities, pushed the case, and then backpedaled into saying \"It isn't about numbers\" is bogus.

I don't think you can criticise me for guessing though, when everyone else that has had an opinion about the validity of Guttersnipe's claim has been guessing too. Cooldog, fatlikepig, amongst others have all believed the claim - they're going through the exact same internal processes as me, though: remembering back through their experiences with Miller claims and what they've seen and heard. <br>\n<br>\nI think many people never knew how rare actual Millers are though, so I think I was right to show people.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nOKAY ENOUGH MILLER CHAT. I've managed to set aside a decent chunk of time for this game, so I'll say some other stuff:<br>\n<br>\nSomeone was asking about my Cooldog gut scumread, and it seems arbitrary, but the first thing that caught my eye was:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4246738#p4246738\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4246738#p4246738\" data-post-id=\"4246738\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 80</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12176\">CooLDoG</a> wrote:</cite>For the record, it is 100% correct miller play to claim in your first post.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhich just seemed like an irrelevant piece of authority/endorsement for Guttersnipe's play. I think scum tend to like making these sort of assertive declarations - it's just an easy way of saying something town-looking with no consequences. Some follow up work: from CooLDoG's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3583170#p3583170\" class=\"postlink\">Liar Vigs Personality Test</a> in MD, he only \"slightly agrees\" Millers and anti-town roles should claim in their first post. <br>\n<br>\nAnother standout was his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4249267#p4249267\" class=\"postlink\">#111</a>, which is weird and scummy, in the way he defends his vote on UTC as being a pressure vote and fencesits nicely on UTC's alignment. Just seems like flimsy posturing. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know enough about CooLDoG, because I haven't played with him in a long time, but I got the distinct impression when I was reading the game he was very reactive and very eager to cooperate with people when they were questioning - people should be doing their best to cooperate, but it looked like he was stepping on eggshells and trying not to offend or be called out. I kinda think he'd be a bit more laid back and aggressive as town.<br>\n<br>\nI might be wifom'ing myself, but his reaction to theplague's claim looked good, because it carried an air of suspicion about it, which I like. He didn't just accept it, and didn't automatically think it scummy - I think in those situations where the game can change rapidly, scum will either make a definitive read or be super fence-sitty. The trying to get another Doc to counterclaim was a proactive town action, I think.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nI'm a sucker for premature VT claims, especially ones out of nowhere. It's annoying when it happens because it narrows down the PR pool, but it really is only newb-town players that make this play. Newb-scum tend to like keeping their options open rather than committing to something untruthful for the sake of it - as a general rule, it's much easier to tell the truth, and there needs to be some reason to fabricate a lie unnecessarily, and this instance, for scum to fakeclaim VT, they need a reason to do it - and most newb-scum won't be savvy enough with this site's meta to realise it looks really town (which is the only reason to do it as scum), whereas town will often leak this information out of boredom or not realising the consequences of what they're doing. It's so much easier to tell the truth than to lie, and I think I've seen enough of UTC to say he has little idea what he's doing, which makes the tell much more reliable to me.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nDon't know how I feel about AngryPidgeon, but I probably lean town if anything just by the sheer amount of effort he's been putting in so far. I can sort of understand why he's voting me - I haven't presented my thoughts about Guttersnipe's claim eloquently. I feel like he's one of those players I'm going to need to invest a good, solid hour or two to read properly, and I can't do it now, but regardless, I'm generally opposed to chasing after such active players early in the game.<br>\n<br>\nRight now, I'd prefer to lynch someone who hasn't done much. I know this logic applies to my slot, given I've replaced a chronic lurker - all I can say to that, is that once I'm all up to date and invested in the game, I do a good job in staying active and working things out when we have a smaller roster.<br>\n<br>\nImage is a totally acceptable lynch for me - he's been relatively quiet and has spent the back half of this day with his vote rested on UTC, who is an extremely easy target. I'd be willing to lynch CooLDoG, but I don't think it'll happen. I keep flip-flopping on what I want to do with theplague - I kinda don't believe him, but if I'm wrong, there's a decent chance we can save a lynch by keeping him alive and letting scum do the work. I get the impression that theplague and Guttersnipe's claims will become more obvious when we know more about the setup, so I'm okay with delaying a decision on both of those slots.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not the best at analysing the whole game on D1, because I like hunt based on connections and PoE - it's hard to whittle down 12 slots into a cohesive summary of events, so, I'll even consider supporting a lynch for someone I don't have a town read on but haven't fully read up on, like Shamrock or TeChNo, but for now, I'll just go with an image vote:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: image</span><br>\n<br>\nI haven't fully expressed all my thoughts, but I just wanted to slap <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">something </div>down now before it gets too close to deadline.", "time": "Wed Aug 22, 2012 4:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22984&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "22984"}

I can see scum throwing in the towel more than I can see town doing what GS did.

Guttersnipe claimed scum. If Guttersnipe is town, he's already claimed miller. If we lynch Guttersnipe we can avoid having a fourth player claim (and a second potential power role). Guttersnipe was suspicious prior to the scum claim (see my case). His presence poses a huge distraction for later in the game. <br>\n<br>\nThe argument towards keeping Guttersnipe alive is that future flips will make it easier to determine his alignment. But this argument is weak and I don't put much faith in its validity. Obviously the only flips that could help us in this way are roles that affect night investigation. If there are any town roles that suggest Guttersnipe's miller claim doesn't fit in with this setup (for example: tracker, watcher...) then they probably would/should have claimed by now, so I assume there aren't any. Alternatively, if there is a cop in the game, then its presence in the setup shouldn't force us to believe Guttersnipe is telling the truth. Cops are pretty common, and, as I believe image pointed out, Guttersnipe might have known there was a cop if somebody on his hypothetical scum team was a Godfather: a cop flip proves nothing. You may argue \"there's no godfather!\", but if theplague42 is telling the truth and there is a doc to protect the hypothetical cop each night, then a cop is extremely powerful in this game unless there's a scum role to counteract it: for example, a godfather. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TL;DR- WAITING FOR FUTURE FLIPS WILL NOT STRENGTHEN OUR READ ON GUTTERSNIPE</div><br>\n<br>\nSomebody please hammer him...<br>\n<br>\nP-edit 1: NO. image not claiming for an hour is not at all disturbing. <br>\nP-edit 2: Great, nearly half the players in the game have claimed. bleh<br>\n<br>\n-W", "time": "Thu Aug 23, 2012 6:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22984&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "22984"}

A pretty common modifier for SK is investigation-immune, it seems like you're begging to be cleared in the eyes of town.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, even though I think you're SK, I don't want you to be the lynch today.

Given that I have no real reason to not believe the Vig claim, nor do I have a reason to doubt the existence of a cop (or some other investigative role), I also think that Jailkeeper is a far more likely PR than Doc when it comes to such a PR-heavy town, because it lessens the amount of power the PRs have greatly (protect is only even-night, has the chance to accidentally RB a PR, etc.).

Thing that makes me think it isn't possible though is that Hoopla is fairly hard pushing a Shamrock lynch; she was the first person to support my wagon analysis lynch idea, from memory. That would mean she would be one scum member down for tommorrow, gains a bit of towncred but ultimately this would be crushed when TP turns up town (assuming a Hoopla/Shamrock/TP scumteam is ridiculously impossible, which it is). <br>\n<br>\nSo basically, she would be hardbussing a scumbuddy for absolutely no gain. Rather, I would see scum-Hoopla as wanting a mislynch on Shamrock that ends in a possible tripletown death and leaves us in lylo with a choice between her and town-TP. I think it is more likely her scumbuddy would be snifit or triton, than Hoopla; or even POSSIBLY she is pushing the bandwagon analysis idea because for some 'lucky-for-her-scumteam' bizarre reasoning her entire team managed to be on the image wagon, and she is pushing a deadend case.<br>\n<br>\nErgo sum, I think scum-Hoopla would be stupid to push on scumbuddy Shamrock, and Hoopla isn't stupid.

My initial impression is scum.<br>\n<br>\nHoopla's claim makes a lot of sense for scum.  She is asking for a cop claim, CCing TP42, and pushing people that were on the GS wagon.  If she is lying then the setup must be doc/cop/vig Vs at least one RC/RB.  If the cop claims and she is lying, then the game is effectively lost.  She can mislynch someone today, RB TP42 and kill the cop.  In that case, she can now proceed to frame TP42 by saying that he isn't a Doctor because he would have protected the cop during the night.

Hoopla can push a townie from that wagon since Tech (and others) clearly see the logic behind doing so for PoE purposes.  Assume all of Hoopla's scum team was on the image wagon.  We lynch Shamrock.  He flips town.  TP42 gets blocked, the cop dies.  Next morning we now get the lovely choice between lynching from the GS wagon (UCT/Snifit) or trying to lynch from the fail claims (Hoopla/TP42).

Her death would have been fairly inevitable at that point.  And there is still the slight chance of them both being town at which point we've pretty much auto lost.

I thought I had a legit crumb on gutter (embarassing), I thought the WIFOM on Mas was legit (more embarassing), and I thought I found FLP's way of writing to be conducive to real-life mafia's downward-inflective tone of voice a scum tell (most embarassing).</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt paid off to some degree. It made you somwhat transparent town, though your meta was making me worried you were just playing a clever scumgame. I think you did well in the end to semi-sheep, IMO. Hopefully this game has taught you a few things about being town! By the by, how confident were you in tech/AP/Hoopla-town?<br>\n<br>\nAbout the VT claim; it wasn't SUPERBAD. But yeah, I would personally advise not to do it. Some people do it in games because it's considered a towntell when people claim VT early, without any need to; and I would say most of the time it is (for scum, it eliminates their ability to fakeclaim, so it's usually not worth the weak town-cred it dishes out). Not to say though that scum couldn't abuse it.<br>\n<br>\nHoopla paranoia was a big thing for me this game. I nearly wanted to push a semi-pseudo policy lynch just because I couldn't trust that I could trust her, etc. I'm glad she came down with the Occam's Razor reasoning/post when she did. I even thought she might have been the last scum there. If I had still been in the game, I would have been leaning CO but creating WIFOM around Hoopla's conf-status (IMO, she WASN'T conf - she could have been CCing scumbuddy TP for massive towncred; high risk high reward stuff). <br>\n<br>\nNice case by AP in the end though. It nailed the coffin on CO. Also glad the night actions worked out the way they did N2; as it was, I could have ended up vigging Sham at the same time as Coolio innoed him. I felt TP was more of a big dog that was harder to lynch for his claim, so was a better vig; but Cool may have been thinking the same thing and decided to inno TP for that reason. IMO, I was a little angry at snifit for not allowing me to post my vig choice before he hammered, but eh, it worked out ok.<br>\n<br>\nI would also like to apologise to Gutter if he is reading this. I felt I was a bit harsh on him for calling me stupid. Particularly when I didn't know his alignment (it's much more acceptable as scum!) <br>\n<br>\nI would like mafia QT please, kthanks.", "time": "Sat Sep 15, 2012 11:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22984&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "22984"}

I know you were throwing reads around everywhere, but <br>\n1. You are refining yourself, eventually you'll work out what are (in your opinion) good scumtells and which aren't, and have more stability in your opinions<br>\n2.

I think snifit could have put more effort into this game, personally; yeah yeah I'm not really one for a winge and he didn't do too bad and all that. I just think snifit shouldn't be berating people too much when<br>\na) yeah, he is more experienced than AP and probably could have done a better job and<br>\nb) he reckons he had TP/Shamrock pegged (which is reflected in the thread), but he didn't push it considerably, particularly when he settled for the FLP lynch after I had said I was likely going to hammer TP<br>\nc) I feel AP put more effort in than snifit, even if snifit could (hypothetically) lawd it over AP as being a better player.<br>\n<br>\nIMO all this is hotheaded crap and both AP and snifit played fairly well. Snifit stop being a spoilt brat and realise everyone will get up your nose once in awhile.

I specifically avoided giving him feedback since I know my dislike of him would likely just make it incendiary and useless. (I don't think AP played a poor game, for what it's worth. Often townies are wrong about things; that doesn't make their play poor. You, me, and AP were all wrong about things in turn.)<br>\nI don't think I berated anyone. It's not about me feeling superior as a player; it's about me having fun playing mafia. As an illustration, I don't particularly enjoy playing with Fate but I know he's quite competent. I don't know how many games you've played, Techno, but surely there's a player that might make you think twice if you were considering signing up for or replacing in to a game and say their name? Perhaps not. That would make you a more agreeable person than me. Such is life.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, AP's response was gracious.

Image could give us wagon analysis. Split the wagons. Definitely not a great reason to kill him, but eh.<br>\n2. He claimed. Albeit, he claimed because I asked him to, but at the time I was having second thoughts about my null read on him and thought he MIGHT have been scum and gutter was his counterwagon. At worst, I was killing a VT<br>\n3. Gutter flipping town made me feel more of that feeling<br>\n4. I didn't get the obvi town vibe you did; and even STILL <br>\n5. He could have been a wasted lynch the next day. Townies who are being pummelled into the ground become baggage unless they manage to 180 and revolutionise the game by miraculously finding all the scum and taking control.<br>\n6. We won. Maybe it had nothing to do with that; it was the gutter wagon that had the analysis that contributed to shammy-death. But at least it showed distance between sham and CO/TP, for future play. Oh and <br>\n7. The only other two people I could have killed was triton or TP. I will NEVER risk killing an unclaimed PR, unless in some real desperate scenario. I was feeling triton town much more than Image. TP, I was feeling town by the claim and I wanted to give him more time (in hindsight, yes, this was the best kill, but don't you love hindsight! Also, Hoopla's claim might not have been heavily believed if we killed TP before she had a chance to CC, but obviously this didn't factor into my decision, just a sidenote). I could have no killed, but I wanted flips. <br>\n<br>\nPersonally I had considered playing vig without killing. I find the idea of night-killing as fairly antitown. It's selfish, one man motivated, and isn't always a role that helps town but can seriously do the opposite.
