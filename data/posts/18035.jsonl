This reminds me of what my predecessor in Mini 1120 did with our scumbuddy. If CML hadnt siteflaked and the town had stayed on him and the scumbuddy, it would have been an easy victory for town. It may be a good idea for people to look back at that game's similarities to this one and look at CML's interaction with Amrun in the early stages of day 1. I'm happy with my vote where it is right now."}

They way you're posting, it's mostly chaff and is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">majorly not helpful</span> from a town perspective. So if you're playing for the town team, you're a teammate of mine for all intents and purposes and in this instance, with your blather, you are <span class=\"noboldsig\">not</span> helping the team. If you're playing for the opposition, however, you're doing a good job. If you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">are</span> playing for the town team, then you may want to consider what your teammates are saying and I'm saying that it's hard for me to take you seriously when a \"rebuttal\" of yours consists of a blathering mixture of sarcasm and attempts at irony and cutesiness.<br><br><br>Speaking of which, let's look to your rebuttal for a moment.

No emphasis needed.<br><br><br>As an addendum to this: It's my opinion that use of smilies is mostly a null tell.

I came back to the site in May I think and I remembered all the reasons I loved playing mafia.  I had a couple of good-fun games and I got back into modding again.  Life was happy.  Then things took a turn for the worse in 3+ ways.  So the wind has been taken out of my sail a little bit.  I am trying to get back into it and always have a little bit more time/effort on the weekend since I work all week.  I have also been posting on my iPad which has significantly reduced my desire to post well thought out long posts (because auto-correct is a pain in the ass when trying to post).  <br><br>1 - My vote on Phoebus was mostly a sheep of VP Baltar because I was reading him as town and I wasn't digging the +1 stuff.  It read as a way to avoid strong analysis and just be passive.   Because I am in the state I am in I have not really went to check if this is a normal thing that he/she does.<br>2 - My case on charter was the honest-to-God read I felt on him at the time.  It was page 4 and I felt like his first vote was random because he just said \"I like your style\" and voted.  Then he proceeded to post 2 posts calling half the game scum without a vote.  I did not realize his first vote was meant to be taken serious.  My vote did have reason but I am going to back down on it a little bit because in all honesty I keep getting Panacea and Phoebus mixed up because I have never played with either.  I thought charter's initial vote was on Phoebus.<br>3 - My vote on beck is because the question is ridiculous.  Read it again.  He asks \"Do you feel people who post useless filler are usually town, scum, or null?\"  This to me reads as a question that he is trying to look like he is scum-hunting.   We all know what the answer will be before the question is even asked.  It's like leading the witness in a courtroom.  In addition, I really don't like his jokey-jokey attitude which I tend to see from scum more on other sites.<br><br>I am leaving my vote, I do believe it's a legitimate point that is being fluffed off because I haven't put my best effort into this game yet.  Like I said, I will give more effort this weekend but I hope this post somewhat explains the way I have played thus far."}

There were two instances of joking behavior from you.  The rat post and the \"I'm married\" post.  I am NOT saying <span class=\"noboldsig\">only</span> scum would do it.  I don't live in your black and white world.  However, I have seen it from scum in the past.  You coming from another site and this being your first game makes it stick out to me because you may not have honed in your \"mafiascum style\" yet.  This is not the primary basis for my vote on you.  It is secondary.  My asking if you were scum was a trick that has ACTUALLY WORKED several times I used it on epicmafia.  Usually the person who answers flat-out \"No\" is not lying.  The guy who says \"No I don't think so\" or \"Yeah lol you broke me down\" is usually the scum.  I was going to see if you made another joke about the question.  You didn't and therefore I did not pursue it.<br><br>@Budja: In regards to Panacea, I believe she showed a tendency to be this way in all her games?  Again, I have been pretty lazy so I haven't looked into it that thoroughly.  I will look more this weekend."}

Rather than coaching, he seemed to snap at her in a way that a partner might press a partner, with a potential bus later. In a curtailed game with 9 players, this strategy (busing a partner early) might work... especially if it gains street cred with the town. I read this game as lacking any other power roles beyond Mafia... based on what the mod said. Therefore, I can foresee a situation where a busing handled correctly might win someone a game.

Just a note to Phoebus, you have been around a lot longer than me by looking at your join date so I may be out of line.  The \"+1\" thing does you a big disservice because by reading your posts I can see you are a good scumhunter.  When you put things in YOUR words it's easier to read.

I think his pappum case is overall weak but there have been times when I have been agreeing with his reads as well, particularly on Beck.  I did notice he backed off the pappum case and switched to Beck while calling hiplop scum over pages 7-8 and I don't like that but I can't argue against his reasons for finding Beck suspicious.  Also, to explain why I called VP town early on.  My intention was to buddy VP strongly.  I was going to call him town several times.  I would think VP-town would accuse me of buddying and VP-scum would let it slide.  I didn't follow up on this because of my lack of interest in this early game, but I thought I would explain it none-the-less.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">hiplop</span> - Not a lot of content.  I have seen a more active hiplop in other games.  I don't know if he is having trouble getting into it or he is scum.  I would say he is a scum-leaning null.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Panacea</span> - I have to parrot what a lot of what others have said.  She has just not done a stinking thing since she has started this game except defend or post smilies.  She hasn't tried to find scum.  The one line of questioning that she thought was scumhunting, which really wasn't, was asking Budja his motivations for calling her \"town\" about the smilies. Also, if she flips scum then there is obvious ties to VP.  I didn't really see the VP-leading her argument as much as her weird response in Post 51 about his having a 1/8 chance of being someone else's partner.  It felt over the top.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Beck</span> - his \"tough\" questions are really not tough.  They are soft balls and he is doing what I myself have got caught as scum doing which is latching on to the first scummy thing I saw and going with it.  Is hiplop scummy for not posting much?  Probably but town do it too and he has grabbed hold of this and not let it go.  He has also thrown out these softball questions like \"who posts fluff more\" and his interrogation of Budja on the smilies.  Biggest mountain out of a molehill I have ever seen.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum</span></span></span><br><br><br>If I missed something that someone had asked me please let me know.  I have a much better feel for the game now and that should help my productivity.  I would be willing to lynch Beck or Panacea today.  I am not interested in lynching anyone from VP Baltar up on my scumlist.  I would reluctantly lynch hiplop but I would like to see more participation from him."}

You asked hiplop \"who do you think posts more fluff town, scum, or its null\" (paraphrase).  Let's take a look.  If hiplop answers town, well that would be weird.  No one is going to answer town.  So that leaves null and scum which are both valid answers that nothing regarding alignment can be gleaned from.  Oh but hiplop was posting fluff you are going to say.  An obvious trap is obvious.  You also interrogated Budja about the smilies like he was a suspected suicide bomber.  WTF?  It was extremely obvious that Budja skimmed some games of panacea to see if posting smilies was the norm.  It was so he noted that nothing can be gleaned from alignment.  How on God's green earth were you learning anything about Budja's alignment from that?  You weren't.  You were just asking questions to be asking questions."}

But that's beside the point. It seems like a massive portion of Beck's posts are lamentations about hiplop not responding to his questions.

He expresses suspicion of Juls, even suggests that she's scumbug #2, but  doesn't even build a case on her because he's apparently got his hands tied until hiplop responds all the way to his questions. Then he mentions later to Baltar that he never said much about Juls.<br><br>There's more, but it's 1 am, I've been catching up with this since I got home two hours ago. Good night!"}

This always leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and she did it to VP who was leaning scum at the time, bugged me even more. She even admits that VP is her buddy, again very off behavior. She votes charter for a post he makes where he lists 3 scum suspects, one of which is....hiplop.<br><br>Beck - I'll save you the obviously biased commentary<br><br>pappums - his first vote pushes a wagon to L-2, than provides some info about another game that nobody really asked for, nor do i think they cared to waste their time reading (I know I didn't) He is the first one to call hiplop out for his vote change to charter, indicating that charter made valid points, not scummy ones. he later debates with VP about who gets credit for the Pan wagon and spends the rest of the time going back and forth with VP<br><br>hiplop - after his RVS vote, he attacks charter for \"Nitpicking way too much for page 3. From what i remember; he never played like this, grasping for too many straws, too quickly.\"  but as we know later he changes that reason to \"Hes just not being sincerere, hes targetting someone full on for no real reason besides newbility. Just grasping for straws\" the only thing that stays the same is the part about grasping at straws, so him being nitpicky has become attacking a newb. He agrees that pan was posting fluff but goes on and just posts a bunch of 1-liners. somewhere in the middle he says his vote was a \"serious\" rvs vote, which seems sort of contradictory to me, RVS is random, a serious random vote off something specific seems like utter horseshit. He ignores my questions and when I get mad at him, he calls me snarky. i could go on and on but ive said enough about  him.<br><br>Phoebus - despite getting to L-2 has been relatively quiet, first 3 posts were a vote and +1s, asks a question to Pan, that I am suprised Juls didn't consider a \"softball\" The question didn't really teach us anything about pan so it was a useless question. next post he responds to pan's post about it being a rebuttal and basically says it wasn't really a rebuttal than angrees with something I said but said it could have been worded differently. Than I feel like he turns the fire up on Pan some what and pushes at her a little harder, than he goes inactive and comes back with a summary post but is still die hard set on lynching pan. - leaning null but only due to the lack of content, i felt he was heating up and than poof.<br><br>Budja - to me doesn't seem to be scum hunting at all and most of his votes are follwoing somebody elses reasons. First jumps in and hops on the Phoebus wagon, later votes Juls and cites charter's comments, than again later votes pappum and agrees with Balter's case. - leaning scum on budja<br><br>Pan - lack of any real content early on, gets into a debate over if her words are a rebuttal or her freaking out, personally I read them as a rebuttal, spends time linking previous games showing that her smilies are common to finally put an end to the smiley discussion. Than she gets busy and finally comes back with a play by play breakdown of my posts and votes me. my issue is despite voting me, she is a null read to me, I think he reasons aren't very well thought out and tbh I really had trouble making it through her entire wall, but I blame my ADD on that one, I basically got bored. If she wants to bullet some questions towards me or some things she interepreted as scummy, i'll be glad to respond better.<br><br>Charter - i sort of disagree with his earlier vote on pan, I don't think lack of content very early on is much of an issue as it is as the game progresses, he also declares VP town which still bothers me the same as mentioned earlier. He voted Hiplop cause he realzied that hiplop's reason was crap, I didn't read it as an omgus vote at all. he is also asking questions to others and responding when asked, I have a town read on him but i feel him and balter are somehow linked which makes my read on him kind of tough for me to swallow"}

I can say that yes, I've posted way less, but at least they've for the most part counted. Beck had 56 at the time I iso'ed him, and a chunk of them were filler. Is that better?

But I know I'm not scum. I said before the Beck wagon that after checking into Phoebus's and Charter's games, I felt them town (I would also like to add that Phoebus's #6 adds to that read). If Baltar is scum, he's really good scum, and I'll check into his meta when I have more time. For right now, he reads more town. The only things I haven't liked about Juls's play so far was bringing maf-drama into the game (it's just uncomfortable, and I agree with Beck's hint at AtE) and the weird reaction to Beck's question of where she played last. The whole prostitute image just seemed extreme. Neither of those are much of a scumtell, though.<br><br>This leaves on my scum list Budja, who's posts are pretty null either way, Pappums, who, like Baltar is good scum if he is scum and who I intend to iso and meta soon, Hiplop, who I can agree does tend to recycle arguments right down to word choice, but who I at the time thought might still be town (I really dislike #224, which wasn't made at the time), and Beck, case is already listed. That being said, there was a 50% chance my main suspect would be on one of the (at the time of Juls's post) 2 main wagons in the first place.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>Mostly parroting what I have said about Beck</div></blockquote> I don't think I'm \"parroting\" at all. (Though maybe I'm just used to the extreme of the \"+1\" thing. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> ) I do agree with you on some of your points with Beck, yeah. Are the tells off limits because you mentioned them? They're still there. I would think it'd be parroting if I just came in, said \"I agree,\" but didn't offer any investigation of my own.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>If there is one thing I can't tolerate it is buddying and it makes me think she and hiplop could very well be buddies.</div></blockquote> Wait, are you saying I'm buddying up to hiplop? How? The case on hiplop is a legitimate, and I'm not defending him. My only mention of hiplop in that post was to point out in which posts Beck brings him up. Just observation.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>I think I want a Panacea lynch more due to her lack of scumhunting and the information we glean from it.</div></blockquote> Honestly, I can agree with this. If we get down to deadline and no one's come right out and yelled \"I'm scum!\" I'd say lynch me. I think I pretty much dug a permanent hole with my earlier lack of content, and would probably be mislynched later anyway. Not to mention that I've had two wagons D1, the first of which was pretty quick, and I'd be willing to bet there was scum on that one, at least. I'd prefer we wait til closer to deadline, though, and I have no intention of self-voting.<br><br>Ughhhhhh, so I can't connect to the server to get to page 10. No more quotes on this post, I guess.<br><br>Just to clarify, yes, my join date is in 2009. I played 5 games from then til early May, 2010. I wound up needing a month of V/LA, so I stopped playing until last month, June, 2011. No, I'm not a newbie and I hate the newbie excuse anyway, but this is my first non-newbie game, and after a year's hiatus, and though I was in denial at first, I'm clearly trying to acclimate to the non-newbie groove at the moment. Don't go light, but do keep it in mind.<br><br>@ Pappums: I mean I love this site and playing mafia because it can be so much fun when you get everyone having a good time. It doesn't all have to be about wining. My problem with this particular  game is that it is so aggressive and tense and all-around fun-less that I'm having a terribly hard time forcing myself to sit and drag through it."}

She votes charter for a post he makes where he lists 3 scum suspects, one of which is....hiplop.</div></blockquote><br>You need to re-examine if you think I am scummy (nah cause you are scum) or if you just don't like me.  I think you just don't like me and you know I am town.  VP is one of the people on this site that I consider a friend.  He is someone I would feel comfortable shooting a PM to to say \"How's your day going?\" He is a super swell guy.   That is all left at the door for this game however.  I explained why I called him town initially.  I wanted to see if VP would call me out for blatant buddying but I didn't get to push it as hard as I would have liked to.  You really don't read my posts do you?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite>Wait, are you saying I'm buddying up to hiplop? How? The case on hiplop is a legitimate, and I'm not defending him. My only mention of hiplop in that post was to point out in which posts Beck brings him up. Just observation.</div></blockquote><br>No, I am saying you are buddying me and parroting my reads on Beck.  I can't really explain in clear terms the feeling I get when someone out of the blue has the same reads as I do.  Especially when those reads are on the second largest wagon.  It makes me think you and hiplop could be partners.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>charter wrote:</cite>What information do you get from a Panacea lynch that you wouldn't get over a Beck or Hiplop lynch?</div></blockquote><br>I have seen two connections to Panacea.  One to VP Baltar for her weird \"no he isn't my partner but there is a 1/8 chance he is scum\" comment.  Others brought up his \"steering\" her but I didn't really see that.  Second is ties to hiplop for trying to jump on the Beck wagon.  Also, I could see Panacea (who is rather new) following her buddy's lead in scumhunting.  Being that VP voted Beck as well there is another tie to Panacea-scum.  I would probably learn a little more from a hiplop-scum lynch than I would from a Beck-scum lynch also.  I would probably have to look back at him a little in night to draw connections if he flipped scum.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>she isn't really asking any questions</div></blockquote><br>Does this excuse you of asking softballs?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>(1.a - the obvious stupid question of \"are you scum\", 1.b - asked charter \"is my vote troublesome for you\") after that I get attacked for my softball questions. How are these questions helping catch scum?</div></blockquote><br>You really don't read my posts do you.  I explained my reasons for 1.a.  I have seen scum from other sites joke that question off.  I wanted to see if you would do it.  The second question was to see charter's reaction. Reactions to a question like that can make/break a read for me.  If his response is fake-rage then he is probably scum.  If his reaction is to back down he is probably scum.  It was attempt to guage charter's natural reaction to my voting him.  I actually liked his response that I wasn't going to get anyone to join me which showed he was confident in his towniness which I usually don't see from scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>she says my humor is a scumtell based on her experience, but later follows up with her own humor - so she is a hypocrite, regardless of her reasoning, if she s going to try and make humor a tell for somebody, than she shouldn't be doing it herself</div></blockquote><br><br>You are really having to dig deep aren't you.

Hey but that blue text makes for a super serious post!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>ok WOW this is crazy, I think what I said in the que is I wouldn't vote him day 1 and it was a joke, REALLY REACHING with this one.

The point I was trying to make is that if there was anyone in this game you would latch on as your \"town-buddy\" as scum it would be charter.  I think you believe you have a special Redskins bond with him and would want to take advantage of that as scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>how is this scum hunting? do they even know the meaning of the word snarky, </div></blockquote><br>I do, do you?  Of course it is scumhunting.  Juls does thing A in the past as scum. She sees Beck doing thing A. Hmmm.

Then her playing every side possible of the Juls/Beck debate, but not taking a stance.  And then her question about bussing really rubs me the wrong way.  I don't see how any answer to that question has relevance to anything, but it looks like she's trying to simultaneously implant the ideas that they're both scum or town/scum and that we should lynch both of them.

You guys need to cool it with the tit-for-tat because it's impossible to tell the difference between genuine frustration and thread spamming to kill town interest in the game at this point. This was a favorite scum technique from Adel back in the day and I'm always suspicious of it when I see it. <br><br>2) I actually like Panacea's play after she gets her head on straight. Charter's vote on her is bullshit and sets off huge alarm bells for me. I haven't liked your play for much of this game charter because your de facto argument is 'people not contributin,' which is a very easy thing for a veteran of MS to attack noobs for and still look legit. Yeah, she flips her read on Beck after her giant PBPA. I hated that PBPA post as much as anyone. However, her follow up posts are pretty decent scumhunting and it is obvious she is really trying at that point. I think it's pretty illogical for you first to attack her for not scumhunting and then to follow that up by attacking the scumhunting she does do when starts putting more effort in. It's damned if you do and damned if you don't. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>VP wrote:</cite>unvote, vote: Budja</div></blockquote><br>Care to elaborate?<br></div></blockquote>Budja has been following me around all game without making any contribution of his own. he clearly got the message of that vote because his following post was original questions. Needless to say, that doesn't exactly quell my suspicions of him. I do think Budja gets kind of a slow start to games when he's town, so I'm certainly not saying I have a strong scum read on him. But my vote would have had very little impact if I had explained that at the time. Either way, I want to see some more out of Budja so I can get a better read of him, and following me around is only going to make me further want to lynch. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>3) I think Beck is scum.

I don't think you come out as the clear winrar of that if that's what your assumption is. I think you're both kind of bickering over petty stuff and your ultimatum is useless. I still have my reservations about Beck, but that doesn't make you 100% right, particularly about a 'failure to admit you're wrong' tell.

My reads are always going to shift and change as I try to figure things out. I haven't flipped at all on my reads in terms of going from someone conf. town in my eyes to conf. scum or anything like that which could be taken as inconsistency. <br><br>In terms of my reads, I think I've been pretty clear actually. I've voted for people I find to be scummy. What reads do you think I haven't been clear on? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>He got caught lying when I called him on saying that I was \"defending hiplop\". It's ludicrous.

To me a lie is something that is unequivocally proven to be a fact. I think Beck's point is bullshit because the things aren't related, but if he's town he probably believes what he is saying. That's quite different than someone lying (ie claiming a night action that is later countered by another role or something along those lines)<br><br>tl;dr<br><br>I feel like you are way over stating things here Juls. Both you and Beck are. That's why all this bickering is going on. You started the game cooly and now you're charging around like a frenzied rhino. What's the deal?

You've got to accept that.

I felt strongly about it. I still think he has a decent chance of being scum. I did back off however because his explanation of his actions is somewhat convincing. Also, he's at least playing the game, so that means my read on him will only improve. <br><br>Beck - still scummy for the things I pointed out earlier. I think he does sound somewhat townish in some of his spat with you though. Which is why I hate those back and forths. It becomes nigh impossible to tell who is frustrated town and who is scum just trying to push buttons. I don't appreciate you fueling that kind of thing. <br><br>Budja - reasonably scummy for his following me like a puppy dog, and my vote is staying there at the moment. <br><br>Panacea - I haven't found her that scummy all game really, even when she was just being lazy. Her PBPA sucks because PBPAs suck and it felt kinda opportunistic. That being said, the vote was on beck, so.... Overall she comes across as noob town and I'm really not interested in lynching her. <br><br>charter - seems mostly town to me other than his persistence on only noobs. <br><br>hiplop - pretty shitty play, so I can understand why charter et al. don't like him to some degree. Gut says he's low hanging fruit though. I guess that balances to more of a null read than anything. I would like to see him be more involved in a significant way. <br><br>Phoebus - null and I think he's trying to stay there, which I don't like. At times he gets in the mix and early on he was at least pushing Panacea with some kind of passion, but he seems detached. Also want to see him get more involved."}

I haven't liked your play for much of this game charter because your de facto argument is 'people not contributin,' which is a very easy thing for a veteran of MS to attack noobs for and still look legit. Yeah, she flips her read on Beck after her giant PBPA. I hated that PBPA post as much as anyone. However, her follow up posts are pretty decent scumhunting and it is obvious she is really trying at that point.

And the majority of my qualms about Hiplop is how he gave bad reasoning for voting me, and then when called on it, he backtracked, and then was called on it again and then changed it.  My latest vote on Panacea has nothing to do with her lack of content (though that certainly isn't helping her case), it has to do with my belief that she's faking scumhunting.  I don't think I've said more than two sentences about Budja, and he's fluffposting like a heavyweight champ.

He's been on every wagon but the Beckwagon (but that occurred the same time as the Budjawagon).  I also feel as if his reason for voting these people has been because they've been safety votes.  What tips me off to this is his reason for no longer suspecting Hiplop and his reason for voting Budja.  I assume his reason for voting Psyche is what everyone else has already said, but once again, no real original reason and on a comfortable target.  All of Pappums's questioning of the people he votes comes after he's voted them.<br><br>I have other reasons for suspecting Pappums is possibly scum, but they basically boil down to gut.  I never mentioned this before because until he voted Budja, there wasn't much that was concrete, but since he switched to Budja, my suspicion has grown, and now with his Psyche vote, it's exploded.  To be honest, the only people that make much sense as his buddy are Phoebus, Beck, and Juls.  Out of them, Phoebus is the obvious pick."}

I just did not see hiplop as scum anymore, based on his answers, and Budja had been someone I had problems with for quite awhile. I never voted him previously because I wanted hiplop to answer my questions and I wanted that pressure to remain on him. As for the hop to Psyche, I had already been a supporter of a Panacea lynch before. Hiplop made more sense for awhile, but then when the replacement came in with scumtastic posts like he did, I switched back to that slot. From my point of view, a Psyche or Budja lynch would be great, and it doesnt matter which one hangs. I think Psyche's vote on him was bussing, and I think the flip of either of them would say alot about the other."}

The only thing I don't like is if we lynch Pappums and he flips town, it's basically like starting the game two players down, since his lynch will tell us nothing.  A lynch on any other player would be much more informative.  I guess that's not much of a reason to not lynch Pappums, but it doesn't help.  I'd much rather lynch someone who is scummy and will be impossible to read in the coming days due to post style.<br><br>I dunno, I'd prefer lynching Budja because of the high chance of being scum, and it will be better for the coming days."}

As I said, anyone who has read this game would know she was on him all day, and your hop onto Beck looks very contrived to me, and your recent posts have made you sound like flailing scum. Budja was scum, and bobsnox is as well. Making a whole case against Beck because Juls suspected him is a horrible, baseless argument, I dont think people analyze NK's anymore, there is way too much WIFOM potential in a NK that it makes it pretty much worthless to take them into consideration. And his \"case\" against Beck isnt even that, he basically just says \"Juls is dead, Juls suspected Beck, therefore Beck is scum\". No real scumhunting going on here whatsoever, and no other backing reasoning for why Beck is scum. THis makes it L-1:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: bobsnox</span>"}

What is so hard to understand about this? I am a VT who replaced into a fairly lame game (not the Mod's fault) which was stalling on DAY ONE with TWO L-2 wagons. I hammered someone I genuinely had a scumread on, but I didn't bother reading the whole game prior to that because the game needed to freaking move on. I decided to do some actual work today, so I started with the best lead I could think of: who died and why? The most obvious answer is that Beck killed Juls. Juls did not hint at being a danger to scum, so someone killed her to avoid pressure from her. Of course there's WIFOM involved there, but it's simple and it makes sense. Pardon the use of Ockham's Razor here, but that's the option I still think is best (well, before I read your recent post that is).

Now, the only possible scumteams at this point is Balter/Hiplop (but it's not actually the case), Balter/Charter (also not the case) or Balter/Someone else (the case) since once Beck/Bobs posts and doesn't hammer, the only explanation is Balter being scum.
