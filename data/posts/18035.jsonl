One day, two of you decided that life wasn't quiet or peaceful enough for your liking so an ultimatum was written. The gist of it: We're tired of sharing this town, get out or we'll kill you all. Not to be frightened out of their homes, the townies of smalltown decided to get down to business and get to dealing with the threat in the only way they know how, with their trusty hanging rope.<br>\n<br>\nPlayer alive:<br>\n<br>\n3.

(Assuming you have the power to do so.)<br>\n<br>\nDo not quote any moderator pms sent to you by me. (This includes role pms and all aspects of the role pm. (ex: Timestamps of role pms))<br>\n<br>\nFeel free to PM me with any questions or concerns you have. I will make in game announcements if appropriate.<br>\n<br>\nDo not use any font size other than normal please. I will warn violaters, and will modkill repeat offenders. Don't try to hide text or make it difficult to read either.<br>\n<br>\nAbsolutely no encrypted text of any kind.<br>\n<br>\nOnce you're dead, stop typing. (I will allow one contentless \"bah\" post as an exception.)<br>\n<br>\nPlease treat the other players in the game with respect. I do not want to have to intervene if the game starts to get personal, but I will if I have to.<br>\n<br>\nDo not talk about ongoing games please.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">This is my color, don't use it.</div><br>\n<br>\nI reserve the right to add, remove and change rules as I see fit to improve the quality of the game. I will also clarify the rules as needed.<br>\n<br>\nModkills will end the day. (Breaking or pretending to break any rule on my ruleset may be grounds for this at my discretion. Your role will be changed to neutral survivor and you will automatically lose the game if you are modkilled, so be forewarned.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gameplay Rules:</div><br>\n<br>\nEach day the town decides on a lynch. You will require one half of the living players plus one in order to achieve a lynching majority. I will go out of my way to make sure you are aware of this number. Be aware that you must achieve this threshold for a lynch, even at deadline. (No lynch will occur at deadline if there's no majority.)<br>\n<br>\nTo vote please do so in this format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Zachrulez</div> Please bold your vote and try to put it at the bottom of your post. (Not required but appreciated.) Failure to vote in the bold format may result in the vote not being counted. (At my discretion I will determine vote intent.)<br>\n<br>\nUnvoting is appreciated, but not required. Please post it in bold if you do it.<br>\n<br>\nNo lynch is also allowed, under the same format. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div> A majority vote for no lynch will send the game into night without a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDay 1 will have a deadline of 3 weeks. All following days will have a 2 week deadline.<br>\n<br>\nYou are subject to a mod prod after 48 hours of inactivity. You will have 24 hours to respond to a prod in thread before I start searching for a replacement. (Weekends will count as 24 hours.)<br>\n<br>\nIf you are unable to meet the minimum posting requirements for any reason, please let us know in thread. Don't leave us hanging.<br>\n<br>\nOnce a majority is reached, that player is lynched and can not be saved with unvotes. All players including the lynched player are free to continue posting until I get around to locking the thread.<br>\n<br>\nNight will last a maximum of 3 days under normal circumstances. Night actions for relevant players are due within this time frame. If I do not receive an action from a player who has one, it will be forfeited.<br>\n<br>\nLast and Most importantly, have fun! That is why we are here after all.", "time": "Sun Jul 03, 2011 4:39 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18035&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "18035"}

Right?<br>\nHowever would you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">care</div> if I said that your posting style prevents me from taking you seriously; which, in turn, hinders my ability to play the game well?<br>\nThis seems to be what I should be taking from the snippet I quoted. As long as your style doesn't hinder the game, it doesn't matter if you're taken seriously or not?<br>\n<br>\nHere's how I see it: As a member of an uninformed majority who knows only about himself, I have to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. This is the only way I can play the game well enough to help my team; and yes, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">am</div> on a team; I just don't know my teammates. They way you're posting, it's mostly chaff and is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">majorly not helpful</div> from a town perspective. So if you're playing for the town team, you're a teammate of mine for all intents and purposes and in this instance, with your blather, you are <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> helping the team. If you're playing for the opposition, however, you're doing a good job. If you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">are</div> playing for the town team, then you may want to consider what your teammates are saying and I'm saying that it's hard for me to take you seriously when a \"rebuttal\" of yours consists of a blathering mixture of sarcasm and attempts at irony and cutesiness.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of which, let's look to your rebuttal for a moment. Something for which you provided a very handy definition:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><br>\n1) \"Rebut:<br>\n &#8212; vb  , -buts , -butting , -butted<br>\n\t( tr ) to refute or disprove, esp by offering a contrary contention or argument.\"<br>\n        (World English Dictionary)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nLet me elaborate on one word in there:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dictionary.com wrote:</cite><br>\nar&#183;gu&#183;ment<br>\n&#8194; &#8194;[ahr-gyuh-muhnt]<br>\n<br>\n2. a discussion involving differing points of view; debate<br>\n3. a process of reasoning; series of reasons<br>\n4. a statement, reason, or fact for or against a point<br>\n5. an address or composition intended to convince or persuade; persuasive discourse. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/argument\" class=\"postlink\">Source</a><br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNow Let's look at your \"rebuttal\": <br>\n(Please correct me if I make an error in assessing some of your intentions below.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>charter wrote:</cite>I don't like how you're posting a ton but saying nothing.

I came back to the site in May I think and I remembered all the reasons I loved playing mafia.  I had a couple of good-fun games and I got back into modding again.  Life was happy.  Then things took a turn for the worse in 3+ ways.  So the wind has been taken out of my sail a little bit.  I am trying to get back into it and always have a little bit more time/effort on the weekend since I work all week.  I have also been posting on my iPad which has significantly reduced my desire to post well thought out long posts (because auto-correct is a pain in the ass when trying to post).  <br>\n<br>\n1 - My vote on Phoebus was mostly a sheep of VP Baltar because I was reading him as town and I wasn't digging the +1 stuff.  It read as a way to avoid strong analysis and just be passive.   Because I am in the state I am in I have not really went to check if this is a normal thing that he/she does.<br>\n2 - My case on charter was the honest-to-God read I felt on him at the time.  It was page 4 and I felt like his first vote was random because he just said \"I like your style\" and voted.  Then he proceeded to post 2 posts calling half the game scum without a vote.  I did not realize his first vote was meant to be taken serious.  My vote did have reason but I am going to back down on it a little bit because in all honesty I keep getting Panacea and Phoebus mixed up because I have never played with either.  I thought charter's initial vote was on Phoebus.<br>\n3 - My vote on beck is because the question is ridiculous.  Read it again.  He asks \"Do you feel people who post useless filler are usually town, scum, or null?\"  This to me reads as a question that he is trying to look like he is scum-hunting.   We all know what the answer will be before the question is even asked.  It's like leading the witness in a courtroom.  In addition, I really don't like his jokey-jokey attitude which I tend to see from scum more on other sites.<br>\n<br>\nI am leaving my vote, I do believe it's a legitimate point that is being fluffed off because I haven't put my best effort into this game yet.

It's not a matter of whether she's contributing fluff or not, as far as I'm concerned.<br>\nI don't do random votes. I usually hold back until I see something worthy of comment and voting. Her \"oh it's not as crazy here as it was in the newbie games!\" line of talking made me want to vote for her. Something about that did not sit right with me. Her subsequent sarcastic and somewhat trite reactions had me content with my vote where it is/was.<br>\n<br>\n2. I've +1'd this before. I did not like the way VP Baltar seemed to be coaching Panacea away from being reactive the way she was, early in the game. I also +1'd the idea that Baltar and Panacea are scum together, because of this.<br>\n<br>\n3. That said, just because charter seemed to be agreeing with stuff that I said/did to Panacea, doesn't mean that I think he's a good guy. In fact, I think, in some ways, that his reaction to Panacea is almost the opposite to Baltar's. Rather than coaching, he seemed to snap at her in a way that a partner might press a partner, with a potential bus later. In a curtailed game with 9 players, this strategy (busing a partner early) might work... especially if it gains street cred with the town. I read this game as lacking any other power roles beyond Mafia... based on what the mod said. Therefore, I can foresee a situation where a busing handled correctly might win someone a game. Also, notice, now, that charter's vote is no longer on Panacea. So maybe the moment has passed.<br>\n<br>\n4. I get the feeling that either one of charter/Baltar has successfully diverted attention from Panacea to other targets, which is now resulting in the current general confusion/cross-fire.<br>\nI can foresee one of three scum combinations at this time:<br>\n--&gt; Panacea + Baltar<br>\n--&gt; Panacea + charter<br>\n--&gt; Baltar + charter (this one, somewhat unlikely... but could be possible)<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone else is scum(my), well I haven't really caught on to much.<br>\n<br>\n5.

I can see that a wagon is building on him. Based on my current thoughts, I am unlikely to want to switch to him. However, three things might change this.<br>\ni) He does/says something absolutely scummy.<br>\nii) He has already done/said something absolutely scummy and I see this when I re-read properly.<br>\niii) I get tired enough of random Day 1-ness and/or we get near enough to a lynch deadline that I would be OK with him swinging. As much as I detest day starts, handled properly, we can usually get information from them after the fact.

I did notice he backed off the pappum case and switched to Beck while calling hiplop scum over pages 7-8 and I don't like that but I can't argue against his reasons for finding Beck suspicious.  Also, to explain why I called VP town early on.  My intention was to buddy VP strongly.  I was going to call him town several times.  I would think VP-town would accuse me of buddying and VP-scum would let it slide.  I didn't follow up on this because of my lack of interest in this early game, but I thought I would explain it none-the-less.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hiplop</div> - Not a lot of content.  I have seen a more active hiplop in other games.  I don't know if he is having trouble getting into it or he is scum.  I would say he is a scum-leaning null.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Panacea</div> - I have to parrot what a lot of what others have said.  She has just not done a stinking thing since she has started this game except defend or post smilies.  She hasn't tried to find scum.  The one line of questioning that she thought was scumhunting, which really wasn't, was asking Budja his motivations for calling her \"town\" about the smilies. Also, if she flips scum then there is obvious ties to VP.  I didn't really see the VP-leading her argument as much as her weird response in Post 51 about his having a 1/8 chance of being someone else's partner.  It felt over the top.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Beck</div> - his \"tough\" questions are really not tough.  They are soft balls and he is doing what I myself have got caught as scum doing which is latching on to the first scummy thing I saw and going with it.  Is hiplop scummy for not posting much?  Probably but town do it too and he has grabbed hold of this and not let it go.  He has also thrown out these softball questions like \"who posts fluff more\" and his interrogation of Budja on the smilies.  Biggest mountain out of a molehill I have ever seen.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf I missed something that someone had asked me please let me know.

But that's beside the point. It seems like a massive portion of Beck's posts are lamentations about hiplop not responding to his questions. From my perspective, he's just trying to keep his vote on what he sees as an easy lynch. He expresses suspicion of Juls, even suggests that she's scumbug #2, but  doesn't even build a case on her because he's apparently got his hands tied until hiplop responds all the way to his questions.

This always leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and she did it to VP who was leaning scum at the time, bugged me even more. She even admits that VP is her buddy, again very off behavior. She votes charter for a post he makes where he lists 3 scum suspects, one of which is....hiplop.<br>\n<br>\nBeck - I'll save you the obviously biased commentary<br>\n<br>\npappums - his first vote pushes a wagon to L-2, than provides some info about another game that nobody really asked for, nor do i think they cared to waste their time reading (I know I didn't) He is the first one to call hiplop out for his vote change to charter, indicating that charter made valid points, not scummy ones. he later debates with VP about who gets credit for the Pan wagon and spends the rest of the time going back and forth with VP<br>\n<br>\nhiplop - after his RVS vote, he attacks charter for \"Nitpicking way too much for page 3. From what i remember; he never played like this, grasping for too many straws, too quickly.\"  but as we know later he changes that reason to \"Hes just not being sincerere, hes targetting someone full on for no real reason besides newbility. Just grasping for straws\" the only thing that stays the same is the part about grasping at straws, so him being nitpicky has become attacking a newb. He agrees that pan was posting fluff but goes on and just posts a bunch of 1-liners. somewhere in the middle he says his vote was a \"serious\" rvs vote, which seems sort of contradictory to me, RVS is random, a serious random vote off something specific seems like utter horseshit. He ignores my questions and when I get mad at him, he calls me snarky. i could go on and on but ive said enough about  him.<br>\n<br>\nPhoebus - despite getting to L-2 has been relatively quiet, first 3 posts were a vote and +1s, asks a question to Pan, that I am suprised Juls didn't consider a \"softball\" The question didn't really teach us anything about pan so it was a useless question. next post he responds to pan's post about it being a rebuttal and basically says it wasn't really a rebuttal than angrees with something I said but said it could have been worded differently. Than I feel like he turns the fire up on Pan some what and pushes at her a little harder, than he goes inactive and comes back with a summary post but is still die hard set on lynching pan. - leaning null but only due to the lack of content, i felt he was heating up and than poof.<br>\n<br>\nBudja - to me doesn't seem to be scum hunting at all and most of his votes are follwoing somebody elses reasons. First jumps in and hops on the Phoebus wagon, later votes Juls and cites charter's comments, than again later votes pappum and agrees with Balter's case. - leaning scum on budja<br>\n<br>\nPan - lack of any real content early on, gets into a debate over if her words are a rebuttal or her freaking out, personally I read them as a rebuttal, spends time linking previous games showing that her smilies are common to finally put an end to the smiley discussion. Than she gets busy and finally comes back with a play by play breakdown of my posts and votes me. my issue is despite voting me, she is a null read to me, I think he reasons aren't very well thought out and tbh I really had trouble making it through her entire wall, but I blame my ADD on that one, I basically got bored. If she wants to bullet some questions towards me or some things she interepreted as scummy, i'll be glad to respond better.<br>\n<br>\nCharter - i sort of disagree with his earlier vote on pan, I don't think lack of content very early on is much of an issue as it is as the game progresses, he also declares VP town which still bothers me the same as mentioned earlier. He voted Hiplop cause he realzied that hiplop's reason was crap, I didn't read it as an omgus vote at all. he is also asking questions to others and responding when asked, I have a town read on him but i feel him and balter are somehow linked which makes my read on him kind of tough for me to swallow", "time": "Mon Jul 11, 2011 8:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18035&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "18035"}

But I know I'm not scum. I said before the Beck wagon that after checking into Phoebus's and Charter's games, I felt them town (I would also like to add that Phoebus's #6 adds to that read). If Baltar is scum, he's really good scum, and I'll check into his meta when I have more time. For right now, he reads more town. The only things I haven't liked about Juls's play so far was bringing maf-drama into the game (it's just uncomfortable, and I agree with Beck's hint at AtE) and the weird reaction to Beck's question of where she played last. The whole prostitute image just seemed extreme. Neither of those are much of a scumtell, though.<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves on my scum list Budja, who's posts are pretty null either way, Pappums, who, like Baltar is good scum if he is scum and who I intend to iso and meta soon, Hiplop, who I can agree does tend to recycle arguments right down to word choice, but who I at the time thought might still be town (I really dislike #224, which wasn't made at the time), and Beck, case is already listed.

How? The case on hiplop is a legitimate, and I'm not defending him. My only mention of hiplop in that post was to point out in which posts Beck brings him up. Just observation.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>I think I want a Panacea lynch more due to her lack of scumhunting and the information we glean from it.</div></blockquote> Honestly, I can agree with this. If we get down to deadline and no one's come right out and yelled \"I'm scum!\" I'd say lynch me. I think I pretty much dug a permanent hole with my earlier lack of content, and would probably be mislynched later anyway. Not to mention that I've had two wagons D1, the first of which was pretty quick, and I'd be willing to bet there was scum on that one, at least.

This always leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and she did it to VP who was leaning scum at the time, bugged me even more. She even admits that VP is her buddy, again very off behavior. She votes charter for a post he makes where he lists 3 scum suspects, one of which is....hiplop.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou need to re-examine if you think I am scummy (nah cause you are scum) or if you just don't like me.  I think you just don't like me and you know I am town.  VP is one of the people on this site that I consider a friend.  He is someone I would feel comfortable shooting a PM to to say \"How's your day going?\" He is a super swell guy.   That is all left at the door for this game however.  I explained why I called him town initially.  I wanted to see if VP would call me out for blatant buddying but I didn't get to push it as hard as I would have liked to.  You really don't read my posts do you?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite>Wait, are you saying I'm buddying up to hiplop? How? The case on hiplop is a legitimate, and I'm not defending him. My only mention of hiplop in that post was to point out in which posts Beck brings him up. Just observation.</div></blockquote><br>\nNo, I am saying you are buddying me and parroting my reads on Beck.  I can't really explain in clear terms the feeling I get when someone out of the blue has the same reads as I do.  Especially when those reads are on the second largest wagon.  It makes me think you and hiplop could be partners.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>charter wrote:</cite>What information do you get from a Panacea lynch that you wouldn't get over a Beck or Hiplop lynch?</div></blockquote><br>\nI have seen two connections to Panacea.  One to VP Baltar for her weird \"no he isn't my partner but there is a 1/8 chance he is scum\" comment.  Others brought up his \"steering\" her but I didn't really see that.  Second is ties to hiplop for trying to jump on the Beck wagon.  Also, I could see Panacea (who is rather new) following her buddy's lead in scumhunting.  Being that VP voted Beck as well there is another tie to Panacea-scum.  I would probably learn a little more from a hiplop-scum lynch than I would from a Beck-scum lynch also.  I would probably have to look back at him a little in night to draw connections if he flipped scum.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>she isn't really asking any questions</div></blockquote><br>\nDoes this excuse you of asking softballs?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>(1.a - the obvious stupid question of \"are you scum\", 1.b - asked charter \"is my vote troublesome for you\") after that I get attacked for my softball questions. How are these questions helping catch scum?</div></blockquote><br>\nYou really don't read my posts do you.  I explained my reasons for 1.a.  I have seen scum from other sites joke that question off.  I wanted to see if you would do it.  The second question was to see charter's reaction. Reactions to a question like that can make/break a read for me.  If his response is fake-rage then he is probably scum.  If his reaction is to back down he is probably scum.  It was attempt to guage charter's natural reaction to my voting him.  I actually liked his response that I wasn't going to get anyone to join me which showed he was confident in his towniness which I usually don't see from scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>she says my humor is a scumtell based on her experience, but later follows up with her own humor - so she is a hypocrite, regardless of her reasoning, if she s going to try and make humor a tell for somebody, than she shouldn't be doing it herself</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou are really having to dig deep aren't you.  Poor thing.  Hey but that blue text makes for a super serious post!<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>ok WOW this is crazy, I think what I said in the que is I wouldn't vote him day 1 and it was a joke, REALLY REACHING with this one. Plus isn't there a rule against forming alliances or using outside influences or something, idk but I would never something so stupid.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou really don't read my posts do you?  The point I was trying to make is that if there was anyone in this game you would latch on as your \"town-buddy\" as scum it would be charter.  I think you believe you have a special Redskins bond with him and would want to take advantage of that as scum. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>how is this scum hunting? do they even know the meaning of the word snarky, </div></blockquote><br>\nI do, do you?

You guys need to cool it with the tit-for-tat because it's impossible to tell the difference between genuine frustration and thread spamming to kill town interest in the game at this point. This was a favorite scum technique from Adel back in the day and I'm always suspicious of it when I see it. <br>\n<br>\n2) I actually like Panacea's play after she gets her head on straight. Charter's vote on her is bullshit and sets off huge alarm bells for me. I haven't liked your play for much of this game charter because your de facto argument is 'people not contributin,' which is a very easy thing for a veteran of MS to attack noobs for and still look legit. Yeah, she flips her read on Beck after her giant PBPA. I hated that PBPA post as much as anyone. However, her follow up posts are pretty decent scumhunting and it is obvious she is really trying at that point. I think it's pretty illogical for you first to attack her for not scumhunting and then to follow that up by attacking the scumhunting she does do when starts putting more effort in. It's damned if you do and damned if you don't. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panacea wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>VP wrote:</cite><br>\nunvote, vote: Budja</div></blockquote><br>\nCare to elaborate?<br>\n</div></blockquote>Budja has been following me around all game without making any contribution of his own. he clearly got the message of that vote because his following post was original questions. Needless to say, that doesn't exactly quell my suspicions of him. I do think Budja gets kind of a slow start to games when he's town, so I'm certainly not saying I have a strong scum read on him. But my vote would have had very little impact if I had explained that at the time. Either way, I want to see some more out of Budja so I can get a better read of him, and following me around is only going to make me further want to lynch. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>3) I think Beck is scum.

I don't think you come out as the clear winrar of that if that's what your assumption is. I think you're both kind of bickering over petty stuff and your ultimatum is useless.

To me a lie is something that is unequivocally proven to be a fact. I think Beck's point is bullshit because the things aren't related, but if he's town he probably believes what he is saying.

His reason was \"wagon ho!\", I don't have any issue with this vote.<br>\n<br>\n187- Switches to Hiplop.  His reasoning is Hiplop's bad vote on me.  The vote has a good home, but it is the third vote on Hiplop, after Beck and myself.  Pappums is jumping on board in the middle when it's safe to do so since others support the vote.  Around this point he ceases questioning anybody but Hiplop.<br>\n<br>\n374- Switches to Budja.  His reasoning is \"I havent liked Budja in this game, everything about him has seemed contrived and forced, and I dont see the hiplop wagon in quite the same light as I did before\".  This is what initially bothered me, it gave me a feeling of Pappums always wants to be on a bustling wagon.  If you read his posts surrounding his Hiplop vote, most of them are questioning Hiplop, which (in my opinion) Hiplop could not have satiated Pappums's concerns.  They didn't up until his Budja vote, and then all of a sudden, they magically have.  The only real difference between the two is how the Hiplop wagon evaporated and the Beckwagon and Budjawagon sprung up.  Once again, Pappums finds himself in the middle of the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n425- Switches to Psyche.  Doesn't give any reasoning.  Once again, finds himself in the middle of the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI feel as if his Hiplop, Budja, and Psyche votes have all been 'safety' votes.  He's been on every wagon but the Beckwagon (but that occurred the same time as the Budjawagon).  I also feel as if his reason for voting these people has been because they've been safety votes.  What tips me off to this is his reason for no longer suspecting Hiplop and his reason for voting Budja.  I assume his reason for voting Psyche is what everyone else has already said, but once again, no real original reason and on a comfortable target.  All of Pappums's questioning of the people he votes comes after he's voted them.<br>\n<br>\nI have other reasons for suspecting Pappums is possibly scum, but they basically boil down to gut.  I never mentioned this before because until he voted Budja, there wasn't much that was concrete, but since he switched to Budja, my suspicion has grown, and now with his Psyche vote, it's exploded.

You're pretty convinced they are both scum at this point?</div></blockquote><br>\nI guess I can change to Pappums, his reasoning for dropping Hiplop is very sketchy, I really don't see how Hiplop's 340 alleviated Pappums's suspicion on him.  The only thing I don't like is if we lynch Pappums and he flips town, it's basically like starting the game two players down, since his lynch will tell us nothing.  A lynch on any other player would be much more informative.  I guess that's not much of a reason to not lynch Pappums, but it doesn't help.  I'd much rather lynch someone who is scummy and will be impossible to read in the coming days due to post style.<br>\n<br>\nI dunno, I'd prefer lynching Budja because of the high chance of being scum, and it will be better for the coming days.", "time": "Thu Jul 21, 2011 11:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18035&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "18035"}

You are very erratic in your reads, and then saying you are going to ISO Juls to see who she suspected is kind of hilarious.

Making a whole case against Beck because Juls suspected him is a horrible, baseless argument, I dont think people analyze NK's anymore, there is way too much WIFOM potential in a NK that it makes it pretty much worthless to take them into consideration. And his \"case\" against Beck isnt even that, he basically just says \"Juls is dead, Juls suspected Beck, therefore Beck is scum\".

What is so hard to understand about this? I am a VT who replaced into a fairly lame game (not the Mod's fault) which was stalling on DAY ONE with TWO L-2 wagons. I hammered someone I genuinely had a scumread on, but I didn't bother reading the whole game prior to that because the game needed to freaking move on. I decided to do some actual work today, so I started with the best lead I could think of: who died and why? The most obvious answer is that Beck killed Juls. Juls did not hint at being a danger to scum, so someone killed her to avoid pressure from her. Of course there's WIFOM involved there, but it's simple and it makes sense. Pardon the use of Ockham's Razor here, but that's the option I still think is best (well, before I read your recent post that is).
