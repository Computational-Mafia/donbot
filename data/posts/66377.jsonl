I felt kind of bad making the host account for changing my RVS two minutes after I made it so I figured I'd just leave it on Garmr until I got a response from RC.  Between 25 and 55, RC posted a few times and didn't really explain why he'd decided it was important to make post 7, and I hadn't found anything else that seemed more suspicious. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7891186#p7891186\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7891186#p7891186\" data-post-id=\"7891186\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 57</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26724\">Apricity</a> wrote:</cite>Also idk how that post from him seems like he's trying to \"look\" town--elaborate?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n2 minutes after the topic goes live, RC says \"hey I've got a way to break the game, I just can't tell you what it is yet\".  With that quick of a reaction time, he definitely thought about ways to break it before the game started.  <br>\n<br>\nIf RC is town, it's poor strategy to alert the scum to the fact that the game will soon be \"broken\" before actually doing it.  Why not just break the game on page 10 or whenever seems like a good time?  Or better yet, some other townie reveals the strategy and then that helps his scumhunting game.<br>\n<br>\nBut there's good reason to announce that the game is broken if he's scum.  This is a fairly simple setup.  Really, any way to break this game has to revolve around the weak bodyguard role.  If he's scum, he probably assumed other people had figured it out too.  Scum RC would assume the game's going to be \"broken\" somehow and that he might as well be the one who does it.<br>\n<br>\nObviously, this is all pretty contingent on how game-breaking this strategy is.  Personally, I'm skeptical of it.  It's been reviewed by like 3 people and I've thought about how to break it myself.  I'm thinking this game-breaking strategy probably only marginally helps us, if it does at all.", "time": "Mon May 02, 2016 8:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66377&start=50", "forum": "53", "thread": "66377"}

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br>\n<br>\nSo coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">while</div>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br>\n<br>\nSo, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">content</div> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">those</div> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">am</div></div> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThat was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br>\n<br>\nI have to go deal with people in RL now.

I feel good about my townread on RC, and that's about it.  <br>\n<br>\nI keep going back and forth on dwlee, BNL, papermaker, and Apricity.  Something sticks out to me about so many people reading Papermaker as town early on.  I had a slight scumread on Papermaker but that's probably tainted by OMGUS.  Still, dwlee, Apricity, BNL, and FourTrouble all did that at various times and that's really weird to me.  It went in the order of BNL &gt; Apr &gt; FourTrouble &gt; dwlee, I think.  I'm not sure about the ordering of FourTrouble and dwlee.  Oddly enough, it was h_a's 376 that tipped me off that something might be up.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I originally thought all four of those players were town.

In that case, the response RC gave (calling people who disagreed with him scummy) is an appropriate response.  Is that really all the Apricity read is based on?  What's the idea behind alone being scum?  He forgot he was calling RC town and decided to not do it in one post?  What end does that achieve?  The snippet on Performer is something else.  Even a few seconds of thought tells you the quote in 479 wouldn't be particularly difficult to fake as scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe choice of what to commentate on seems very disjointed and the commentary itself doesn't feel very far past surface level.", "time": "Sat May 07, 2016 4:58 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66377&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "66377"}

This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.

The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.

My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br>\n<br>\nSo, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">content</div> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">those</div> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">am</div></div> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThat was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br>\n<br>\nI have to go deal with people in RL now.

You're being frustratingly contrary here.<br>\n<br>\nAll of his talk about things sounds fabricated and overexplainy, because he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe way he unvoted Dwlee was terribad becuase of how it's not really about how he thinks Dwlee is scum or not. When he unvoted it was because he was trying to look like he was taking into account the information in a mockery of scumhunting. When Dwlee gave the reasons Asphodel unvoted because he didn't know what to do next in response to what was an largely null post<br>\n<br>\nIn 537 he is trying to shove his previous read under the rug as though it doesn't matter, as though it wasn't ok to just admit that his opinion changed, he has to completely revise what happened because it's not his fault that he made an innocent mistake. Therefore he isn't believing something, he is &#8776;taking a stance&#8776;. This is actually a pretty big thing.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the comment at the end is just like running away from the wagon and then being like \"hmm yes very opportunistic wagon indeed lynchbait\". This kind of thing just makes me more sure every time that he posts that he's still scum. But I don't say it every time because I cbf and it would sound dumb.<br>\n<br>\nHe basically just decides who to call scum and then looks for reasons to say so. Especially at the end with the h_a vote. It was not a vote on someone he was scumreading, it was a stance which he searched for justification for afterwards. He was also calling basically everyone town before that cuz he's scum. If you ask him for a read list he'll fabricate more scumreads though, he didn't know what he was doing.<br>\n<br>\nEven if you look at the way he was calling paperweight / h_a scum before, he was saying all this shit about how it's \"{strange, odd, weird} how [4 people] were townreading him\" (indirect quote), which is just scummy bullshit trying to not give a read but throw shade<br>\n<br>\nAnd there's the focus whatever I think you should understand that.<br>\n<br>\nActually no this is awful, i fucking can't do this any better than I did before.

You're being frustratingly contrary here.<br>\n<br>\nAll of his talk about things sounds fabricated and overexplainy, because he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe way he unvoted Dwlee was terribad becuase of how it's not really about how he thinks Dwlee is scum or not. When he unvoted it was because he was trying to look like he was taking into account the information in a mockery of scumhunting. When Dwlee gave the reasons Asphodel unvoted because he didn't know what to do next in response to what was an largely null post<br>\n<br>\nIn 537 he is trying to shove his previous read under the rug as though it doesn't matter, as though it wasn't ok to just admit that his opinion changed, he has to completely revise what happened because it's not his fault that he made an innocent mistake. Therefore he isn't believing something, he is &#8776;taking a stance&#8776;. This is actually a pretty big thing.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the comment at the end is just like running away from the wagon and then being like \"hmm yes very opportunistic wagon indeed lynchbait\". This kind of thing just makes me more sure every time that he posts that he's still scum. But I don't say it every time because I cbf and it would sound dumb.<br>\n<br>\nHe basically just decides who to call scum and then looks for reasons to say so. Especially at the end with the h_a vote. It was not a vote on someone he was scumreading, it was a stance which he searched for justification for afterwards. He was also calling basically everyone town before that cuz he's scum.

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br>\n<br>\nSo coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">while</div>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br>\n<br>\nSo, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">content</div> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">those</div> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">am</div></div> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThat was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br>\n<br>\nI have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening.</div></blockquote>\ndat ate tho", "time": "Wed May 18, 2016 2:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66377&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "66377"}

Here are my thoughts:<br>\n<br>\n1.  I don't like how zakk uses posts 605 &amp; 877 as a way to show that TTH isn't being consistent on her read of him.  The first one is TTH saying she \"doesn't like zakk's catchup\" and the second is her townreading zakk.  But zakk posted a billion times in between those two posts, so it's totally reasonable for TTH to have changed her mind in that span of time.<br>\n<br>\n2.  The quotes about Performer and BNL aren't an argument, they're just highlighting some of TTH's scumreads.  Useful for post-flip but not for deciding whether or not to lynch<br>\n<br>\n3.  I don't think TTH's complaints about kush voting for her are scummy.  I would if kush's reasoning for the vote wasn't \"her reads are weak\".<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I still wouldn't be opposed to lynching TTH.  I'm mostly neutral on her with a tinge of scum because I'm wary of her not having posted any opinion on me whatsoever.

For someone who was so sold on Performer being scum, I would've expected more resistance to Performer's counterwagons.

I think BNL's the scum of the bodyguard claims and there's still no way I'm planning on lynching him today.

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br>\n<br>\nSo coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">while</div>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br>\n<br>\nSo, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">content</div> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">those</div> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">am</div></div> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThat was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br>\n<br>\nI have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening.</div></blockquote>\nlol i hope you learned your lesson about this post TTH.<br>\n<br>\nnever do this shit as scum it will come back to bite you in the ass. lmfao", "time": "Tue Jun 07, 2016 5:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66377&start=1950", "forum": "53", "thread": "66377"}

They avoided killing zakk, who was extremely active and made a case against TTH on Day 1.  I feel like this was at least partially because I said I'd be guarding zakk at one point yesterday.  They also avoided killing Performer, who was Titus' suggestion for my bodyguard target last night.  They did kill Bellaphant, who was probably the most town-seeming of the 4 remaining VT claims.

Doesn't really lean me either way.  I think RC's probably right--Bellaphant was a weird nightkill.  I was rethinking my townread of her overnight given the TTH flip.  <br>\n<br>\nRegarding bodyguards:  Expedience is a better fit for TTH's partner than BNL is.  Expedience has been a pretty aggressive player this game.  Just skimming through is iso, he called Bellaphant, dwlee, me, Performer, and RC all some form of \"probably scum\" yesterday.  To be fair, there are a few other VT claims like zakk and Apricity that he's been pretty lenient on, and he can't be partners with all of them.  But he was very lenient on TTH.
