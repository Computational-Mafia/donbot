I felt kind of bad making the host account for changing my RVS two minutes after I made it so I figured I'd just leave it on Garmr until I got a response from RC.  Between 25 and 55, RC posted a few times and didn't really explain why he'd decided it was important to make post 7, and I hadn't found anything else that seemed more suspicious. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7891186#p7891186\" class=\"postlink\">post 57</a>, Apricity wrote:</cite>Also idk how that post from him seems like he's trying to \"look\" town--elaborate?</div></blockquote><br><br>2 minutes after the topic goes live, RC says \"hey I've got a way to break the game, I just can't tell you what it is yet\".  With that quick of a reaction time, he definitely thought about ways to break it before the game started.  <br><br>If RC is town, it's poor strategy to alert the scum to the fact that the game will soon be \"broken\" before actually doing it.  Why not just break the game on page 10 or whenever seems like a good time?  Or better yet, some other townie reveals the strategy and then that helps his scumhunting game.<br><br>But there's good reason to announce that the game is broken if he's scum.  This is a fairly simple setup.  Really, any way to break this game has to revolve around the weak bodyguard role.  If he's scum, he probably assumed other people had figured it out too.  Scum RC would assume the game's going to be \"broken\" somehow and that he might as well be the one who does it.<br><br>Obviously, this is all pretty contingent on how game-breaking this strategy is.  Personally, I'm skeptical of it.  It's been reviewed by like 3 people and I've thought about how to break it myself.  I'm thinking this game-breaking strategy probably only marginally helps us, if it does at all."}

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br><br>So coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">while</span>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br><br>So, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <span style=\"font-style: italic\">content</span> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">those</span> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">am</span></span> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br><br>That was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br><br>I have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening."}

Whereas for RC I think he genuinely thought his plan would work, and exhibited the same kind of firmness in pushing it like he showed in Space Invaders, where he was town (there, he also strongly advocated for a plan of 1x doc protection within the setup). Dwlee's paranoid that it's just him manipulating people, but then RC dropped it when he saw it wouldn't work instead of pushing it through anyway as it seems he did in the game Dwlee cited. That's part of why I had reservations about voting him. At the same time though, he isn't as open with his thoughts as before--hence my wanting him to post more before forming a more solid opinion.<br><br>@FT: It didn't give me a townread. It lessened my suspicion about him early on, so I think overall it balances back out to null. I left it there because no one had done anything scummy enough to make me want to move it off.<br><br>p-edit: RC is male."}

And none of the evaluations seem to go that deep either, starting with the scumread on RC.  How are you distinguishing between RC being overzealous and just wrong as town?  In that case, the response RC gave (calling people who disagreed with him scummy) is an appropriate response.  Is that really all the Apricity read is based on?  What's the idea behind alone being scum?  He forgot he was calling RC town and decided to not do it in one post?  What end does that achieve?  The snippet on Performer is something else.  Even a few seconds of thought tells you the quote in 479 wouldn't be particularly difficult to fake as scum.<br><br>The choice of what to commentate on seems very disjointed and the commentary itself doesn't feel very far past surface level."}

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br><br>So coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">while</span>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br><br>So, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <span style=\"font-style: italic\">content</span> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">those</span> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">am</span></span> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br><br>That was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br><br>I have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening.</div></blockquote><br>well this post was useless and a good way to \"post content\" without actually posting content<br><br>igmeoy"}

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br><br>So coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">while</span>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br><br>So, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <span style=\"font-style: italic\">content</span> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">those</span> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">am</span></span> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br><br>That was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br><br>I have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening.</div></blockquote><br>well this post was useless and a good way to \"post content\" without actually posting content<br><br>igmeoy</div></blockquote><br><br>This is a stupid thing to say considering I explicitly said it wasn't \"content.\"<br>I'm sick of that buzzword anyway.<br><br>I'm not impressed with your catchup, by the way."}

It'd be much easier for scum to just distance if Asph is scum or jump on the wagon if he's town given how much support it had, but he didn't do that and his defense of Asph looking beyond just the vote showed a town mindset imo.

Though I must admit that I didn't read the case thoroughly, since I wasn't scumreading the post because of it (it was the vote). It read to me as defense of a scumbuddy (though its proven Asph/nnn aren't scumbuddies now)<br>Another thing is I didn't like is the vote and unvote on HA ten minutes later.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why did you find him calling the Heur case obvtown weird when you didn't even read it thoroughly? Also, even before the bodyguard claims, that string of posts did not seem like defending a scumbuddy at all imo. Kush was a pretty well-established townread for most people by then. If he were scum (and I highly doubt he is), I don't think he would directly jeopardize that by defending someone widely scumread."}

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br><br>So coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">while</span>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br><br>So, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <span style=\"font-style: italic\">content</span> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">those</span> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">am</span></span> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br><br>That was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br><br>I have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening.</div></blockquote><br>dat ate tho"}

Here are my thoughts:<br><br>1.  I don't like how zakk uses posts 605 &amp; 877 as a way to show that TTH isn't being consistent on her read of him.  The first one is TTH saying she \"doesn't like zakk's catchup\" and the second is her townreading zakk.  But zakk posted a billion times in between those two posts, so it's totally reasonable for TTH to have changed her mind in that span of time.<br><br>2.  The quotes about Performer and BNL aren't an argument, they're just highlighting some of TTH's scumreads.  Useful for post-flip but not for deciding whether or not to lynch<br><br>3.  I don't think TTH's complaints about kush voting for her are scummy.  I would if kush's reasoning for the vote wasn't \"her reads are weak\".<br><br>That said, I still wouldn't be opposed to lynching TTH.  I'm mostly neutral on her with a tinge of scum because I'm wary of her not having posted any opinion on me whatsoever.

It helps us if Fourtrouble either accidentally guards scum or if the bodyguard we pick happens to be one of the scummier-looking town ones.<br>3.  sry<br>4.

You could call it scum protecting dwlee, but that doesn't explain why she flipped from being about to hammer Performer to supporting the dwlee lynch.

For someone who was so sold on Performer being scum, I would've expected more resistance to Performer's counterwagons.

I think BNL's the scum of the bodyguard claims and there's still no way I'm planning on lynching him today.

But his interactions with Titus (2 of the most mysterious players in this game) made me townread him. He did vote Exp in d2 , which I could agree with. But he also self voted , which looked like he was causing ruckus. People who are hot and cold like this, I have a hard time consistently townreading so I have RC at null, which is uncomfortable to me. People who are questionable in my eyes (null area), typically should not be left alive. <br><br>On top of that, RC saying he could townread Tell more than I, is super fishy - after re-ISOing her , she stated she'd lynch Dwlee or me . Her case on lynching Bullet doesn't look valid (\"come on let's lynch BNL, it'll be funny\" was her case). People can see the rest of her ISO as well. <br><br>Because of this, I've changed my read on Tell and am adding my vote on her.

He was tunneling me pretty hard when he counterclaimed me.  I feel like goon Expedience would at least be a little bit worried that he'd locked onto the traitor.

I love the concept of mafia because I read crappy Victorian mysteries all the time and I like the puzzle solving aspect, but in the last few months the games I've played have just turned out terribly.  This was in no small part because I've had a pretty bad streak of drawing scum and I absolutely hate being scum.  Posting becomes a chore and I drag my feet.  I'm no good at telling people what they want to hear because I'm already socially awkward and it's not one of my strengths.  It doesn't help that I have the charisma and likability of a dried up cat turd.  The couple times I did draw town, I become an emotional, bitter wreck and by the end of the game I ended up turning into a heinous bitch that was pissed off at everybody.<br><br>So coming into this game, I thought I would have the attitude of just trying to enjoy the game and just letting my reads develop at their own pace.  These usually don't roll around for a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">while</span>.  I am super slow because I always try to consider all the different interpretations of people's posts and their implications.  I only end up sharing about 5% of what I think just because most of it ends up being garbage.  (As a side note, this is a large part of the reason why you will see me in hydra games a lot more often than solo games.  My hydra partner deals with people and I can take my sweet ass time.)  <br><br>So, when I saw BNL say \"You're not making <span style=\"font-style: italic\">content</span> on page 2, you're scum!\" I was immensely annoyed and just immediately went into bitch mode because I thought \"It's not going to be one of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">those</span> games again, is it?\"  I'm not sharing what I'm thinking because I'm not ready yet, but I <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">am</span></span> keeping up and giving this some thought.  The old me probably would've ignored BNL and just kept grabassing until she got better reads.  But sadly the old me is dead, beaten to a bloody pulp by games of disappointment, mislynches, and angst.  Now, getting pushed for bad reasons bugs the shit out of me and drains me.  None of this is BNL's fault, but it is how it is.</div></div></div><br><br>That was largely irrelevant and probably doesn't make any sense, but I had to vent and get that off my chest now.<br><br>I have to go deal with people in RL now.  This'll be an adventure.  I'll be back this evening.</div></blockquote><br>lol i hope you learned your lesson about this post TTH.<br><br>never do this shit as scum it will come back to bite you in the ass. lmfao"}

They avoided killing zakk, who was extremely active and made a case against TTH on Day 1.  I feel like this was at least partially because I said I'd be guarding zakk at one point yesterday.  They also avoided killing Performer, who was Titus' suggestion for my bodyguard target last night.  They did kill Bellaphant, who was probably the most town-seeming of the 4 remaining VT claims.  I'll need to think on this some more.<br><br>Regarding TTH &amp; Apricity:  Apricity's been pretty overlooked pretty much the whole game so you're not going to find much disproving any pairing with her in it.  Apricity was the first person to vote TTH yesterday, but it was <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7955957#p7955957\" class=\"postlink\">something that didn't really feel like a commanding vote</a>.  Doesn't really lean me either way.  I think RC's probably right--Bellaphant was a weird nightkill.

Expedience has been a pretty aggressive player this game.  Just skimming through is iso, he called Bellaphant, dwlee, me, Performer, and RC all some form of \"probably scum\" yesterday.  To be fair, there are a few other VT claims like zakk and Apricity that he's been pretty lenient on, and he can't be partners with all of them.  But he was very lenient on TTH.

You're probably scum, but you're also probably the traitor.  And you're a bg claim, so there's a decent chance you'll prove yourself innocent if I'm wrong.  Also keeping BG claims alive allows us to better protect Titus, Performer, and Zakk.  I'm not lynching you today."}

In 988, he's giving Dwlee a weak townread and TTH a mixed review.  Then 13 posts later, he's defending TTH.  That's the fart.  He knows that if one of them flips scum, that post is going to be looked back on.  So he tries to replicate the fart noise in 1148.  Then he overdoes it in 1252 for good measure, tying himself more heavily to Dwlee than he did to TTH."}
