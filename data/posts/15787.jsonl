HAVE FUN.<br>2) I, as Your Moderator, have final say in everything. If I make a mistake, please send me a PM to discuss it. Votecount errors can be pointed out in the thread.<br>3) Anything in the thread that should draw my attention should be bolded, thus: <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod, blah blah blah.</span> <br>4) You may not talk about this game outside of this thread; exceptions are only when your Role PM allows it.<br>5) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bolded Blue</span></span></span> is my color. Do not use it, under penalty of Impersonating The Mod (which is modkillable; don't make me do it).<br>6) Posting in other colors is allowed, and in fact encouraged. I like colorful games.<br>7) Do not quote your Role PM or any other PM from Me. Likewise, do not quote from any outside communication.<br>8) Do not post in invisible text or tiny text. If I have to \"Quote\" your post to be able to read what you made small, I will Not Be Happy.<br>9) I will post votecounts no more often than once per page, or once per real-life day, whichever is less. If there's been a burst of activity, and I've not posted a votecount, feel free to send me a PM.<br>10) If you somehow have the ability to edit your post, do not. I will modkill you. Dead. Worse than Dead. Your faction will suffer. I am Evil when crossed. Be warned.<br>10a) Flavor is flavor. Parts is parts. Nothing in the flavor reflects Actual Game Mechanics. You are free to ignore the flavor (except, of course, that you'll hurt my feelings; I expect to spend a good deal of time creating flavor, and I think you should at least read it. However, it has no bearing on the game. At all.)<br>11) I will allow hydra accounts into the game; however, I must know who the heads are. PM me.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Player Activity</span></span><br><br>12) I do not (always) automagically prod players. If you would like a prod sent, ask in-thread. Prods will be sent, on request of at least two living players, after 48 hours of inactivity. Weekends (Saturday &amp; Sunday) are counted as 24 hours.<br>13) If you are prodded: You must respond in-thread within 36 hours or you will be replaced. If you require a second prod, you will only have 24 hours to respond before a replacement is searched for. If you require a third prod, you are subject to replacement.<br>14) If you are one of those annoying players that INSISTS ON USING CAPSLOCK, you have automatically lost a brownie point. No, I'm not telling you what will happen, as it completely depends on my mood and exactly how annoying you are. (There will be no modkills strictly for using capslock. But don't push it.)<br>15) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Votes</span> MUST be <span class=\"noboldsig\">bolded</span> and MUST be at the beginning of the line that they are on (flush left, if that makes it clearer).<br>16) Notwithstanding Rule #15, if I think it's a Vote, it's a Vote. Be very clear of your intentions. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadlines and actions and such</span></span><br><br>17) Days will have a three week deadline; extensions will rarely be granted, and then only in extenuating circumstances.<br>18) If activity severely lags, I may or may not institute a shorter Day deadline. You will have at least 72 hours notice should this happen.<br>19) Night deadlines will be at least 72 hours. Do not ask for a shorter (or longer) night phase.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Death and other matters</span></span><br><br>20) No-lynch requires a simple majority.<br>21) If the required number of votes is not reached by deadline, there will be NO LYNCH.<br>22) Lynching requires a true majority of votes from the living players. Every votecount will have the number alive and the number required to lynch.<br>23) Once a lynch has been reached and it is Twilight, everyone may talk until I post the death scene and lock the thread.<br>24) If you are night-killed, you are allowed one \"Bah!\"-type post. No game-relevant content allowed.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous</span></span><br><br>25) I reserve the right to modify these rules if necessary. Any rule changes during the course of the game will be clearly announced in the thread.<br>26) Do not tempt The Mod. Do not annoy The Mod. Do not get The Mod wet, nor feed The Mod after midnight.<br>27) Do not admit to not having read The Rules. I get very, very upset about this. The rules are here for a reason. Read them, follow them, know them.<br>28) Remember to have fun. After all, that's why we're here, isn't it?"}

The problem was that I wasn't sure one of the people who had already posted in the game were scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>s I said if you insist on this discussion explain why rather than just asserting your belief on us.</div></blockquote> I explained it to the best of my abilities. There is no right answer. There's only a preference.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>so you agree with me on the meta but it is invalid because???</div></blockquote> No, I agreed that you were using Meta. It is invalid because clearing someone of being town by meta is horrible. This person looks scummy. I'm not going to argue on previous experiences that this is why this person is scummy, I'm going to argue why this person is scummy at the present moment.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>Guys read this and then tell me why we are not wagonning this guy, it is awful. You cannot give two scum reads, however small, then vote randomly. And proffes utter bemusement at being called out on it.</div></blockquote>First off, you butchered my name, but I don't really care about that. Just caught my attention.<br><br>Second off, that is your opinion. I did give two scum reads, being small, and did vote randomly. Do I think it was a townie move? Not necessarily. Do I think it was a move that started discussion? In some ways, yes. Do I think it was a scummy move? No, not in the least. Null? Most probably.<br><br>The only reasoning that you have that it's scummy, is because I voted someone not in my post. Psst. It's still Page 1 there.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Boberz wrote:</cite>Lets be clear you didnt we all know that, whether it is scummy or not is a matter of opinion.</div></blockquote> But in fact Boberz, I do.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Boberz wrote:</cite>Also miyaki stop trying to goad everyone into theory discussion, re pressure, RVS, FOS and no doubt others. It is really anti town.</div></blockquote> Au contraire. You're the one who disputed my random vote to be scummy. While I will take the blame for Pressure, there is absolutely nothing about FoS in this thread that I have said. This is a horrible accusation.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AntB wrote:</cite>... wow...</div></blockquote>I find no reason why you needed to comment on this. If you honestly can't see the sarcasm in this, I feel sorry for you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AntB wrote:</cite>More foul language and not much else.</div></blockquote> Foul Language isn't a scum tell. Anger isn't a huge one either.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AntB wrote:</cite>I lold again. Either he cba to read because he knows who scum are or is genuinely a bad player making him a greater liability.</div></blockquote>I'll agree to this. However, I'll only agree to this.<br><br>Here's the problems that I find to AntB's case.<br><br>First off, and this is the minor part, AntB seems to say everything that everyone else has seem to said in a neat way, and in one post. While this is small because Moose is scummy, and he makes one new(small) point, I'd still like to include it.<br><br>Second off, AntB's scum tells. Anger isn't a scumtell, first off. Second off, I don't believe in pressure working well with other players than new players, so I could see him being legitimately frustrated or such. Third off, the constant repetition of noting foul language. While this is a small tell on both sides of our argument, there are loads of people that use swear words constantly, and act like they were normal. <br><br>Third, the posts that AntB ignores. For starters, he ignores the basis of the lynch, Post #1. While this was made conscious or not, this is a bit worrying to me.<br><br>Post #7. This should be a huge part of everyone's case that's on the Moose lynch. However, AntB wants to ignore it. I mean, this is the basis why I find him scummy. Then again, I don't make the rules about why a person is scummy, however, I know that AntB's tells are worthless.<br><br>Post #10. Moose here says that he isn't sure if anyone is scum. AntB doesn't seem to care about this.<br><br>...<br><br>Yuck.<br><br>Post#11. While AntB didn't miss this post in terms of posting, he did miss the complete and utter point about it. Moose makes a valid, but small point. Bob did have his post on me, while wanting to apply pressure to Moose. It doesn't really work that well.<br><br>Post #13. Like Post #11, AntB didn't miss this post, but found it scummy in his report. This isn't scummy. This is just borderline trolling and/or making a joke. Personally, it made me laugh for a moment, I doubt that was Bob's reaction though.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ant_to_the_max wrote:</cite>I think this is very important to note.

I tried reading the game with both with him in Iso and with everyone viewable and the post numbers weren't lining up.  Just trying to follow your argument.<br><br>@ Lateralus, I don't generally share anything other than my scum reads anymore, for a variety of reasons.  If I had to summarize my standpoints at this point in a few sentences, I want Moos dead and I'm currently watching a few other players.  Lord Chronos is striking me as scummy as well, at this point.  He's posted 4 times and if anyone Iso's those 4 posts it looks dangerously like active lurking.  I have one player who I fully believe is town, and another one that I believe is beginning to be called on scummy traits, but I'll keep those to myself for now.  Mariyta is temporarly absconded from this wrath because I believe he/she has just fallen inactive... i.e. there aren't a few scattered posts here and there making it seem like Mariyta is attempting to avoid a prod.  Also, I find myself agreeing with your sentiment on Beefster, given his posts thus far.<br><br>@ LordChronos, given the above statement, I'd like to see more reads and posts out of you.  Don't do town reads, for the reasons boberz' pointed out with the \"shopping list\".  Just your top 2-3 scum reads and concrete reasons other than \"I agree\" would be nice.

In terms of what turned me, I wasn't 100% sure with that first /confirm post.  He's assumed an extremely poor position since then and it's time to get some rope.<br><br>@ Hiraki, I lol'd at the Death Note reference.  I think this is made even funnier by the fact that we both have 22 at the end of our names, thus making my usual method of scanning for posts aimed at me rather confusing."}

I have.)<br><br>For the record, I am neither convinced Hiraki's answers regarding the random vote he made after giving suspicions are suitable, nor do I believe he believes them either.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>Considering there was no question, and it was a bland statement on my play, that is quite the misrepresentation...</div></blockquote><br>Mistake rather than misrep. However you did rather avoid the point. You failed to adequately respond to my attack.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>But that's not the point.</div></blockquote><br>But it is and was from the very moment several picked up on it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>It is invalid because clearing someone of being town by meta is horrible.</div></blockquote><br>I did no such thing.

Hiraki made more than one reference to FOSs in iso post 4.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>You're the one who disputed my random vote to be scummy.</div></blockquote><br>Exactly, that is not theory. Going into when RVS should end in a broad way as you did is not game relevant.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hirakir wrote:</cite>It doesn't really work that well.</div></blockquote><br>The thread has proved that to be absolute crap. It is evident that both of you have felt pressured, admittedly you dealt with it infinitely better than moose.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>I doubt that was Bob's reaction though.</div></blockquote><br>I found it hilarious. You cant afford to get annoyed with people so if you feel they are losing control, acting off emotion or trolling then you know you are winning the argument.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>Moose would need to call it a mislynch if he knew he was town, no?</div></blockquote><br>Not really he could call it a lynch without adding mislynch to it. Considering how loose moose has been with claiming scum elsewhere I see little reason why he should feel the need to be allignment specific here. It just felt awkward I think.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>lateralus wrote:</cite>Post #22 (Hiraki): What??? If you believe in that why would you vote for some random person instead?

I felt the moose wagon was getting credit (rigthly so) only later did I join it myself.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>later wrote:</cite>Who does {LordChronos; Mariyta; LordChronos; Dekes} think is scum and why.

What's wrong with discussing Moose200x's behaviour?</div></blockquote><br>Nothing wrong, but it is becomming the sole focus. we need more than one line of enquiry at a time. This will allow us to involve more people and havea  more broad undertanding of people's positions on a variety of people. I am more talking to people not actively pushing moose atm.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mr Wright wrote:</cite>Boberz, can you explain why we would need a 'distraction'?

I saw no town motivation and it felt out of place and wrong.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Lord Chronos wrote:</cite>for his response to boberz answer to Beefster's vote.</div></blockquote><br>What was scummy about it, I dont like people who adopt popular views without justifying them.

But this is a fallacy; the whole point of meta is that it helps you find what they do unconciously. A player breaking meta is affecting all his other games both now and in future, they are unlikely to do this for the sake of confusing you on one issue in one game. How many times have you done something in one game purely to shape your meta, not many is my bet.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>beefster wrote:</cite>I'm working on getting focus.

I asked you for something to add, not a sob story about some bastard mod.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>moose wrote:</cite>So substrike- Just to clarify right now.

Are you that selfobsessed.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiraki wrote:</cite>First off, I explained it quite clearly in the post. Call it it an FoS if you want. I was not ready to vote either of the two suspects, therefore, I voted randomly.</div></blockquote><br>We hear you, we just think it is scummy and bollocks. Because it implies random votes are better than reasoned votes. It implies random wagons have more value than real wagons. It implies you are scared to be held to account for your views. We understand your point we just think it is bollocks.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hiraki wrote:</cite>First off, I explained it quite clearly in the post. Call it it an FoS if you want.

Unless he picks up the pace from now on he should either get vigged if there is a vig in the setup or be dealt with later. There are scummier people to deal with right now.<br>- I agree with Mariyta about the wall o' texts. I'm not entirely against them but if game theory and silly misunderstandings are getting blown out of proportion in them (I'm looking at you, boberz and Hikari) it's getting to the point where they are cluttering the thread and aren't any helpful at all.<br>- I actually agree again with Mari in that I think Lord is scum: Riding the popular opinions and wagons, staying under the radar, posing some alibi questions that aren't investigated further.<br><br>Mari, if you think both Beefster and LC are scum, why did you choose to vote the empty wagon over the Beefster wagon? Seems like a wasted vote.<br><br>- Not a fan of [http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2668779#p2668779=url]these kind of things where someone announces pressure on somebody else. I think Substrike did something similar early on. If you announce the pressure how will you create pressure? The votes just seem so much less threatening afterwards.<br><br>- Substrike's post on me was really awful as Lateralus has pointed out. What kind of information were you hoping to get from an absent person? If I hadn't posted for another 24 hours I would've been replaced. But instead of pressing active persons you suspect (which you arguably have looking at your posts) you go after me.<br><br>The fact that Sub avoided the Beef wagon on which LC hopped on gives me a rather good feeling about Beef. IIRC the case on him was mainly based on a whacky, empty accusation of him against boberz and it developed from there...if there's more to it, please I'd like, to hear it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Substrike</span>"}

Being able to just claim PR makes it too easy for scum. <br><br>So if he is town we won't lose anything from a full claim, and if he is scum his claim will be much easier to check, so I think that now that a soft claim has been made there is good reason for a full one. <br><br>You've changed your mind very quickly as well: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beefster wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>moose200x wrote:</cite>Just let me do my thing for one night and if I am alive you lynch me fast.

What do <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> think?</div></blockquote><br><br>Fair enough. It comes off to me much more as always playing that way both judging from a quick glance at his previous games and the general read I get of his motivations this game, so more as anti-town than scummy. Now using previous bad play to justify current bad play creates a general site meta of encouraging bad play, so I don't think it's good to use this to clear him, and if boberz and anyone else in favor of a Hiraki lynch can provide a stronger case (mainly who do you think his scum partners are?) then I would be paying much more attention. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>beefster wrote:</cite>Are there any other accusations you'd like to bring to the table?</div></blockquote><br><br>While reading the thread it seemed like there was some time of connection between you and Mariyta, I would see this as a possible scum team. <br><br>I found Mariyta's vote on boberz fairly odd. Same post she seems to want to put a vote on moose but doesn't because that would put him at l-2 (it would actually put him at l-3, but that is neither here nor there); I don't think a quick lynch was a reasonable threat here, and if you really thought he was the scummiest why wouldn't you want to vote him? Later in the game you would write: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mariyta wrote:</cite>Why should I vote the person I feel is the lesser scum just because he has the wagon?</div></blockquote><br><br>Why should you vote for someone you consider the lesser scum just because they don't have a wagon? Trying to get votes on somebody else would only distract from moose.  The overreacting charge seems a very weak reason for voting for boberz here. <br><br>So I found this vote odd straight away, and it really set alarm bells off when beefster, with his first actual game post, voted for boberz with almost the exact same reason (switching from overreacting to Hiraki to overdefensive to Hiraki). Of course it seems odd that scum would play together like this, but there doesn't seem to be any intention from beefsters of creating a connection between him and Mariyta shown in the post, just a mutual attempt to start a boberz bandwagon for fairly weak (and similar) reasons. <br><br>Mariyta's later posts show some signs of too strong attempt to separate herself from beefster: <br><br>-Her post fourth post is fairly odd: boberz has made both one of the scummiest comments and isn't very scummy, and the attacks on boberz by beefster are ridiculous despite her being the source of the attacks main argument (overreaction/defense) and maintaining that the overreaction is one of the scummiest things so far. She then claims beefster as her second scum pick despite not really providing a case against him, although she doesn't place a vote on him (2nd scum pick seems a pretty easy way to bus without much consequence). The case against LC is also pretty weak, seeing as a large number of players had been fairly inactive at that time and she doesn't provide much to differentiate him from them. The lack of posts is perhaps suspicious, but to have that alone as your reasoning for top scum pick? <br><br>-Her vote on beefster has been provided with little reason; yes he was her second scum pick, but could we get some of the reasons why? The ones given don't seem very strong. It only places him as l-4, so I could see it as bussing; I could also see it as an unfortunate (for her) combination of her previous placing of beefster as a second scum pick for bussing purposes and the common procedure of cleaning the slate a little for replacements. <br><br>@beefster: mind outlining the case against me?"}

But instead of voting him after the next votecount, you pick on brokenscraps who had just made more or less a case on you.

His D2 effort is almost non-existant. He avoids every other topic but his continued moose-tunneling from yesterday.

I can't see the town thought process behind this, there's no actual explanation that switches towards \"only trying to lynch people\" and feels like a hollow statement. I don't see how Beefster was just a bad player, I can't recall this but have you actually said this on Day 1 or is this some great revelation you're having now?<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2712912#p2712912\" class=\"postlink\">#583</a> (AntB): Fluff post actually.

I don't understand if you're saying bobber + Mari scum because when scum buddy it's towards townies, not their actual partners.

He was the one who brought up the Hiraki case early on when no one was jumping onto him. I can't see the town thought process behind this, there's no actual explanation that switches towards \"only trying to lynch people\" and feels like a hollow statement. I don't see how Beefster was just a bad player, I can't recall this but have you actually said this on Day 1 or is this some great revelation you're having now?<br><br>#583 (AntB): Fluff post actually. There's a lot of text to support his observation which is normally good but it's useless in this context because boberz already admitted to his claim before. I don't understand if you're saying bobber + Mari scum because when scum buddy it's towards townies, not their actual partners.

So vote more, if you have any suspects, please.<br><br>Well, with AntB flipping scum that would most likely clear Lateralus. I don't see scum AntB coming out of the gate D3 attacking somebody he had as town/no opinion before after scum got lynched last day. Lat's appearance after getting attacked was so ridiculously fast it can't be more than coincidence.<br><br>I'm more interested in the fact that AntB completely dropped boberz after having him as a main suspect yesterday. Part of Ant's case on Lat is a lack of activity but he ignored the fact that boberz hadn't posted at all at that point. Ant even considers attacking ATTM (while not wanting to call him scum o_O) over boberz today. Doesn't make any sense until you take Sub's lynch into account.<br><br>Part of why I don't believe in a Lat/AntB and maybe even in Antb/boberz team is that I don't think AntB is capable of or willing to bus. Confirmed by his non-commital interactions with Sub yesterday. He agreed completly on my case against Substrike (#672), yet didn't vote him. What!? <br>And after Sub's claim, instead of questioning a setup with a tracker, a watcher, a claimed doc and a claimed JOAT, he asked Sub about his lack of activity on D2. Translation: \"You can still save you hide with that claim buddy, just come up with a proper excuse for your inactivity!\". Btw, the same lack of activity that made AntB hesitate yesterday to hammer/threaten Sub is now used against Lat as a main point in Ant's case against him. Double standards anyone?(#679)<br><br>The difference to boberz regarding bussing is that boberz started to attack AntB and Ant only played (had to play?) the passive part in this scenario. But he always tried to tie Mari in there making up a scum team that he wanted to go down together whenever boberz should flip. Too bad, Mari got cleared by moose so he had to go another route and is aiming now for two of the three remaining unconfirmed townies (in this case with boberz\u00b4as his partner). After being confident in calling me town yesterday...besides Substrike (lol, for what exactly?)(#567)<br><br>So, that leaves us with ATTM. There's not much going on there. He generally seems to fly under the radar, but he was very early on the Substrike wagon. The only thing I have now (without having gone through his ISO, since this post is too long already) is AntB's yet another non-commital stance (\"I will attack him later, but refrain from calling him scum now.\").<br><br><br>Boberz, can I get a towniest to scummiest list of the remaining players from you?<br><br>ATTM. You said, yesterday, if Sub were to flip scum, boberz would most likely be his partner.

This is especially awkward considering how adamant you were on boberz being scum yesterday. You might wanna clear this up by explaining why you don't believe scum boberz would've hammered without any discussion in that scenario.<br><br>Also, a lot of your words doesn't match up with your actions. <br>- Your say you're toying with self-hammering, yet you don't want the day to end this early because not enough reads and cases have been build.<br>- You call me repeatedly scum without a case behind it. Only thing I could find is in your notes that I was too determined to lynch Substrike which is simply ridiculous. You were close to getting lynched yesterday. All WIFOM aside, why wouldn't I lynch you and go into LyLo today without having to bus anyone? Doesn't make any sense at all.<br>- You first say you want to attack ATTM to get a better read on him, yet in your next post you say you're leaning scum on him without any reasoning behind it. What's worse is that you never followed up on those attacks on ATTM that you promised (unless asking him where he works and calling him lead-head helps you getting a read on him, lol <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\">).<br><br>So, in conclusion, while you say people should use the remaining time of the day to get reads and build cases, all you do is baseless accusing, all the while never leaving out an opportunity to say that you're town. It should be YOU, who most likely is not seeing the end of the day alive, who should be giving out as much info and reads with reasoning and evidence if you're really town.<br>Only telling people what should be done now is just you appearing to be active and pro-town while we are second guessing ourselves. But you are not wriggling yourself out of your lynch today.<br><br><br>@moose<br>Don't act like I didn't see you earlier in this topic.<br>You are confirmed town but that doesn't mean you can't help us win this thing.

Substrike's vote wasn't particularly useful as he tunneled moose hardcore. Ant_Max was on AntB for a good part of the first day before switching to the main wagon of the day. AntB followed Substrike to the moose wagon and stuck there most of D1, aside from a brief unvote before putting his vote right back, then jumping on the Beefster wagon at the tail end of the day.<br><br>D2, Substrike tunnels again and AntB goes after boberz. Max waits six days to vote, then jumps on Substrike, where he remained for the rest of the day. (I'm tempted to rule out Max as scum for this, but I'm not doing so just yet.) AntB avoided the wagon entirely and boberz jumped on right at the end, just like he did with Beefster. <br><br>D3, AntB starts out voting me, avoiding his main target from yesterday, while boberz hops on him. <br><br>The problem with all this is that I'm assuming AntB is scum. I need to analyze the rest of it, but I need to go to bed right now. Hopefully I'll get time tomorrow. <br><br>P-edit: One quick note- Lat was on Substrike a lot D1, so I'm tempted to rule him out as scum, too. I'm leaning toward boberz at this moment. <br><br>@Lat, moose, Max, boberz: Please take the time in the next few days to analyze everyone and give your thoughts (unless you're scum, of course.

And to everyone else, this is what I tried to point out in my previous post on Bob. <br>Although the thing that has been bothering me the most is, Moose claimed on D1 that he was going to shoot either Bob or Sub.

Maybe it would have been to obvious, but this is just WIFOM stuff here. <br><br>Only other person I would consider lynching today is Lat. Way I see it is AntB/Bob/Lat is a 2/3 chance to nail scum.

Any refusal of sharing your reads and opinions is scummy. Period.<br><br>The last sentence is bogus. If AntB self-hammers, we'll know his alignment soon enough and that doesn't prove his scumminess or non-scumminess in the slightest. The only reason for keeping the day alive was to keep gathering information and the fact that you left the risk of self-hammering alive by not unvoting is that you were just pretending to be interested in keeping the day alive. Scummy.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mariyta wrote:</cite>Dekes, in #562, you call AntB town. What changed your mind?</div></blockquote><br>In fact, I called him town on several occasions. Because that's what my read was until D3. I knew this was his first Normal Game so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He took a lot of independent stances and he wasn't afraid of attacking rather baselessly, usually typical newbie town tells.<br>But his interactions during and prior to the Substrike hammer, his 180s of his reads on D3 and his \"woe is me, I'm townie\" spiel while being in lynch vicinity is just too fucking obvious to overlook.<br><br>If you want me to choose between AntB and boberz? There's something incredibely akward in how boberz is approaching this imminent AntB lynch (\"might be too easy, yet I'm keeping my vote on him\"). And the discrepancy between how he handled the Substrike wagon yesterday and the AntB wagon today gives me the feeling there's informed minority at work here. Which would point a lot to boberz scum and maybe even AntB town (fuck you, AntB, for already second guessing myself). Yet I still have the stronger belief in \"if AntB is scum, then boberz is scum\" than \"if boberz is scum, then AntB is scum\". So I'm still up for an AntB lynch unless everybody else is up for a boberz lynch first.<br><br>On a sidenote, Mari, I still think you're suffering from the same fate that Fate (oh no, he didn't) did in Biggest Game. You've only completed a game with me where I was scum. And because I played decent there and fooled some of you there for a while, you seem to feel like you don't want to rule me out because you don't want to get fooled again instead of just looking without any bias at what I've done so far like getting Substrike lynched when there was absolutely no need to if I was scum. And btw, you give Lat credit for riding Substrike hard on D1 while there was little to no chance of Substrike getting lynched with the moose/Beefster/werewolf-wagons going on when he was barely on him on D2. That doesn't add up, sweetie.<br><br>/offtopic<br>a) I'm already looking forward to X-Files mafia and if you're not in it, you should totally join<br>b) If anyone is interested in being my back-up mod for my Mini Normal Game (in return I'd offer being back-up mod as well, of course), shoot me a pm."}

MyLo makes it ten times harder to aim for a scum quicklynch than LyLo.<br><br>- Now after AntB's lynch (btw, remind me to tell him postgame to stick to newbie games for a while...he was so scummy his lynch was inevitable) it's possible boberz and ATTM (depending on who AH's partner is), fearing they probably would get blocked, left the kill to AH.<br><br>- If I read one of xtoxm post right, he hinted at blocking AH yesterday already.<br><br>@AH<br>You said you got mislynched due to a scum no kill before.

My AH/Lat town read went out of the window as soon as AntB flipped anyway. A lot of it based on the assumption AntB was scum and attacked Lat for no reason at the start of yesterday. If you take that away then the Lat slot wasn't all too different from Substrike's: Coming out to defend himself while continuously pushing for mislynches.

Boberz gave us two (count them, 2) hammers, then rode AntB two days in a row, only switching to the Substrike wagon to hammer. Dekes is ballsy enough to both bus his buddy and to no-kill.

You came into a slot where I had a slight town read on, but then managed to turn that around. After you have jumped into the game and read through most/if not all the discussion we have had so far you were still jumpy about being lynched even though there was little to no fire on your slot.<br><br>Coming into Day 2, there was small questionable actions on your part talking about the night actions. From there it seems like you have taken control of the game (not necessarily a bad thing in general...more later) But also notably I thought you might be trying to distance yourself from Cay, a possible scum mate. Now, he had to go off so the interaction between you two could not have continued as I would have liked. I am saying that your vote on him and argument might have been staged to create that little tiff between you two.<br><br>BUT, another interesting thing I noticed...Nic might also be another scum buddy of yours. Maybe you told him to do a \"follow my lead\" kinda thing while you put on a show to hurry another wagon on a townie. From what happened in the later half of all your posts now I have no clue on what to make of it, but I do know that I don't feel like trusting you on your crazy little plan like Nic is.<br><br>I know I don't have specific posts highlighted for my argument in this post, but if there is anything you want me to clarify or point out which posts made me feel this way just ask. I just wanted to through my thoughts out there right now and see what you think. <br><br>So to sum it up, Robo is the leader, Nic and Cay are plausible mates.</div></blockquote></div></div></div>"}
