HAVE FUN.<br>\n2) I, as Your Moderator, have final say in everything. If I make a mistake, please send me a PM to discuss it. Votecount errors can be pointed out in the thread.<br>\n3) Anything in the thread that should draw my attention should be bolded, thus: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod, blah blah blah.</div> <br>\n4) You may not talk about this game outside of this thread; exceptions are only when your Role PM allows it.<br>\n5) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">Bolded Blue</div></div> is my color. Do not use it, under penalty of Impersonating The Mod (which is modkillable; don't make me do it).<br>\n6) Posting in other colors is allowed, and in fact encouraged. I like colorful games.<br>\n7) Do not quote your Role PM or any other PM from Me. Likewise, do not quote from any outside communication.<br>\n8) Do not post in invisible text or tiny text. If I have to \"Quote\" your post to be able to read what you made small, I will Not Be Happy.<br>\n9) I will post votecounts no more often than once per page, or once per real-life day, whichever is less. If there's been a burst of activity, and I've not posted a votecount, feel free to send me a PM.<br>\n10) If you somehow have the ability to edit your post, do not. I will modkill you. Dead. Worse than Dead. Your faction will suffer. I am Evil when crossed. Be warned.<br>\n10a) Flavor is flavor. Parts is parts. Nothing in the flavor reflects Actual Game Mechanics. You are free to ignore the flavor (except, of course, that you'll hurt my feelings; I expect to spend a good deal of time creating flavor, and I think you should at least read it. However, it has no bearing on the game. At all.)<br>\n11) I will allow hydra accounts into the game; however, I must know who the heads are. PM me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player Activity</div></div><br>\n<br>\n12) I do not (always) automagically prod players. If you would like a prod sent, ask in-thread. Prods will be sent, on request of at least two living players, after 48 hours of inactivity. Weekends (Saturday &amp; Sunday) are counted as 24 hours.<br>\n13) If you are prodded: You must respond in-thread within 36 hours or you will be replaced. If you require a second prod, you will only have 24 hours to respond before a replacement is searched for. If you require a third prod, you are subject to replacement.<br>\n14) If you are one of those annoying players that INSISTS ON USING CAPSLOCK, you have automatically lost a brownie point. No, I'm not telling you what will happen, as it completely depends on my mood and exactly how annoying you are. (There will be no modkills strictly for using capslock. But don't push it.)<br>\n15) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Votes</div> MUST be <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bolded</div> and MUST be at the beginning of the line that they are on (flush left, if that makes it clearer).<br>\n16) Notwithstanding Rule #15, if I think it's a Vote, it's a Vote. Be very clear of your intentions. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Deadlines and actions and such</div></div><br>\n<br>\n17) Days will have a three week deadline; extensions will rarely be granted, and then only in extenuating circumstances.<br>\n18) If activity severely lags, I may or may not institute a shorter Day deadline. You will have at least 72 hours notice should this happen.<br>\n19) Night deadlines will be at least 72 hours. Do not ask for a shorter (or longer) night phase.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Death and other matters</div></div><br>\n<br>\n20) No-lynch requires a simple majority.<br>\n21) If the required number of votes is not reached by deadline, there will be NO LYNCH.<br>\n22) Lynching requires a true majority of votes from the living players. Every votecount will have the number alive and the number required to lynch.<br>\n23) Once a lynch has been reached and it is Twilight, everyone may talk until I post the death scene and lock the thread.<br>\n24) If you are night-killed, you are allowed one \"Bah!\"-type post. No game-relevant content allowed.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous</div></div><br>\n<br>\n25) I reserve the right to modify these rules if necessary. Any rule changes during the course of the game will be clearly announced in the thread.<br>\n26) Do not tempt The Mod. Do not annoy The Mod. Do not get The Mod wet, nor feed The Mod after midnight.<br>\n27) Do not admit to not having read The Rules. I get very, very upset about this. The rules are here for a reason. Read them, follow them, know them.<br>\n28) Remember to have fun. After all, that's why we're here, isn't it?", "time": "Mon Dec 06, 2010 4:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15787&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "15787"}

Therefore, if we prolong the RVS, which in your post(to me at least) seems like I'm making a mediocre RVS go to a huge RVS, but I digress.<br>\n<br>\nRVS can tell a lot. People, who dislike RVS to the point of murder, are people I don't like. RVS can be sex some games, and it could be the old point of tomfoolery the next. Whatever the case, itsa good.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>\"really\" yes really, so now answer properly.</div></blockquote>Considering there was no question, and it was a bland statement on my play, that is quite the misrepresentation...<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\n(b\")b<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>because you had two slight scum reads at the time, and the game was kicking into gear.</div></blockquote> But that's not the point. If it was a random vote, you shouldn't care about it. It can't be scummy because you know it was a random vote, and you knew that I had suspicions already. The problem was that I wasn't sure one of the people who had already posted in the game were scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>s I said if you insist on this discussion explain why rather than just asserting your belief on us.</div></blockquote> I explained it to the best of my abilities. There is no right answer. There's only a preference.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>so you agree with me on the meta but it is invalid because???</div></blockquote> No, I agreed that you were using Meta. It is invalid because clearing someone of being town by meta is horrible. This person looks scummy. I'm not going to argue on previous experiences that this is why this person is scummy, I'm going to argue why this person is scummy at the present moment.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>Guys read this and then tell me why we are not wagonning this guy, it is awful. You cannot give two scum reads, however small, then vote randomly. And proffes utter bemusement at being called out on it.</div></blockquote>First off, you butchered my name, but I don't really care about that. Just caught my attention.<br>\n<br>\nSecond off, that is your opinion. I did give two scum reads, being small, and did vote randomly. Do I think it was a townie move? Not necessarily. Do I think it was a move that started discussion? In some ways, yes. Do I think it was a scummy move? No, not in the least. Null? Most probably.<br>\n<br>\nThe only reasoning that you have that it's scummy, is because I voted someone not in my post. Psst. It's still Page 1 there.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Boberz wrote:</cite>Lets be clear you didnt we all know that, whether it is scummy or not is a matter of opinion.</div></blockquote> But in fact Boberz, I do.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Boberz wrote:</cite>Also miyaki stop trying to goad everyone into theory discussion, re pressure, RVS, FOS and no doubt others. It is really anti town.</div></blockquote> Au contraire. You're the one who disputed my random vote to be scummy. While I will take the blame for Pressure, there is absolutely nothing about FoS in this thread that I have said. This is a horrible accusation.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AntB wrote:</cite>... wow...</div></blockquote>I find no reason why you needed to comment on this. If you honestly can't see the sarcasm in this, I feel sorry for you.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AntB wrote:</cite>More foul language and not much else.</div></blockquote> Foul Language isn't a scum tell. Anger isn't a huge one either.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AntB wrote:</cite>I lold again. Either he cba to read because he knows who scum are or is genuinely a bad player making him a greater liability.</div></blockquote>I'll agree to this. However, I'll only agree to this.<br>\n<br>\nHere's the problems that I find to AntB's case.<br>\n<br>\nFirst off, and this is the minor part, AntB seems to say everything that everyone else has seem to said in a neat way, and in one post. While this is small because Moose is scummy, and he makes one new(small) point, I'd still like to include it.<br>\n<br>\nSecond off, AntB's scum tells. Anger isn't a scumtell, first off. Second off, I don't believe in pressure working well with other players than new players, so I could see him being legitimately frustrated or such. Third off, the constant repetition of noting foul language. While this is a small tell on both sides of our argument, there are loads of people that use swear words constantly, and act like they were normal. <br>\n<br>\nThird, the posts that AntB ignores. For starters, he ignores the basis of the lynch, Post #1. While this was made conscious or not, this is a bit worrying to me.<br>\n<br>\nPost #7. This should be a huge part of everyone's case that's on the Moose lynch. However, AntB wants to ignore it. I mean, this is the basis why I find him scummy. Then again, I don't make the rules about why a person is scummy, however, I know that AntB's tells are worthless.<br>\n<br>\nPost #10. Moose here says that he isn't sure if anyone is scum. AntB doesn't seem to care about this.<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nYuck.<br>\n<br>\nPost#11. While AntB didn't miss this post in terms of posting, he did miss the complete and utter point about it. Moose makes a valid, but small point. Bob did have his post on me, while wanting to apply pressure to Moose. It doesn't really work that well.<br>\n<br>\nPost #13. Like Post #11, AntB didn't miss this post, but found it scummy in his report. This isn't scummy. This is just borderline trolling and/or making a joke. Personally, it made me laugh for a moment, I doubt that was Bob's reaction though.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ant_to_the_max wrote:</cite>I think this is very important to note.

What's wrong with discussing Moose200x's behaviour? I agree his play is terrible, but we're getting a lot of nice responses from the other players about it. Like your own post 78. Why do you suddenly make a 180 turn? Do you consider sarcastic claims a scumtell?<br>\n<br>\nBut I do think we shouldn't stick to the Moose200x case for too long. It's obvious he isn't going to contribute anything useful to this game. I suggest we let everyone have their say about Moose200x and then just ignore him. Hopefully he will be replaced or ask for a replacement eventually.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@ AntB<br>\nAntB, why are you wasting time on an ISO analysis of Moose200x?

I am and was hoping this would cause Moos to actually post something decent.

People can manipulate their playstyles knowing their meta will be looked at.  He said he was scum.  He needs to die.  If they're going to come out and claim scum, that's extremely anti-town and unhelpful in any way.  Moos needs rope.<br>\n<br>\n@ Hiraki, in post 89, when you're citing AntB's stuff at the bottom, how did you generate those post numbers?  I tried reading the game with both with him in Iso and with everyone viewable and the post numbers weren't lining up.  Just trying to follow your argument.<br>\n<br>\n@ Lateralus, I don't generally share anything other than my scum reads anymore, for a variety of reasons.  If I had to summarize my standpoints at this point in a few sentences, I want Moos dead and I'm currently watching a few other players.  Lord Chronos is striking me as scummy as well, at this point.  He's posted 4 times and if anyone Iso's those 4 posts it looks dangerously like active lurking.  I have one player who I fully believe is town, and another one that I believe is beginning to be called on scummy traits, but I'll keep those to myself for now.  Mariyta is temporarly absconded from this wrath because I believe he/she has just fallen inactive... i.e. there aren't a few scattered posts here and there making it seem like Mariyta is attempting to avoid a prod.  Also, I find myself agreeing with your sentiment on Beefster, given his posts thus far.<br>\n<br>\n@ LordChronos, given the above statement, I'd like to see more reads and posts out of you.  Don't do town reads, for the reasons boberz' pointed out with the \"shopping list\".  Just your top 2-3 scum reads and concrete reasons other than \"I agree\" would be nice.

Unless he picks up the pace from now on he should either get vigged if there is a vig in the setup or be dealt with later. There are scummier people to deal with right now.<br>\n- I agree with Mariyta about the wall o' texts. I'm not entirely against them but if game theory and silly misunderstandings are getting blown out of proportion in them (I'm looking at you, boberz and Hikari) it's getting to the point where they are cluttering the thread and aren't any helpful at all.<br>\n- I actually agree again with Mari in that I think Lord is scum: Riding the popular opinions and wagons, staying under the radar, posing some alibi questions that aren't investigated further.<br>\n<br>\nMari, if you think both Beefster and LC are scum, why did you choose to vote the empty wagon over the Beefster wagon?

But instead of pressing active persons you suspect (which you arguably have looking at your posts) you go after me.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that Sub avoided the Beef wagon on which LC hopped on gives me a rather good feeling about Beef.

Whatever opinions suits the lynch you're looking for, eh?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beefster wrote:</cite>This looks like an excuse to fencesit for a while. What do <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> think?</div></blockquote>\n\nFair enough. It comes off to me much more as always playing that way both judging from a quick glance at his previous games and the general read I get of his motivations this game, so more as anti-town than scummy. Now using previous bad play to justify current bad play creates a general site meta of encouraging bad play, so I don't think it's good to use this to clear him, and if boberz and anyone else in favor of a Hiraki lynch can provide a stronger case (mainly who do you think his scum partners are?) then I would be paying much more attention. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>beefster wrote:</cite>Are there any other accusations you'd like to bring to the table?</div></blockquote>\n\nWhile reading the thread it seemed like there was some time of connection between you and Mariyta, I would see this as a possible scum team. <br>\n<br>\nI found Mariyta's vote on boberz fairly odd. Same post she seems to want to put a vote on moose but doesn't because that would put him at l-2 (it would actually put him at l-3, but that is neither here nor there); I don't think a quick lynch was a reasonable threat here, and if you really thought he was the scummiest why wouldn't you want to vote him? Later in the game you would write: <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mariyta wrote:</cite>Why should I vote the person I feel is the lesser scum just because he has the wagon?</div></blockquote>\n\nWhy should you vote for someone you consider the lesser scum just because they don't have a wagon? Trying to get votes on somebody else would only distract from moose.  The overreacting charge seems a very weak reason for voting for boberz here. <br>\n<br>\nSo I found this vote odd straight away, and it really set alarm bells off when beefster, with his first actual game post, voted for boberz with almost the exact same reason (switching from overreacting to Hiraki to overdefensive to Hiraki). Of course it seems odd that scum would play together like this, but there doesn't seem to be any intention from beefsters of creating a connection between him and Mariyta shown in the post, just a mutual attempt to start a boberz bandwagon for fairly weak (and similar) reasons. <br>\n<br>\nMariyta's later posts show some signs of too strong attempt to separate herself from beefster: <br>\n<br>\n-Her post fourth post is fairly odd: boberz has made both one of the scummiest comments and isn't very scummy, and the attacks on boberz by beefster are ridiculous despite her being the source of the attacks main argument (overreaction/defense) and maintaining that the overreaction is one of the scummiest things so far. She then claims beefster as her second scum pick despite not really providing a case against him, although she doesn't place a vote on him (2nd scum pick seems a pretty easy way to bus without much consequence). The case against LC is also pretty weak, seeing as a large number of players had been fairly inactive at that time and she doesn't provide much to differentiate him from them. The lack of posts is perhaps suspicious, but to have that alone as your reasoning for top scum pick? <br>\n<br>\n-Her vote on beefster has been provided with little reason; yes he was her second scum pick, but could we get some of the reasons why? The ones given don't seem very strong. It only places him as l-4, so I could see it as bussing; I could also see it as an unfortunate (for her) combination of her previous placing of beefster as a second scum pick for bussing purposes and the common procedure of cleaning the slate a little for replacements. <br>\n<br>\n@beefster: mind outlining the case against me?", "time": "Thu Dec 16, 2010 7:13 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15787&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "15787"}

During that game the cop ending up dying the first night and the Doc wasted a protect on moose. Then the Doc made himself obvios the next day and moose got mislynched as a VT. Doc was killed the next night, not cuz he was obvios but during this time scum was able to blend in and the town lost. <br>\n<br>\nThe rhetorical line about your cutting the crap comment feels off. If you want moose to stop then why not say it bluntly, in a straight forward way?<br>\n<br>\nAnd what do you mean \"possible\" buddeying?

But sadly, it was a) consistent with his suspicions, so no slip up there and b) now that we have seen both wagons flip it was definitely not a vote to save his partner.<br>\n<br>\nNow, the good news, he's still extremely high on the scummilicious list. His D2 effort is almost non-existant. He avoids every other topic but his continued moose-tunneling from yesterday. And if moose really turns out to be the SK, Substrike would have as much interest in getting rid of him, especially since moose expressed a lot of suspicion towards Substrike yesterday.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Substrike22 wrote:</cite>Mariyta and Moose scumteam?</div></blockquote>\nMind sharing a bit of information or reasoning about that, mmh? <br>\n<br>\nEh, Lateralus and Ant-to-the-Max, stop rereading and join the debate, will ya?

So vote more, if you have any suspects, please.<br>\n<br>\nWell, with AntB flipping scum that would most likely clear Lateralus. I don't see scum AntB coming out of the gate D3 attacking somebody he had as town/no opinion before after scum got lynched last day. Lat's appearance after getting attacked was so ridiculously fast it can't be more than coincidence.<br>\n<br>\nI'm more interested in the fact that AntB completely dropped boberz after having him as a main suspect yesterday. Part of Ant's case on Lat is a lack of activity but he ignored the fact that boberz hadn't posted at all at that point. Ant even considers attacking ATTM (while not wanting to call him scum o_O) over boberz today. Doesn't make any sense until you take Sub's lynch into account.<br>\n<br>\nPart of why I don't believe in a Lat/AntB and maybe even in Antb/boberz team is that I don't think AntB is capable of or willing to bus. Confirmed by his non-commital interactions with Sub yesterday. He agreed completly on my case against Substrike (#672), yet didn't vote him. What!? <br>\nAnd after Sub's claim, instead of questioning a setup with a tracker, a watcher, a claimed doc and a claimed JOAT, he asked Sub about his lack of activity on D2. Translation: \"You can still save you hide with that claim buddy, just come up with a proper excuse for your inactivity!\". Btw, the same lack of activity that made AntB hesitate yesterday to hammer/threaten Sub is now used against Lat as a main point in Ant's case against him. Double standards anyone?(#679)<br>\n<br>\nThe difference to boberz regarding bussing is that boberz started to attack AntB and Ant only played (had to play?) the passive part in this scenario. But he always tried to tie Mari in there making up a scum team that he wanted to go down together whenever boberz should flip. Too bad, Mari got cleared by moose so he had to go another route and is aiming now for two of the three remaining unconfirmed townies (in this case with boberz&#180;as his partner). After being confident in calling me town yesterday...besides Substrike (lol, for what exactly?)(#567)<br>\n<br>\nSo, that leaves us with ATTM. There's not much going on there. He generally seems to fly under the radar, but he was very early on the Substrike wagon. The only thing I have now (without having gone through his ISO, since this post is too long already) is AntB's yet another non-commital stance (\"I will attack him later, but refrain from calling him scum now.\").<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBoberz, can I get a towniest to scummiest list of the remaining players from you?<br>\n<br>\nATTM. You said, yesterday, if Sub were to flip scum, boberz would most likely be his partner.

When Moose claimed that he was going to shot Bob, Substrike got really defensive and started to push even harder for a Moose lynch. He said he \"wasn't comfortable\" with Bob dying. Big red flag right there for me, and now that Sub flipped scum, it is something that is nagging at me. <br>\n<br>\nNow, ISOing Bob for anything this are some posts that stuck out to me <br>\n<br>\n#179\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>I dont like the substrike wagon.</div></blockquote>\n\nDefense for Sub wagon early on. No follow up here because there was nothing really to follow up with. <br>\n<br>\n#262\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>In conclusion. Town this game have been utter crap.<br>\n<br>\nIt is obvious from how the wagons sped up that moose is not scum. Too many people wanted him off for policy or near policy reasons. I still think a vig should hit him if only to teach him a lesson.<br>\n<br>\nHiraki is obv scum. He was one of only two valid wagons at one point and nobody joined the wagon. Obv scum. Whether or not you liked the case, it really is obvious.<br>\n<br>\nMaryta is probably hiraki's partner. He is also a terribad player. Need to see a hiraki flip first.<br>\n<br>\nBeefster could be third, if not AntB.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote vote hiraki's replacement</div><br>\nGuys you really need to run with this.</div></blockquote>\n\nHere there is a couple things. The way he refers to himself and the town sometimes interests me. More on that later. I also just realized this, but obv horrible reasoning is obv horrible. <br>\n<br>\n#328<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>Hello, town wake up. It wont work, even if the right person dies we cant prove whether moose is town or not, but we wake up tomorrow with some dead people.

If there is a vig out there hit him. If he is a vig he should hit the most scummy player (probs beef but mariyta if werewolf is scum). Fine done, whateer happens moose is considered as the lynch the next day.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nMove on.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnother derogatory comment directed at the \"town\". <br>\n<br>\n#338<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>If moose kills me he is both stupid and selfish and playing against wincon. I am not particularly scummy (I dont think) nobody has said so. If that is what he chooses to do he is wrong. But it doesnt decrease our number of mislynches allowed so I would rather lynch someone I am more sure is scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nOhh I like this one. A <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">VERY</div> subtle way of claiming/planting the idea of being town. <br>\n<br>\n#572 <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>Haha,I am not your pawn I do not have to respond to every thing you say to me. And tbh I have currently got the strongest point currently in play.<br>\n<br>\nAnd wheneve people try and work together someone always cries that it is scummy, it merely proves that that person is crap.</div></blockquote>\n\nJust going to say it here, but throughout many of his other posts pressing against werewolf, he always seems to push his cases with some sort of authority. <br>\n<br>\n#586 <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite>I am not prepared to look at substrike today.</div></blockquote>\n\nCOMPLETELY avoids commenting on my case for Substrike. <br>\n<br>\n#667 <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>boberz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Ant to the max wrote:</cite>...\"forced\" by the deadline.

Mighty strong case.<br>\n<br>\n - AntB retaliates taacking and voting boberz while tying Mari into the mix.<br>\n<br>\n - They're going at each other for almost all of D2, completely ignoring Substrike in the process (always remember, what role Substrike flipped).<br>\n<br>\n - D3 begins and AntB is still on the Mari/boberz team. However, after voting boberz yesterday he decided to vote Mari today (because after one of his buddies flipped he's afraid to keep pushing on his other buddy before the mislynch goes through).

Substrike's vote wasn't particularly useful as he tunneled moose hardcore. Ant_Max was on AntB for a good part of the first day before switching to the main wagon of the day.

Max waits six days to vote, then jumps on Substrike, where he remained for the rest of the day. (I'm tempted to rule out Max as scum for this, but I'm not doing so just yet.) AntB avoided the wagon entirely and boberz jumped on right at the end, just like he did with Beefster. <br>\n<br>\nD3, AntB starts out voting me, avoiding his main target from yesterday, while boberz hops on him. <br>\n<br>\nThe problem with all this is that I'm assuming AntB is scum. I need to analyze the rest of it, but I need to go to bed right now. Hopefully I'll get time tomorrow. <br>\n<br>\nP-edit: One quick note- Lat was on Substrike a lot D1, so I'm tempted to rule him out as scum, too.

Because that's what my read was until D3. I knew this was his first Normal Game so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He took a lot of independent stances and he wasn't afraid of attacking rather baselessly, usually typical newbie town tells.<br>\nBut his interactions during and prior to the Substrike hammer, his 180s of his reads on D3 and his \"woe is me, I'm townie\" spiel while being in lynch vicinity is just too fucking obvious to overlook.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want me to choose between AntB and boberz? There's something incredibely akward in how boberz is approaching this imminent AntB lynch (\"might be too easy, yet I'm keeping my vote on him\"). And the discrepancy between how he handled the Substrike wagon yesterday and the AntB wagon today gives me the feeling there's informed minority at work here. Which would point a lot to boberz scum and maybe even AntB town (fuck you, AntB, for already second guessing myself). Yet I still have the stronger belief in \"if AntB is scum, then boberz is scum\" than \"if boberz is scum, then AntB is scum\". So I'm still up for an AntB lynch unless everybody else is up for a boberz lynch first.<br>\n<br>\nOn a sidenote, Mari, I still think you're suffering from the same fate that Fate (oh no, he didn't) did in Biggest Game.

And because I played decent there and fooled some of you there for a while, you seem to feel like you don't want to rule me out because you don't want to get fooled again instead of just looking without any bias at what I've done so far like getting Substrike lynched when there was absolutely no need to if I was scum. And btw, you give Lat credit for riding Substrike hard on D1 while there was little to no chance of Substrike getting lynched with the moose/Beefster/werewolf-wagons going on when he was barely on him on D2.

I believe a successful block for several reasons.<br>\n<br>\n- While a scum nokill is worth considering, it's unlikely in this situation. MyLo makes it ten times harder to aim for a scum quicklynch than LyLo.<br>\n<br>\n- Now after AntB's lynch (btw, remind me to tell him postgame to stick to newbie games for a while...he was so scummy his lynch was inevitable) it's possible boberz and ATTM (depending on who AH's partner is), fearing they probably would get blocked, left the kill to AH.<br>\n<br>\n- If I read one of xtoxm post right, he hinted at blocking AH yesterday already.<br>\n<br>\n@AH<br>\nYou said you got mislynched due to a scum no kill before. Can you link the game?<br>\n<br>\n@Mari<br>\nPlease, don't go all crazy now with victory at hand. Take a breather and look at this game again. There was nothing wrong with xtoxm's plan if he was aiming to catch AH's partner and/or confirm his successful block. And being a sheep in MyLo is a bad, bad strategy.<br>\n<br>\n@xtoxm<br>\nThe same advice as I gave Mari. Take a breather. The majority is behind your plan and Mari obviously just had a rough day yesterday. But even if you can't be convinced to stay, can you get out the reasoning behind AH's block before you leave?<br>\n<br>\nI'd rather lynch AH over a No Lynch today. My AH/Lat town read went out of the window as soon as AntB flipped anyway. A lot of it based on the assumption AntB was scum and attacked Lat for no reason at the start of yesterday. If you take that away then the Lat slot wasn't all too different from Substrike's: Coming out to defend himself while continuously pushing for mislynches.
