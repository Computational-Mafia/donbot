During that time I would also frequently do crazy D1 tactics as I really didn't care for the game if I rolled town and just spam things or troll in games. Then I realized I needed to take a break and am back after a few weeks of no Mafia. In the site I did play on, I'm notorious for trolling D1, not reading the OP properly, not knowing how to use my roles correctly, but am known for putting in work N1 onwards.", "time": "Mon Dec 14, 2015 7:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64581&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "64581"}

Says hawk is trying to appease people and is ignoring mounting pressure on his slot.<br>\n-His response to hawk's claim does not address anything about the claim itself but rather continues to try to make hawk look bad. This seems scummy to me.<br>\n-Has a lot of posts where he's clearly trying to get people to talk more, which looks towny.<br>\n-Unvotes, I'm assuming because of my arguing, in #161.<br>\n<br>\nMoosy:<br>\n<br>\n-Expressed conviction waaay too early. Like, his second post. Then he has more conviction about more things before there's really too much of a basis for having that conviction (#30, #34, #36). I take this as more town-looking than scum, it genuinely looks like somebody who is bored with D1 and wants to try to have fun with it by being a troll.<br>\n-That also explains his cheeky response to me in #60, #61 and #62.<br>\n-The way he's doggedly sticking to his hawk vote despite multiple in-thread explanations for why this is a bad idea also seems like town...Moosy seems reckless and stubborn, and as scum it's much better to be flexible so you don't get scumread for stupid stuff.<br>\n<br>\nTheCow:<br>\n<br>\n-Starts doing a lot of work right off the bat, approaches the game with a drive to base reads on evidence. Tend to think this looks towny, but then it's something I do to guide my thoughts and make them look more town when I'm scum. There is one part where it looks kind of genuinely town though, and that's where he's asking hawk for his typing speed to see whether he had his claim typed up beforehand. Why this would impact his evaluation of hawk's claim I'm not sure, but TC obviously saw something behind it, and given some of the other stuff he's looked at (he did meta research and commented on a player's use of punctuation), it fits into his MO.<br>\n-He does put Hawk back at L-1 after the first person unvotes Hawk following the claim (#104), but then there were enough people who didn't immediately unvote Hawk following his claim that I don't think scum could explain all of them. Plus, you know, the unlikelihood of all three scum being on the first substantial wagon to form. So TC leans town for me.<br>\n<br>\nMetrion:<br>\n<br>\n-Null, only two posts and neither have anything substantial.<br>\n<br>\nSword:<br>\n<br>\n-Obviously newbie, to the point where he doesn't know how to unvote. This needs to inform the read on him.<br>\n-I do think that basically preempts the scum explanation for his eager entrance to the game.<br>\n-It also makes me doubt the motivation behind posts like #47 and #97, where he seems to be looking for reasons to scumread people. Maybe this is just him learning to scumhunt.<br>\n-So null, basically.<br>\n<br>\nira:<br>\n<br>\n-Also very newbish.<br>\n-#76 seems somewhat towny to me. He's exhibiting paranoia of a lot of different players and I kind of don't think such a new scum player would think to do fake pre-flip associatives.<br>\n-Posts like #77 and #158 demonstrate an openness to ira's thought process that strikes me as town as well.<br>\n-Interaction with hawk slot could come from scum, though. His vote on hawk in #76 put hawk at L-2, and his unvote was made in response to my urging people to unvote. It's kind of like I gave him an excuse to.<br>\n<br>\nChaotic:<br>\n<br>\n-Nothing substantial, null.<br>\n<br>\nSyndesis:<br>\n<br>\n-Has a clearly self-doubting attitude about scumhunting, which I think looks towny. Some examples: in #105, asking if somebody thought it was a good idea to lynch a claimed PR, in #110 beginning a sentence by saying he doesn't like a post and then reversing and saying it's fine.<br>\n-Yeah it just seems like he's not very sure of himself, which I think he would be more self-conscious about as scum.<br>\n<br>\ndave:<br>\n<br>\n-Has several posts that kind of look like he's trying to interact with people to get them to look scummy but doesn't really want to draw attention to himself, as well as posts where he's just kind of interacting without giving thoughts on the game. Examples of the former would be #38, #42, #92 and #93.

In a surface-level way, this actually strikes me as town. When I was secretive about something in my last game, it was two townies who endlessly pushed me trying to get me to be more explicit.<br>\n-Nothing else other than that that seems alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nFA:<br>\n<br>\n-Second post (#95) he places hawk at L-1. Says hawk is trying to appease people and is ignoring mounting pressure on his slot.<br>\n-His response to hawk's claim does not address anything about the claim itself but rather continues to try to make hawk look bad. This seems scummy to me.<br>\n-Has a lot of posts where he's clearly trying to get people to talk more, which looks towny.<br>\n-Unvotes, I'm assuming because of my arguing, in #161.<br>\n<br>\nMoosy:<br>\n<br>\n-Expressed conviction waaay too early. Like, his second post. Then he has more conviction about more things before there's really too much of a basis for having that conviction (#30, #34, #36). I take this as more town-looking than scum, it genuinely looks like somebody who is bored with D1 and wants to try to have fun with it by being a troll.<br>\n-That also explains his cheeky response to me in #60, #61 and #62.<br>\n-The way he's doggedly sticking to his hawk vote despite multiple in-thread explanations for why this is a bad idea also seems like town...Moosy seems reckless and stubborn, and as scum it's much better to be flexible so you don't get scumread for stupid stuff.<br>\n<br>\nTheCow:<br>\n<br>\n-Starts doing a lot of work right off the bat, approaches the game with a drive to base reads on evidence. Tend to think this looks towny, but then it's something I do to guide my thoughts and make them look more town when I'm scum. There is one part where it looks kind of genuinely town though, and that's where he's asking hawk for his typing speed to see whether he had his claim typed up beforehand. Why this would impact his evaluation of hawk's claim I'm not sure, but TC obviously saw something behind it, and given some of the other stuff he's looked at (he did meta research and commented on a player's use of punctuation), it fits into his MO.<br>\n-He does put Hawk back at L-1 after the first person unvotes Hawk following the claim (#104), but then there were enough people who didn't immediately unvote Hawk following his claim that I don't think scum could explain all of them. Plus, you know, the unlikelihood of all three scum being on the first substantial wagon to form. So TC leans town for me.<br>\n<br>\nMetrion:<br>\n<br>\n-Null, only two posts and neither have anything substantial.<br>\n<br>\nSword:<br>\n<br>\n-Obviously newbie, to the point where he doesn't know how to unvote. This needs to inform the read on him.<br>\n-I do think that basically preempts the scum explanation for his eager entrance to the game.<br>\n-It also makes me doubt the motivation behind posts like #47 and #97, where he seems to be looking for reasons to scumread people. Maybe this is just him learning to scumhunt.<br>\n-So null, basically.<br>\n<br>\nira:<br>\n<br>\n-Also very newbish.<br>\n-#76 seems somewhat towny to me. He's exhibiting paranoia of a lot of different players and I kind of don't think such a new scum player would think to do fake pre-flip associatives.<br>\n-Posts like #77 and #158 demonstrate an openness to ira's thought process that strikes me as town as well.<br>\n-Interaction with hawk slot could come from scum, though. His vote on hawk in #76 put hawk at L-2, and his unvote was made in response to my urging people to unvote. It's kind of like I gave him an excuse to.<br>\n<br>\nChaotic:<br>\n<br>\n-Nothing substantial, null.<br>\n<br>\nSyndesis:<br>\n<br>\n-Has a clearly self-doubting attitude about scumhunting, which I think looks towny. Some examples: in #105, asking if somebody thought it was a good idea to lynch a claimed PR, in #110 beginning a sentence by saying he doesn't like a post and then reversing and saying it's fine.<br>\n-Yeah it just seems like he's not very sure of himself, which I think he would be more self-conscious about as scum.<br>\n<br>\ndave:<br>\n<br>\n-Has several posts that kind of look like he's trying to interact with people to get them to look scummy but doesn't really want to draw attention to himself, as well as posts where he's just kind of interacting without giving thoughts on the game. Examples of the former would be #38, #42, #92 and #93.

Many people here seem to think that it is a good time to get rid of lackluster players but that simply means you are entering day 2 as a day one repeat - a day with almost no information whatsoever.  It is very important for town, IMHO, to get out of that stage as fast as possible and get good interactions to proceed with.  Information early on is crucial.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, I hate just stabbing in the dark and that is essentially what day one is.  <br>\n<br>\nI don't like Moosey's posting either - it is worthless - but if we end up lynching it we are going for a PL rather than a scum lynch.

Like, his second post. Then he has more conviction about more things before there's really too much of a basis for having that conviction (#30, #34, #36).

Tend to think this looks towny, but then it's something I do to guide my thoughts and make them look more town when I'm scum. There is one part where it looks kind of genuinely town though, and that's where he's asking hawk for his typing speed to see whether he had his claim typed up beforehand. Why this would impact his evaluation of hawk's claim I'm not sure, but TC obviously saw something behind it, and given some of the other stuff he's looked at (he did meta research and commented on a player's use of punctuation), it fits into his MO.<br>\n-He does put Hawk back at L-1 after the first person unvotes Hawk following the claim (#104), but then there were enough people who didn't immediately unvote Hawk following his claim that I don't think scum could explain all of them. Plus, you know, the unlikelihood of all three scum being on the first substantial wagon to form. So TC leans town for me.<br>\n<br>\nMetrion:<br>\n<br>\n-Null, only two posts and neither have anything substantial.<br>\n<br>\nSword:<br>\n<br>\n-Obviously newbie, to the point where he doesn't know how to unvote. This needs to inform the read on him.<br>\n-I do think that basically preempts the scum explanation for his eager entrance to the game.<br>\n-It also makes me doubt the motivation behind posts like #47 and #97, where he seems to be looking for reasons to scumread people. Maybe this is just him learning to scumhunt.<br>\n-So null, basically.<br>\n<br>\nira:<br>\n<br>\n-Also very newbish.<br>\n-#76 seems somewhat towny to me. He's exhibiting paranoia of a lot of different players and I kind of don't think such a new scum player would think to do fake pre-flip associatives.<br>\n-Posts like #77 and #158 demonstrate an openness to ira's thought process that strikes me as town as well.<br>\n-Interaction with hawk slot could come from scum, though. His vote on hawk in #76 put hawk at L-2, and his unvote was made in response to my urging people to unvote.

Asks a lot of good questions to get reads on people like \"what's your reason for this\" or \"please explain in detail\". He seems the most experience although CN has been on since 2010 and I haven't read his posts yet. He's being patient with his voting and I respect that. My read on him is null mainly because I haven't seen him respond to pressure because he has had no pressure.<br>\n<br>\nFA_Q2 (slightly town): Again, I love those question marks. He states claims and makes reasons for his claims as well like any scum hunter should. He has been targeted once before as scum and dealt with it splendidly (and by that I mean better than I first handled it). He has not made any clear definitive posts that I can point to and say \"Boom. This makes him town,\" but I can expect a post from FA_Q2 to swing me that way at anytime.<br>\n<br>\nIraonavp (town): post 76 and post 77 say it all. He is making reads on everyone, hinting but not jumping to conclusions. I especially love reading the exclamation marks in his posts because it makes me feel like I'm reading a mystery novel! I do not agree with his voting of FA_Q2 because I believes that when there are real suspects of scum out there, voting him for no reason really grinds his gears.

He unvotes, the V/LA.<br>\n<br>\nMoosyDoosy (scum): I have to read his votes neutrally and pretending I'm not Hawkleader3. Sure. During the time he voted me, I was awkward with my intros and backed off Sydnesis early after being pressed. In the early stages of the game, it's enough to call me scummy. Since then, he has read three different people Syndesis (who started up my bandwagon and has been town-like ever since), Iranoavp (who as I said earlier. Clearly town), Hawk, Hawkleader3, and me. It seems like he wants me to be lynched. Maybe because I'm a PR? Maybe he is too lazy to go back to ISO people to look for scum and it's easier to just say Hawk is scum? Whatever it is, I see him as slightly scummy under normal circumstances, but because it's hard finding scum in other people in this game, it makes him look extra scummy.<br>\n<br>\nSoapBar (slightly town): Hasn't posted a lot of substance, but again. Lots of questions that he asks. He gave some reads of his and the second half of his posts were him talking to himself. It's not a lot of posts, but the more reading I see from people, the more town I perceive people to be.<br>\n<br>\nSwordsworth (null): He's voted and stated why he has voted. He didn't respond to pressure on bandwagoning against him, but it feels like he was posting more when it was safer. There isn't a big enough sample size to confirm this, but it made him took a little suspicious. But since his active reading counteracts this scum suspicion, it leaves me with a null read on him.<br>\n<br>\nSyndesis (slightly town): When i first save her couple of posts, I was like \"OMG this girl is boastful and it needs to stop. Please be scum!\" and her overwhelming confidence that I was scum made me angry. I couldn't tell if she was joking or that confident in her abilities. Once I got over the fact that she wasn't scum, she seems slightly town to me. She is kind of like Davesaz in that i want to see how she responds to pressure. But with the way she acts right now, I can assume how she would act if she was accused<br>\n<br>\nTheCow (slightly town): If he reads every scum victim like he reads me and studies me, this guy is for sure town! the WPM thing was slightly weird and if I, A PR town, was lynched based off how consistent my typing speeds are? I would've left the forum for a little while. He did lots of research, but Cow. I don't think I act the same as I did years ago. I was 14-15 years old when I played those games. I'm 18 now. This strategy would've been brilliant had my games been consistent. Kudos for the effort for reading through my games.<br>\n<br>\nToolenduso (town): I have to admit I overlooked Tool a lot because he posted long posts when I didn't have the time to read them. After reading his posts now, I see him as town. I had a problem in the beginning when he said sword was the most suspicious for having an eager to please entrance when my entrance looked more that way than anyone's, but of course I wasn't going to tell him this with me being close to lynched. I let it go. Since then, he has asked a lot of questions and has scum hunted well. He knows when to hold them and knows when to fold them. He also gave his ISOs.

I feel that his responses to pressure looked like genuine town irritation. I don't support his retaliative push on toolenduso, but I think it came from a town-aligned thought process (from reasoning of toolenduso is wrong, therefore he's scum-aligned, which despite being wrong doesn't make Chaotic Neutrality more likely to be scum-aligned). I don't see why a scum-aligned player would push their accuser (if toolenduso was town-aligned, which I feel is likely to be true), since all that would do is convince their accuser that they were more likely to be scum-aligned.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Chaotic may seem a bit more Town after that last post?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe above, for those wishing to know my exact words and not the twisted versions being depicted of declaring him strongly Town aligned only because of that reaction.</div></blockquote><br>\nNo, that is not what I am attempting to convey! You are not stating your convictions up-front, and it seems your defense of CN is subtle and underhanded. I never depicted you as declaring him strongly town-aligned. The way you declare him \"a bit more Town\" appears to me \"magical\" as the reasoning behind it makes no sense to me.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Saying we shouldn't waste discussion is reaching to defend a player, I think that's some poor word choice right there.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt constitutes reaching in my opinion because you appear to be resorting to this extremely odd argument to combat a vote on CN, rather than addressing why you think CN is likely to be town-aligned. I strongly doubt you actually are this concerned about a few days of discussion time, especially considering your abysmal opinion of how we've used this time so far.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Reaching implies struggling to make a congruent case. There simply isn't a case at all...Semantics aside, it's lame reasoning to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really not like</div> (where-ever that arbitrary scaling system places that). Reasoning being that there simply isn't anything scummy about it.</div></blockquote><br>\nI believe that, from reading between the lines, you are attempting to push an agenda of making CN appear town-aligned. It is \"scummy\" (as you call it) to play below the radar and be opaque about your motivations and opinions.<br>\n<br>\n(Note: You later go on to state that you read CN as town-aligned, this marks the start of the creation of this congruent case.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Unless you want to suggest that rushing into things is better for town,</div></blockquote><br>\nTrying to consolidate a lynch target with 5 remaining days simply does not constitute \"rushing into things\", whatever way you look at it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>or that asking for more time in any sense is scummy</div></blockquote><br>\nNot in any sense, but I would argue that the way in which you requested more time makes you more likely to be scum-aligned. This is not worth examining further at this point, so I suggest you do not debate with me here yet.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>especially when the person that is circumstantially being defended is read by that player to be town.</div></blockquote><br>\nI expected this, to some extent. I would like for you to elaborate further on this point. Are there any other reasons why you believe CN is likely to be town-aligned, other than your strange post about him misinterpreting something?<br>\n<br>\nYou have implied earlier that you believed that CN was scum-aligned until he posted a certain thing, and not said a whole lot about him looking town-aligned otherwise. Really, from looking at your posts, I get mixed messages. Some parts feel like you think he's scum-aligned and your opinion softened just slightly, yet I got the impression that you were subtly trying to push a town-aligned read on him.

First the people who have votes, then selected others.<br>\n<br>\nLooking next at toolenduso, I didn't really have an opinion until he tried to push me for casting doubt.  That whole exchange seems very townie to me.  He went into a lot more detail than I'd expect from scum, and stuck with it when I came back strong.  I would have expected scum to break off when I said I understood his push but disagreed, and would also have expected a stronger reaction to the soft \"maybe you're scum for still pushing\".  Then he looks into background and comes around on his own, where scum would have let it die down and keep the justification for a future mislynch attempt.<br>\n<br>\nThe later analysis of CN is pretty strong.  I think I probably agreed with it the first time I read it.  Having some doubts on FA (who had earlier started pushing CN for the same things, but weaker push) is also a town mindset.  Can't dismiss that angle, scum might indeed push weakly on their partner and it might look just like FA's push.  And I can certainly imagine a scum partner not wanting their push to be forgotten lest they lose the town cred, so FA bringing up that CN focused only on toolenduso's push is also a scumtell.<br>\n<br>\nHaving reread the 3 people with more than one vote, I'm getting a strong town on toolenduso, weak scum on FA, strong scum on CN.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Chaotic Neutrality</span><br>\n<br>\nTo answer another previous question, we needed 4 more votes, with me it's 3.<br>\n<br>\nPrevious reads included a medium town on Hawk and a WTF on Moosy.

Multiball would have to be werewolves since Chaotic's mafia faction was just called \"mafia\" and not \"___ mafia.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnyway....here's the wagon analysis I did during the night. It's based on Chaotic's faction being the only anti-town faction in the game, so very subject to change should anything come to light that suggests otherwise.

As I've said before, it didn't really look like bussing.<br>\n<br>\nSynd: Synd's switch to FA and redirection to the CN wagon when it became apparent that that was the lynch looks somewhat scumpartner-y. But Syndesis overall looks town.<br>\n<br>\nDave: Dave might look bad if it weren't for the context surrounding his L-3 vote. At the time, syndesis had hopped off of CN and onto FA. CN and FA had the same number of votes on them and dave agreed that FA looked scummy. So for hypothetical purposes, if dave were scum with CN and FA is town, that would mean that scumdave looked at two wagons with equal momentum and chose to push his partner over a townie. Doesn't make sense. On top of that dave looks town for other reasons which I've gone into before.<br>\n<br>\nSoap: Soap's vote comes soon after dave's vote, and at the time CN and FA were again tied for number of votes (because CN voted FA). It also came after I specifically asked soap for his thoughts on CN. My initial thought was that soap's vote looked the most like bussing scum because of the timing, but CN's vote on FA puts that in doubt a little bit because that meant soap was, at least by pure numbers, in the same position that dave was in when dave voted on CN. However, Soap wasn't posting very frequently in the week leading up to deadline (bc Christmas) and it's possible he wasn't paying a ton of attention to the voting/VCs. Simply by process of elimination, Soap looks like the best candidate for bussing scum on the wagon. If we eliminate him and he flips town, I think I could accept the possibility that it was an all-town wagon that lynched CN.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: FA_Q2 wagon</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Synd #139, L-6, switches to dave in #318, L-7<br>\n-ira #189, L-5, unvotes in #231, L-6<br>\n-lolbabe #378, L-6<br>\n-Synd #379, L-5, switches to CN in #460, L-5<br>\n-ira #415, L-4<br>\n-Chaotic #447, L-3<br>\n<br>\nSynd: OK this side of things continues to make Syndesis look bad. The vote in #139 doesn't really mean much, I could see that coming from a partner or a townie, but the fact that she revoted FA one post after lolbabe decided to revive the FA wagon is a little suspicious given that FA was the only other wagon that looked like it might succeed besides CN's wagon. I'm going to want to take another look at Syndesis's ISO and see how I feel about this.<br>\n<br>\nira: ira's arc also makes him look like a potential partner to CN. He follows syndesis onto the FA wagon but unvotes when FA questions him a little, perhaps like scum who lack true conviction in a wagon they know is on town. When he revotes FA, it's at a time when it wasn't yet clear that CN was the day's likely lynch. In other words, ira helped push momentum toward the FA wagon that I now believe was likely on town. ira did start saying in #434 that he would lynch anybody, including CN, and I believe this actually supports the case that ira is a partner. #434 was just after dave pushed the CN wagon closer to being the day's lynch (but before CN put FA's wagon equal with his own again) and looks like scum giving themselves the ability to bus if need be.<br>\n<br>\nlolbabe: lolbabe was also in a place that looks like it could be scum pushing a counterwagon to partnerCN, but I will point out that she appears pretty open about the possibility that CN is scum. She says CN looks like town in the post she votes FA (#378), but then pushes CN some in #401, #452 and #453. The first of those, #401, was while the FA wagon was still neck-and-neck with the CN wagon. So that works in favor of lolbabe being town, though she could just be a good scum player.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone else, plus an ISO read on Synd:<br>\n<br>\nMetrion: Metrion's only vote was an RVS vote on the Cow. He unvoted in his second post and never voted again. He wasn't too active during that time, and holy crap does his arc look like a scum partner to CN. Literally half his posts come after I begin pushing CN, and the bulk of that is defending CN/his read on CN. It's always a relatively soft defense (look at the question mark in #334), and after I push back on it he begins to distance himself from the read ever so slightly. But he never goes so far as to abandon his townread on CN. His last post came before dave pushed the CN wagon toward becoming the day's lynch, so we never got to see how his attitude on CN would have changed (or not changed) given the town momentum, but given the slow build and compromise-y nature of the CN lynch, it would make sense for at least one of the scum partners to have been MIA as momentum swung CN's way.His defense of CN was, imo, shallow. I bookmarked a couple snippets from Metrion's defense in case CN flipped scum because even at the time I thought Metrion's defense of CN looked weird. Even as he was defending CN, he was trying to put some focus on other players, like ira. The \"droning on\" thing I highlighted because it looked like Metrion was reaching to support his conclusion that CN looked towny. It looked like he was grabbing for anything to support his conclusion, which is what you do when you want to arrive at a certain conclusion instead of trying to arrive at the conclusion that truly makes the most sense. I think #346 looks bad as well; he's trying to slow down momentum toward lynching CN by saying that we have five days left -- ignoring the fact that those days made up the week of Christmas, which I had already pointed out. Right now Metrion looks like by far the best candidate for a D2 lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMoosy: It's tough to tell whether Moosy's end-of-day vote on ira was serious or not. He was clearly not taking D1 seriously, and the post in which he voted ira involved him voting every single player including himself. So maybe he did it just to be silly but intentionally made ira the last person he voted for, or maybe ira just happened to be the last person he put on his vote ladder and therefore it was more like another RVS vote. One could argue that his nonchalant and silly attitude on D1 came from scum wanting to absolve himself of any attachment to anything that happened during the day, therefore ensuring that he would live on to D2, but I don't really buy that when I weigh it against the desire to protect your partner (who became the lynch candidate and was under pressure for a good chunk of the day). It's worth noting that Moosy mentions CN in two of the posts where he actually put in some effort, #293 and #312. In the first he leans toward CN being town but says that may change. Looks like genuinely trying to sort CN imo. In the second he says that CN is \"probably scum tbh.\" So even though it's possible Moosy is a partner, I think there are much better candidates to look at right now.<br>\n<br>\nTheCow: Again, the arc with hawk ends with Cow looking town imo. He naked votes me in #269 and declines to say why when asked. For the whole week leading up to Christmas/deadline, he really didn't do anything. This also kind of fits in with my theory from my Metrion analysis above -- that at least one of the scum partners was inactive close to deadline, which is why the CN wagon built like it did -- but again I don't necessarily buy that that's true when Metrion looks much more like scum than Cow and it also makes a lot of sense that at least one partner would be on the FA counterwagon.<br>\n<br>\nSynd: You know what, the tone of Syndesis's posts throughout the game, especially earlier in the day, support the town explanation for her voting pattern re: FA and CN. She plays lighthearted and switches her vote around a lot and votes people to see how they'll react (as opposed to having a ton of conviction behind votes). At one point she says she feels adrift. That explains, from a town perspective, why she switched around from FA to CN, and why some of it looks like it's at times that would be convenient for scum. I'm comfortable keeping Synd out of the scum pool for now.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Chaotic's interactions</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-His first real reads are given in #253, where he says moosy and I look scummy.

Especially now with #511 he's trying to push the game forward in it's current slow state with a hearty bunch of points/speculation from diving through the thread. What mainly had me was their voting pattern D1. When they first vote CN they give off the intention that yeah CN's a scum read or at the very least has is someone they wouldn't mind getting off the board. As scum this could be a real poke to get their act together I suppose.  They then switch to FA, right after lolbabe puts on the first vote of the wagon. Their only comments on CN after this point is that they are willing to compromise on their lynch and that they look more like apathetic town but they aren't really sure. They end up putting the L -1 vote on CN and then their reaction when Swords hammers, which is completely ironic that they pointed out in #511 that Ira's response is in line with \"accidentally hammering my partner\" when theirs are rather similar. <br>\n<br>\nAnd they promised reads in 396, that would have been cool to have at that point. Considering it was Christmas Eve though I can't exactly blame them.

Considering you were pushing for me at the end I certainly do not see your vote on my wagon as a 'compromise.'</div></blockquote><br>\nIt was a compromise lynch because I considered Metrion more likely to flip scum than you. This is just nitpicky and terrible, I don't see how it could be at all indicative even if I used the wrong term to describe it.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt's not 'nitpicky' and it has nothing to do with using the 'wrong term.'  It has to do with positioning.</div></blockquote><br>\nI feel I have made it clear enough in my explanations that what I meant to convey was that I still read you as scum-aligned, but would prefer to lynch Metrion. The awkwardness you perceive in my positioning comes only from perceived misuse of the term \"compromise lynch\", of which it has been established that we interpret it in different ways.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You do scummy things and then demand that they really are not scummy.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat is generally how one responds to inherently flawed accusations.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Lastly, the town read on CN was not just wrong - it was completely uncalled for.

I know from past experiences it's a town more often that not who will really try to defend/counter a wagon on a scum, whereas real scum are more selfish about their image since they know such a person is actually scum and they don't want to get caught by association next day if it goes through. I also know that someone using bad arguments and coming to bad conclusions doesn't really make them scum or town either way. I try to see intent, and though misguided I don't see you as that malicious. If you actually think I'm a mafia trying to bus Metrion, which is absurd, then I don't mind trading 1 for 1 if we do get a mafia in Metrion (very likely).

Even the way that they are grouped in a separate category close together suggests that he can easily swap votes between the two. If he pushes \"i want either metrion or iraonavp lynched today\", then he's going to get a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nSyndesis's uncertainty around the lynch, while possibly indicative of a scum-aligned player unwilling to push either wagon knowing that they were mislynches, felt pretty genuine and was possibly her just seeing indications that there was something wrong (?). I really think that even if Syndesis was scum-aligned, it would still be a non-indicative trait of her play.<br>\n<br>\nI think Moosy is town-aligned because his switching across to the Metrion wagon is based on the reasoning that he sees from toolenduso (in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7537235#p7537235\">586</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7544139#p7544139\">645</a>), rather than just \"oh everyone is moving votes k\". He seems like he's actively trying to solve the game and he has not been very opportunistic.<br>\n<br>\nSoapbar doesn't really address the situation yesterday other than by saying that he would rather lynch Metrion than me. There isn't any opportunistic stance manipulation because he hasn't given a read on me earlier and wasn't voting me earlier. That could be indicative of a scum-aligned player trying to stay out of the situation and then place pressure whenever necessary, but I would be hesitant to lynch Soapbar based on this alone. Also considering his earlier push on davesaz which was not at all opportunistic.<br>\n<br>\nSimilar with Burning_Earth, he comes in at the perfect time to place pressure on Metrion. He doesn't justify his stance at all and just votes blindly. I really did not like TheCow either, and I think that Burning_Earth is scum-aligned.<br>\n<br>\nRaskolnikov's actions regarding the lynch make me think he was town-aligned. He comes in and pushes Metrion before several other people bandwagon onto the lynch, no real opportunism (but he wasn't in the game therefore not voting me before so perhaps idk?). I think he would've pushed me if he was scum-aligned, since there were already several votes on me and about 2 on Metrion iirc. There's no reason to push for a Metrion mislynch in that situation if I'm much more readily available, he can't have foreseen everyone switching onto Metrion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo in conclusion, I think davesaz, FA_Q2 and Burning_Earth are very likely to be scum-aligned.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: davesaz</span><br>\n<br>\nI think I've been reading his questioning style wrong, and it's non-indicative. It seems like an easy think to fake as a scum-aligned player, it's also easy to manipulate logic to reach incorrect conclusions. The main thing preventing me from voting FA_Q2 is his hard pushing of Chaotic Neutrality on d1, and I don't want to vote Burning_Earth because I don't think I'll get much out of my vote in terms of a response.", "time": "Thu Jan 14, 2016 9:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64581&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "64581"}

He was very apathetic day 2 and I feel like here too he's sort of complacent. I guess he was afk but he just sat on his dave vote which was clearly not going anywhere at the time and he barely interacted with the other events. He like dave also as a small positive went on CN instead of the viable FA_Q2 wagon, and again I don't know how much credit to give them for it. I know for example my slot was on the wrong wagon at that point so I don't want to weigh whether someone joined the CN wagon around halfway/past or if they didn't for too much.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't ISO'd syndesis but from the time I've been here I like his posts and even his effort/methodology on his wagon on me despite it being wrong. He'd be even better but idk why he townreads dave and doesn't like soap. A tiny bit of him not liking soap seems to even be because soap doesn't like dave which is a weird reason to not like soap for. Now that I think about it if we get dave and he flips scum syn will be worse off, I'd personally still rather go for TheCow(slot) than dave if the guy was here though.</div></blockquote><br>\nI have not liked your slot all game and your hard buddying ira certainly is not helping this.

As I've said before, it didn't really look like bussing.<br>\n<br>\nSynd: Synd's switch to FA and redirection to the CN wagon when it became apparent that that was the lynch looks somewhat scumpartner-y. But Syndesis overall looks town.<br>\n<br>\nDave: Dave might look bad if it weren't for the context surrounding his L-3 vote. At the time, syndesis had hopped off of CN and onto FA. CN and FA had the same number of votes on them and dave agreed that FA looked scummy. So for hypothetical purposes, if dave were scum with CN and FA is town, that would mean that scumdave looked at two wagons with equal momentum and chose to push his partner over a townie. Doesn't make sense. On top of that dave looks town for other reasons which I've gone into before.<br>\n<br>\nSoap: Soap's vote comes soon after dave's vote, and at the time CN and FA were again tied for number of votes (because CN voted FA). It also came after I specifically asked soap for his thoughts on CN. My initial thought was that soap's vote looked the most like bussing scum because of the timing, but CN's vote on FA puts that in doubt a little bit because that meant soap was, at least by pure numbers, in the same position that dave was in when dave voted on CN. However, Soap wasn't posting very frequently in the week leading up to deadline (bc Christmas) and it's possible he wasn't paying a ton of attention to the voting/VCs. Simply by process of elimination, Soap looks like the best candidate for bussing scum on the wagon. If we eliminate him and he flips town, I think I could accept the possibility that it was an all-town wagon that lynched CN.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: FA_Q2 wagon</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-Synd #139, L-6, switches to dave in #318, L-7<br>\n-ira #189, L-5, unvotes in #231, L-6<br>\n-lolbabe #378, L-6<br>\n-Synd #379, L-5, switches to CN in #460, L-5<br>\n-ira #415, L-4<br>\n-Chaotic #447, L-3<br>\n<br>\nSynd: OK this side of things continues to make Syndesis look bad. The vote in #139 doesn't really mean much, I could see that coming from a partner or a townie, but the fact that she revoted FA one post after lolbabe decided to revive the FA wagon is a little suspicious given that FA was the only other wagon that looked like it might succeed besides CN's wagon. I'm going to want to take another look at Syndesis's ISO and see how I feel about this.<br>\n<br>\nira: ira's arc also makes him look like a potential partner to CN. He follows syndesis onto the FA wagon but unvotes when FA questions him a little, perhaps like scum who lack true conviction in a wagon they know is on town. When he revotes FA, it's at a time when it wasn't yet clear that CN was the day's likely lynch. In other words, ira helped push momentum toward the FA wagon that I now believe was likely on town. ira did start saying in #434 that he would lynch anybody, including CN, and I believe this actually supports the case that ira is a partner. #434 was just after dave pushed the CN wagon closer to being the day's lynch (but before CN put FA's wagon equal with his own again) and looks like scum giving themselves the ability to bus if need be.<br>\n<br>\nlolbabe: lolbabe was also in a place that looks like it could be scum pushing a counterwagon to partnerCN, but I will point out that she appears pretty open about the possibility that CN is scum. She says CN looks like town in the post she votes FA (#378), but then pushes CN some in #401, #452 and #453. The first of those, #401, was while the FA wagon was still neck-and-neck with the CN wagon. So that works in favor of lolbabe being town, though she could just be a good scum player.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone else, plus an ISO read on Synd:<br>\n<br>\nMetrion: Metrion's only vote was an RVS vote on the Cow. He unvoted in his second post and never voted again. He wasn't too active during that time, and holy crap does his arc look like a scum partner to CN. Literally half his posts come after I begin pushing CN, and the bulk of that is defending CN/his read on CN. It's always a relatively soft defense (look at the question mark in #334), and after I push back on it he begins to distance himself from the read ever so slightly. But he never goes so far as to abandon his townread on CN. His last post came before dave pushed the CN wagon toward becoming the day's lynch, so we never got to see how his attitude on CN would have changed (or not changed) given the town momentum, but given the slow build and compromise-y nature of the CN lynch, it would make sense for at least one of the scum partners to have been MIA as momentum swung CN's way.His defense of CN was, imo, shallow. I bookmarked a couple snippets from Metrion's defense in case CN flipped scum because even at the time I thought Metrion's defense of CN looked weird. Even as he was defending CN, he was trying to put some focus on other players, like ira. The \"droning on\" thing I highlighted because it looked like Metrion was reaching to support his conclusion that CN looked towny. It looked like he was grabbing for anything to support his conclusion, which is what you do when you want to arrive at a certain conclusion instead of trying to arrive at the conclusion that truly makes the most sense. I think #346 looks bad as well; he's trying to slow down momentum toward lynching CN by saying that we have five days left -- ignoring the fact that those days made up the week of Christmas, which I had already pointed out. Right now Metrion looks like by far the best candidate for a D2 lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMoosy: It's tough to tell whether Moosy's end-of-day vote on ira was serious or not. He was clearly not taking D1 seriously, and the post in which he voted ira involved him voting every single player including himself. So maybe he did it just to be silly but intentionally made ira the last person he voted for, or maybe ira just happened to be the last person he put on his vote ladder and therefore it was more like another RVS vote. One could argue that his nonchalant and silly attitude on D1 came from scum wanting to absolve himself of any attachment to anything that happened during the day, therefore ensuring that he would live on to D2, but I don't really buy that when I weigh it against the desire to protect your partner (who became the lynch candidate and was under pressure for a good chunk of the day). It's worth noting that Moosy mentions CN in two of the posts where he actually put in some effort, #293 and #312. In the first he leans toward CN being town but says that may change. Looks like genuinely trying to sort CN imo. In the second he says that CN is \"probably scum tbh.\" So even though it's possible Moosy is a partner, I think there are much better candidates to look at right now.<br>\n<br>\nTheCow: Again, the arc with hawk ends with Cow looking town imo. He naked votes me in #269 and declines to say why when asked. For the whole week leading up to Christmas/deadline, he really didn't do anything. This also kind of fits in with my theory from my Metrion analysis above -- that at least one of the scum partners was inactive close to deadline, which is why the CN wagon built like it did -- but again I don't necessarily buy that that's true when Metrion looks much more like scum than Cow and it also makes a lot of sense that at least one partner would be on the FA counterwagon.<br>\n<br>\nSynd: You know what, the tone of Syndesis's posts throughout the game, especially earlier in the day, support the town explanation for her voting pattern re: FA and CN. She plays lighthearted and switches her vote around a lot and votes people to see how they'll react (as opposed to having a ton of conviction behind votes). At one point she says she feels adrift. That explains, from a town perspective, why she switched around from FA to CN, and why some of it looks like it's at times that would be convenient for scum. I'm comfortable keeping Synd out of the scum pool for now.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Chaotic's interactions</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">-His first real reads are given in #253, where he says moosy and I look scummy.
