No discussion of the game outside the thread will be allowed unless I explicitly say so.<br>1.2. Do not edit posts. Do not use invisible text. Do not use small text.<br>1.3. No quoting of PMs will be allowed. Claiming is allowed, but quoting role PMs is not. By the same token, NO quoting mod communication in the game thread.<br>1.4. No discussion of the game in thread will be allowed following the game being put into night. However, the day does not end until I verify that a lynch has occurred.<br>1.5. No discussion of ongoing games will be permitted.<br>1.6. A basic level of civility will be required of all players. If personal attacks reach an excessive level, action will be taken.<br>1.7. At my discretion, modkills will be issued for the breakage of these rules depending on the intent and severity of the error. Modkills will convert a player to neutral survivor, and either not end or end the day, at my discretion. I will make sure that modkills are harmful to your faction.<br>1.8. Any type of claiming mafia partners as any alignment will result in a modkill, regardless of alignment. Don't do it.<br>1.9. Intentionally provoking a player in an attempt to get him or her modkilled or otherwise using modkills for strategic purposes will result in a modkill against the person using it as a tactic.<br><br>Rules Section 2: Voting, Deadlines, and Prods<br>2.1. All votes should be bolded and in the following format: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: [PLAYERNAME]</span>. Likewise, if you are already voting for someone, please unvote before voting again, in a format like this: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, vote: [PLAYERNAME]</span>. <br>2.2. Players may vote to end the day without a lynch by a majority of them voting for a no lynch.<br>2.3. Upon the majority of players voting for a particular player, a lynch will occur. If, at deadline, a majority has not been reached, no-lynch will occur.<br>2.4. Deadlines will be as follows: 2 weeks will be allowed per day. No extensions will be allowed except due to extenuating circumstances. Night actions must be received within 48 hours of a day's end. This means that night phases are roughly 50 hours long. If no night action is received, it will be randomized.<br>2.5. Failure to post within a 72 hour period will result in a prod. Failure to respond to a prod within 48 hours will result in replacement. After being prodded 3 times, unless your activity has made up for it otherwise, you will be force replaced if you need a fourth prod.<br><br>Rules Section 3: Other Rules<br>3.1. Cryptography (using ciphers) is forbidden, but stenography is allowed. If not sure, PM me first. <br>3.2. After you're dead, stop talking.<br>3.3. There is no rule 3.3.<br>3.4. Everything is randomized.<br>3.5. I am not infallible. If I make a mistake, please PM me or point it out in the thread.<br>3.6. This is my <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">color</span></span>, do not use it.<br>3.7. Play to win, but still have fun.<br>3.8.

I feel like pressure on him will get us no further and his joking was probably more town in hindsight. I can't see scum wanting to draw attention to themselves unless it's for a pro- town reason. What do you think of Acro?</div></blockquote><br><br>No, my vote is still on Beck because I haven't decided on a better place to put it at the moment. <br><br>What do I think about Acro? Well, I had to pull up his ISO to even remember what he had posted, and that's because he's made four posts with no information except that he doesn't want to vote yet. His only questions to others have been about Beck's previous mafia experience and a request for clarification from confid about his vote, which seems like a defensive move rather than an attempt to put pressure on Confid. In short, he's posting, but has avoided voting or letting any opinions be known. I can excuse a refusal to vote if a player compensates by actively pressuring players through pointed questions and provides interesting analysis, but Acro is not doing this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sleepy wrote:</cite>You thinking Yank was scum until post 49. Why the sudden change?</div></blockquote><br><br>I thought I explained myself pretty fully in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3158610#p3158610\" class=\"postlink\">Post 53</a>. Prior to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3158465#p3158465\" class=\"postlink\">Post 49</a>, I read Yank as fence sitting and hesitant to state firm opinions, which I consider scummy. In post 49, he came out of his shell a bit and took a firm stand. I don't think it was necessarily a good one, but I don't think it was a scummy one either. It looked like a jumpy newbie defense, which lessened my suspicions of Yank.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sleepy wrote:</cite>@CS<br>RVS is OVER. Acro did the right thing not slapping on a vote.<br>+5</div></blockquote><br>I find Sleepy's support of Acro's refusal to vote a bit strange. I wouldn't vote someone for refusing to vote, but neither would I argue that it is a good move, and I certainly wouldn't assign someone \"vollkan points\"\u00a9 for calling someone out for refusing to vote.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Confid wrote:</cite>A trait I've noticed in various mafia games throughout the interwebs is that scum, more specifically newer scum, tend to want to make sure that everyone knows why they are doing what they are doing, so that they won't get suspected for it. Your [Acro's] statement seems to fall in line with that.</div></blockquote><br>I find this argument plausible.<br><br>In conclusion, my vote isn't doing much on Beck, and it looks like Acro might need a few votes on him before he decides to contribute. I'm less concerned by the fact that he's not voting than the fact that he's not voting OR contributing much in other ways. This is troubling to me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Acronach</span>"}

Claiming RVS still applied by post 24, though, is a bit much. Criticising Ivan for putting\u2026 conviction into early posts is rank hypocrisy. Voting Acro for not posting a random vote is just as wrong of you as it was in ConfidAnon, though maybe less suspicious - you're doing a good job of convincing me that you really do hold the (mistaken) belief that everyone should always have their vote on someone.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Captain Spoon wrote:</cite>voting is the town's greatest weapon<br><br>Not voting is nearly always anti-town.

I don't vote for someone unless I want to see them dead. Pressure can be applied through analysis, interrogation, discussion, argument.<br><br>ConfidAnon's position on Acronach seems to be subtly shifting (as SleepyKrew has noticed). Compare these two:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ConfidAnon wrote:</cite>Vote: Acronach<br><br>Why hold your vote because we're out of the RVS?

Was it holding his vote, or what he said about it? If it was what he said about it, why didn't you say that in the first place?<br><br>I like subgenius's point that Acronach has been posting a lot but not providing much content, though I'm also interested in the speed of the resulting wagon.<br><br>SleepyKrew, could you summarise your case against Captain Spoon?"}

I agree with going for the wall post with spoiler tags. Also, I'd like to point out that your entire premise of scum hunting seems to be \"I don't like this, + scum points\".

There really is no black and white line where you can say \"post 56 is RVS and post 57 is out of RVS\" unless some very significant post caused the change. It is generally a gradual thing that happens over the course of the first 2-5 pages. We happened to be a 2 page game. I can say with confidence that page 3 contains a lot of non-RVS content.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Sleepy wrote:</cite>Acro is a VI.

I did, however, also get confused by one of his statements to jump to the same conclusion that you did.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Spoon wrote:</cite>scum need pressure to slip<br><br>this is basic mafia<br></div></blockquote><br>While I think pressure is a great way to induce scum slips, I disagree that they need pressure to slip. Scum makes bad votes, bad cases, lousy bus attempts, and get themselves outed in VCA all the time. I don't think town NEEDS to be voting at all times in order to catch scum. That being said, if someone isn't trying to find scum, then they probably aren't playing with a town motivation, which probably means they aren't town.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Tommy wrote:</cite>This sounds like an admission of dishonesty, but I've had to get used to people playing weirdly in the early game, so on its own this doesn't damn you.<br></div></blockquote><br>I do the exact same thing in virtually every game I play in, town OR scum.

I feel like Spoon was more justified in his vote than Sleepy was, but I'm seeing town motivation behind some of Sleepy's posting as well.<br><br>I do not like at all how Yank seems to have disappeared off the radar as soon as pressure on him let up. All you've done lately is complain that Ivan is charging a bandwagon on you, which by the way never got anywhere near lynching, and tried to redirect attention off of you. It just feels like scum play to me."}

Though I'm curious as to why you qualified your original statement with \"since the RVS is over,\" your logic for not voting is sound.<br><br>However, what originally drove me to vote, was the fact that you made the statement in the first place.  As we both agree, the logic is simple - to the extent that I doubt anyone would suspect you for not voting (again, not what I've ever suspected you for).  Why bother to tell us such an obvious fact?  A trait I've noticed in various mafia games throughout the interwebs is that scum, more specifically newer scum, tend to want to make sure that everyone knows why they are doing what they are doing, so that they won't get suspected for it.

However, when sleepy said 'I wanted to give him (Acro) a chance. If he gives a shitty response, then make room for me on the bandwagon' there's just something about that, after defending him, and wanting to give him a chance, then you would easily jump on a bandwagon if he gave a bad response, why would a bad response about not-voting around rvs, after just defending him over it, cause you to jump on a bandwagon on him. (if you are scum partners) then this seems that you were protecting him then if he couldn\u2019t respond well enough himself to follow on you would distance yourself in case suspicion continued as its better for one to go down than two. A bad response doesn\u2019t seem much to make you jump on a bandwagon, you relationship with him seemed to change to quick as if he was in danger and you had to get away from it as well.<br><br>Then about the Acro being a vi stuff. Firstly, it didn\u2019t really think any of the vi stuff was necessary to know as it originated from a previous game mostly. Then with Sleepy defending Acro for being vi, by saying Acro's a vi and defending it, it seems like he's trying to help Acro get past any suspicion by saying it\u2019s just bad play, he\u2019s a vi. Sleepy seems to be deflecting any votes away from Acro through the vi excuse. Sleepy\u2019s using the vi as a shield for Acro.<br><br>Atm, out of anyone im leaning towards SK as scum, his defence of acro about the no-vote then leading to him distancing himself then once again he's defending Acro for being a vi, by saying acro's a vi. SK seems to be deflecting any votes away from acro through the vi excuse. Sleepy just seems to be protecting acro a bit too much. <br><br>However, then only reason I\u2019m not voting yet is like beck pointed out, its weird there defending each other, if they were to be scum, its throwing themselves out there too much so I\u2019m not sure for a vote just yet."}

For a bus to work properly, it can't be planned.

I find myself nodding along with sub's 224, as it echos a lot of my thoughts.<br><br>I liked Ivan's attack on Yank initially, but it seemed for weak reasons. It was also quite vocal, and seems to have died off. Ivan, what is your current opinion of Yank?<br><br>PAGE 10---------------------<br><blockquote><div><cite>Acronach wrote:</cite>it's not meant to be an example of us defending eachother, its meant to show you why sleepy is calling me a VI. obviously i'm not, but i'm showing you why he would have that impression.<br></div></blockquote><br>Something about this is really bugging me. He really does seem to be attempting to show people WHY Sleepy views Acro as a VI, which just doesn't sit well with me. Sleepy should be the one trying to provide evidence why he thinks Acro is a VI, not the other way around.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Acronach wrote:</cite>i know defending him makes us look like scumbuddies. although he may be scum, i'm not. sleepy is in no way clear, i am in no way clear. i would be happy to take one for the town and be the first lynch, but i hope it doesn't come to that.<br></div></blockquote><br>Holy cow there is no reason for town to ever say anything like this in the current situation, period. The only reason anyone would ever want to say this is an attempt to gain town credibility unnecessarily. Simply awful.<br><br>Subgenius continues to make goodposting. Definitely my most solid town read at the moment.<br><br>Definitely don't like Acronach's 233. He counters a \"this is WIFOM\" with something very rude, then continues his \"you must be a complete idiot\" trend.<br><br>Koolz didn't really take a single stance in his list, really. I didn't see any \"this guy looks suspicious\" or \"vote: ____\". He implies <span style=\"font-style: italic\">mild</span> suspicion on Yank, and possibly on Ivan, but nothing concrete. Definitely not liking this so far.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>I stand by my statement that Yank is the one deserving of pressure, and the Acro wagon seems like a counter wagon to distract from Yank.<br><br>Yank has done nothing useful<br>Yank is too concerned with how people think of him<br>Yank has fos'd 2 people (iirc) that have voted or FOS'd him first<br>plus his comment about me being a jester, instead of being scum is pretty damning as grey pointed out<br></div></blockquote><br>I definitely agree with this. Yank had some very mild pressure put on him, and reacted significantly. It really deserved more pressure, but that never happened.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Acronach wrote:</cite>kk, well any arguments you make about the VI thing are irrevelant. deal with it. <br></div></blockquote><br>No. They aren't. And he stated why. Deal with it.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Acronach wrote:</cite>if im town and SK is maf, why would he defend me? if SK is town and im maf, why would i defend him? using this logic, it's extremely unlikely that we have opposing alignments. not impossable, but unlikely. <br></div></blockquote><br>Scum defends town so that town thinks scum is town. It is called buddying.<br><blockquote><div><cite>rblinker wrote:</cite>However, then only reason I\u2019m not voting yet is like beck pointed out, its weird there defending each other, if they were to be scum, its throwing themselves out there too much so I\u2019m not sure for a vote just yet.<br></div></blockquote><br>So you instead prefer to talk about what is going on instead of really calling anyone out for anything, and refusing to put a vote down. How, exactly, do you intend to find scum? Are you waiting for someone else to do it? If you're town, how do you know that someone else is town?<br><br>PAGE 11----------------<br>Beck's 252 is essentially why I'm still voting for Yank, as in addition the points I made early in the game still apply.<br><br>Tommy's 256 makes a good point. Acronach is definitely high on my suspects list.<br><br>Wow Sleepy, definitely not impressed by your play at all. I'm having a harder and harder time finding legitimate scum hunting coming from you.<br><br>Not much on page 12 so far.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS-------------------<span class=\"noboldsig\">(Must read if you skipped everything else)</span><br>My 3 strongest scum reads right now are Yank, Sleepy, and Acro in no particular order. I currently feel like the most can be achieved with my vote where it currently is, on Yank. I'm holding reservations for Spoon, Ivan, and Koolz, but these players are not preferred lynches, whereas the others are. I'm not impressed by rblinker's play so far, or how much Greymarble is lurking, considering it is a hydra account. They are nullish reads though. I'm not in any way open to a day 1 lynch of the rest of the players."}

It seems unlikely that head #1 would make a decision while head #2 would make the post, so it seems likely that they're lying. The only reason they're not higher on my scum list is that I can't come up with a good scum motivation for lying about what seems to me to be a fairly minor detail. I'm willing to believe that Archae forgot about the Acro vote. Mostly I simply dislike that this is coming up as an issue at all. Get your acts straight.

I didn't believe he had a reason that it was better to withhold his vote after the RVS had ended as opposed to during the RVS.

The original post contains a whopping zero solid reasons for voting Ivan.  It throws around some buzz words and phrases, like \"gut read,\" \"rubbing the wrong way,\" \"opportunistic,\" but does nothing to explain what exactly is scummy.  Why is the logic bad?   He did try to qualify the vote with already having a \"minor scumread\" on Ivan, but when asked about it, it amounted to absolutely nothing.  Gut reads are fine, but you need to have evidence to back them up.<br><br>This has been Acronach's only vote so far this game, if I'm not mistaken.  You claim to be waiting for concrete reasons to vote . . . yet after you are pressured for not voting, you make a vote based on what appears to be absolutely nothing.

Sure, I don't give seven or eight posts a day, but I put everything I have to contribute into one or two longer, thought-out posts.

I can't believe we're still having this argument.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Acro wrote:</cite>so why do you just assume it's irrelevant? and i'd like an answer that isn't \"i don't care\" or anything similar to that. </div></blockquote><br>SK is on my suspect list because he was defending you early in the game in a way that I and some other players consider excessive. These defenses are well documented, and they aren't limited to him calling you a VI. The possible scum motivations of a scum player going out of his way to defend town early in the game have been explained, and the possible scum motivation to defend scum should not have to be explained. You are repeatedly trying to force me to read evidence that proves SK had a good evidence for calling you a VI, and maybe he does, but no matter how good his evidence is, it does not absolve him from mounting a suspiciously vigorous and early defense of you. He could be completely right about you acting like a VI in the previous game, but that would not explain why he felt compelled to try to excuse your actions in this game.<br><br>I don't know how to explain it any more clearly than that. How you acted in the previous game simply has no bearing on my thoughts about SK's actions in this game, particularly since his defenses of you weren't limited to him calling you a VI. I believe you when you say SK has reasons for calling you a VI. It just doesn't change anything about my case, which is about his choice to defend you not his choice of how to defend you.<br><br>And one last thing:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Acro wrote:</cite>and a big part of the mutual defense is the VI thing. why ignore it?</div></blockquote><br>I've explained why the specifics of the evidence leading to the VI charge are not that important as far as SK is concerned. I've said in the past that I thought it was strange that you would corroborate SK's VI charge, but I don't count that much as a defense, since as I've said, it's not related to my suspicions of him. You were merely providing information, which is fine, although strange, given the situation.<br><br>This, on the other hand, is where you are defending SK:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Acro wrote:</cite>honestly, i can see where hes coming from in both cases as far as the defending me is concerned, and that was more of a \"voting vs. not voting\" debate rather than a \"lynch acro or dont lynch him\" debate. i don't think he was defending me, but rather he was defending the idea that voting when you don't have a strong FOS on anyone in particular is anti-town. </div></blockquote><br>Because this actually addresses the case against SK. You're claiming he wasn't actually defending you, which more directly strikes at the case against him. It's also false, as I pointed out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3163699#p3163699\" class=\"postlink\">232</a>. You never did respond to this, and we've been running in circles about the old game you linked ever since. The above quote is where your half of the mutual defense really comes into play, and you still haven't addressed my rebuttal of it."}

You all want to lynch Yank, which is cute and all, and you go right ahead. However, I find Subgenius to be a better option. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>This is my 2nd game on site so no but if you have been playing here since 2008, so I'm taking an assumption you are a good player</div></blockquote><br>Unfortunately, I've only played four games since I joined, and I've been on the winning team in exactly none of them, so I'm not sure your assumption is a good one.<br><br>Yank isn't looking too hot right now. Between his equivocal opinion on Beck and now his lame defense against Ivan, which consists of little more than an accusation of twisting words, I'm not seeing much from him. It's only the second page, but I've got a bad feeling about Yank.<br><br>Also:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Yank wrote:</cite>You're voting for me because you guys are able to twist words? That's convenient.</div></blockquote><br>\"That's convenient\" seems to imply that you think Ivan is up to something shady. Do you think he's purposely trying to twist your words because he's scum, or are you merely trying to avoid answering his accusations?</div></blockquote><br><br>This post, followed by this one:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>YankCane151 wrote:</cite>What defense? Ivan pretty much said he's keeping his conclusions to himself, and still hasn't stated a case against me other than me saying \"At the Same time.\" So yes, it feels to me that he could be opportunistic scum. I can't have a lame defense if I don't know what I'm defending myself from, and I'm not going to sit here and defend my word choice. What I said regarding the jester is exactly what I thought(Didn't know they weren't in normal formats), that Beck may have been trying to hard for a lynch. I don't see how I'm 'evenhanded', and I thought what Beck was saying early game was anti-town and weird. Past that, I don't see your case.</div></blockquote><br><br>You gave Beck a pass on his first post, because you thought he was potentially a jester. Now that you know that is impossible, what do you think of his first post?</div></blockquote><br><br>strike me as very odd. He is clearly building suspicion of Yank, yet he is clinging to his random vote. There are two things that bother me here. The first is that he would maintain his random vote rather than applying pressure. If he is scum it is most likely because he doesn't feel under any pressure to change his vote, and he wants to generally go with the flow. Does that sound like Subgenius so far? I think so. If he is town, then he is asking questions and trying very hard to look town, but doing this without using his vote. These things are in conflict, therefore I find it unlikely that he is town. For those who will ask, I believe he is trying to look town based on the leading yet pleasant quality of his questions. They do not have the teeth of pressure or the certainty of suspicion. They are too nice. Scum are generally very nice people, and honestly I couldn't see Subgenius-scum playing any other way. <br><br>I will post more later."}

What's your read on Yank right now?</div></blockquote><br><br>Pretty null.  His dubious comments from earlier in the thread are offset by his newbish flailing.  It doesn't strike me as particularly scum-motivated to change your read of a wagon from scum-fueled to having town on it after one more person joins it.  I read the situation more as him just using commonly posted wording in blatant AtE.  Now there's more of a case for Yank scum looking at how he seems to have gotten quieter after his name was joined by others under the spotlight, but I don't think that's enough for a lynch.  Especially when I look at my points on Acro.<br><br>I don't think the (mis)lynch justification point conflicts at all, really, although strictly using the term mislynch does.  Either way, saying something like \"either way we'll learn a lot\" is an attempt to add weight to an argument without adding content - kind of used to muscle a lynch through without building a more substantial case.  If they are both scum, it could be an attempt to push through a bus without having to draw more attention to the case.  If SK is scum and Yank is town, well, the point makes itself.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>As much as I hate this whole confusion thing with Ivan, yank is still the better subject. His silence since Ivan switched off him just proves to me we have hit scum. </div></blockquote><br><br>How do you feel yank compares to acro?  I see similar cases built for both (less-than-professional scum play), but I have more trouble finding the scum motivation for Yank than I do for Acro.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>YankCane151 wrote:</cite>unvote, Vote: Greymarble <br><br>Ivan's been giving me town reads, Grey has had 3 posts and really hasn't said much of substance.</div></blockquote><br><br>This just made the Yank case a hell of a lot stronger, but I'd still like to answer the above question, Beck, from your pre-362 thoughts.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>YankCane151 wrote:</cite>Didn't address the rest of my post, but okay...<br><br>I'm a mason. I have two partners but I will not out them nor do I expect them to out themselves (And no, making me out my partners is not pro-town, it's role-fishing and a scum tactic). I will tell you that FOR SURE, Beck, Ivan, Acro, ICE, Greymarble, and Sleepy are NOT masons. If you want to lynch me now and find out for sure, then fine, but that should clear at least a bit up. I still think for sure that there are at least two scum on my wagon (I don't know how many there are, though) and regardless of whether I die now when someone hammers or to a NK, All the people who have jumped on me right now should be looked at. Greymarble is giving me a huge scumread because he has lurked all game like I did and basically brought up no case and just pushing for the biggest bunch lynch. I think he's the biggest priority for a lynch right now.<br><br>I got really frustrated on the first handful of pages at the total strawmanning and overreactions on me. It was uncalled for, and I'm 100% sure scum are a part of it because the cases aren't even town-sounding, it's just 'Let's hop on the nearest bandwagon.' I think Ivan may have been mistaken but he ended up helping out because he's brought scum candidates to life by starting my wagon... <br><br>If I'm lynched now, Greymarble, Acro, and Beck need to be strung up in the preceding days, no way around it, they're just opportunistic scum(At least 2 of 3 of them), I can tell just by the vibe I get.<br><br>Again, Don't ask me to out my mason partners, I refuse to do so, and chances are I'll call you scum for wanting to.</div></blockquote><br><br>Translation:  \"I'm not a Mason.  Not gonna reveal my partners, but I'll eliminate half the game from the potential Mason list.  Not gonna reveal though.\"<br><br>Fail.  <br><br>This claim . . . really doesn't claim much.  However, looking at it from a lie:  I don't see Yankscum making this claim without having first brought it up with his scumteam.  And I don't see any sane scumteam approving such a daring lie.  This lie, if they supported it, would implicate all three of them, especially if a real mason group existed in the setup.  Yank as a rogue scum just doing his own thing without the other two helping doesn't feel right to me either.  The chance of this being a lie doesn't seem near as likely as him telling the truth.  Yank's not the lynch today.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Acronach wrote:</cite>&gt;people believing the mason claim (facepalm)<br>&gt;SK replacing out (double facepalm)<br><br>well, looks like we're not lynching yank for some reason even though if he is maf in stead of mason we just let the most obvious fucking maf get away with being scummy as hell. <br><br>unvote vote ivan<br><br>was voting ivan before and i like this wagon more than any other ATM except yank, which apparantly isnt happening -.-</div></blockquote><br><br>So, unless I've missed a huge new original update in your reasoning, you're going back to voting Ivan for . . . . nothing.  I'm still confident that Acronach is a good lynch right now."}

There are three parts to it. The first part is the fact that Acronach and SleepyKrew have been defending each other, as subgenius summarised in posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3163699#p3163699\" class=\"postlink\">232</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3169696#p3169696\" class=\"postlink\">351</a>.

The third part is Acronach's consistent avoidance of my questions about post 188."}

There are reasons for people to post things like that, it's called reaction testing. Ignoring the comment all together can be quite telling, because a townie who is interested in scum hunting would be questioning it. Acro knew it was a reaction test and decided to leave it alone.<br><br>2. while this isn't much, it's something that seemed odd to me because I think Ivan is scum. In one of Acro's posts, he refers to twistedspoon and archaebob, not Captain Spoon and Ivan, why not refer to their in-game names?<br><br>3. Like stated earlier, SK defends Arco very early on and continues to do so most of the game, Acro defends SK in return and even tries to prove what SK is referring to. I can't talk about the game right now cause even though I am dead, it is still on going, but people are calling me a VI. I know I am not a VI, I will never be ok with being called a VI so if somebody referred to me as a VI, I would never go and support that person's claim. Again not really a scum tell, but just doesn't make sense if he is genuinely town.<br><br>4. Earlier in the game I had some suspicions on Captain Spoon and I voted him, Acro defends CS by calling twistedspoon a vi and basically calling him the worse player in the game.  I believe I was the only person voting for CS at the time (maybe 1 other person was, idk) so there was absolutely no need to defend him<br><br>5. looking over Acro's games, the one where he was scum and the one where he was town doctor.<br><br>the one where he was scum, he made at least 1 if not 2 posts similar to what he did this game, and that was a list of reads where he had everyone broken down. I don't recall seeing that in the game where he was the town doctor. Also in the game where he was town doctor, he was much more agressive in his scum hunting, where I feel in this game he has not really done anything except defending himself.<br><br>6. he makes a post that says tomorrow Ivan needs to go no matter what, and in his last \"reads\" post his suspicions of ivan are<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>scum<br>Ivan the Pleasant - needs to stop vote-hopping, needs to stop voting without proper explaination, heads need to learn to communicate, at least one of the heads should be posting more than just simple stuff, and he needs to reply to beck's questions. </div></blockquote><br><br>a. vote hopping isn't a scum tell, if anything I read it as more of a null/town tell cause vote hopping draws attention to yourself<br>b. while I disagree with who he is voting for half the time, I do feel that Ivan at least explains his reasonings for each of his votes<br>c. what does communication with his heads have to do with a person being scum or not<br>d. pot calling the kettle black?<br><br>final point, acro stays on Ivan the entire game until Yank is at L-2, yank says he won't claim unless he is at L-1 so acro votes him to put him at L-1. going through all of acro's posts, his only suspicion of yank comes from points that Ice has made, no where does he provides his own reads on yank, so putting him at L-1 without giving his own reasons for why he is scum, by his own definition shoudl mean he is scum, I mean if Ivan is scum because he didn't provide reasons, than Acro has to be too right?<br><br>And acro's reaction to the claim and insistance that he should be lynched regardless is really odd because like I said, he never provided his own reasons why yank was scum other than everything Ice said in his post #50<br><br>I'd like Acro to answer my previous questions and respond to this wall of text before I do anything, but I think I may be voting for Acro pretty soon."}

In this case, it is absolutely inevitable that he will be cleared before lylo by 1 of 2 things: his own death and flip of mason, or a mason buddy's flip who can vouch for him. At some point, day 3 is usually a good time, the mason team will claim and clear Yank, giving us a ridiculously small poor of possible scum to lynch from.<br><br>2)Yank is lying scum and there is a mason team present in town. In this case, at some point one of the town masons will come forward saying \"I am a town mason, and Yank is not in our mason team, lynch the lying scum!\" and we lynch Yank. Town masons absolutely need to do this by day 3, day 2 would be preferable. Day 2 is absolutely required if only a single mason pair is left alive, as if we have a 2 man mason team that dies before outing Yank he could be incorrectly cleared as town.<br><br>3)Yank is lying scum and there is no mason team present in town. In this case, Yank's scum buddies can obviously not clear him as mason as they would out the entire scum team and give town a 100% victory. Yank stays alive night after night with no one to vouch for him and by day 3 or so it becomes crystal clear that he's lying scum and we lynch him. Gain for town.<br><br>4)Yank is lying town. I wouldn't normally include this, but I've played with too many fucking idiots who claim a power role as VT. If this is the case, Yank needs to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">immediately</span> retract his claim, and admit to being a VT, as VTs claiming power role literally wins games for scum.<br><br>Hopefully there is no situation I've missed, or variation that is negative for town.

The reason I was so hesitant to change my vote was because I strongly wanted to lynch Acro, but it seemed like the wagon and the day had stalled (it turns out this was because the hammer had already been dropped). I wasn't sure what else I could do to move the acro wagon forward. I really thought that Grey deserved some pressure, and I didn't want to sit around hoping for a last Acro vote to trickle in before the deadline without doing anything else. So, I figured I'd start digging in a new direction. I was quite concerned that the Acro wagon would never regain momentum, which is why I seemed so reluctant to change my vote."}

So most of it disappeared when Acronach's alignment was revealed. There's still the fact that SleepyKrew was defending Acronach, and now I read back I see that I had it the wrong way around in my head - I thought that it was mainly Acronach defending SleepyKrew. But I don't really see how it would be in scum's interest to buddy up with a scummy-looking town player.

Unfortunately they're almost all useless. Here's a simplified rundown on his reads on everyone:<br>Sleepy - town, for meta reasons.<br>Beck - lurker but not scummy/third party.<br>Spoon - leaning town, but slightly scummy.<br>Ivan - no actual read, just a strange comment.<br>Me - too quiet to read (fair enough, at that point in the game).<br>Rblinker - lurker with reasoned posting, but wait it's just mafia discussion.<br>Tommy - a lot of weird comments that involves no read.<br>Yank - \"something fishy going on\".<br>Acro - the only true scum read given by Koolzzy's post.<br>Confid - lurker, no read.<br><br>All I see are a lot of weak opinions, statements that don't really make sense or contribute, and little or no direction.

While it is definitely a good policy to not answer questions directed at others, what Spoon did wasn't exactly scummy. The vehemence with which the vote was placed simply doesn't track with the reason for voting, which leads me to believe that he was looking for a place to park his vote without actually having scum hunted much.<br><br>Then he does the weird \"wait don't hammer yet!\" then tries to hammer Yank in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3171860#p3171860\" class=\"postlink\">post 386</a>. He seems to have a good case, but hardly even addresses the mason claim. It really looks like an attempt to look town while having hammered a mason.<br><br>The rest of the day he doesn't really do anything else. As Tommy pointed out earlier in the page, Koolzzy advocates then backtracks on policy lynching.<br><br>That all being said, head #2 seems to have just popped in and is promising some content. I've decided that ultimately I'll hold off on any Koolzzy votes until after this promised content. If I don't see the content coming, or the content provided isn't solid scum hunting, I'll definitely move forward on voting here."}

Unlike those players, though, he's also posting scum lists without backing them up. Hard to know what to make of this, because it's pretty obviously bad play as scum or town.

If you are town, and you are lurking or not contributing, PLEASE come back and start putting some heat on someone. We're stalling out here, and a big part of the reason is that we have so many lurkers that we don't have enough active players to simultaneously pressure the lurkers and keep the game moving along.

Your premise is fine, but your conclusion is strange. Essentially you're saying that SleepyKrew has scum motivation to defend Achro, so either scum Sleepykrew is buddying town achro, or scum SleepyKrew is defending his partner. Achro seems like an unlikely townie to be buddied, especially if SleepyKrew thinks he's a VI. On top of that, calling him a VI defeats the buddying as no one particularly likes being called stupid. And if he's right and achro really is a VI, then he won't be a very useful pawn anyway.<br><br>Therefore we should assume that SleepyKrew is not scum buddying a townie. That means that you assume he is scum defending his scumbuddy. If that is the case, then Achro must be scum for this to hold true. Therefore, if you actually place store in this you should be trying to lynch achro first. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite>Nothing is wrong with defending a VI town read from being lynched, but that is in no way what Sleepy was doing.<br>First, Acro was not anywhere near a lynch, he was simply under a small amount of pressure.<br>Second, I haven't seen Sleepy argue anywhere that he actually has a town read on Acro. He was only pointing out Acro's meta as a VI, which is utterly irrelevant to his alignment in this game.<br><br>I'm changing my vote. There's something fishy going on with Sleepy and Acro, and Sleepy is the far fishier of the two.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote<br>vote: Sleepy</span></div></blockquote><br><br>This is where you vote Sleepykrew, and it implies the same thing. Your argument requires achro to be scum therefore you should be voting achro if you actually believe what you're saying. You aren't, therefore you don't. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: Subgenius.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>First of all, this was never answered satisfactorily.

He reminds me of myself in my first game after a long hiatus, in which I was subjected to some early pressure. GreyICE (of GreyMarble) was in that game, and might recall it.

I have no idea why he hasn't been lynched. It's difficult for me to articulate but I just don't get a sense that he WANTS to find scum. For instance, just look at the amount of times he's made a serious vote. Once. He writes plenty, and I'm sure it looks like he's an active contributor, but he's not. And that's the thing.

However, whilst I have some suspicion over Beck's joke, I think we should be precautious with voting as it\u2019s a little earlier.</div></blockquote><br><br>Serious suspicion is clearly less important than RVS voting for blinker. He's worried about voting but he does it anyway just for the sake of participating? &lt;--- Scum blending in.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also about Captains statement about no-voting is anti-town, I disagree as I don't necessarily agree that not voting is anti-town, you can still help the town by pushing and pressuring other players without votes. Other people have votes on other players and then someone else can develop on that without a vote. Also unnecessary votes can easily start and bandwagon over something little and therefore could go against town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Translation. Hello. I don't like voting, because it makes me accountable for my actions. I like to silently echo others sentiments. Sure, I've listed PLENTY of reasonable things you can do in absence of voting, but I don't really do them. No, what I want to do is wait for when it's SAFE to vote. <br><br>PS. Being over cautious is also a scum tell.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Ivan: Although, it is useful to vote and pressure it is not essential to vote to pressure players there\u2019s other ways.

Essentialy, the most concrete thing he says is \"I'm leaning scum on Sleepy.\" coupled with a bit of passive aggression. And some more game theory about not voting.<br><br>--My problem is nothing here is concrete. He says it's weird that they'd be defending each other and putting themselves out so much if they're scum.

It's not waiting for someone else to find it, it\u2019s simply I felt i wasnt ready to put down a vote on sleepy, there wasn\u2019t enough suspicion and if Sleepy continues to do suspicious stuff then I\u2019ll stick a vote down.</div></blockquote><br><br>Woah Kay.

Then some stuff about whether Spoon wants to lynch him or not.<br><br>Iso #9: Kay. He finally gets the balls to vote. Took him nearly 500 posts however. Anyway, this is a horribly opportunistic vote. Refer back to the bit I mentioned \"I want to vote when it's safe to bandwagon\". <br><br>Iso #12: More passive aggression towards being called scum by Ivan.<br><br>Iso #13: Suspicion of Grey. This is just going after an easy target. iirc all his suspects at this point consist of Sleepy/Acron/Llamarble. The former two were prime time suspects and the latter is suspected for his hammer. <br><br>Iso #16: More passive aggression. Come on. <br><br>Iso #18: Oh gods more over caution. Fun Fact. In this post he claims that everyone should pressure Kool because they've done little. But he doesn't do so in this post. Or his next posts. Weee. Btw. Interaction with Ivan is weird as hell.<br><br>Lets put this into perspective. Ivan wants to KILL blinker. Then blinker says, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Well monsieur, if you shall allow, I have, erm, a word of advice, I shall like to deliver to you. </span>\"Proceeds to lecture Ivan about being organized\"<br><br>The fuck? blinker's desperate to avoid conflict with Ivan.<br><br>Iso #19: Wee lurker lynch. Easy lynch. Yay! <br><br>----So, let me try to sum this up.<br><br>We've got the horrible obsession with not voting, because he's scum who doesn't know WHEN to vote. He's blatantly just here to blend in (See 1st post/later suspicions), and his choice of scum suspects is opportunistic. (See voting/timing of when he voices his opinions) Then we've got the passive aggression, (early interactions with sleepy and Ivan) trying not be accountable ect (lack of voting till the time is right).<br><br>So. To anyone who disagrees, I would like concrete reasons as to why blinker isn't the villain I say he is.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: blinker</span><br><br>More votes please."}

Ivan's other points on subgenius look so thin as to suggest he's had to put the case together now, retrospectively.<br><br>Welcome, Magic Trainer. I like your case on rblinker. He's certainly cautious and hasn't been contributing much, and those are mild scum-reads. If there weren't better options, I'd be happy with an rblinker lynch.

They never really seem to give much thought that it could be true instead voted to still lynch Yank. Also, although i know i havent been the most active player in the game, Da Kools have been quite inactive, and given the fact that their a hydra you'd expect more content from them saying as its two people playing. I think there more avoiding content and questions and staying under the radar than generally being away from the game. However, although i have them leaning scum, now looking back Da Koolz wasnt in Yanks list of definatly not mason, i know it doesnt clear them as being scum or means there mason, but i think we should be careful incase they are mason, and so instead this round go with Jilys lynch. <br><br>As from Tommy, i dont really have anything on him, I wouldnt really say he has raised any suspicion for me and so Im leaning more town/null."}

As I said in an earlier post, I'd prefer to avoid lynching a lurker simply because we can't come up with another suspect. I'm all for putting serious pressure on Jilynne and Dakoolzy, but primarily in the hopes that they'll contribute. If they don't, I'm fine with lynching either one. My problem with the plan is that you seem to be making the lynch of a lurker a forgone conclusion for today, and I'm not sure that's the best plan. You seem to be confident that the wagons that form will be informative, but I'm not so sure. I can think of scenarios where such information would be useful, but I'm not sure any of them are consistent with our actual situation. Therefor, I'm reluctant to blindly follow along without there being more traditional scum hunting methods going on as well. I'm afraid we'll enter Day 3 (which will likely be LYLO if we mislynch) with a serious lack of information if we follow your plan and it doesn't pan out like you expect. I don't think either Jilynne or Dakoolzy are bad lynches necessarily (I'm quite suspicious of both of them), but I'd rather not head straight for a lurker lynch when there's still a lot of time before the deadline.<br><br>Also, I still would like to hear how Ivan ended up on your town list. In my opinion he has contributed very little, especially during the current day. He hasn't exhibited much interest in making cases, and when he finally did make a case, it was largely a rehash of one of his cases from yesterday which he never followed up on despite claiming the response to the case was inadequate, and now he still isn't following up on his case. The whole thing seems phony to me. I'm all for pressuring lurkers, but I think Ivan is one of the scummiest people that has actually been posting anything."}

His most fully developed case is the one against me, which is all based on old info. He first presented it in D1, and never responded to my defense. Then today, when he was again asked to present a case, he more or less reposted his original case and claimed that my response was not satisfactory. If this was the case, and if he really thought I was scum, I would expect him to both continue pressuring me and point out my failures in an attempt to get others to lynch me. He did neither, which leads me to believe he neither believes in his case nor wishes to lynch scum. Other than this, I find his sarcastic attitude quite anti-town, though not necessarily scummy. <br><br>Last point is that after reading <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=18170\" class=\"postlink\">this thread he posted in Mafia Discussion</a>, which I mostly agree with, I don't see how he implemented his town mindset into day 1 play.

I realize that hopping off the Jily wagon will raise some eyebrows, but even though I think she's scummy, I'm nowhere near sure enough to lynch her without trying to stir up more leads for D3. The problem is that I think most of the evidence against her is from Sleepy's D1 actions. She has done nothing to redeem her player slot, and she's hardcore lurking, but I feel like we're skipping the information gathering stage of D2 if we go ahead and lynch someone based on D1 info without first trying to generate more information. Jily is fully deserving of a lynch, but we're cheating ourselves if we do it right this minute. I know this looks like I'm defending her, but I'm just trying to suggest the course of action I think is most beneficial for town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rblinker wrote:</cite>were not really guna get a lynch on someone being replaced anyway.</div></blockquote><br>I don't agree with this, we've practically settled on Jily within a week of her replacing in, why couldn't we do it with Koolzzy?

I feel like it's strong enough to at least consider seriously. At the core of the case is the simple point that I don't get the impression that Ivan has much interest in lynching scum. He's alluded to scum reads here and there but hasn't done much to pursue them or demonstrate that he sincerely believes his scum lists. I would also suggest reading Archaebob's thread in Mafia Discussion, because his idea of how a townie should act does not at all resemble how Ivan has acted.<br><br>Also, I don't see how you can think that Ivan has been helpful. He didn't actually provide anything substantive today until I had asked him several times (to which his first response was a veiled threat), and when he did post a case, it was a rehash of what he already had from yesterday. If I hadn't asked him to back up his scum list, I have little doubt that he would still be voting for Tommy with nothing but a one line explanation about how he agreed with Llama's case.  Instead, he's now voting for me apparently partly as retaliation for actually demanding that he do something. <br><br>He's not doing anything without being provoked, and then when he does do something, he gives no evidence that he is still actively looking for scum. The guy is absolutely not helping. He's not even being the brash and aggressive scummy type player that I'm guessing you're frequently accused of being.

Well, I had to pull up his ISO to even remember what he had posted, and that's because he's made four posts with no information except that he doesn't want to vote yet. His only questions to others have been about Beck's previous mafia experience and a request for clarification from confid about his vote, which seems like a defensive move rather than an attempt to put pressure on Confid. In short, he's posting, but has avoided voting or letting any opinions be known. I can excuse a refusal to vote if a player compensates by actively pressuring players through pointed questions and provides interesting analysis, but Acro is not doing this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sleepy wrote:</cite>You thinking Yank was scum until post 49.

Prior to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3158465#p3158465\" class=\"postlink\">Post 49</a>, I read Yank as fence sitting and hesitant to state firm opinions, which I consider scummy. In post 49, he came out of his shell a bit and took a firm stand. I don't think it was necessarily a good one, but I don't think it was a scummy one either. It looked like a jumpy newbie defense, which lessened my suspicions of Yank.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sleepy wrote:</cite>@CS<br>RVS is OVER. Acro did the right thing not slapping on a vote.<br>+5</div></blockquote><br>I find Sleepy's support of Acro's refusal to vote a bit strange.

I'm less concerned by the fact that he's not voting than the fact that he's not voting OR contributing much in other ways. This is troubling to me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Acronach</span></div></blockquote><br><br>You don't need to read all of this post as a lot of it is just responding to other people.  However, there is a general tone that needs to be taken into account. This is really a gut thing, so it will be difficult for me to articulate, however I will try.  He is much to reasonable.  He answers everything asked of him carefully in a way that won't spark any controversy.  He is quick to agree with other people's opinions, but has a few in mind that he won't agree with.  It all reads like play acting. <br><br>More tangibly, read the sentence where he actually votes achro. There is very little actual reasoning in it despite all the logical discussion regarding other issues above.  This is very basic scum mindset.  He is logical to appear town, but his vote is more offhanded in a way that prevents him from being held to that opinion.  Notice that he doesn't say \"Achro is scum,\" he says achro needs some pressure.  That allows him to very easily later say \"yes achro is scum, that's why I'm voting him. Duh,\" or to say \"No achro is town, I was just pressuring him but he seems ok now.\"  There is no way anyone could hold him to this vote.  Now his RVS vote follows the same patter.  At any point he could say \"Oh it was obviously a joke,\" or \"No, I think that was a real slip, or he was acting nervous.\"  Again, I'm less concerned about that one due to it being his first post. <br><br>3rd.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>SleepyKrew wrote:</cite>It is protown to not vote when you have no idea what to do.

Of course he'll do anti-town things.</div></blockquote><br>In the second quote, it looks like that you admit Acro was being anti-town, but dismiss it based on him being a VI. Now, you're saying that he was being pro-town despite being a VI. <br><br>Before that, you said that not voting was correct play based on RVS being over, but you didn't mention at all that this was correct only if you're a VI or that Acro is a VI.<br><br>Still, your only consistent position on Acro is that he shouldn't be exposed to pressure.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>@sub, if somebody thinks somebody is VI, what is wrong with that person defending the VI from being lynched (going under the assumption that the VI = town read)</div></blockquote><br>Nothing is wrong with defending a VI town read from being lynched, but that is in no way what Sleepy was doing.<br>First, Acro was not anywhere near a lynch, he was simply under a small amount of pressure.<br>Second, I haven't seen Sleepy argue anywhere that he actually has a town read on Acro. He was only pointing out Acro's meta as a VI, which is utterly irrelevant to his alignment in this game.<br><br>I'm changing my vote. There's something fishy going on with Sleepy and Acro, and Sleepy is the far fishier of the two.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Sleepy</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Look at his vote sentence again. They aren't scum, they're \"fishy.\" That means at any time he can make the same claim. \"I actually think they are scum,\" or \"No I was pressuring them, but I think they're probably town.\"  No one could possibly hold him to this vote either.  It is truly amazing how slippery he is with his wording. <br><br>4th.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Yank</span><br><br>Honestly, I expected him to disappear and be prodded out.

Also he qualifies this with \"I'm not sure I'm ready for the day to end,\" which means he can hop off the bandwagon whenever he feels like it. <br><br>5th<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>Alright, my opinion is that there are literally only scum motivations for lynching Yank right now. Even I were 90% sure Yank was scum today (which I consider a pretty high degree of certainty for a day 1 lynch) he'd still be a bad lynch today. If he's telling the truth, lynching him is a bad blow for a very powerful pro-town faction. If he's lying, he's already caught, and it's just a matter of time before he's lynched. There's no hurry. Therefor, Da Koolzy and Acro are both looking a bit scummier after their post claim support for Yank's wagon.

There is no conviction behind it, rather it is a \"good lynch,\" not a \"scum lynch,\" but a \"good lynch.\" Again this is slippery. He could very easily decide that this is \"not a good lynch.\"<br><br>His next vote is a mod correction, so I'm ignoring it. <br><br>6th<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>Ugh, fine. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Greymarble</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Really?<br><br>7th<br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>I'm a little surprised that scum decided to kill Yank, but his alignment isn't much of a surprise.

My primary concern is that if we lynch Jil or Dakoolzy, and they're not scum, we won't have an awful lot to show for this day. I think it's unwise to put all of our eggs in the scummy lurker hunting basket.<br><br>Also, since it looks like Da Koolzy is being replaced, I think it would be wise to wait to see what his replacement has to say. <br><br>In the meantime,<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Ivan</span><br><br>The case is that despite posting a fair amount, I don't feel that he has developed any authentic scum reads, and if he has, he doesn't seem terribly interested in making them stick. His most fully developed case is the one against me, which is all based on old info. He first presented it in D1, and never responded to my defense. Then today, when he was again asked to present a case, he more or less reposted his original case and claimed that my response was not satisfactory. If this was the case, and if he really thought I was scum, I would expect him to both continue pressuring me and point out my failures in an attempt to get others to lynch me. He did neither, which leads me to believe he neither believes in his case nor wishes to lynch scum. Other than this, I find his sarcastic attitude quite anti-town, though not necessarily scummy. <br><br>Last point is that after reading <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=18170\" class=\"postlink\">this thread he posted in Mafia Discussion</a>, which I mostly agree with, I don't see how he implemented his town mindset into day 1 play. Particularly:<br><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite>What I mean by \"town must look town\" is that you must reveal what your role is simply by being truthful. You aren't trying to \"look town\" as much as you are trying to share your true feelings with the town in a way that is helpful and productive. This means you want to play honestly, openly, and amicably</div></blockquote><br>Granted, Ivan is a hydra, and not all of the play has been archaebob's, but I find that a lot of Ivan's play has been the opposite of honest, open, amicable, helpful, and productive. The sarcasm, the reluctance to post cases, the inability to form a coherent opinion with his other head, none of these are consistent with what he, himself, has said a town player should be doing, which leads me to think that he is, in fact, scum.<br><br>If we get to the deadline, and no other cases are solidifying, I'll be happy to hammer Jily, but as it stands, I feel like the town is settling for the default lynch, which is ok as long as we do it while also simultaneously using our limited time trying to uncover and develop more reads, but I do not want to lynch a lurker with a week left before the deadline without digging around a bit more</div></blockquote><br><br>Here, finally after all this time, he votes us. Now he does actually post some serious suspicions, however notice that the part dealing with us starts with \"In the meantime,\" so I suppose we're expected to think that there is something else he plans to get to that will take precedence over voting us. <br><br>And that's it. Not once has he wholly committed to a vote. Not once has he not left himself with an out. Every single time he actually votes anyone he drowns it in qualifiers.  His entire attitude is to be pro-town, not to find scum.  That is a scum mind set."}

He answers everything asked of him carefully in a way that won't spark any controversy. He is quick to agree with other people's opinions, but has a few in mind that he won't agree with. It all reads like play acting. </div></blockquote><br>*shrug* I don't have a problem with being called too reasonable. I've agreed with what I agreed with and disagreed with what I disagree with. If you can show how any of my opinions are insincere or scum motivated, maybe this would be more persuasive.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>More tangibly, read the sentence where he actually votes achro. There is very little actual reasoning in it despite all the logical discussion regarding other issues above.</div></blockquote><br>Perhaps if you weren't skimming to drum up a case, you would have noticed that most of the reasoning for voting Acro is in the first paragraph of the post. I just didn't actually vote until the end.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>They aren't scum, they're \"fishy.\"</div></blockquote><br>One thing you'll find about me is that I very rarely call anyone scummy unless I'm convinced that there is no way to justify a town person doing what they're doing. Suspicious or fish or strange simply means something that doesn't quite make sense from my understanding of the game but might have a town explanation. Scummy is something that has no possible town excuse. I don't run in to things like that very often.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>rather it is a \"good lynch,\" not a \"scum lynch,\"</div></blockquote><br>Similar to above. I'd need to be 95% sure that someone was scum before I declared that we were going to have a scum lynch. Unfortunately, I'm almost never that sure, and anyone who claims to be that sure is generally delusional, lying, or a cop.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite> however notice that the part dealing with us starts with \"In the meantime,\" so I suppose we're expected to think that there is something else he plans to get to that will take precedence over voting us. </div></blockquote><br>You're acting as if I'm trying to be sneaky here. I straight out said that I would be happy to hammer Jillyne later, but I thought we were moving too fast and with too little discussion. Therefor, I decided to do something else. I'm still in the same frame of mind. I'll happily lynch Jilynne, but I'm quite glad that we haven't done it yet since we're seeing a surge in activity right now that might have been skipped over if we had simply settled on Jilynne.<br><br>Anyhow, you've thoroughly explained why you think I'm scum. It seems to rely primarily on word choice, which I've never found especially compelling, but at least you made a full case that didn't rely entirely on material from D1.<br><br>However, you still have three other suspects that you have said almost nothing about. What did you think of Magic's plan to wagon Jily and Dakoolzy? That plan had a chance of putting two of your suspects, Rblinker and Tommy, on the spot, but you never commented on it at all."}

The difference is when you read someone and assume town and read someone and assume scum, you can eventually get a sort of overall feel if it makes sense or not. For example, when I read Beck and assume scum, a lot of things don't make sense. He's been genuinely trying to find scum, and has remained fairly transparent of his opinions. This doesn't mean that Tommy is scum and Beck is not. There are other reasons that I believe Tommy has a lower likelihood of flipping scum than Beck. I'll explain.<br><br>I'm going to make a few assumptions right now:<br>1) Those who are on the confirmed not masons list have a higher chance of flipping scum.<br>-Beck, Ivan, Acro, Myself, Llamarble., jily.<br>2) Those who were on the wagon to lynch Acro have a slightly higher chance of flipping scum.<br>-Confid, Myself, CS, Beck, Subgenius, Rblinker, Llamarble.<br>3) Those who I have a scum read on have a higher chance of flipping scum.<br>-Jily, Llama, Tommy, to an extent Koolzzy's slot and Rblinker.<br><br>Of the first 2, unless I am mistaken there are 3 common names of myself, Beck, and Llama. Of all 3 assumptions, the only name that pops up every time is Llama. Beck has recently picked up a few scum points based on what I said in 766, so I'll put him on the consider for lynching, but ultimately my lynch preference is this:<br><br>Llama &gt; jily &gt; Beck. I do not really feel like town should be lynching anyone other than these 3 currently.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote Llamarble.</span><br><br>I've been waffling around for a while but now I feel pretty good about this."}

Honestly, the only thing I don't like his reluctance to explain himself, and walk in a straight line. If Tommy turns up scum I can easily see Ivan's play as blatant bussing. It works even better with both heads shooting in opposite directions. Consistently attack your buddies, but don't drive them over the edge. In the mean time, just piss around. Both hydra heads are competent players to realize their schizophrenic play is bad, which supports my bussing theory BECAUSE their schizophrenic play severely lowers their chance of actually driving a lynch through.<br><br>But I'd rather wait for a Tommy flip before considering Ivan for a lynch.

He leads on others suspicions, without putting himself out there. This is ideal scum play. Look like you're doing shit without actually doing it.</div></blockquote><br>I take as much responsibility for the Acronach wagon as the people who voted for it. I made it clear that he was my top suspect, and that I was holding off my vote until I could get some content out of Greymarble. I didn't want day 1 to end until I had at least some material from every player. In the end, Greymarble hammered before I had the chance to place my vote.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So, when I entered this game and stated Tommy one as of my scum reads, he ignored it. Completely.</div></blockquote><br>Yes. To explain your suspicion you pointed to a Greymarble post which I felt I'd addressed already. There didn't seem much to add except for 'Hey! Don't suspect me, I'm a goodie!' Which wouldn't have been much of a contribution.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hell, in my case against blinker I criticized blinker for voting Llamarble based on his hammer, this is the same reason Tommy was voting Llamarble. Yet he ignores THAT as well.</div></blockquote><br>Hmm. When you say you criticized him, I guess you must mean this paragraph:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Iso #13: Suspicion of Grey. This is just going after an easy target. iirc all his suspects at this point consist of Sleepy/Acron/Llamarble. The former two were prime time suspects and the latter is suspected for his hammer. </div></blockquote><br>You weren't really criticising all hammer-based votes so much as rblinker's sheeping (or that was my understanding). I had no problem with this as part of your larger picture of rblinker coasting. Llamarble was indeed an easy target, partly because I'd been leading the charge against him.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>EVEN when he was responding to my idea, he doesn't even bother to ask WHY I would ever suspect little ol him.</div></blockquote><br>Think I've already answered this bit. I knew why you suspected me, and I felt that I'd already addressed it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>even later on when I put him on the spot light, he doesn't bother to ask WHY I suspect him? Why? He was curious to know when Ivan asked, so why not ask me as well? (Because he's scum who doesn't care atm)</div></blockquote><br>Because I knew, because I knew, because I knew.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hell, take a look at this comment by Grey, who stated he knew 2/3 scum in X list. I said a similar thing, but no reaction to my accusation.</div></blockquote><br>Ah yes. Now, here you have a good point. Frankly, I felt a bit silly when I picked up Greymarble's one. This 'at least two of these five'-type talk is something I've always found weird, but it's so common on this site that it's hardly a scum tell. I did notice when you did it later, but I said to myself, 'Come on, you're not going to criticise that stuff twice in the same game, are you? People will just start thinking you're a dick.' You've correctly identified an inconsistency. I flagged one instance out of two, but I think I should have flagged neither.<br><br>Lasly, I have a question for you. On Ivan you say this:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I can easily relate to WHY he suspects certain people and understand his reasoning.</div></blockquote><br>What? Half his reads have no reasoning whatsoever! If you happen to know why they're there, could you enlighten the rest of us?"}

I still don't think it was a bad decision to delay the lynch, since the action really picked up in the second half of the day. The downside is that apparently I made an ass of myself during the extra time. Looking back over things, I'm starting to have trouble seeing how my own case makes sense, so it's probably time to back off. I still think there was something to the original issues I raised, and I'm going to be keeping a closer eye on Beck in particular, but in retrospect I pursued too aggressively and painted myself into a corner. Hopefully, it doesn't end up being a fatal error.<br><br>I think there's a good chance that Jilynne is scum, but I'm still not certain, which is largely why I suggested delaying the lynch in the first place. Nothing has changed about Jily since then, so my opinion about her hasn't changed too much. That being said, the deadline is here, and I'll hammer her as I promised if a replacement hasn't been found by tomorrow afternoon. My primary concern at this point is that if she's lynched and flips town, I'm probably next in line for lynching, which will quite likely cost the town the game. If she flips scum, I'm still probably next in line for lynching, but at least we'll have earned another day of play by lynching scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hammer incoming in 24 hours.</span>"}

Comments on the rest of the game will follow. I apologize for any mistakes or clumsy wording here, as I don't have time to preview and read through this post to insure the level of quality I usually prefer. It will have to do.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Llama wrote:</cite>I'm saying he's going through the motions. His reasoning is stock stuff like \"llama was on wagon. Llama isn't mason. Beck used classically bad \"too scummy to be scum.\"<br>Experienced players know that most lynches can be avoided by just giving reads with reasons and tossing in some 'appearing to care who gets lynched.'<br>The organic 'OH MAN this idea just struck me' sorts of things are much harder to replicate.<br></div></blockquote><br>As someone who has played with me before as town, you should know that my cases tend to be, well, fairly mechanical. I don't go off of gut reads, or else I'd be going after Tommy right now. I don't base my cases off of \"OH MAN this idea just struck me!\" sort of things, unless something truly brilliant indeed comes to mind. I admit my cases was more brief and less explained than usual, but that simply comes to having about one third of the free time I used to.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>I can't support a marble wagon because Ice is supporting a marble wagon and since I believe he has proven his ability to make good decision making sucks, I will not be on any wagon he is pushing. Not to mention I have not seen a really valid case for his lynch.<br></div></blockquote><br>My decision making sucks? Excuse me? That was an unprovoked attack on me and unless you can back that up with some serious basis, I don't appreciate this kind of comment at all. Plus using \"X player who isn't scummy is pushing a wagon\" as a reason to be against the wagon is a logical fallacy. I'm not sure which one it is, but it is one of them.<br><br>Page 34 has shot Beck up to the top of my scumlist. His recent posting has been so incredibly bad, I don't even feel like I need to make a case out of it at this point.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llama wrote:</cite>Acro was the best lynch I believed to be viable because the only other one under consideration was my own and my impression of the politics of the town was that I couldn't get a better one in the time remaining.<br>As town I only care about securing the best lynch.<br></div></blockquote><br>Acro was the leading wagon at the time with nearly a week left before deadline. You made zero, yes we can count them, zero posts about players you actually found scummy. You therefore defaulted to lynching him to preserve yourself, knowing any lynch other than yours would be preferable. That doesn't come from town motivation, that comes from survival motivation. Town motivation would have been to make AT LEAST A SINGLE point about those you find scummy in an attempt to get them lynched.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Llama wrote:</cite>SB &amp; Ice are \"LOLOL U HAMMAH AND NOT MASON\"<br></div></blockquote><br>It's more like LOLOL YOU HAMMERED SOMEONE YOU THOUGHT WAS TOWN AND NOT MASON AND ONE OF THE SCUMMIEST PLAYERS.<br><br>Sub's post 848 echos much of my thoughts on the page so far.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>Ice posts 3 statements and makes a list of people on each person, because llama is on all 3, he votes him.<br></div></blockquote><br>One of those 3 things happened to be me having a scum read on him, which I've qualified throughout day 2."}

The attention on SK was mostly my doing, I was trying to get something going on Ivan when few others were doing it, and I was trying to draw you out when nobody else had a scum read on you. I won't deny that I've settled on some wagons, but to say that's all I've done is simply not true. I've been actively trying to stir things up and force people to explain themselves in a game where a lot of people have been lurking or parking on easy wagons. In the process, I've come out looking pretty dirty, but even if I get lynched today, I think we'll be better off than we would be if we had lynched Jilynne a week ago. So I can't say I completely regret anything. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>This is essentially an admission of guilt in my eyes</div></blockquote><br>So nice of you to be magnanimous when I admit that I might have been mistaken in some of my reads.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>This is so obviously contrived it's not even funny.

It's feeling like an utter chore. I'm not finding any reads that are working for me, and at the same time, I'm being insulted and attacked, and at the same time I'm pretty sure I'd be doing the same if the situation was reversed.

I've been spending more time trying to pressure players that aren't receiving pressure than just about anyone else in this game. Why do people sheep? To slip under the radar unnoticed or to push promising mislynch wagons to a successful vote. Can anyone seriously try to argue that I've been trying to slip under the radar in this game? I've been sticking my neck out for the majority of the game, and it's finally caught up with me. Nobody could argue that I've been trying to slip under the radar. Secondly, I don't think you can look at my voting history and argue that I've been simply trying to push wagons to a lynch. I tried to move my vote after Acro was lynched because I thought pressuring Grey would be more useful than hammering Acro. Then why did I try to put the breaks on the Jilynne wagon? Again, I wanted to pressure more people before we lynched. Anyone who has done more than skim the vote counts should know that I have not been settling on large wagons and waiting for a lynch. Sheeping is an easy buzzword accusation, and it simply isn't true. Not even a little.<br><br>Case against Beck- I took what I think began as a valid point and took it too far. I don't think I was completely wrong, but I think I took a small bit of information and began trying to draw grand conclusions out of it. I was overly enthusiastic, and it looks bad. I'm just going to have to admit that I got carried away. There's not enough to lynch Beck on, but please people, read Beck closely and make sure the development of his opinions is making sense."}

Granted, I'm being pretty lazy about my cases at this point, but that's mostly because I hold very little hope that they would do me much good. Anyhow, I think the read on Beck and Llama is anything but shallow and non-messy. Nobody else picked up Beck backing off his Llama scum read. Nobody else felt like questioning him about his shift on Llama's hammer. Nobody else called Beck on \"forgetting\" to vote for Jilynne after unvoting me. You can disagree with these opinions, but to say that they're shallow and clean is not accurate. If you're going to lynch me, do it because you think I was over pursuing a player most people think is town, or lynch me because I didn't want to lynch Jilynne after suspecting SK all of D1, but don't lynch me for making easy and inoffensive cases. That's just inaccurate.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Magic wrote:</cite>What's your straightforward, full read on him?</div></blockquote><br>You're surprised I didn't mention a player I described as bland as one of my three strongest reads? I've taken note of his defense of me, and I'm not sure what to make of it. I've taken note of him mirroring my attacks on Beck, and again, I'm not sure what to make of it. All I can come up with is WIFOM. On the one hand, I don't think it makes sense for scum to attach himself to the cases of a sinking ship, so maybe he's town. On the other hand, he might think defending me will provide town cred after I die. Reading back over his ISO, I agree with a lot of the things he's said, but then I disagree with how easily he returned to a town read on Beck now that it looks pretty clear that I'm going down. Sorry to disappoint you, but my straightforward read on Tommy is, \"I don't know.\" <br><br>If I absolutely had to pick, I'd say I lean town on him based on his opinions matching my own quite frequently. We had similar views on the Jilynne wagon, similar views on Magic's plan for competing wagons, similar views about Ivan, etc. I wish he was more aggressive, but I can't come up with any solid reason to think he's scum.<br><br>I guess that was more stream of conscious than straightforward, but hopefully that's sufficient."}

I also hounded the lurkers to get something out of them. I think it's important to stop people getting all the way to night 1 without committing to any opinions. I've had a lot of flak for the way I did this (withholding my vote), but I think it was a pro-town activity. In day 2, I nailed scum with my first post and argued consistently against Llamarble until he swung. At one point I was the only one left voting for him, so I switched my vote to Ivan, but even during that period I made it clear that Llamarble was still my preferred lynch. As soon as Scott arrived and voted Llamarble, I hopped back on. I didn't let up the pressure from then until we got him.

What is it about my play today that strikes you as scummy?<br></div></blockquote><br>It hasn't been terrible, to be frank. However, you're relying completely on PoE, which is a tool that I think is incredibly useful to use, but you aren't putting it in context. You're simply saying you've rounded your lynch pool down to only town reads, and haven't done anything to look deeper and find the scum motivations behind the play in each of your scum list. I definitely approve of your vote of Beck, but I don't really approve of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">why</span> you've voted Beck. He's the least town of your town-read-only lynch pool.<br><br>I definitely encourage you to go back and read all of us in ISO and present your findings because otherwise I would agree that you are coasting along the day doing very minimal scum hunting, really. Sure you've posted a lot, but I'm not finding a lot of scum hunting analysis from you. I've been very clear as to who I believe is scum and why, whereas you're simply saying \"based on process of elimination, some of my townreads must be wrong so I'm just going to vote one of them\".<br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>Tommy isn't doing anything to help find scum, he even says his top lynch suspects he has a town read on, he doesn't find ANYONE scummy.<br><br>this is a red flag.<br></div></blockquote><br>Summed up nicely.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>I don't like him, but it's mostly i think he lacks good judgment sometimes, this is the 2nd time he has done something that makes absolutely no sense. <br></div></blockquote><br>I'm making fantastic judgement calls here. I've lost games to scum who did a wonderful job of posting great reasons to lynch the wrong players. You're posting wonderfully, and if this was day 1 or 2 you would currently be one of my strongest town tells. However, based on the circumstances of Llama's lynch considering Sub's counter wagon, you, regardless of my read on you, have the highest likelihood of flipping scum, with Tommy coming in second. I have better reasoning against Tommy based on his posts, but the circumstances simply point to you being our best lynch.<br><br>That being said, I'm considering a Tommy lynch as well. His flip will be decisively informative about Beck, I should say.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Lynch... I dunno, Ivan? Townie. <br></div></blockquote><br>Ivan is close to confirmed town. I will not be voting him unless there are very solid reasons to believe him of being a serial killer, which based on the single night kill during night 1, is highly unlikely. We have no doctor, so the only possibility is one forgot/chose to not shoot (unlikely) or they shot the same person (also unlikely).<br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Who do we lynch after Tommy and Beck? Who's your third scum read?<br></div></blockquote><br>If Beck is scum but Tommy is not, then the remaining scum is Scott. If Tommy is scum but Beck is not, I have no freaking clue. Probably MT, but that still seems like a long shot. I believe the likelihood of the first 2 votes on Llama both being scum is virtually nothing, so Tommyscum nearly clears Scott in my mind. If there's evidence of serial killer Ivan, I'm willing to look at it, but it just doesn't seem plausible. From my point of view, that leaves MT and his crazy Llama hammer as a gambit. Which, once again, I don't see as particularly plausible, so I'm really going to stick with Beck/Tommy/Scott, 2 of these 3.<br><br>I don't see much of any chance of both Tommy and Beck being scum, though one of them being scum reduces the likelihood of the other being scum in my mind.<br><br>Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I think a Tommy lynch might actually be more informative as to day 4's lynch. If Tommy flips town, we're almost guaranteed to hit Beckscum. If Tommy is scum, then we need to take a long hard look at the game and decide if Tommy and Beck would be willing to bus each other at this point.<br><br>I need to think on this."}

I've stated reasons, very recently, why I believe Ivan's claim. I don't need to repeat them. These reasons are subject to change depending on night 4 and 5 actions, but I think he's probably telling the truth. If so, then I can't reasonably say that town has more than 3 masons and a one shot vig. We definitely don't have 2 mafia families, as there was no distinction during night kill's or Llama's title (straight up goon) as I believe is required to do in normal minis. I'm not really sure what kind of anti-town role mafia could have at this point besides role cop, though.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>you gave your top 3 but never explained why....<br></div></blockquote><br>I clearly stated, within the post you are referring to:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite>If you haven't made it crystal clear in the past few pages why you want this player lynched, a quick explanation of your read would be helpful.<br></div></blockquote><br>I'm fairly sure I had made it clear shortly before.

As I've stated before, I'm assuming that Ivan is telling the truth. I have reason to assume so. Therefore, I can state with a fair amount of confidence that we do not have a doctor in this game."}

The idea that there must be scum on the subgenius wagon is predicated by the mafia family knowing who its members are and making a conscious effort to save one of them.  An SK, while scum, does not have that relationship with the mafia and would therefore be excluded from this scenario.  If one is to assume that there must be at least one scum on the major town wagon yesterday and one scum on the major scum wagon, then the scum on the town wagon must be you."}

Good play.<br><br>8, 12, 14, 15, 16: ICEninja is playing well during this period. Most of his energy is going into attacking Acronach and protecting the claimed mason from Beck.<br><br>18: A bit quick to forgive Greymarble for the scumminess of his hammer.<br><br>20: Suspicious of Da Koolzzy. Could be distancing, I suppose, but the reasoning is good: Da Koolzzy wasn't engaging with the game.<br><br>25: Votes Da Koolzzy and names jilynne as his second choice.<br><br>29: Possible attempt to smear jilynne by confusing Monday 11th July with Monday 18th July.

Good play.<br><br>38: Good pressure on Giitah.<br><br>40-42: Laudable effort to cure the town's indecision at the end of day 2.<br><br>44: First post of day 3. Rightly calls for third mason to claim. Votes Beck for having been on the subgenius wagon at the end of day 2. ICEninja assumes that Llamarble wouldn't have been bussed by both buddies, which I think isn't super-safe.<br><br>48: Claims he forgot about the non-mason list while reading YankCane's ISO. Odd, because the list is part of that ISO. Can't see how lying about this would benefit him as scum, though.<br><br>The rest is largely explanation of his own position in answer to other players: he wants to kill Beck or me, preferably Beck.<br><br>Summary: largely pro-town play, with the odd poor moment.

Beck's flip would be interesting, but not enough for me to want to vote him. <br><br>Tommy is very interesting.  When I read him I pretty much forget what he said the moment afterwards.  Right now off the top of my head I have no idea who his suspects are.  That's pretty cool if you think about it.  Not a lot of people are talented enough writers to make themselves invisible like that.  Or he could just be really uninteresting, but in either case his writing feels fabricated to me.  <br><br>ICE was giving me scum vibes, but once I compared it to the last game we played together, I'm pretty sure he' town.  Ivan the Fool's read on him still has not been explained to me, so it is probably gut, so fine.  His gut is usually awesome, but he was wrong once already this game on someone I was pretty sure was scum as well.  I personally am ready to clear ICE for the moment.  <br><br>Whiskers is another of those people that just disappears in my mind despite the large amounts of bluster.  However, just reading her posts I'm pretty sure she's town.  I don't get any weird vibes from it, and I can see why she reacts the ways that she does regardless of whether I agree with her. <br><br>Scott needs some rereading before I can give a confident opinion on him.  <br><br>Magic Trainer is weird for me however.  His posting in general is protown, but I would expect that from a good player.  He really hasn't done anything to make me think he's town, and on top of that his sudden praise of archaebob and myself really rubbed me the wrong way.  It's fine if you think we're good, but why would you say that?  You're just painting a target on our heads if we're town.  If you thought we were scum then that would be fine, but you really didn't seem to have an opinion on us, you just wanted to call out how strange we were acting.  If you could tell that we were getting ready to pull something then what is the protown reasoning for outing us?  You know our playstyle is not to be open and transparent, and if you read that game that you linked then you should really know not to talk about the things we are doing behind the scenes if you notice them.  That was very weird for me.  <br><br>Actually, you know what?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: Magic Trainer</span><br><br>I want to see how you respond to this."}

Beck, Giitah, scott, and us Ivans are all town.  <br><br>Here's why. <br><br>1) Beck is obv town. He's always been obv town, and the crappy statistics case ICE was pushing yesterday combined with his weaksauce commitment to it and a Tommy lynch make him extremely scummy. <br><br>2) Giitah is town because of his behavior when he was a major wagon with Llmarble.  He did not cross vote, which could easily have saved his skin and gotten him town cred for the bus, but instead tried to push a new wagon and pressure people, which was not in the interests of self preservation.  Reading that whole turn of events makes it painfully obvious that Giitah is town. <br><br>3) Scott is probtown.  We led in with \"we will be lynching scott tomorrow if Tommy flips scum\" which he did.  Combine that with the fact that we are definitely not mafia and could be a lurking full vig or SK, and there is no reason why we wouldn't get the nightkill unless 1) they thought we were lynchable (not likely) or 2) they were hoping to gain something from our suspicions.  They obviously knew the Tommy flip, so that means they thought we would be going for scott and that would be safe.  <br><br>This is ultimately wifom however, which is why scott is probtown and not obvtown.  <br><br>4) We are town. We said why earlier. <br><br>5) ICE is scum because of his super tentative statistics case on Beck. If he actually believed any of that he would have pushed it like a motherfucker.  The fact that he went after Tommy in an equally weaksauce way is borderline ridiculous.  He bussed out Llamarble, then bussed out Tommy, and is now going to try and soak up the town cred and coast to the finish.  That is very common scum play, personally I do it all the time.  Note the game Magic Trainer linked. <br><br>6) Heliman could be scum simply because I don't have a great reason to think he's town.  Ivan the Fool has a more formulated opinion on him. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: ICEninja</span><br><br>-Ivan the Terrible."}

You will continue to tunnel and never be satisfied. Content---------situational. You are extremely to the left (to the point where you still suspected Ivan after his claim lol). I am more on the right especially after flips. Granted your methods have been I guess more effective in this specific game given there appears to be no scum on the Sub wagon and there's a real chance that one of the hammers was scum. <br><br>Anyway, Beck is probably town as I seriously doubt we had rival scum wagons yesterday. <br><br>That leaves Git, MT and Ice. <br><br>Git's play yesterday concerns me. There really wasn't much content, only asking people general questions. 1390 is scummy, deflecting some suspicion on Tommy, claiming the hammer but never acting it on it. 1390 is probably the scummiest thing I have seen of the people still alive given Tommy's flip. However, I still haven't seen an unprovoked VT claim turn up anything but VT. Also the counterwagon to Llama which also would need to be scum/scum which seems unlikely. <br><br>MT was pretty useless yesterday as well disappearing for most of the day. Idk I still cannot see the hammer and being on Tommy all day yesterday coming from scum though. Interested to hear what the replacement has to say. <br><br>It definitely was a good spot for ICE to hammer and get town-cred, but he has been having similar thoughts to me which I see coming from a town mindset. I guess it's entirely possible Icescum is buddying/agreeing with me? Bleh. <br><br>The MT hammer is much different than Ice's hammer though. I still refuse to believe MT would hammer a scumbuddy in that spot where it is completely easy to mislynch Sub. Tommy's lynch was going into inevitable land though, so that hammer did not necessarily come from town. <br><br>I guess I'm leaning towards Giitah or ICE at this point but my reads on either aren't particularly strong."}

Alot of bad play here.

Why? It's because Ivan's claim that he was faking the indecisive behavior causes two large contradictions. First, the whole trick had no defensive aspect to it once yank mason claimed D1 with three partners who were EXPRESSEDLY not you. Scum was pretty obviously going to be going after the mason team for the next three freakin days, MINIMUM, so you had nothing much to complain about. Second, Your huge argument on sub in #768 was all about how he was scummy for being purposely indecisive. This argument doesn't make any sense now because you just claimed to be purposely indecisive just like you claimed sub was. You're scummy by your own definition. Also if you're a vig your hit on Sub was a horrible shot. <br>Also Also, Hydra heads that try to make good arguments but can't agree with each other in the end are basically a factory of small, ineffective wagons. Makes for an enviornment that favors scum, wouldn't you say?<br><br>Scott Brosius-<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3293851#p3293851\" class=\"postlink\">#1290</a> Have to agree with this a with regards to beck.<br><br>NIGHT 3- Ok, tommy finally flips scum, I sorta saw that coming when I read the mod's opening post. That does a great dealof good for Beck's case, but bearing in mind that tommy put up friction with marble too this effect is somewhat lessened. The cool thing about the current situation is that a certain potential SK can keep on killing now because if the SK exists, the mafia is probably already dead.<br><br>SO, there you have it. my scum reads are Ivan and to a lesser extent Beck.<br><br>BUT. Does this matter today? It sure doesn't! Why? Because we should to No Lynch today! Why? because at we need to thin out the lynch pool. Why? Because if it comes right down to it, a 2:1 LYLO Situation is statistically better for us than a 3:1 LYLO Situation. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: no lynch</span>"}

Why? It's because Ivan's claim that he was faking the indecisive behavior causes two large contradictions. First, the whole trick had no defensive aspect to it once yank mason claimed D1 with three partners who were EXPRESSEDLY not you. Scum was pretty obviously going to be going after the mason team for the next three freakin days, MINIMUM, so you had nothing much to complain about. Second, Your huge argument on sub in #768 was all about how he was scummy for being purposely indecisive. This argument doesn't make any sense now because you just claimed to be purposely indecisive just like you claimed sub was. You're scummy by your own definition. Also if you're a vig your hit on Sub was a horrible shot. <br>Also Also, Hydra heads that try to make good arguments but can't agree with each other in the end are basically a factory of small, ineffective wagons. Makes for an enviornment that favors scum, wouldn't you say?</div></blockquote><br><br>Two things.  First of all, this account was supposed to be an experimentation with meta.  Notice that we were trying not to reveal our heads at all, but archaebob mistakenly posted from his account.  We both have meta of posting large quantities and being aggressive scumhunters, but here we have not done that.  We wanted to see what would happen if we generated the schizophrenic hydra, ignored questions, and were generally unhelpful.  I have to say it's pretty amazing that we didn't get lynched for all that, or even seriously wagoned. Think about it.  The whole security we have in playing mafia is that people won't be allowed to get away with lurking and not answering questions because we the town can make them answer questions! We have just shown that that is not true.  <br><br>Now as interesting as all that is, our 1 shot vig role was actually interesting and lent itself well to the experiment.  Not getting might killed actually had some useful aspects and we chose to play to that goal. If you still think we're a serial killer, think about how most SKs have NK immunity, investigation immunity, or both.  We don't have Night Kill immunity.  It would be almost impossible for an SK to win while having to fear getting lynched and fearing the mafia.  We certainly have not been playing a strong town game to avoid the noose, and our 1 shot claim nearly guarantees that we'll get the kill tonight since we didn't get it last night.  <br><br>Secondly, we have killed exactly one person.  The only possible benefit to that is to avoid suspicion of being the SK (assuming that is our role).  That locks us into a claim of 1 shot vig, ties our hands with our kill, and forces us to avoid lynches and nks simultaneously.  That's fucking impossible. <br><br>Now I'd like to hear a case on Beck since you're pretty much the only one who thinks that he's anything but vanilla town.  <br><br>Then I'd like to hear your in depth opinion on ICEninja.  This goes for <span class=\"noboldsig\">Giitah</span> s well."}

I apologize for not doing this sooner, and as Beck has pointed out, I definitely have not done a good job of this so far.<br><br>I apologize if this post is not up to my usual quality, I don't have the time to preview it.<br><br>Here is Ivan's original case against me, point by point:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>1) Beck is obv town. He's always been obv town, and the crappy statistics case ICE was pushing yesterday combined with his weaksauce commitment to it and a Tommy lynch make him extremely scummy. <br></div></blockquote><br>Beck, right now, is prob town. He was absolutely not obv town at all, as I discussed yesterday, the likelihood of that sub wagon showing up at such strength during day 2 so close to the deadline against a scum wagon seriously implied a scum fueled attempt to save a scum. While I now realize the likelihood of there being more than just Llama scum on that wagon is much lower, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">it was not at all clear that this was the case yesterday</span>.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>ICE is scum because of his super tentative statistics case on Beck. If he actually believed any of that he would have pushed it like a motherfucker. The fact that he went after Tommy in an equally weaksauce way is borderline ridiculous.<br></div></blockquote><br>Oh so the fact that I realized scum was probably between 2 players, and players did a good job of convincing me it was the other makes me scum? I did initially push it quite hard, actually. The fact that Beck had so much town posting made it extremely difficult for me to push it any harder, and I made that very clear. I was conflicted because of that, so obviously town shouldn't push anything like a motherfucker when we're this far in. At least not a player like me. I suppose I shouldn't speak for you.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>He bussed out Llamarble, then bussed out Tommy, and is now going to try and soak up the town cred and coast to the finish. That is very common scum play, personally I do it all the time.<br></div></blockquote><br>This isn't even evidence against me. You're saying that because I lynched scum, I'm obviously bussing and therefore scum myself. This may be how you play scum. I hope it's how you play town, as well. Do you not try to lynch scum as town? If you can explain how I'm playing to a scum win condition and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> to a town win condition, then we'll debate.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>Town doesn't talk about things in terms of what they \"definitely see a reason to do.\" They just do things. The unnecessary caveat in this sentence reeks, reeks of scum.<br></div></blockquote><br>You play town differently than I do. I simply cannot defend myself on this because, as I have said I believe multiple times now, I don't \"just do things\". I present with as much transparency as possible my case and thought process on why I believe who is scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>This is a style of scum play that a lot of players who don't know any better fall into, particularly players who pride themselves on their intelligence and rationality. They fail to recognize that their desperate, pathetic attempts to appear completely nuanced and even-handed is in an of itself the most powerful scumtell in this game. <br></div></blockquote><br>I attempt to play \"completely nuanced and even-handed\" in every single game. I've never once heard that used as a scum tell against me. I'd actually like to point out <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2121594#p2121594\" class=\"postlink\">something from this post</a> that was said about me. I was town, the poster was scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mysterious Mystery Man wrote:</cite>ICEninja, excuse me if this is too joking, but he really does look like a computer program designed to play mafia, he appears to be imitating human behaviour without getting emotionally involved in any way. I'm not really sure if that's town or scum. <br></div></blockquote><br>In that game, I played very methodical and devoid of any gut reads. If I had the same amount of time to devote to this game as I did previous games, I'd be playing exactly the same.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>Real town is paranoid, inconsistent, and will often make leaps in logic that they can't really justify because they have an intuition about something. To be sure, some players will tend to be more rational even as town, and I have no doubt that ICE is such a player. Nevertheless, the tone and structure of his posts reveal his alignment pretty clearly to anyone who is willing to look.<br></div></blockquote><br>He even admits exactly the truth in here. I am a rational player, but I simply don't make leaps in logic that I can't justify, at least in terms of deciding who to vote.<br><br>I now recall earlier in the game I had a gut scum read on Tommy, but never pursued it because I simply don't pursue gut reads unless I can qualify them. I believe I said as much. This is just how I play.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ivan wrote:</cite>Town simply does not think in those terms. Everything is put into such a narrowly defined box:<br></div></blockquote><br>You're a narrow minded player if you think you can define how another player, who plays SIGNIFICANTLY different from yourself, thinks as town. You obviously have a strong gut read on me, but you haven't actually substantiated very much against me, despite what you may think. You really can trim your entire case on me down to \"ICE is playing in a way I feel is different than how town plays\". I realize that's the basis for scum hunting, but the examples you're using to present me as playing unlike town is exactly how I play town.<br><br>Now let's take a look at Beck's case against me.<br>It's a bit all over the place so I won't use quotes for this one, but it seems to simply be based on VCA, where my vote was and when, and the fact that he thinks I had terrible reasons to vote him yesterday.<br><br>My reasons for voting him yesterday came from pretty much the same thing as his reasons for voting me today: the situation in which lynches occurred, and where town and scum are more likely to be on them. Considering how hard you pushed yesterday at this being faulty logic, and then using it today, really gives me nothing to defend. It's just terrible.<br><br>TL;DR, there's very little substance in the cases against me. I'll do more scum hunting when time permits."}

You're right, it did hit L-1. For some reason I don't remember it looking that convincing of a lynch, but that definitely isn't the case. I suppose Giitah is prob town at this point.

Regardless, Beck has made a lot of good arguments. I even acknowledged yesterday the good posting he was doing, which went a long way to town lynching scum instead of Beck.

With quite a lot of conviction, to boot. If you're actually bringing stuff up that points to me being scum, then like I said, we can debate about it.

Furthermore, you are a reasonably intelligent person with a sizeable amount of experience playing this game.<br><br>Your playstyle consists of making purely logical deductions from purely objective observations that nobody can really disagree with all that much.

Why?  Because any detail townies give the scum on who to kill is a bad thing.  Night kills often effect a players thought process on who is scum, so coming into a day with four players alive and only one scum means you will, nine times outta ten, no lynch without saying anything else.  That way the scum has to make a kill off old assumptions and leaves the town in the strongest possible position come lylo.<br><br>Now, with that out of the way do you have a reason for thinking my slot is scum outside of what happened yesterday?  What's your feelings on Scott?  I actually have read very little of the game so far as I wanted to see who died and so on.  I'm also pretty interested to see what you two have to say about each other.  For me I have a 50/50 choice, I know one of you is the last scum.

Theres a lot of one-liners after that, calls Llama town at one point. 868 he goes hard after Tommy. <br><br>Jumps on Sotty (jilynne) wagon when it is jilynne/Llama rival wagons putting jilynne at L-1.

Talks about wanting to hammer for the next few posts. Then says he is sticking with the sub lynch. Ends up eventually hammering (also saying that Sub/Tommy need to die if he flips town)<br><br>Thoughts: Looks like standard call one partner scummy call one partner town scum behavior. He changes his opinion on Llama very quickly and contrary to what I thought before, I guess he thought he could get a ton of town cred for hammering there. It's a somewhat safe spot to do it given the D1 mislynch. One of the scummier things happens earlier in the day when he puts jil at L-1 when we are still looking for a replacement. Basically looks like he's going for the easy lynch against a slot that doesn't even have a voice. In retrospect the hammer doesn't seem genuine but my opinion is clearly influenced now by knowing racer is scum. <br><br>Next day the content drops. He initially votes Ivan, Ivan claims, goes back to Tommy without really pushing the case just remaining stagnant claiming nothing productive is being done. The softpush on Tommy the next day is pretty null to me. It's entirely possible he got bored or whatever. Everything else can be ignored. There really isn't much to be gained from Heilman I don't think, as the main issues are with MT's play. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scott Brosius wrote:</cite>It's process of elimination. As you said from your \"perspective\" the Sub wagon was all town. I find that extremely hard to believe. Given Ivan's claim, that leaves you. It's not really about playstyle, its circumstance. Although your hunt of MT seems foolish as that hammer is town 99.2% of the time in that situation.</div></blockquote><br>Like I said, every analysis I have seems to be wrong this game. It's definitely a high risk high reward hammer.<br><br>Anyway that's a hasty ISO of that slot. I will look further into Tommy and Llama's posts concerning that slot as well perhaps by tonight."}

He hangs CA in his scumlist but nothing is really persuasive about it.<br><br>D2: MT replaces in. Tommy does a 180 now going after Llama and seems to think MT is town with his replace in post 690. There is some interaction mostly limited question answering but nothing I see of importance. Obviously his vote remains on Llama. <br><br>Thoughts: Not really any interaction to draw on. That does make sense though considering he is bussing Llama to ignore the other scumbuddy. <br><br>D3: Again not much interaction or mentioning. Does essentially clear him in 1301 for that hammer although at the time that did make sense. MT puts Tommy at L-1 in 1328. Tommy ends up claiming that his read on CA was a slight scum-tell when after rereading it was obviously more than that ion 1337. <br><br>Thoughts: The downplaying of thinking the MT slot was scummy is interesting, especially given the L-1 situation he was in at the time.

Why did people suspect of being scum because I did something pro-town? (Referring to hammering Llama)<br><br>Like seriously guys, there is nothing wrong with having a good list of obvious town players. The cost/benefit ratio for hammering Llama in that situation is not worth it. Even if I did that as scum (Which I'd never do, I'd let you fuckers suffer with a no lynch and then push that sub lynch easily), no one would regard me as <span style=\"font-style: italic\">confirmed</span> town because of it, and if I was still around during lylo, then it'd be discarded as nothing.<br><br>But, if I was town and you guys let that slide and let me have fun with being obvious town (as town), then I'd probably get night killed as scum would freak out about having townies agree on their correct town reads. Meaning I'd die before lylo because we're all awesome enough to win this game via PoE if you let us.<br><br>5. Why the fuck did you guys lynch Ice? He was one of the most obvious town players this game. This is saying something considering he always looks fuckin scummy. (I'm assuming the Ivan hydra had Ice nailed as town and just wanted a town mislynch then a scum lynch.)<br><br>6. Sotty, what questions did you want to ask me if I were here? I'm curious."}

Sotty had modded (well I guess forced into modding after CML vanished) a game where I was scum where I didn't really bus anyone but had the same middle of the road with me. I was instantly killing Beck but when Sotty replaced in, I became weary that I would be figured out. I was really glad racer voted first. I wanted to play up the well, I'm not thrilled with this case since I had a town read but I guess MT/racer is scum. I did not want to be the first to vote. I see there is some discussion about voting first in LYLO being town/scum tell. I don't really see it as either. I think it's advantageous as scum to pin it as 1v1 especially leaving it up to a player who probably won't be lynched. <br><br>I also did not believe Sotty when she said she thought racer was the final scum. That didn't seem sincere at all and got me worried. It looked like an appeal for content more than anything. <br><br>I was also wondering why Ice was lynched. Him and I basically were saying the same things all game, yet he was the one who got lynched for it. We were both trying to keep Beck in place, favoring logic over emotion. Yet when it came down to it, Ivan went after him. There was no way I was killing Ivan after that comment at the end of D3 saying if he died look at me. Especially when I had a mason still alive. <br><br>I stand by a lot of what I said in terms of Beck even though I obviously had scummy motives. There is no way you can think Ivan was an SK with the way kills happened. I was in utter disbelief at his flip. Also using VCA against Ice after being completely against it earlier was hilariously hypocritical. Not that I was going to say that in thread =). Also MT's hammer was completely town. There is no chance in that situation that he would hammer scum simply for town cred. The situation of 3 scum still alive D3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any potential town cred (THAT HE DID NOT EVEN END UP REALLY GETTING)<br><br>Would really love to hear the thought process behind the SK play. <br><br>The definitely not masons gambit of sorts was definitely interesting, but when it came down to it, (not that you knew this) but we eliminated ourselves, eliminated CA/MT for being on the wagon, it was pretty obvious who they were to scum. <br><br>Setup was balanced I thought. Masons being the first 3 NKs seriously sapped their power. But otherwise I think any more town PRs would have been townsided especially if the masons had even just another day alive. More frequent VCs would be the only mod criticism I had. I too am struggling through a game finding replacements, easily the worst in terms of that I've ever modded. <br><br>As everyone is complaining about, there are 2 things I never understand. This game it wasn't important, but looking into NKs to an extent. Call it WIFOM but I'm not basing complete cases off of it but I think it's definitely something to look into. This game, the NKs were obvious so not really important. Second is that when someone dies, any opinions they have die with them essentially. Whiskers suspected me, dead never mentioned. Beck suspected me, dead never mentioned."}

Weigh the benifets versus the costs. The Costs outweigh the benefits to the point where I'd get fucking bankrupt as scum. I'm assuming you think everyone would classify me as <span style=\"font-style: italic\">confirmed</span> town and let me go scot free in lylo. If this is your fear, then there are two important things to learn. One, most people are not as stupid as you think they are, they are well aware of WIFOM situations and thefor wouldn't in the strictest sense, confirm a player <span style=\"font-style: italic\">indefinitely</span>. Second, in lylo, no one would have cared about me hammering for looking pro-town. I'd lose any town cred gained as scum and it'd be null. I'd then gain suspicion for while I'm still alive as well.<br><br>Occams Razor is generally reliable.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>Your wishy washy voting for half the playerbase doesn't help either</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay. You are making a poor generalization that \"wishy washy\" is bad.

(----&gt; If the answer in any scenario is yes then disregard wishy washyness as a stupid wiki tell) Changing your mind is very natural, if not inevitable. Plus all my reads were consistent all around.<br><br>Beck/ICE/Spoon were all around town all the time. Llama/Jill/Scott/ were Null interchangeably Tommy was confirmed scum a long time ago. Ivan was scum to me on the condition that Tommy was scum. (Hence timidly pushing him/revealing his hydra head). I withdrew the blinker scum read when I realized he was a Mason, and I was forced to compromise on all my strongest reads because no one wanted to vote with me.<br><br>Blinker ---&gt; People agree but refuse to vote<br>Koolzy/Jil ---&gt; Compromise based on deadline/lack of support.

I don't even understand why people would question a literally last minute vote to save a no lynch.<br><br>The Common theme is I held consistent town reads and interchanged votes because I wanted a goddamn lynch to go through that was at least somewhat related to my stronger reads so I could connect the dots later."}

But basically, I hated how you made these big cases Tommy/blinker and then just dropped them as soon as the new sparkly came along. I can get that you were frustrated that no one was listening, but to me it was like you didn't really want to lynch these guys and that your cases were bluster. I never felt you truly push your Tommy case at all. And the case was good. I had convinced myself it was too good, but that's not the point. I think you need to beat on that drum a lot more. Don't just abandon your reads for the town. Yes there are times when you should compromise, but there are a lot more times where you should get a megaphone, stand on your soap box and ask over and over why we aren't lynching so and so.<br><br>The best way to get people to talk about your cases if you are feeling ignored is to single people out. \"Hey Beck, what do you think of what I posted about Tommy in post yadda yadda?\" That why you get direct feedback on the case you built AND you can work on convincing him and drawing others into your dialog.

Reflecting back I compromised waaay too much. I don't remember the exact reason why I let Tommy go so easily, it was probably due to deadline/inner-frustration. I did notice a small but very important technical problem in my case that made it harder to push the momentum.<br><br>I've got to ask though, what specific things do you think I should have pushed harder? I felt like I was translating a very strong gut read into logical points.
