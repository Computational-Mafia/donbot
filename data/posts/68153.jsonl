All site rules apply.<br>2. Play to your win condition.<br>3. Be civil.<br>4. Do not discuss ongoing games in this thread.<br>5. Pretending to break rules will be treated the same as breaking them.<br>6  Going 48 hours without posting will result in a prod. If you do not pick up a prod in 24 hours, or if I have to prod you a third time, I will look for a replacement.<br>7. Do not quote out-of-thread communications with me or another player.<br>8. Just because a rule isn't stated here, doesn't mean it's acceptable - use common sense.<br>9. This game follows the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Guidelines</a>.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Game Mechanics:</span></span></span><br><br>1. Lynches require a majority of players. n/2 rounded down + 1<br>2. Voting must use vote tags (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>) or bolded text (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player</span>)<br>3. I will accept nicknames as long as it is clear who is being voted<br>4. Place votes at the beginning of a line (With that being said, no trick votes, I reserve the right to count votes like that (or not) in a pinch)<br>5. Once a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight. People can still talk, but no voting or unvoting will be counted.<br>6. A Nolynch occurs when the deadline runs out and a majority has not been recieved, or when it is voted for by the majority<br>7. Actions follow the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>. <br>8. Day phases last 14 days, night phases last 2 days.<br>9. Night phase will never end early.<br>10. I will extend the deadline at my discretion if needed.<br>11. Players will flip with their full role ability name and alignment<br>12. Flavour that may or may not exist in this game is just that - flavour with no bearing on anyone's role or alignment <br>13. All roles were assigned randomly<br>14: At least one player has the following role PM:<br><br><br><br><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome &lt;Player&gt;, to Mini #1827<br><br>You are a <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>, aligned with the <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town</span></span><br><br>You have no special abilities. Your weapons are your words and your vote.<br>You win when all anti-town factions have been eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=68153&amp;p=8278489#p8278489\" class=\"postlink\">Here</a> is the game thread.

I'm Naomi. I have a problem with my mindset in general. As both scum and town I fear getting lynched and sometimes that drives me to inaction. Additionally I doubt myself and never feel that my reads are very good and because of this i'm not the strongest arguer as in the back of my mind I'm always doubting myself. so.. I come off as unsure. My solution to fixing this has been to ask questions and being very open and honest wherever possible. beacuse even if I'm bad at scum hunting at least I can support town by keeping activity high. I like doing regular read lists as well so people can get an idea of what I'm thinking (every 10 pages or so) When I wake up I normally do a larger 'catchup' post followed by shorter reaction posts over the course of the day. Because of this I also tend to do lots of LAMIST moves beacuse Im always worried people will want me gone as I'm not very good. Scum tend to use this to there advantage sometimes.<br><br>The reason I'm opening with this is my mind set follows a more scum meta when, for me, its really NAI as I just havn't managed to get past the idea that by lynched and I don't want to die.. and thats a problem but.. as I can't really do anything about it I been taking to attempting to announce this when playing to help town out. I also find it helps if I'm honest about it early on as it's going to come out through my gameplay and its hard to defend this play style. <br><br>I expect this post will be a hot topic down the line for both Scum!Naomi and Town!Naomi but Thats just the kinda player I am. Also I normally get a handful of votes for this post from people who declare; \"She is setting up for later\" which is true. this is setting up for when people point and say I'm being LAMIST and for when people notice my unsure mindset and habbit of backing off because my meta is strange.."}

I tend to use Null for people who havn't said much.. but I still treat null as town.. I guess what I should do is go; Confirmed town, Extreme town, Strong Town, Town, Slight Scum, Scum. If that makes sense.. but This isn't good for my health I find as everyones like; why you think people are town and I'm like; Dunno? should I not. And then it just gets messy.<br><br>PEDIT; Yeah thats the 3 camps thing I pointed out a bit later. It is very much NAI but pointing out that its NAI is the point of the post so.. sorta works? I havn't tested yet but I think it would be an interesting theory to look at those people who do find it scummy as paranoid townies. Though there is also a scum chance.. also this time it was a good conversation starter, though its talking about an NAI post so not really much hunting ... but its nice to start to move out of a RVS cycle."}

No better than mine though so eh? But anyway they seem to ask pretty okay questions. but this wasn't the focus of my iso. It was to check your statement and tbh I'm not seeing it from your perspective. They have done 8 posts so far 2 of which was RVS (which arguably we are still in kinda?) some stuff talking about general game meta (the day talk, Putting people L-2) but when it comes to your statement I find it rather perplexing. Not sure what else to say on this topic.<br><br>PEDIT; Hey looks like my activity stimuli has kicked in! but can you cover your scum reads as they are most important to game flow? (I know you said 3 but Scum reads are the important ones as it allows to cross check for fake reasoning)<br><br>PEDIT2; I haven't been asked for explanations on anything because so far I haven't given out many reads As far as I'm concerned I like Transcend for his early read list (though I'm currently squeezing it for more information to assist town and to try and get a more active scum hunting // create discussions over stuff to get the ball flowing a little better.) and KTS ...... And then KTS was moved back to null.. just noticed the entire game he has been using friendly terms and acting like I'm town which is extremely strange as we are not linked in a role (aka we are not masons//lovers) and I don't think I've done anything too townie yet. I guess this is a strange case of me thinking he was being too friendly? he also uses terms like I'm always right.. so i'm kinda suspecting psychological tactics are at play there, or he is just being really friendly and nice and reads me as town and I'm being paranoid..  Could I get some 3rd party opinions on this matter in relation to his interactions with myself?<br><br>PEDIT3; Give me a chance to type XD"}

If you had such a scummy vibe from y first post you have no reason to wait until other people being up it being scum if you were town. Not to mention your second reason for scum reason me is me not voting when you couldn't be bothered to start a wagon on me until another person placed a vote.<br><br>As for what you actually said about the post as well as Naomi the first part was filler yeah it was a joke I don't even know how you didn't even think that was a joke. The second part was just me pointing out how Kill was not 100% right in his statement and plus no one even town slipped so what are you wen trying to get at? The third part wasn't even anything to do with scumhuting or even anything remotely related to what you said as that part was me asking a question about what would likely be in a setup. The 4th part was me criticizing you for trying to put words in Kill's mouth ecausse he never said everyone but Jord was town which you were saying he was implying.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Creature</span>"}

You give no reason for a scum read, then when another person had the same read as you, you act like you had thought of that reason first and they were just slow to realize that. Sure that could be true if you are town, but as town you had no reason to hide evidence for me being scum whereas scum could just as easily say they think someone is scum and allow a townie to go through to work of making a reasoned argument and claim the exact same thing. And it's the later that looks like what you are trying to do because you did exactly that, vote me and wait for someone else to make an argent why I would be scum."}

This said he could also believe what he was saying so yeah<br><br>8. Creature - My number one scum read right now. I'll talk about this in my next post, but feel free to run an ISO on him while I get that one ready.<br><br>9.

At the time I pressured his XYYZY view and took the time to explain how its kinda bad to do stuff without reasoning with it. Here I'd like to expand on my thoughts on that subject slightly mid post you can skip this part if you like but It may also help you understand my read here; Just like how its super easy for scum to RoleClaim VT Its also easy for them to give votes and lists without reasoning. It comes off and looks like activity however anyone can give a list of names like that, you may do it strongest to weakest player or how you think generally town is but votes with no data are just that no data nothings that cannot be used to either find your alignment or read your true views other than eliminating other targets. This'll come up again in his read list.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8282321#p8282321\" class=\"postlink\">post 153</a>, Creature wrote:</cite>Let's see:<br><br>Scum would want to make their posts less awkward.<br><br>Town is usually awkward at beginning.</div></blockquote><br>Here we see another example of; What would I do if I was town. Much like the quotes above it shows that creature has been thinking about what is 'townie' and then doing things based on that while trying to avoid 'scummy' acts this stateing of stuff when he does it just makes me think that he is scum thinking about what he should do as town and then doing that. in contrast to my own post which I made just declaring as a blanket I'll do certain things, his posts are always followed by doing what he feels is a 'townie' action while myself as town put it at the start and then only did those things slowly over time as they came up, as once I posted my intro post I don't think about what is scummy or townie and just post what i'm thinking at the time (and sometimes my thoughts mid post)<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8282325#p8282325\" class=\"postlink\">post 154</a>, Creature wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8282320#p8282320\" class=\"postlink\">post 152</a>, Naomi-Tan wrote:</cite>Additionally; If you feel XYZZY is not scum you should expand why you feel that way else your just saying words.

You shouldn't need to include yourself in a read list and its a little tacky. LAMIST ) Next Thing I notice is he crossed out all the most active towny players. myself KTS and Transcend. then there is xyzzy not crossed out despite him thinking he was town earlier and all the weaker town left in with two acceptations; Blackstar and Jordaman. Now if I had to guess he included one scum buddy in his town list and didn't include another. the XYZZY elimination could been done for distancing and as for the scum left in I'd suspect blackstar for the IO vote this of course is speculation on my part. but my veiw stands that a few of these reads are really off hilter and reads that I really cannot see. for example black star and XYZZY's play is pretty close but one posted more recently and moving on.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8283202#p8283202\" class=\"postlink\">post 230</a>, Creature wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8283192#p8283192\" class=\"postlink\">post 228</a>, Io wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8283164#p8283164\" class=\"postlink\">post 223</a>, Creature wrote:</cite>I am actually tempted to whiteknight Io.</div></blockquote><br>I don even know what that means.</div></blockquote><br>Hard defend someone.</div></blockquote><br>Finally this flip flop changing from trying to get an IO train started to considering to protect them, normally speaking when you think someone is scum you don't rotate on a dial as it is. as im Scum reading them I'm seeing this as them trying to backtrack after biting off a bit more than they can chew.<br><br>My scum veiw on creature is not comprised of a single post but multiple posts as you can now see.

Realistically, no.<br>I mean it is a game so everyone should be playing towards their wincon and town usually sets the meta and mafia mimic the meta in theory.<br>But the problem with theory is that it doesn't apply in all cases as you have some people who play town differently than others and scum who play scum differently than others. When it comes to making posts someone's style of post is more often than not just going to be how they usually post no matter if they are scum or town, alignment comes into play when making reads and how they go about making accusations. Scum are at a disadvantage because they already know the players' alignments, outside of multiball, and that can show through when scum make reads as they have to pretend they don't already know a player is confirmed town."}

Naomi is now in the top tier, no way she flips wolf.<br>2. Creature and Io out of the scumpool and into the town pool. I've been pleased with their posts as of lately.<br>3. BlackStar moves up a tier because I think his case on me albeit wrong was genuine and town processed.<br>4. Jorda moves to the null tier because I decided that his reaction to the BW could easily be faked when I initially dismissed it as town.<br>5. Pretty sure xyzzy was the only person I've had in the bottom tier, but I've now moved Vedith there. His vote compared to his reads looks inconsistent and he's never justified himself.<br>6. Massive's analysis of xyzzy was really good and something I agreed with. He didn't go too far in depth but he moves into the more townier than not tier.<br>7. Skelda's vote on KTS doesn't look like a wolf vote so I also put him in the same tier as massive.<br>8. I have 3 people in the scum tiers now as opposed to 5. Obviously I expect to be wrong on at least one, but I'd like to think I have at least one wolf in the bottom 3 tiers to focus on. Leaning heavily towards Vedith or xyzzy rope."}

Jorda moves to the null tier because I decided that his reaction to the BW could easily be faked when I initially dismissed it as town.<br>5. Pretty sure xyzzy was the only person I've had in the bottom tier, but I've now moved Vedith there. His vote compared to his reads looks inconsistent and he's never justified himself.<br>6. Massive's analysis of xyzzy was really good and something I agreed with. He didn't go too far in depth but he moves into the more townier than not tier.<br>7. Skelda's vote on KTS doesn't look like a wolf vote so I also put him in the same tier as massive.<br>8. I have 3 people in the scum tiers now as opposed to 5. Obviously I expect to be wrong on at least one, but I'd like to think I have at least one wolf in the bottom 3 tiers to focus on.

Before the did read I did just above this post I had them as null as They haddn't contributed and that was starting to scum lean as they was posting just nothing of substance. however, after reading there big Summery blocks I found myself flipping back and forth and saw there reads mutating as they posted as well to me this would be truely hard for scum to replicate and there thoughts stayed consistent through out (bar one acception) after looking over it all I struggle to believe they could have scum motivations. <br><br>2. Transcend - okay so before the iso I had them as town, however during this look over they appear to be pushing XYZZY which after diving into there post head first I'm totally town solid right now. which is tarnishing my read on them. To me it looks like a TvT fight and thats sorta eh? I guess I'm slightly less sure of my town read than before so.. slight town?<br><br>3. light_ganski - Pre-Iso Slight town read, post Iso; Slight scum read I don't like how they rarely talk about good posting and town posting (there read list being there only here are town people post) I also dislike how they had pistachi0n as town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8285423#p8285423\">294</a> it seems weird they would get that vibe after just 4 posts.<br><br>4. massive - I went it with a pretty null veiw into the ISO. Now; Eh.. kinda scum-Nullish I feel that they havn't posted enough to warrent a scummy read but They are pushing someone I now town read and It feels pretty.. weak? I dunno.. This ones got me on the fence a little I feel that they might be scum or not.. this one is hard.. Gut plays a large part here but I also don't like how there only town read is me (because I feel by now I'm obvious as a flare) Which seems kinda off to me. and even then they never said I was town but just implied they thought that. Its really award. I also don't buy there scum slip argument :/ oh yeah and post more<br><br>5. Jordarrian - This guy dropped off the face of the earth I don't even remember them So.. IF I have to ISO to remember you, you should post more; And after reading we get another null (but with a slightly smaller hint of scummy) I dislike how we have literally no analysis to go off of in the last 10 pages(well 11 now) but they do make town comments on occasion They really havn't spoken much though and that makes me kinda lean a little scummy just because of the lurk factor. however, they are still pretty null.<br><br>6. Killthestory - Okay... so last time I did one of these read lists I had KTS as null as I felt that his constant naomi is towning was impairing my judgement fortunately he didn't do as much this phrase and also didn't do much else really Time for a controversial read. after my ISO (230 - present) I'm slight scum reading him. all of his posts seem to be about him being great at scum hunting with very little scum hunting going on all very fluffy and with no meat to it. this doesn't leave me with a real pro-town feel <br><br>7. BlackStar - Okay had a slight scum read on him earlier from his look at IO and his statements saying X is scummy while doing X (See every time I mention glass houses) I only recently said this and Before Iso I'd still be there so lets see if the ISO changes my mind. and after reviewing.. I have them as a slight town. there posting style seems close to mine with little posts scattered throughout with little bits of content this leaves a smaller impact on there own but when looked over in bulk they make a more soild stance on town blackstar. They also seem the type who is weaker in the early game.<br><br>8. Creature - okay final ISO, Last time I looked at creature I concluded they was town and focused them for the last 250 posts or so, but putting that aside lets re-read them and see if I feel they are more townie. ISO; Okay starting off his defence is flimsy at best as if he wasn't expecting it his links to meta (even though I didn't read it) could be a thing he does as town. the fact he multi-sourced it makes me think its very likely to be true. so I'll continue this Iso thinking on that; I dislike his pushing of IO (still) and I also don't like his lynch list including the idle players.. ; eh.. I guess I can slightly more see a Town!Creature right now. as unlikely as that is, but if V or Light flipped town I'd be back on him. I'm gonna be reducing my scum read on him enough to switch votes to V<br><br>9. Skelda - Firstly If I have to ISO to remember you, you need to post more often; Null yup.. They agree with my KTS thoughts right now (and appear to have beaten me to the punch though I didn't know it till now (this is the second to last iso btw Im doing it in order from most to least sure)) and yeah I like how they gave a controversial read that was unlikely to get traction and may of resulted in there lynch but there activity is lacking at best... Eh lets raise them to slight town. giving benafit of the doubt on thinking on it.<br><br>10. Vedith - Before Isoing I'm slight scum reading them. they tunnelled blackstar hard (and this is kinda half iso result from the other stuff I looked at) so.. I'm not sure if anything will change so I'm going to read back over. Bleh, that Iso was not any better. reading this toxic attitude is nasty. <br><br>11. pistachi0n - Mild scum read. they don't post very often and when they do they don't say much. at least I make up for my inactive times by mega posts and smaller comments as we proceed. they also don't go deep into there thoughts saying things like; \"I am townreading creature and the creature wagon is scum\" - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8288155#p8288155\">406</a><br><br>12. Io - I like there content. they don't post very often but when they do its a more bulky post which always has some manner of content. least pre-iso; and post Iso too. Awesome Likely town<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Vedith</span> I feel they been joking most of the game and hasn't contributed much and goes berserk when pressured I also don't really like there attitude as it doesn't seem very nice.<br><br>So Final thing from town to scum<br><br>TOWN<br><br>XYZZY<br>IO<br>Transcend<br>Blackstar &amp; light_ganski<br>Skelda<br>Jordarrian <br>KTS &amp; Massive<br>Creature<br>pistachi0n  &amp; Vedith<br><br>SCUM"}

Like I can see the connections to things she does and track her POV pretty stably it seems  that nearly everything she said that can be tracked back to either her mentality being simalier to my own (aka she doesn't fully have a read and is unsure about herself) or its something else she said along the way. Like the things I like just seem too intricately linked to be Scum motivated."}

I feel like most likely at most 1 person on that wagon is scum, so if Jordarrian dies, looking at how those 3 people all interacted with him will be a decent source of information.<br>50: post 50 is definitely not a strong tell, but in general, I feel like pointing out information that is theoretically obvious but that could still be used to mislead the town is a slight town tell.<br>67: it just doesn't feel legitimate to me. I don't have a strong reason for believing this, but it doesn't feel like a pro-town action.<br>76: I tend to not be a huge fan of meaningless tautological statements, but despite my misgivings toward them, I've found that they're not really a scum tell.<br><br>122: I don't think trying to work out that info is unusual, but I think the manner in which Transcend responds to that question could provide info.<br>135: correcting other players' typos feels like an attempt to subtly make someone look like less of an important contributor to the game without actually meaningfully saying anything about their arguments.<br>142: the \"can you guess why\" part is the part I like.<br>152: that's fair. while sharing gut reads is an acceptable thing to do imo, not sharing them is just fine too, and I think your reasons for doing so are valid.<br>161: just so it's clear, my longer posts generally involve a lot of ISO-checking.<br>184: \"they're annoying\" isn't a valid reason to lynch someone (it's entirely possible for a town player to be annoying or for a scum player to be the most charming person in the game), and agreeing with that statement without adding anything to it at all doesn't feel good to me.<br><br>5: as I said, it's probably completely irrelevant, but it has the potential to feel noteworthy later on.<br>6: even though this is a non-serious post, I feel like in general town is a little more likely to make that kind of post, even if it's 100% a joke.<br>20: I don't feel like finding post 19 and post 20 both slightly town-leaning contradictory, but I see where you're coming from.<br>24: I think it's reasonable to expect people to say something about whatever's going on in the game if possible. as I said, I think on its own it's a null tell, but if someone has a lot of posts where they're just saying things without really contributing to any ongoing conversation, that's not great.<br>29: I'm not sure I fully understand what you're getting at here.<br>61: I screwed up my own grammar here--basically, what I meant was that someone could (incorrectly) decide that light_ganski's post 25 was scummy, and the fact that you pointed out that it isn't is fine. I had no issues with post 25.<br>86: this is something that I noted around that point during this re-read, although I guess pointing it out at post 86 wasn't super clear.<br><br>123/124: I don't feel like quoting three posts and simply saying \"these don't sound genuine\" without any additional commentary is a substantial reason to focus on someone as scummy; I still don't have a strong sense of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> Transcend finds those posts non-genuine, just that he does.<br>277: this was in response to BlackStar's comment in 276 about Transcend frequently wagon hopping. the fact that Killthestory suggested that Transcend get on a wagon and then he immediately did just seems interesting to me.<br><br>88: I'm not sure what you mean by this. as far as I can tell, Transcend is implying that you're a gimmick account here.<br>158: I can't recall now why I marked this as a post I dislike, and since I'm thinking about it now, I don't really feel like it's bad anymore.<br>164: Creature's post 164 changed my mind about Io's post 81. I guess I should've made that more clear.<br>197: I don't understand what you mean by this.<br>199: yeah, as I said to Transcend, this is some bad reasoning based on a misinterpretation on my part of how neighborhoods work.<br><br>-----------------------<br>I figured out from context that TvT probably means \"town vs town\"! I'm so proud of myself for figuring that out even though <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commonly_Used_Abbreviations\" class=\"postlink\">it's not on the abbreviations page</a>. anyway, I'm going to give some thought to the possibiity that that's what's going on with me and Transcend, because it wouldn't be the first time that me and another town player with very different playstyles mutually tunnel each other, so even though I find Transcend scummy, I don't want to ignore the possibility that that's because of my own cognitive biases.<br><br>I mostly like Naomi-Tan's reads list in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293460#p8293460\">post 518</a>; I think the fact that she goes into some detail for each person about how her reads have evolved is a good thing. that said, pointing out that you dislike someone's attitude and that it doesn't seem very nice while voting for that person kind of feels like you're just tacking on another reason to vote them that isn't actually relevant to their alignment. you also seem to imply that a lot of your reads are close to null, which isn't necessarily great.<br><br>I really dislike the fact that Transcend is pretty much openly choosing not to engage with certain portions of the game. Vedith seems to kind of be doing the same with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293846#p8293846\">post 523</a>.<br><br>I'm planning on doing more re-read posts, and I'll try to format them in such a way that it's easier to go through them. I tend to have an easier time processing information about the game if it's been a few days since I first read it, which is largely why I've used that format."}

(I realize my rants can make no sense and hard to follow, but trust me it just doesn't look right if you can get what I'm trying to say.)

I do not think Verdith will be scum with Light. It seams way to incredibly convenient that almost every single player scum reads Verdith but there is disagreeing with Light.<br>It makes most sense for 2 scum (Xyzzy and Light) to push Verdith and have another scum (I think Seraphim) to bus Light and frame Verdith with the bus. Again Xyzzy said he thought it derailing to bring up the daychat as it was irrelevant, but the daychat would lead to a well thought out scum plan which is what this looks like.<br><br>TLDR:<br>Verdith is Town<br>Light and Xyzzy are very likely a scum team.<br>Seraphim is also a pretty good shot to be in the scum team."}

A part of that case, which multiple people have now mentioned (Transcend, Creature) is that Vedith and light's interactions look like distancing/bussing. Hence, my Vedith vote. I could come up with more but I have a feeling that no one would read it because no one else seems to be reading the same game as me.

Do I have to continue with this question?<br>OK, but seriously you would be the most likely person I see to bus Light. I wouldn't want to lynch you now as I think Xyzzy is a much better candidate and you could still have easily been in the wrong place and the wrong time, but I do not think highly of you and really I need to see Xyzzy flip red before I would consider pushing hard for your lynch.<br><br>As for your questions.<br>It's pretty obvious Xyzzy was defending Light and people still were not giving their opinions on the matter such as Massive, Skelda, and obviously your predecessor never gave any opinions.<br>Consensus is that it was not unanimous.<br><br>As for the Verdith opposition include myself, who I know is Town already, and Skelda who just has no opinion on the topic.<br>Thus the pretty obvious conclusion is that if everyone but a single person (myself not included) say 1 player is scum something is clearly wrong because that means either the entire Mafia chose to bus that one person immediately, or they have to be town. The flip from Light doesn't help make Verdith look more scummy it does the opposite if anything. <br>Really 2 Mafia bussing each other is something I just refuse to acknowledge as a valid argument as for why Verdith is scum because that is the single stupidest thing I have ever heard.<br>Literally any townie should be able to step back and look at that and think that something has to be wrong for all of the Town and scum to want to lynch Verdith. You can see it as a bus sure, but then that doesn't explain a dual bus because to push a dual bus for almost the whole game is absurd and makes no sense for a Mafia with daychat to even do. That entire plan would revolve around the Mafia having 1 member bus the other 2 to be pretty much confirmed Town which is the worst gamble I have ever seen.<br>The fact that I am having to explain to you how stupid you and anyone thinking Verdith is scum is absurd.<br><br>Oh and I forgot to say this in the last post, but really anyone still considering a scum dayvig...I really can't express my disappointment in your critical thinking skills. \"Mod being allowed 1 abnormal role makes scum dayvig very likely\" is just...*sigh* no real words can describe how bad that argument is.

It would make much more sense to just vote on the wagon or tell him to claim a pr or something. Wagon form and fall apart quickly on day 1, so it was likely that if I hadn't shot light then he wouldn't have even gotten lynched. No matter how often you say it, Verith is not \"obv town\". He's null at best and that's being a little generous. Why do you even townread xyzzy? I'm not voting sera right now because you've been illogical throughout the game so far and I don't want to follow someone like that. Yeah, jord was scummy. But sera has been decent. I don't know what to make of him so far. But xyzzy's posts are really awkward and light had them as high up on his reads list without saying why. I think it's better to go after xyzzy</div></blockquote><br>Blitz, reply to this please</div></blockquote><br><br>1) Towncred <span class=\"noboldsig\">you'd still get towncred from being on the wagon. Why would you waste a big shot instead of voting? Also, it's effing impossible to have a scum day vig in a normal game!</span><br>2) Vedith is obvious town. Sorry. No matter how much shade you both throw, he has conflict with all scum so... <span class=\"noboldsig\">youre the only one who sees him as obv town, so he's clearly not obv town </span><br>3) Because you're pushing him, he's solving the game and you two are desperately deflecting onto anyone scumhunting that is not you. You're attempting to have me prove everyone else town to avoid your terrible association with Light. Then, you just pick the weakest town case and argue it's not enough. Not playing that game. <span class=\"noboldsig\">hes not solving the game, almost all of his posts are worded awkwardly, light had him high on his reads list and never said high, he barely posts and he started sheeping you as soon as the wagon on him formed. It's extremely likely that he's scum. I don't have an association with light and you need to stop don't biasing.</span><br>4) Here's the mysterious \"illogical\" insult rather that responding to the case on Sera. The fact I believe you are scum is not a tenet in my case on Sera. You saw they slipped and voted ten. Now that there's another wagon, suddenly I am illogical. <span class=\"noboldsig\">its not mysterious or sudden. You've been illogical ever since the vig shot. The normal reaction to someone shooting scum isn't \"you must be scum too!\" And it's not logical to become 100% convinced of a bs read like this even though it goes against the guidelines of a normal game. You really need to take a step back and look at what you've been doing.</span><br>5) It's not better to go after town while you insult me for going after scum. It's the only move you have left as I am not Looney tunes sounding if scum can have a dayvig. <span class=\"noboldsig\"> you're going after town  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> </span></div></blockquote>"}

I'm not voting sera right now because you've been illogical throughout the game so far and I don't want to follow someone like that. Yeah, jord was scummy. But sera has been decent.

This leads me to believe that either one of creature or KTS is scum. At the time I backed off the arguement as I wanted it to play out naturally and see where it would lead though I miss informed everyone at the time as i wished there reactions to be true without outside influence that may scare scum. I feel I failed as my little comment got KTS to back down and he hasn't pushed since. This however doesn't stop my hunt. Lets revisit another thing.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8319020#p8319020\" class=\"postlink\">post 1158</a>, Killthestory wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8318990#p8318990\" class=\"postlink\">post 1156</a>, Naomi-Tan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8318977#p8318977\" class=\"postlink\">post 1155</a>, Killthestory wrote:</cite>hey creature what happened to me being scum?<br><br>Did your team tell you to push someone else?</div></blockquote><br><br>Go on...? expand please, how you know he has a team?</div></blockquote><br>shh just wait Naomi</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8318934#p8318934\" class=\"postlink\">post 1153</a>, Naomi-Tan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8318866#p8318866\" class=\"postlink\">post 1148</a>, Creature wrote:</cite>Also, I really doubt massive is a mafia NK.</div></blockquote><br><br>Im going to put this quote away for much later (not a post today but MUCH later)</div></blockquote><br><br>It is now MUCH Later and I will expand what I meant at the time.

XYZZY for a pretty bad reason saying themselves that they thought they was town. At the time they had them down in a list of people he wished wouldn't reach the end game. <br><br>Now.. Here comes the tricky part; What is KTS? Or what information does he have? At that stage Creature Soft claimed Vig and given his read matches the kill and the fact that scum motivation wise. the only thing that could be a factor is massive saying light and jorridy are linked. I feel the following situation is more likely<br><br>\u2022 Creature chooses to Vig Massive as they suspect them<br>\u2022 KTS // Mafia Rolecops Creature to work out if he is worth killing (as if he had no PR they could leave him up as a person to read lylo to lead to a miss lynch or otherwise outplay but confirming no PR helped) <br>\u2022 Seeing as most people have a townish veiw of KTS they get him to do the pressure (or he does it of his own free will) starting to ask leading questions to try and lay the foundations for a miss lynch<br>\u2022 When I question it they back off thinking that maybe I too have some information<br>\u2022 KTS Switches his thoughts on the matter and acts like he was just suspicious of the new read.<br><br>This leads me to the following conclusion; I was the target of the night kill but was saved (by a doc or some other protective role) This makes sense as I have been killed by mafia in pretty much all my town games of late Night 1 and everyone was town reading me at the time. The rolecop got information on creature and scum decided to attempt his miss lynch to prevent another vig shot and creature shot massive.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: KTS</span><br><br>Did you guys miss me XD"}

Jorda moves to the null tier because I decided that his reaction to the BW could easily be faked when I initially dismissed it as town.<br>5. Pretty sure xyzzy was the only person I've had in the bottom tier, but I've now moved Vedith there. His vote compared to his reads looks inconsistent and he's never justified himself.<br>6. Massive's analysis of xyzzy was really good and something I agreed with. He didn't go too far in depth but he moves into the more townier than not tier.<br>7. Skelda's vote on KTS doesn't look like a wolf vote so I also put him in the same tier as massive.<br>8. I have 3 people in the scum tiers now as opposed to 5. Obviously I expect to be wrong on at least one, but I'd like to think I have at least one wolf in the bottom 3 tiers to focus on.

I feel like most likely at most 1 person on that wagon is scum, so if Jordarrian dies, looking at how those 3 people all interacted with him will be a decent source of information.<br>50: post 50 is definitely not a strong tell, but in general, I feel like pointing out information that is theoretically obvious but that could still be used to mislead the town is a slight town tell.<br>67: it just doesn't feel legitimate to me. I don't have a strong reason for believing this, but it doesn't feel like a pro-town action.<br>76: I tend to not be a huge fan of meaningless tautological statements, but despite my misgivings toward them, I've found that they're not really a scum tell.<br><br>122: I don't think trying to work out that info is unusual, but I think the manner in which Transcend responds to that question could provide info.<br>135: correcting other players' typos feels like an attempt to subtly make someone look like less of an important contributor to the game without actually meaningfully saying anything about their arguments.<br>142: the \"can you guess why\" part is the part I like.<br>152: that's fair. while sharing gut reads is an acceptable thing to do imo, not sharing them is just fine too, and I think your reasons for doing so are valid.<br>161: just so it's clear, my longer posts generally involve a lot of ISO-checking.<br>184: \"they're annoying\" isn't a valid reason to lynch someone (it's entirely possible for a town player to be annoying or for a scum player to be the most charming person in the game), and agreeing with that statement without adding anything to it at all doesn't feel good to me.<br><br>5: as I said, it's probably completely irrelevant, but it has the potential to feel noteworthy later on.<br>6: even though this is a non-serious post, I feel like in general town is a little more likely to make that kind of post, even if it's 100% a joke.<br>20: I don't feel like finding post 19 and post 20 both slightly town-leaning contradictory, but I see where you're coming from.<br>24: I think it's reasonable to expect people to say something about whatever's going on in the game if possible. as I said, I think on its own it's a null tell, but if someone has a lot of posts where they're just saying things without really contributing to any ongoing conversation, that's not great.<br>29: I'm not sure I fully understand what you're getting at here.<br>61: I screwed up my own grammar here--basically, what I meant was that someone could (incorrectly) decide that light_ganski's post 25 was scummy, and the fact that you pointed out that it isn't is fine. I had no issues with post 25.<br>86: this is something that I noted around that point during this re-read, although I guess pointing it out at post 86 wasn't super clear.<br><br>123/124: I don't feel like quoting three posts and simply saying \"these don't sound genuine\" without any additional commentary is a substantial reason to focus on someone as scummy; I still don't have a strong sense of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> Transcend finds those posts non-genuine, just that he does.<br>277: this was in response to BlackStar's comment in 276 about Transcend frequently wagon hopping. the fact that Killthestory suggested that Transcend get on a wagon and then he immediately did just seems interesting to me.<br><br>88: I'm not sure what you mean by this. as far as I can tell, Transcend is implying that you're a gimmick account here.<br>158: I can't recall now why I marked this as a post I dislike, and since I'm thinking about it now, I don't really feel like it's bad anymore.<br>164: Creature's post 164 changed my mind about Io's post 81. I guess I should've made that more clear.<br>197: I don't understand what you mean by this.<br>199: yeah, as I said to Transcend, this is some bad reasoning based on a misinterpretation on my part of how neighborhoods work.<br><br>-----------------------<br>I figured out from context that TvT probably means \"town vs town\"! I'm so proud of myself for figuring that out even though <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commonly_Used_Abbreviations\" class=\"postlink\">it's not on the abbreviations page</a>. anyway, I'm going to give some thought to the possibiity that that's what's going on with me and Transcend, because it wouldn't be the first time that me and another town player with very different playstyles mutually tunnel each other, so even though I find Transcend scummy, I don't want to ignore the possibility that that's because of my own cognitive biases.<br><br>I mostly like Naomi-Tan's reads list in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293460#p8293460\">post 518</a>; I think the fact that she goes into some detail for each person about how her reads have evolved is a good thing. that said, pointing out that you dislike someone's attitude and that it doesn't seem very nice while voting for that person kind of feels like you're just tacking on another reason to vote them that isn't actually relevant to their alignment. you also seem to imply that a lot of your reads are close to null, which isn't necessarily great.<br><br>I really dislike the fact that Transcend is pretty much openly choosing not to engage with certain portions of the game. Vedith seems to kind of be doing the same with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293846#p8293846\">post 523</a>.<br><br>I'm planning on doing more re-read posts, and I'll try to format them in such a way that it's easier to go through them.

(only happening when people read back, or iso) and because of this he is disregarding most of the posts like.. 'Show me where people say your town. but anything that is a read list doesn't count' is just really dumb. Then he didn't even examine the posts and from what I can tell just looked for the words 'Naomi is town' Its like they asked for the content then ignored it rather than thinking on it &gt;_&lt; also I have no idea how he is getting KTS called me scum from any of those posts it just boggles my mind.

If this was !Scum motivated I could at least see a reason behind it but this is a TvT over stupid things because V is paranoid and can't accept that I am me. despite me going to unreasonable lengths to prove it.

TvT means two people are interacting to try and make the other look worse with both of them being town. there are higher odds of a TvT interaction than not a TvT interaction<br><br>As for your speach thing, its all most like we been talking for nearly 2000 posts in a thread or something and Vedith is much longer to type than V I have no idea who called you V first. but it is quicker. I picked up KTS from another thread too as town so its not like its something I don't do. Using this as a scum tell is NAI/Bad town play. As you can just pick up speech patterns from In thread like i have over the course of this game."}

Well from what I see D1 their lack of opinions could have been a reason to scum read Skelda, but looking at them now not only does Skelda have reads, Skelda is actually changing their reads too even willing to admit they were probably wrong about Naomi being scum and flipping to a Naomi town read (Not that I fully agree with it). Skelda was also defending Seraph a bit before Rach stepped in to help the slot.<br>The only thing I found somewhat scummy from reading their ISO was the conflicting messages between who should be claiming and not claiming in 1104 and 1111, but even then those aren't even really that scummy because we did lynch Xyzzy and Seraph didn't even claim which is what Skelda was advocating for.<br><br>I'm just not really seeing it now that I went back to reevaluate Skelda.

You bus your partner on day one and either get them lynched and earn town cred or get in a big fight with them to distance the two of you before you eventually change your mind and decide not to get them lynched.

I think blitz is scummy, I want Vedith gone as they have pushed me the wrong way, and I don't believe your RC so think your scum. At the start of the day I had a null read on Vedith (if I remember correctly) and I had a town read on yourself and didn't like blitz yesterday. When Vedith pushed me hard I got really flustered and checked his iso and didn't like it so voted them. then when I calmed down I still wanted to vote them because they upset me. I joined your train in order to push a roleclaim So I knew if my information was gonna help get us a lynch (if you lied) and when you claimed BP I didn't believe it. Post that point my vote has only jumped to those 3 trains all of which I don't object to right now. I hope you find this answer to your liking."}

To my knowellege we are not in LYLO anyway so this is a dumb move by Scum. I will flip town and Vedith gets lynched tomorrow. Or they get lynched today either way works for me. If he is lying as town then he is a jackass who will cause this game to be a loss just because he believes i'm scum. (As I have thought of this and wouldn't put it past him)<br><br>I guess neo is kinda balanced in the game as I'm more likely to out a PR than I am to find scum TBH :/ least until a mass claim happened and I can start looking into the VT claims. Like yesterday when I outted KTS. (though at the time I thought his BP claim was totally fake which it turns out it was) If he had claimed body guard I'd been more likely to trust it (as I feel BP is much more powerful than body guard) But this is all speculation I dunno what went through the mods head. I do think that maybe one of the claims was false but thats just my gut read,"}

And even if it did that would just earn him town cred for getting a scum lynched. So that's not a compelling argument for transcend being town. It just looks like distancing. And their distancing was even more apparent on day 3. Transcend is just using reverse psychology on you right now and for some reason you're buying into it."}
