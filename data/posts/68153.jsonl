Just because a rule isn't stated here, doesn't mean it's acceptable - use common sense.<br>\n9.

Lynches require a majority of players. n/2 rounded down + 1<br>\n2. Voting must use vote tags (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>) or bolded text (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Player</div>)<br>\n3. I will accept nicknames as long as it is clear who is being voted<br>\n4. Place votes at the beginning of a line (With that being said, no trick votes, I reserve the right to count votes like that (or not) in a pinch)<br>\n5. Once a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight. People can still talk, but no voting or unvoting will be counted.<br>\n6. A Nolynch occurs when the deadline runs out and a majority has not been recieved, or when it is voted for by the majority<br>\n7. Actions follow the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>. <br>\n8. Day phases last 14 days, night phases last 2 days.<br>\n9. Night phase will never end early.<br>\n10. I will extend the deadline at my discretion if needed.<br>\n11. Players will flip with their full role ability name and alignment<br>\n12. Flavour that may or may not exist in this game is just that - flavour with no bearing on anyone's role or alignment <br>\n13. All roles were assigned randomly<br>\n14: At least one player has the following role PM:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome &lt;Player&gt;, to Mini #1827<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Vanilla Townie</div>, aligned with the <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Town</div><br>\n<br>\nYou have no special abilities.

{"number": 48, "id": "8281008", "user": "Naomi-Tan", "user_id": "19768", "content": "Hello everyone,. I'm Naomi. I have a problem with my mindset in general. As both scum and town I fear getting lynched and sometimes that drives me to inaction. Additionally I doubt myself and never feel that my reads are very good and because of this i'm not the strongest arguer as in the back of my mind I'm always doubting myself. so.. I come off as unsure. My solution to fixing this has been to ask questions and being very open and honest wherever possible. beacuse even if I'm bad at scum hunting at least I can support town by keeping activity high. I like doing regular read lists as well so people can get an idea of what I'm thinking (every 10 pages or so) When I wake up I normally do a larger 'catchup' post followed by shorter reaction posts over the course of the day. Because of this I also tend to do lots of LAMIST moves beacuse Im always worried people will want me gone as I'm not very good. Scum tend to use this to there advantage sometimes.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason I'm opening with this is my mind set follows a more scum meta when, for me, its really NAI as I just havn't managed to get past the idea that by lynched and I don't want to die.. and thats a problem but.. as I can't really do anything about it I been taking to attempting to announce this when playing to help town out. I also find it helps if I'm honest about it early on as it's going to come out through my gameplay and its hard to defend this play style. <br>\n<br>\nI expect this post will be a hot topic down the line for both Scum!Naomi and Town!Naomi but Thats just the kinda player I am. Also I normally get a handful of votes for this post from people who declare; \"She is setting up for later\" which is true. this is setting up for when people point and say I'm being LAMIST and for when people notice my unsure mindset and habbit of backing off because my meta is strange..", "time": "Fri Aug 26, 2016 12:47 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68153&start=25", "forum": "53", "thread": "68153"}

No better than mine though so eh? But anyway they seem to ask pretty okay questions. but this wasn't the focus of my iso. It was to check your statement and tbh I'm not seeing it from your perspective. They have done 8 posts so far 2 of which was RVS (which arguably we are still in kinda?) some stuff talking about general game meta (the day talk, Putting people L-2) but when it comes to your statement I find it rather perplexing. Not sure what else to say on this topic.<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT; Hey looks like my activity stimuli has kicked in! but can you cover your scum reads as they are most important to game flow? (I know you said 3 but Scum reads are the important ones as it allows to cross check for fake reasoning)<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT2; I haven't been asked for explanations on anything because so far I haven't given out many reads As far as I'm concerned I like Transcend for his early read list (though I'm currently squeezing it for more information to assist town and to try and get a more active scum hunting // create discussions over stuff to get the ball flowing a little better.) and KTS ...... And then KTS was moved back to null.. just noticed the entire game he has been using friendly terms and acting like I'm town which is extremely strange as we are not linked in a role (aka we are not masons//lovers) and I don't think I've done anything too townie yet. I guess this is a strange case of me thinking he was being too friendly? he also uses terms like I'm always right.. so i'm kinda suspecting psychological tactics are at play there, or he is just being really friendly and nice and reads me as town and I'm being paranoid..  Could I get some 3rd party opinions on this matter in relation to his interactions with myself?<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT3; Give me a chance to type XD", "time": "Sat Aug 27, 2016 12:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68153&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "68153"}

If you had such a scummy vibe from y first post you have no reason to wait until other people being up it being scum if you were town. Not to mention your second reason for scum reason me is me not voting when you couldn't be bothered to start a wagon on me until another person placed a vote.<br>\n<br>\nAs for what you actually said about the post as well as Naomi the first part was filler yeah it was a joke I don't even know how you didn't even think that was a joke. The second part was just me pointing out how Kill was not 100% right in his statement and plus no one even town slipped so what are you wen trying to get at? The third part wasn't even anything to do with scumhuting or even anything remotely related to what you said as that part was me asking a question about what would likely be in a setup. The 4th part was me criticizing you for trying to put words in Kill's mouth ecausse he never said everyone but Jord was town which you were saying he was implying.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Creature</span>", "time": "Sat Aug 27, 2016 4:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68153&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "68153"}

Sure that could be true if you are town, but as town you had no reason to hide evidence for me being scum whereas scum could just as easily say they think someone is scum and allow a townie to go through to work of making a reasoned argument and claim the exact same thing.

It comes off and looks like activity however anyone can give a list of names like that, you may do it strongest to weakest player or how you think generally town is but votes with no data are just that no data nothings that cannot be used to either find your alignment or read your true views other than eliminating other targets.

You shouldn't need to include yourself in a read list and its a little tacky. LAMIST ) Next Thing I notice is he crossed out all the most active towny players. myself KTS and Transcend. then there is xyzzy not crossed out despite him thinking he was town earlier and all the weaker town left in with two acceptations; Blackstar and Jordaman. Now if I had to guess he included one scum buddy in his town list and didn't include another. the XYZZY elimination could been done for distancing and as for the scum left in I'd suspect blackstar for the IO vote this of course is speculation on my part. but my veiw stands that a few of these reads are really off hilter and reads that I really cannot see. for example black star and XYZZY's play is pretty close but one posted more recently and moving on.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8283202#p8283202\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8283202#p8283202\" data-post-id=\"8283202\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 230</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27374\">Creature</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8283192#p8283192\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8283192#p8283192\" data-post-id=\"8283192\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 228</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27554\">Io</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8283164#p8283164\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8283164#p8283164\" data-post-id=\"8283164\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 223</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27374\">Creature</a> wrote:</cite>I am actually tempted to whiteknight Io.</div></blockquote>\nI don even know what that means.</div></blockquote>\nHard defend someone.</div></blockquote>\nFinally this flip flop changing from trying to get an IO train started to considering to protect them, normally speaking when you think someone is scum you don't rotate on a dial as it is. as im Scum reading them I'm seeing this as them trying to backtrack after biting off a bit more than they can chew.<br>\n<br>\nMy scum veiw on creature is not comprised of a single post but multiple posts as you can now see.

Realistically, no.<br>\nI mean it is a game so everyone should be playing towards their wincon and town usually sets the meta and mafia mimic the meta in theory.<br>\nBut the problem with theory is that it doesn't apply in all cases as you have some people who play town differently than others and scum who play scum differently than others. When it comes to making posts someone's style of post is more often than not just going to be how they usually post no matter if they are scum or town, alignment comes into play when making reads and how they go about making accusations.

{"number": 518, "id": "8293460", "user": "Naomi-Tan", "user_id": "19768", "content": "1. xyzzy - town. Before the did read I did just above this post I had them as null as They haddn't contributed and that was starting to scum lean as they was posting just nothing of substance. however, after reading there big Summery blocks I found myself flipping back and forth and saw there reads mutating as they posted as well to me this would be truely hard for scum to replicate and there thoughts stayed consistent through out (bar one acception) after looking over it all I struggle to believe they could have scum motivations. <br>\n<br>\n2. Transcend - okay so before the iso I had them as town, however during this look over they appear to be pushing XYZZY which after diving into there post head first I'm totally town solid right now. which is tarnishing my read on them. To me it looks like a TvT fight and thats sorta eh? I guess I'm slightly less sure of my town read than before so.. slight town?<br>\n<br>\n3. light_ganski - Pre-Iso Slight town read, post Iso; Slight scum read I don't like how they rarely talk about good posting and town posting (there read list being there only here are town people post) I also dislike how they had pistachi0n as town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8285423#p8285423\">294</a> it seems weird they would get that vibe after just 4 posts.<br>\n<br>\n4. massive - I went it with a pretty null veiw into the ISO. Now; Eh.. kinda scum-Nullish I feel that they havn't posted enough to warrent a scummy read but They are pushing someone I now town read and It feels pretty.. weak? I dunno.. This ones got me on the fence a little I feel that they might be scum or not.. this one is hard.. Gut plays a large part here but I also don't like how there only town read is me (because I feel by now I'm obvious as a flare) Which seems kinda off to me. and even then they never said I was town but just implied they thought that. Its really award. I also don't buy there scum slip argument :/ oh yeah and post more<br>\n<br>\n5. Jordarrian - This guy dropped off the face of the earth I don't even remember them So.. IF I have to ISO to remember you, you should post more; And after reading we get another null (but with a slightly smaller hint of scummy) I dislike how we have literally no analysis to go off of in the last 10 pages(well 11 now) but they do make town comments on occasion They really havn't spoken much though and that makes me kinda lean a little scummy just because of the lurk factor. however, they are still pretty null.<br>\n<br>\n6. Killthestory - Okay... so last time I did one of these read lists I had KTS as null as I felt that his constant naomi is towning was impairing my judgement fortunately he didn't do as much this phrase and also didn't do much else really Time for a controversial read. after my ISO (230 - present) I'm slight scum reading him. all of his posts seem to be about him being great at scum hunting with very little scum hunting going on all very fluffy and with no meat to it. this doesn't leave me with a real pro-town feel <br>\n<br>\n7. BlackStar - Okay had a slight scum read on him earlier from his look at IO and his statements saying X is scummy while doing X (See every time I mention glass houses) I only recently said this and Before Iso I'd still be there so lets see if the ISO changes my mind. and after reviewing.. I have them as a slight town. there posting style seems close to mine with little posts scattered throughout with little bits of content this leaves a smaller impact on there own but when looked over in bulk they make a more soild stance on town blackstar. They also seem the type who is weaker in the early game.<br>\n<br>\n8. Creature - okay final ISO, Last time I looked at creature I concluded they was town and focused them for the last 250 posts or so, but putting that aside lets re-read them and see if I feel they are more townie. ISO; Okay starting off his defence is flimsy at best as if he wasn't expecting it his links to meta (even though I didn't read it) could be a thing he does as town. the fact he multi-sourced it makes me think its very likely to be true. so I'll continue this Iso thinking on that; I dislike his pushing of IO (still) and I also don't like his lynch list including the idle players.. ; eh.. I guess I can slightly more see a Town!Creature right now. as unlikely as that is, but if V or Light flipped town I'd be back on him. I'm gonna be reducing my scum read on him enough to switch votes to V<br>\n<br>\n9. Skelda - Firstly If I have to ISO to remember you, you need to post more often; Null yup.. They agree with my KTS thoughts right now (and appear to have beaten me to the punch though I didn't know it till now (this is the second to last iso btw Im doing it in order from most to least sure)) and yeah I like how they gave a controversial read that was unlikely to get traction and may of resulted in there lynch but there activity is lacking at best... Eh lets raise them to slight town. giving benafit of the doubt on thinking on it.<br>\n<br>\n10. Vedith - Before Isoing I'm slight scum reading them. they tunnelled blackstar hard (and this is kinda half iso result from the other stuff I looked at) so.. I'm not sure if anything will change so I'm going to read back over. Bleh, that Iso was not any better. reading this toxic attitude is nasty. <br>\n<br>\n11. pistachi0n - Mild scum read. they don't post very often and when they do they don't say much. at least I make up for my inactive times by mega posts and smaller comments as we proceed. they also don't go deep into there thoughts saying things like; \"I am townreading creature and the creature wagon is scum\" - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8288155#p8288155\">406</a><br>\n<br>\n12. Io - I like there content. they don't post very often but when they do its a more bulky post which always has some manner of content. least pre-iso; and post Iso too. Awesome Likely town<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Vedith</span> I feel they been joking most of the game and hasn't contributed much and goes berserk when pressured I also don't really like there attitude as it doesn't seem very nice.<br>\n<br>\nSo Final thing from town to scum<br>\n<br>\nTOWN<br>\n<br>\nXYZZY<br>\nIO<br>\nTranscend<br>\nBlackstar &amp; light_ganski<br>\nSkelda<br>\nJordarrian <br>\nKTS &amp; Massive<br>\nCreature<br>\npistachi0n  &amp; Vedith<br>\n<br>\nSCUM", "time": "Tue Aug 30, 2016 4:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68153&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "68153"}

I could see it being a bussing situation, though.<br>\n<br>\n-------------------------<br>\n<br>\nhere's some responses to Naomi-Tan's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293304#p8293304\">post 510</a> (which contain responses to my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8287633#p8287633\">post 381</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8287728#p8287728\">post 402</a>):<br>\n<br>\n19: even though it's a fairly obvious point, I doubt scum would directly acknowledge an idea like this that can only benefit the town. if any member of the town hadn't already come to this conclusion and Killthestory is scum, then this post is Killthestory saying \"hey, by the way, here's a thing I might do that you should pay attention to,\" and that seems unlikely.<br>\n27/28: Creature's post 27 seems like it's trying to set Jordarrian up to make a mistake if he's scum; Jordarrian completely avoids taking the bait, which isn't an extremely strong town tell, but it's definitely not a scum tell.<br>\n32-34: because the Jordarrian wagon came out of nowhere, once any of those 4 people are dead, it'll be a little bit more feasible to infer information about possible connections between them. I feel like most likely at most 1 person on that wagon is scum, so if Jordarrian dies, looking at how those 3 people all interacted with him will be a decent source of information.<br>\n50: post 50 is definitely not a strong tell, but in general, I feel like pointing out information that is theoretically obvious but that could still be used to mislead the town is a slight town tell.<br>\n67: it just doesn't feel legitimate to me. I don't have a strong reason for believing this, but it doesn't feel like a pro-town action.<br>\n76: I tend to not be a huge fan of meaningless tautological statements, but despite my misgivings toward them, I've found that they're not really a scum tell.<br>\n<br>\n122: I don't think trying to work out that info is unusual, but I think the manner in which Transcend responds to that question could provide info.<br>\n135: correcting other players' typos feels like an attempt to subtly make someone look like less of an important contributor to the game without actually meaningfully saying anything about their arguments.<br>\n142: the \"can you guess why\" part is the part I like.<br>\n152: that's fair. while sharing gut reads is an acceptable thing to do imo, not sharing them is just fine too, and I think your reasons for doing so are valid.<br>\n161: just so it's clear, my longer posts generally involve a lot of ISO-checking.<br>\n184: \"they're annoying\" isn't a valid reason to lynch someone (it's entirely possible for a town player to be annoying or for a scum player to be the most charming person in the game), and agreeing with that statement without adding anything to it at all doesn't feel good to me.<br>\n<br>\n5: as I said, it's probably completely irrelevant, but it has the potential to feel noteworthy later on.<br>\n6: even though this is a non-serious post, I feel like in general town is a little more likely to make that kind of post, even if it's 100% a joke.<br>\n20: I don't feel like finding post 19 and post 20 both slightly town-leaning contradictory, but I see where you're coming from.<br>\n24: I think it's reasonable to expect people to say something about whatever's going on in the game if possible. as I said, I think on its own it's a null tell, but if someone has a lot of posts where they're just saying things without really contributing to any ongoing conversation, that's not great.<br>\n29: I'm not sure I fully understand what you're getting at here.<br>\n61: I screwed up my own grammar here--basically, what I meant was that someone could (incorrectly) decide that light_ganski's post 25 was scummy, and the fact that you pointed out that it isn't is fine. I had no issues with post 25.<br>\n86: this is something that I noted around that point during this re-read, although I guess pointing it out at post 86 wasn't super clear.<br>\n<br>\n123/124: I don't feel like quoting three posts and simply saying \"these don't sound genuine\" without any additional commentary is a substantial reason to focus on someone as scummy; I still don't have a strong sense of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> Transcend finds those posts non-genuine, just that he does.<br>\n277: this was in response to BlackStar's comment in 276 about Transcend frequently wagon hopping. the fact that Killthestory suggested that Transcend get on a wagon and then he immediately did just seems interesting to me.<br>\n<br>\n88: I'm not sure what you mean by this. as far as I can tell, Transcend is implying that you're a gimmick account here.<br>\n158: I can't recall now why I marked this as a post I dislike, and since I'm thinking about it now, I don't really feel like it's bad anymore.<br>\n164: Creature's post 164 changed my mind about Io's post 81. I guess I should've made that more clear.<br>\n197: I don't understand what you mean by this.<br>\n199: yeah, as I said to Transcend, this is some bad reasoning based on a misinterpretation on my part of how neighborhoods work.<br>\n<br>\n-----------------------<br>\nI figured out from context that TvT probably means \"town vs town\"! I'm so proud of myself for figuring that out even though <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commonly_Used_Abbreviations\" class=\"postlink\">it's not on the abbreviations page</a>. anyway, I'm going to give some thought to the possibiity that that's what's going on with me and Transcend, because it wouldn't be the first time that me and another town player with very different playstyles mutually tunnel each other, so even though I find Transcend scummy, I don't want to ignore the possibility that that's because of my own cognitive biases.<br>\n<br>\nI mostly like Naomi-Tan's reads list in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293460#p8293460\">post 518</a>; I think the fact that she goes into some detail for each person about how her reads have evolved is a good thing. that said, pointing out that you dislike someone's attitude and that it doesn't seem very nice while voting for that person kind of feels like you're just tacking on another reason to vote them that isn't actually relevant to their alignment. you also seem to imply that a lot of your reads are close to null, which isn't necessarily great.<br>\n<br>\nI really dislike the fact that Transcend is pretty much openly choosing not to engage with certain portions of the game. Vedith seems to kind of be doing the same with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293846#p8293846\">post 523</a>.<br>\n<br>\nI'm planning on doing more re-read posts, and I'll try to format them in such a way that it's easier to go through them.

The only difference is that Xyzzy was scum reading Trancend for a while, but is now calling it just TVT which could be backing off realizing he couldn't push a Trans lynch but that's aside the point. Both of them are scum reading both Light and Verdith, and to a lesser extent Blackstar but Xyzzy just calls it a potential bus.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the interactions within both of them are odd to say the least.<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8287728#p8287728\" class=\"postlink\">420</a> mentions how Light's switching on their Naomi read looks \"ineresting\", but then still says they are a townie so it's like just pointing out a slightly scummyish post just for the sake of pointing it out but then just throwing away any real meaning attached to the point of calling it out. (I realize my rants can make no sense and hard to follow, but trust me it just doesn't look right if you can get what I'm trying to say.) Also the rest of his posts with light in them are kind of just filler, not buddying, scum reading, town reading, or really interacting at all.<br>\nAlso Light and Xyzzy just both kinda town read each other without really talking about it at all. The highest extent of interaction was <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8285426#p8285426\" class=\"postlink\">296</a> being a light defense of Xyzzy.<br>\n<br>\nI also want to mention how early both of them get onto the Creature wagon and never let it go.

I do not think Verdith will be scum with Light. It seams way to incredibly convenient that almost every single player scum reads Verdith but there is disagreeing with Light.<br>\nIt makes most sense for 2 scum (Xyzzy and Light) to push Verdith and have another scum (I think Seraphim) to bus Light and frame Verdith with the bus.

Do I have to continue with this question?<br>\nOK, but seriously you would be the most likely person I see to bus Light. I wouldn't want to lynch you now as I think Xyzzy is a much better candidate and you could still have easily been in the wrong place and the wrong time, but I do not think highly of you and really I need to see Xyzzy flip red before I would consider pushing hard for your lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAs for your questions.<br>\nIt's pretty obvious Xyzzy was defending Light and people still were not giving their opinions on the matter such as Massive, Skelda, and obviously your predecessor never gave any opinions.<br>\nConsensus is that it was not unanimous.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the Verdith opposition include myself, who I know is Town already, and Skelda who just has no opinion on the topic.<br>\nThus the pretty obvious conclusion is that if everyone but a single person (myself not included) say 1 player is scum something is clearly wrong because that means either the entire Mafia chose to bus that one person immediately, or they have to be town. The flip from Light doesn't help make Verdith look more scummy it does the opposite if anything. <br>\nReally 2 Mafia bussing each other is something I just refuse to acknowledge as a valid argument as for why Verdith is scum because that is the single stupidest thing I have ever heard.<br>\nLiterally any townie should be able to step back and look at that and think that something has to be wrong for all of the Town and scum to want to lynch Verdith. You can see it as a bus sure, but then that doesn't explain a dual bus because to push a dual bus for almost the whole game is absurd and makes no sense for a Mafia with daychat to even do. That entire plan would revolve around the Mafia having 1 member bus the other 2 to be pretty much confirmed Town which is the worst gamble I have ever seen.<br>\nThe fact that I am having to explain to you how stupid you and anyone thinking Verdith is scum is absurd.<br>\n<br>\nOh and I forgot to say this in the last post, but really anyone still considering a scum dayvig...I really can't express my disappointment in your critical thinking skills. \"Mod being allowed 1 abnormal role makes scum dayvig very likely\" is just...*sigh* no real words can describe how bad that argument is.

It would make much more sense to just vote on the wagon or tell him to claim a pr or something. Wagon form and fall apart quickly on day 1, so it was likely that if I hadn't shot light then he wouldn't have even gotten lynched. No matter how often you say it, Verith is not \"obv town\". He's null at best and that's being a little generous. Why do you even townread xyzzy? I'm not voting sera right now because you've been illogical throughout the game so far and I don't want to follow someone like that. Yeah, jord was scummy. But sera has been decent.

Why would you waste a big shot instead of voting? Also, it's effing impossible to have a scum day vig in a normal game!</div><br>\n2) Vedith is obvious town. Sorry. No matter how much shade you both throw, he has conflict with all scum so... <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">youre the only one who sees him as obv town, so he's clearly not obv town </div><br>\n3) Because you're pushing him, he's solving the game and you two are desperately deflecting onto anyone scumhunting that is not you.

Not playing that game. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hes not solving the game, almost all of his posts are worded awkwardly, light had him high on his reads list and never said high, he barely posts and he started sheeping you as soon as the wagon on him formed. It's extremely likely that he's scum. I don't have an association with light and you need to stop don't biasing.</div><br>\n4) Here's the mysterious \"illogical\" insult rather that responding to the case on Sera. The fact I believe you are scum is not a tenet in my case on Sera. You saw they slipped and voted ten. Now that there's another wagon, suddenly I am illogical. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">its not mysterious or sudden. You've been illogical ever since the vig shot. The normal reaction to someone shooting scum isn't \"you must be scum too!\" And it's not logical to become 100% convinced of a bs read like this even though it goes against the guidelines of a normal game. You really need to take a step back and look at what you've been doing.</div><br>\n5) It's not better to go after town while you insult me for going after scum. It's the only move you have left as I am not Looney tunes sounding if scum can have a dayvig. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> you're going after town  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> </div></div></blockquote>", "time": "Mon Sep 05, 2016 1:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68153&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "68153"}

I'm not voting sera right now because you've been illogical throughout the game so far and I don't want to follow someone like that. Yeah, jord was scummy. But sera has been decent.

The fact I believe you are scum is not a tenet in my case on Sera. You saw they slipped and voted ten.

The normal reaction to someone shooting scum isn't \"you must be scum too!\" And it's not logical to become 100% convinced of a bs read like this even though it goes against the guidelines of a normal game. You really need to take a step back and look at what you've been doing.</div><br>\n5) It's not better to go after town while you insult me for going after scum.

This leads me to believe that either one of creature or KTS is scum. At the time I backed off the arguement as I wanted it to play out naturally and see where it would lead though I miss informed everyone at the time as i wished there reactions to be true without outside influence that may scare scum. I feel I failed as my little comment got KTS to back down and he hasn't pushed since. This however doesn't stop my hunt.

This is a possible answer but wasn't the one I settled on in the end.<br>\n<br>\nMy final check was testing who read massive and how they read them. most people; my self included, had him down as a null however, there was one person who didn't Creature. a person who was suspected multiple times and read as a weaker town member at that stage who just miss lynched. XYZZY for a pretty bad reason saying themselves that they thought they was town. At the time they had them down in a list of people he wished wouldn't reach the end game. <br>\n<br>\nNow.. Here comes the tricky part; What is KTS? Or what information does he have? At that stage Creature Soft claimed Vig and given his read matches the kill and the fact that scum motivation wise. the only thing that could be a factor is massive saying light and jorridy are linked. I feel the following situation is more likely<br>\n<br>\n&#8226; Creature chooses to Vig Massive as they suspect them<br>\n&#8226; KTS // Mafia Rolecops Creature to work out if he is worth killing (as if he had no PR they could leave him up as a person to read lylo to lead to a miss lynch or otherwise outplay but confirming no PR helped) <br>\n&#8226; Seeing as most people have a townish veiw of KTS they get him to do the pressure (or he does it of his own free will) starting to ask leading questions to try and lay the foundations for a miss lynch<br>\n&#8226; When I question it they back off thinking that maybe I too have some information<br>\n&#8226; KTS Switches his thoughts on the matter and acts like he was just suspicious of the new read.<br>\n<br>\nThis leads me to the following conclusion; I was the target of the night kill but was saved (by a doc or some other protective role) This makes sense as I have been killed by mafia in pretty much all my town games of late Night 1 and everyone was town reading me at the time. The rolecop got information on creature and scum decided to attempt his miss lynch to prevent another vig shot and creature shot massive.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: KTS</span><br>\n<br>\nDid you guys miss me XD", "time": "Tue Sep 13, 2016 2:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68153&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "68153"}

I feel like most likely at most 1 person on that wagon is scum, so if Jordarrian dies, looking at how those 3 people all interacted with him will be a decent source of information.<br>\n50: post 50 is definitely not a strong tell, but in general, I feel like pointing out information that is theoretically obvious but that could still be used to mislead the town is a slight town tell.<br>\n67: it just doesn't feel legitimate to me. I don't have a strong reason for believing this, but it doesn't feel like a pro-town action.<br>\n76: I tend to not be a huge fan of meaningless tautological statements, but despite my misgivings toward them, I've found that they're not really a scum tell.<br>\n<br>\n122: I don't think trying to work out that info is unusual, but I think the manner in which Transcend responds to that question could provide info.<br>\n135: correcting other players' typos feels like an attempt to subtly make someone look like less of an important contributor to the game without actually meaningfully saying anything about their arguments.<br>\n142: the \"can you guess why\" part is the part I like.<br>\n152: that's fair. while sharing gut reads is an acceptable thing to do imo, not sharing them is just fine too, and I think your reasons for doing so are valid.<br>\n161: just so it's clear, my longer posts generally involve a lot of ISO-checking.<br>\n184: \"they're annoying\" isn't a valid reason to lynch someone (it's entirely possible for a town player to be annoying or for a scum player to be the most charming person in the game), and agreeing with that statement without adding anything to it at all doesn't feel good to me.<br>\n<br>\n5: as I said, it's probably completely irrelevant, but it has the potential to feel noteworthy later on.<br>\n6: even though this is a non-serious post, I feel like in general town is a little more likely to make that kind of post, even if it's 100% a joke.<br>\n20: I don't feel like finding post 19 and post 20 both slightly town-leaning contradictory, but I see where you're coming from.<br>\n24: I think it's reasonable to expect people to say something about whatever's going on in the game if possible. as I said, I think on its own it's a null tell, but if someone has a lot of posts where they're just saying things without really contributing to any ongoing conversation, that's not great.<br>\n29: I'm not sure I fully understand what you're getting at here.<br>\n61: I screwed up my own grammar here--basically, what I meant was that someone could (incorrectly) decide that light_ganski's post 25 was scummy, and the fact that you pointed out that it isn't is fine. I had no issues with post 25.<br>\n86: this is something that I noted around that point during this re-read, although I guess pointing it out at post 86 wasn't super clear.<br>\n<br>\n123/124: I don't feel like quoting three posts and simply saying \"these don't sound genuine\" without any additional commentary is a substantial reason to focus on someone as scummy; I still don't have a strong sense of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> Transcend finds those posts non-genuine, just that he does.<br>\n277: this was in response to BlackStar's comment in 276 about Transcend frequently wagon hopping. the fact that Killthestory suggested that Transcend get on a wagon and then he immediately did just seems interesting to me.<br>\n<br>\n88: I'm not sure what you mean by this. as far as I can tell, Transcend is implying that you're a gimmick account here.<br>\n158: I can't recall now why I marked this as a post I dislike, and since I'm thinking about it now, I don't really feel like it's bad anymore.<br>\n164: Creature's post 164 changed my mind about Io's post 81. I guess I should've made that more clear.<br>\n197: I don't understand what you mean by this.<br>\n199: yeah, as I said to Transcend, this is some bad reasoning based on a misinterpretation on my part of how neighborhoods work.<br>\n<br>\n-----------------------<br>\nI figured out from context that TvT probably means \"town vs town\"! I'm so proud of myself for figuring that out even though <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commonly_Used_Abbreviations\" class=\"postlink\">it's not on the abbreviations page</a>. anyway, I'm going to give some thought to the possibiity that that's what's going on with me and Transcend, because it wouldn't be the first time that me and another town player with very different playstyles mutually tunnel each other, so even though I find Transcend scummy, I don't want to ignore the possibility that that's because of my own cognitive biases.<br>\n<br>\nI mostly like Naomi-Tan's reads list in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293460#p8293460\">post 518</a>; I think the fact that she goes into some detail for each person about how her reads have evolved is a good thing. that said, pointing out that you dislike someone's attitude and that it doesn't seem very nice while voting for that person kind of feels like you're just tacking on another reason to vote them that isn't actually relevant to their alignment. you also seem to imply that a lot of your reads are close to null, which isn't necessarily great.<br>\n<br>\nI really dislike the fact that Transcend is pretty much openly choosing not to engage with certain portions of the game. Vedith seems to kind of be doing the same with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293846#p8293846\">post 523</a>.<br>\n<br>\nI'm planning on doing more re-read posts, and I'll try to format them in such a way that it's easier to go through them.

(only happening when people read back, or iso) and because of this he is disregarding most of the posts like.. 'Show me where people say your town. but anything that is a read list doesn't count' is just really dumb. Then he didn't even examine the posts and from what I can tell just looked for the words 'Naomi is town' Its like they asked for the content then ignored it rather than thinking on it &gt;_&lt; also I have no idea how he is getting KTS called me scum from any of those posts it just boggles my mind.

And he's said throughout the agen that he doesn't feel invested in it so it makes sense why he didn't seem to care much when he got \"shot\". I don't see any hidden agenda in his posts and he just looks like a townie who doesn't feel like doing much. The point of the fake shot was to look at the reactions of everyone else and see who would act opportunistically after it. Rachmarie stands out to me the most.

You said Vedith was pushing him hard on day 2 so they can't be partners. But Transcend was town read by most people at that point. Vedith knew that the wagon wasn't going to gain any traction. And even if it did that would just earn him town cred for getting a scum lynched. So that's not a compelling argument for transcend being town. It just looks like distancing.

And he's said throughout the agen that he doesn't feel invested in it so it makes sense why he didn't seem to care much when he got \"shot\". I don't see any hidden agenda in his posts and he just looks like a townie who doesn't feel like doing much. The point of the fake shot was to look at the reactions of everyone else and see who would act opportunistically after it. Rachmarie stands out to me the most.

I don't see any hidden agenda in his posts and he just looks like a townie who doesn't feel like doing much.
