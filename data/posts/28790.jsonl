Ugh, Trollie's alarm goes off, time to get up and smell the roses big boy!  Trollie starts speaking to his stuffed animals. \"Last night was totally AWESOME!\" he says, \"I got home from work, watched some TV, and cozied up in bed.  What a rad night, and today promises to be as unbelievably awesome as yesterday!\"  Trollie gets dressed and walks down stairs so he can get breakfast.  But something doesn't feel right...so he walks into his living room to find that, in the midst of all the awesome stuff that happened last night, thatguy's dead body has wound up on his coffee table.   \"who the fuck are all of these people in my living room?\" trollie exclaims.  It seems that the local circus-parade-robo-wonder show crew got derailed from their circus-parade-robo-wonder route, and were now lost in Trollie's living room.

Trollie gets out his Gorilla Glue and glues the dead body to the ceiling so that it is out of everybody's way.  <br><a href=\"http://searchforme.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/gorilla_glue.jpg\"><img style=\"max-width:200px;\" src=\"http://searchforme.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/gorilla_glue.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a><br>Then he locks all the doors and glues them up too.<br><br>\"none of you are leaving until we find out who did this,\" Trollie says, \"I am going back up to my room, and by the time I come back down you better have this all sorted out.\"  Trollie goes upstairs and slams the door shut in outrage.

I don't think anyone was asking you to read anyone who wasn't participating in the game. Saying that anyone who wasn't around by the time page 2 started could be scum just seems silly to me. Apparently I could be scum because I came in and told everyone I would be gone, and then the ones who had yet to post were scummy because they weren't in the game yet? That's extremely poor play from where I'm standing. From now on you should probably focus on reading those who are in the game rather than detracting from the game by saying anyone who isn't in it yet is suspicious. You call yourself newb so if you have questions please ask them. Also just because someone votes you (especially in RVS) doesn't make them any more scummy. RVS is random. You should forget the vote and move on. Seeing as you did have him lean scum (even only a little bit) you look more scummy now. If you were joking it wasn't obvious. Also if you are going to write inside of a quote you should format the changes (bold or a different color or something). Overall this does seem very newb but you've been a member since August? I might go looking for some meta on you soon.<br><br>Lets talk about the bw on Mr_Bungle. First of all I can agree that RVS in forum mafia doesn't do much, though everyone seems to think it does. However if someone starts to bandwagon in RVS it leans my suspicion toward them. If I was scum I think I'd go for someone who had no votes on them so that I wasn't bandwagoning though, so it goes both ways. Most of what I see in a game is that when someone is bw'd so fast (4 votes in less than 3 full pages?) is that they are probably town putting pressure on someone who COULD be scum, but that they typically are not. His reaction to the votes is almost too calm (almost as if he's overthinking it), but I'm willing to let that slide at this point, because I don't know the player. I'm unsure of Mr_Bungle but I don't think I want him lynched today, mostly because I think he could give some interesting information for the future. <br><br>As far as Mirari goes I don't think he/she/it/whatever would actually defend someone so openly if they were scum.<br><br>Infinity does seem to be leading but I like what he's saying at this point. Not pushing a vote but just leading discussion from where I'm standing."}

If we don't look for mafia in lurkers then all mafia has to do is lurk to win.  We have to examine everything.<br>5.  You didn't say that my doing that detracted from my other reads.

That is my opinion of what you did. I think exactly what inifinity said. Lurking scum has to come out at some point. Look at the content for reads rather than the non-content. Nothing drives me more crazy than people who try to use something that doesn't exist to support their read. Most scum show it in their content, and its still early in the game so there is no reason to call them out. Also, There's no reason to call me suspicious if you find me null, that's what i'm trying to say with your read on me. I do find that if you are detracting from the what you are saying as your actual reads, than you are detracting from the game. You're putting content in there that is useless which could be to take the spotlight away from your other reads, and it also causes us to talk about your reads and explain to you that they are null and not suspicious rather than talk about content that others have been posting."}

Often he's right - he's a very good player - but he's almost as good at giving the impression that he couldn't possibly be wrong when he's wrong plenty often. So when you see Fate train his sights on you you're facing up to the probability that people are just going to mindlessly lynch you on his say-so (and hey, look what's been starting to happen). It'd annoy me as scum that one player could get me lynched whereas often one player pegging you is survivable, but it'd also annoy me as town because it only takes one Fate to get a whole town to mislynch without much argument. You get me? So there's an inevitability when Fate turns his eye on you and at this point, having played with him both forum and face-to-face a good amount, I'm just going to sit here and go \"you really should be thinking more about this\"."}

If someone is playing within themselves, i.e. not playing as well as I know they can do, presumably going after them would mean that either they'd start playing better and probably wouldn't be such easy targets any more, or they'd continue to keep playing within themselves and I'd be justified in going after them.

Here I go, to the best of my ability:<br><br>Antagon - Well played with the investigation.  I probably would have claimed full cop just to bait the kill since u were macho and 1-shot and a doc already died so there was no point in them not trying to kill u, and then you could save other potential PRs, but it didn't matter in this game anyway, and it wouldn't have mattered in 9/10 games with this setup i think.  <br><br>Bub - was really looking forward to seeing this role play out.  Good target choice for night 1, I'd have been interested to see what would've happened had you not been killed.  <br><br>CDB - Good call with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5040521#p5040521\" class=\"postlink\">465</a> I was impressed with u catching some of the associative tells that other didn't for Reck, and also the stuff that cleared some of the townies listed.  Telo played a great game so not surprised u got thaat one wrong.  Ur lynch was probably dumb for town as i said in the Dead QT.  It was a prime example of where more discussion of associative tells/nks, VCA would have done town a huge service in this game.  <br><br>Fate - nice job on quadz.  Interested to know where that came from.  was it just gut/bs at first?  I thought quadz <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5005662#p5005662\" class=\"postlink\">#100</a> might have done it.  Ill talk about that when i get to quadz. Also nice job on being against the Mirari lynch.  <br><br>Glork - ur reads may have been a bit off this game but nonetheless you were playing really pro-town.  I was surprised your reads didn't gain more traction.  <br><br>Infinity - you played very pro-town as well.  Highly analytical and well thought out reads and posts.  good work.  <br><br>Maestro - HAHAHAHAHA! you fell for my lil trick.  My hope with this setup was that there would be mislynches due to people not believing the number of PR claims, but I never expected it to work out SO DAMN WELL.  Anyway, don't feel too shitty, I did plan the setup that way lol.  But yeah you should have probably been a bit more careful with the counterclaim to let ppl think about whether there could be 2 protective roles.  That Antagon cop really saved you D2.<br><br>Mirari - well, shucks.  stinks you had to go out the way you did but that happens sometimes.  I thought the content of your claim was SUPER town and believable because of the stuff about saying you thought i messed up on normalcy.  Fate had pointed that out and I was surprised other people didn't agree.  <br><br>quadz - well, what can you do? Cop gotcha.  The slip in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5005662#p5005662\" class=\"postlink\">#100</a> I was talking about is being worried about being \"super-outclassed at mafia-ing\" is pretty scummy.  Townies shouldn't really be worried about that.  If the other players are town thats good for your team, if they are scum, yeah, maybe they will outplay you but it shouldn't be as big a deal.  I think scum is more likely to be concerned about being caught, which means they are more likely to say something like that.  <br><br>rmpeacoc - u did well sticking to your reads.  a lot of them were reads others were resistant to (like the scum-fate one) and you probably could have benefitted from trying to get more out of the other players about why they disagreed with your reads instead of just continuing to push them.  I make the same mistake all the time.  <br><br>roflcopter - Glork was probably a good hide target N2, except I didn't really see any crumbing (may have missed it) and i think if glork was scum no one would have known it from ur death.  The N4 hide was probably a bad move given the situation town was in.  if you had lynched 1 more scum the hide would have been fine, but with 2 scum left that hide was damning to town.  Even if you thought Telo was town, he could have been NKed, leaving you in the same position as you were in.  <br><br>Telo - Glad you enjoyed my modding, I thoroughly enjoyed modding this game!  You played an amazing game.  really thats all I can say about it.<br><br>Reck - see, u can play scum dude.  Only comment I have is that i thought the infinity kill was sloppy.  Reason being you were really the only one so adamant about his being mod-confirmed town.  Not sure many other people in the game would have chosen that kill.  <br><br>And thats what i've got to say.  You all played very well and were great participants for my first Modding experience.  I'll be modding a Mini Theme shortly with Macbeth flavor (that Quadz and Reck both helped me with (and CES)).  If your interested in playing that shoot me a PM.<br><br>Until next time<br>--Trollie<br><br></span></span>"}
