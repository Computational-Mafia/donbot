Ugh, Trollie's alarm goes off, time to get up and smell the roses big boy!  Trollie starts speaking to his stuffed animals. \"Last night was totally AWESOME!\" he says, \"I got home from work, watched some TV, and cozied up in bed.  What a rad night, and today promises to be as unbelievably awesome as yesterday!\"  Trollie gets dressed and walks down stairs so he can get breakfast.  But something doesn't feel right...so he walks into his living room to find that, in the midst of all the awesome stuff that happened last night, thatguy's dead body has wound up on his coffee table.   \"who the fuck are all of these people in my living room?\" trollie exclaims.  It seems that the local circus-parade-robo-wonder show crew got derailed from their circus-parade-robo-wonder route, and were now lost in Trollie's living room.

I don't think anyone was asking you to read anyone who wasn't participating in the game. Saying that anyone who wasn't around by the time page 2 started could be scum just seems silly to me. Apparently I could be scum because I came in and told everyone I would be gone, and then the ones who had yet to post were scummy because they weren't in the game yet? That's extremely poor play from where I'm standing. From now on you should probably focus on reading those who are in the game rather than detracting from the game by saying anyone who isn't in it yet is suspicious. You call yourself newb so if you have questions please ask them. Also just because someone votes you (especially in RVS) doesn't make them any more scummy. RVS is random. You should forget the vote and move on. Seeing as you did have him lean scum (even only a little bit) you look more scummy now. If you were joking it wasn't obvious. Also if you are going to write inside of a quote you should format the changes (bold or a different color or something). Overall this does seem very newb but you've been a member since August? I might go looking for some meta on you soon.<br>\n<br>\nLets talk about the bw on Mr_Bungle. First of all I can agree that RVS in forum mafia doesn't do much, though everyone seems to think it does. However if someone starts to bandwagon in RVS it leans my suspicion toward them. If I was scum I think I'd go for someone who had no votes on them so that I wasn't bandwagoning though, so it goes both ways. Most of what I see in a game is that when someone is bw'd so fast (4 votes in less than 3 full pages?) is that they are probably town putting pressure on someone who COULD be scum, but that they typically are not. His reaction to the votes is almost too calm (almost as if he's overthinking it), but I'm willing to let that slide at this point, because I don't know the player. I'm unsure of Mr_Bungle but I don't think I want him lynched today, mostly because I think he could give some interesting information for the future. <br>\n<br>\nAs far as Mirari goes I don't think he/she/it/whatever would actually defend someone so openly if they were scum.<br>\n<br>\nInfinity does seem to be leading but I like what he's saying at this point.

Often he's right - he's a very good player - but he's almost as good at giving the impression that he couldn't possibly be wrong when he's wrong plenty often. So when you see Fate train his sights on you you're facing up to the probability that people are just going to mindlessly lynch you on his say-so (and hey, look what's been starting to happen). It'd annoy me as scum that one player could get me lynched whereas often one player pegging you is survivable, but it'd also annoy me as town because it only takes one Fate to get a whole town to mislynch without much argument. You get me?

I don't think so. I think it means the opposite. If someone is playing within themselves, i.e. not playing as well as I know they can do, presumably going after them would mean that either they'd start playing better and probably wouldn't be such easy targets any more, or they'd continue to keep playing within themselves and I'd be justified in going after them.
