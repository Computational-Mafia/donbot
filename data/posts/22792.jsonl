I voiced my top two suspects, one of which was the lead wagon for most of the day and the person I voted. I did not rally for people to vote or caps lock and call him obv-scum, but there was no reason for that. It was D1 and my read, though I considered it one of the best I had, was still not by any means air-tight. I did not fight against any wagons because really there were none.<br>\n<br>\n2. I disagree. Raaize was unprompted. My suspicion of McStab was not original, but my stating it in thread was not prompted. On top of this, add the fact that we're on page 10, 2 days into D2. That I haven't made a laundry list of accusations is hardly surprising or unusual. <br>\n<br>\nI see how parts of my play when taken alone could be interpreted as scum motivated, however I feel they are being over-analyzed and are perfectly reasonable behavior for a townie in the context of this game.", "time": "Thu Aug 02, 2012 12:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22792&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "22792"}

{"number": 342, "id": "4253450", "user": "FUT", "user_id": "19629", "content": "Good afternoon everyone, I am FUT, Formerly known as TUF, on DDO, where I normally play mafia. <br>\n<br>\nI am new to this site, and know that it is a little different from DDO mafia. One of the biggest differences I have noticed in this game after reading through 14 pages, and getting my role PM, is that it lacks a theme. This game may be different than others on this site. On DDO it's SOP to pressure 2-3 people to get character claims only, and then VTNL. (Vote to not lynch)<br>\n<br>\nI am not sure if that same concept carries on over here or not. I will try my very best to pick up on the play style here, however. I would say that I am fairly experienced, as I am tied on the mafia leader board over on DDO. I have hosted 7 or 8 of my own mafia games, and about 13 quickfires mafia games. <br>\n<br>\nI will try my best to be objective and reasonable.<br>\n<br>\nFrom my quick read through of this day phase, I have to say that my biggest scum reads are gellatin and empking. I will have to look deeper into everyone elses behavior in order to comprise a list of suspicions (something we commonly do on DDO).<br>\n<br>\nA few pages back I noticed someone say that role fishing is a scumtell. I would like to why this opinion is shared here? On DDO, in DP1 we often will \"rolefish for 1-2 roles on DP1 to get information for the town. Usually protective roles can cover that person for the night if they have a power role, so there is no harm in it. Scummy role claims, or Counter Claims, can occur from this information, which is why it is really beneficial.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, based on my reading of this game, I think the best idea would be to vote gellatin for his SOP policy lynch idea on PG1. This is an absolute horrible idea, and will result in the town mis-lynching for sure. I am sure he as mafia knew this before pre-supposing the idea. If this kind of statement were made on DDO, this random lynching to protect the town from theirselves (lol wtf?), they would be lynched without a doubt. I actually am surprised that people let Gellatin off the hook without so much as a second thought.<br>\n<br>\nLater Empking bandwagoned with him several times, and said that he believes gellatin is town, without offering any reasoning whatsoever. <br>\n<br>\nI am going to tell you all right now, that I am not a bandwagoner, and if you expect a vote from me to end the DP, you won't get it, unless it's on someone I think is scummy.

FUT's join date is only a couple hours after Kat requested replacement and he immediately gets into our game. Doesn't go to the newbie queue first or wait for a game to pick him up. It's like he sought out the replacement thread to get his spot back. While I was researching this I noticed he figured out how to use the quote system in the queue thread, but then reverts back to copy/paste to quote people in our game. Also look at all the meta violations he's making, repeatedly. If he read the thread he would understand we don't play the way he's asking, and if he were really just a new guy trying out our site he would accept that and conform rather than pressing his home meta. I think he's trying really hard to come across as clueless when he's really not.

Neither of those are impossible cause they were both scummy but I noticed it so I figured it's worth pointing out. It's also totally possible that Peta and Matt are both scum. I was leaning towards buying Peta's claim since he sort of called theam being vig. Matt's claim while executed pretty smoothly doesn't sell me at all. 4 shots this game plus 2 tracks from Peta allegedly and he misses all of those. Pretty convenient. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4235624#p4235624\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4235624#p4235624\" data-post-id=\"4235624\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 233</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13446\">Katsuki</a> wrote:</cite>Prodded.<br>\n<br>\nLeaving on a trip later today, be back on the 7th (my time anyways).
