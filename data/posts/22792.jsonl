My case on CF is not that he wittheld just his vote but didn't fight for or against any wagons altogether yesterday and though he did prompt discussion today he has not given hardly any insight into his reads without being prompted. The only time I tend to read an unprompted vote as town is when I can kind of feel that the person giving the vote is fishing for reactions or is being aggressive with the vote, I don't feel like CF has brought anything original to the table in regards to his thoughts, nor has he been willingly transparent about much of anything but yesterday's hammer, and even then there was little elaboration. <br><br>I understand your TA vote, I just think my case is a little bit more solid.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4228791#p4228791\" class=\"postlink\">post 211</a>, Katsuki wrote:</cite>Slaxx is?...</div></blockquote><br><br>Grimmjow/lolwagons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4231084#p4231084\" class=\"postlink\">post 218</a>, SGRaaize_ wrote:</cite>nooooo, why did you kill crypto, i love him.<br><br>RXK's hammer came across as incredibly over-the-top, which in turn came across as Mafia.

The manner in which people jumped on the wagon is a bit different, for example, out of all the people who hopped on I'm most comfortable with you because you expressed suspicion of CF yesterday, so if he flips scum it'd be hard for me not to assume you were town. Empking and Natalie could be bussing I suppose but nothing about either of their votes made me cringe or rethink my position, I'm still relatively sure on my read here and I don't think 4 votes within a couple days should really worry anyone that much."}

I voiced my top two suspects, one of which was the lead wagon for most of the day and the person I voted. I did not rally for people to vote or caps lock and call him obv-scum, but there was no reason for that.

I have hosted 7 or 8 of my own mafia games, and about 13 quickfires mafia games. <br><br>I will try my best to be objective and reasonable.<br><br>From my quick read through of this day phase, I have to say that my biggest scum reads are gellatin and empking. I will have to look deeper into everyone elses behavior in order to comprise a list of suspicions (something we commonly do on DDO).<br><br>A few pages back I noticed someone say that role fishing is a scumtell. I would like to why this opinion is shared here? On DDO, in DP1 we often will \"rolefish for 1-2 roles on DP1 to get information for the town. Usually protective roles can cover that person for the night if they have a power role, so there is no harm in it. Scummy role claims, or Counter Claims, can occur from this information, which is why it is really beneficial.<br><br><br>Anyways, based on my reading of this game, I think the best idea would be to vote gellatin for his SOP policy lynch idea on PG1. This is an absolute horrible idea, and will result in the town mis-lynching for sure. I am sure he as mafia knew this before pre-supposing the idea. If this kind of statement were made on DDO, this random lynching to protect the town from theirselves (lol wtf?), they would be lynched without a doubt. I actually am surprised that people let Gellatin off the hook without so much as a second thought.<br><br>Later Empking bandwagoned with him several times, and said that he believes gellatin is town, without offering any reasoning whatsoever. <br><br>I am going to tell you all right now, that I am not a bandwagoner, and if you expect a vote from me to end the DP, you won't get it, unless it's on someone I think is scummy. I would rather let this day end in a VTNL.<br><br><br>So for now, Vote: Gellatin (not sure how to bold my vote, sorry."}

How does town ever win games here with foul play like that? What do you define as scummy behavior? Posting no analysis when voting, bandwagoning, and random lynching, are the best scum tells in the games I have played, and usually result in mafia lynches. It seems as if you have a pre-supposed excuse that is supposed to be commonly accepted by the community for scummy behavior. I am not buying that your random voting is helpful in anyway. Up until this point, you haven't offered anything to the game, and even now just continue to WIFOM out of a claim.

Do they not have LD's here at mafiascum? Stating an IWWTT (I win with the town) statement for LD's is extremely important. Besides that the theory is incredible full of holes. If that is all you have on me for FOSing your scummy behavior, then I wish you luck in your endeavor in trying to redirect pressure."}

I am willing to listen to reason.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1. Powerroles are NOT as common on MS, there are probably 3-4 in this setup, and one is dead already. If petapan is scum, then obviously he is going to lie about his role, and its really not that hard to fakeclaim as scum, especially when our (I'm assuming here) strongest investigative role is gone.</div></blockquote><br><br>That's why we pressure for claims though. We judge based on how likely his role claim is to be in this game. If he claims something that IS in this game, and that role belongs to someone else, that person will counter claim him, revealing that he is scum. Role Claims, are EXTREMELY beneficial to the town.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>2. What if he IS the protective role? Then what? Docs cant self protect here, in case you didn't know that. And even if UN allowed for that, we would never be able to confirm peta if he was self protecting so we are right back to square one.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know what types of roles are commonly used here, but on DDO, the normal response to this would be to have a watcher utilize his/her role on this person. Also the chance in him being a protective role are pretty slim. 1/12 at this point. Role claiming is not harmful."}

It's like he sought out the replacement thread to get his spot back. While I was researching this I noticed he figured out how to use the quote system in the queue thread, but then reverts back to copy/paste to quote people in our game. Also look at all the meta violations he's making, repeatedly. If he read the thread he would understand we don't play the way he's asking, and if he were really just a new guy trying out our site he would accept that and conform rather than pressing his home meta.

Even if I'm looking too much into this and FUT is not Kat, this last nugget of information makes me think the slot is scum and FUT is assuming Kat's suspect list because there are non-subjective reasons for that list to be what it is, such as avoiding a scummate or possibly following some game plan that was predecided in the QT. <br><br>If you want more reasons, there's the minor contradiction that FUT calls SGR patient and Natalie conservative and thinks they're both town, and calls me patient and conservative and thinks I'm scum.

Honestly if you even sort of think I could be scum you should be voting me over Natalie because I could see me-scum/nat-town but not nat-scum/me-town. Obviously from my unique perspective this is why I'm banking so hard on Nat-town.

Neither of those are impossible cause they were both scummy but I noticed it so I figured it's worth pointing out. It's also totally possible that Peta and Matt are both scum. I was leaning towards buying Peta's claim since he sort of called theam being vig. Matt's claim while executed pretty smoothly doesn't sell me at all. 4 shots this game plus 2 tracks from Peta allegedly and he misses all of those. Pretty convenient. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4235624#p4235624\" class=\"postlink\">post 233</a>, Katsuki wrote:</cite>Prodded.<br><br>Leaving on a trip later today, be back on the 7th (my time anyways).

Matt's been hollaring over and over since he replaced in about how Nat must be scum since scum didn't flash wagon her after his vote, which is all well and good unless he's scum himself. OmNom came to the Nat/CF team conclusion pretty quickly which makes me suspicious, but Slaxx was pretty pro-town. Peta's vote being out there right now is the most telling thing about him imo. Gallatin, Idk. If I had to pick one to be town.... I guess I pick OmNom. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: MattP</span>"}

It would make more sense to me if you were a tracker. <br><br>On the me tunneling Matt thing, I'd like to point out I was tunneling Matt based on 1) him voting someone I had a strong town read on in lylo and 2) believing your tracker claim over his JK claim. Around that time I believe there were some mumblings from other players about you being scum while my suspicion of Matt was completely a solo thing, so I feel like aside from the tiny insignificant detail that he was town, pushing the Matt lynch is a towntell for me. You also have to take into account that Matt was replacing Kat/FUT, who I had previously believed were scum, whereas you voted CDB replacing Nat, who you had previously said was town. That's the difference."}

I pushed for 3 town lynches by D2 so not-killing me by then isn't as crazy as Peta makes it sound. The not-hammering me thing is way wrong because you defended me early so hammering would've looked terrible and the speed of my wagon made it look like I would go down without your help.
