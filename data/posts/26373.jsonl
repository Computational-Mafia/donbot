Voting: Votes and unvotes must be in bold to be counted. (Ex: Vote: Dunhamganger.) You do not have to unvote between votes for the next vote to be counted. You may unvote at any time and need not specify who you were voting for.<br><br>2.Lynching: Lynches require a simple majority of votes. Once that majority is reached, a lynch is achieved and further votes or unvotes will have no effect.<br><br>3. No Lynch: You may Vote: No lynch if you wish to end the day without lynching (herp). No Lynch will also require a simple majority.<br><br>4. Deadline: This game will function on a cycle of strict 3-week days. Replacements near deadline will extend that deadline by a maximum of 3 days.<br><br>5. Deadline Lynch: When the deadline passes, if no player has a majority of the votes, the player with the most votes will be lynched. If more than one player is tied for the most votes, no lynch will occur<br><br>6. Night and Night Actions: Night will last for 72 hours maximum. Night actions not received within those 72 hours will not occur. Night actions will be resolved using Natural Action Resolution.<br><br>7. Lurking: Players who sign up in this game are expected to actively post and participate. Players who do not post for 48 hours without prior warning will be prodded. Failure to respond to a prod within 48 hours will result in replacement. Lurking will not be a viable strategy in this game and players who are consistently prodded or post only to avoid being prodded will be replaced at the Mod's discretion.<br><br>8. Out-Of-Thread/Beyond-The-Grave Communication: The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so, and then only in the manner stated in your role PM. Don't quote any out-of-thread communications regarding this game in the thread; this includes your role PM. In addition, once you're dead, you may post exactly once more (often called a \"Bah\" post) before endgame, and it may not contain relevant game content. Any violation of this rule is a modkillable offense.<br><br>9. Posting Style: Do not use odd colors, font size,excessive Caps Locks, or excessive images in your posts. Do not be unduly abusive to your fellow players. Do not edit or delete your previous posts. No codes or foreign languages. Failure to meet these criteria will result in warnings and/or replacement. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This is my color, IT's MINE!! do not use it</span></span></span><br><br>10. V/LA: If you are going to be V/LA, please post in the thread if at all possible. Do not assume that a simple site-wide announcement will suffice. Please treat this game like a commitment and respect the time and enjoyment of your fellow players.<br><br>11. Questions, Comments, Concerns: If you have any questions that need to be addressed outside of the thread, please PM me. Otherwise, you may get my attention using either of the following formats: @Jake From State Farm, @Mod.<br><br>12. Playing to Win: If at any point I deem you to be playing against your win condition, you will be replaced or modkilled. No exceptions. (I always prefer replacements but if it's something I deem extreme I will modkill)<br><br>13. Catch-All: If you seem to be violating the spirit of these rules while operating under the letter of them, I will take appropriate action. Fair warning.<br><br>14. Fun: Having fun is by no means mandatory, but I would vastly prefer that each of you have some amount of it. If there's anything I can do to ensure that you do, please do not hesitate to let me know.<br><br>15. Modkills: A modkill on Town will end the Day, and a modkill on any kind of scum will keep the Day going <br><br>16. At least 1 player will get a VT role pm that looks like this<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sample Vanilla Role PM wrote:</cite>Welcome to State Farm Mafia, __________. Your role is <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>, you only possess the power to speak your mind and vote. You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is nothing else that can prevent it.</div></blockquote>"}

He got a really good laugh when she admitted she tried to summon a State Farm agent and nothing happened nor did she get a new car to replace her broken one. She reminded him of his grandmother so they had a nice long chat about things since her grandkids don't call or visit her anymore. All of a sudden she heard a strange noise in the background and the line went silent. She called back quickly but the phone just rang and rang and nobody picked up. She immediately hung up and dialed 911 but the dispatcher just chuckled when he heard an old lady say \"I think Jake from State farm has been murdered\" She got so annoyed and just pleaded with the office to send someone over to the office just to check on him and the office in a condescending tone said he would. The next morning David and Mike were making their way into the office discussing the outcome of the Playoff Game when they noticed Jake's car was still in the parking lot. They thought it was kind of odd as Jake is never there when they arrive so they decide to go by his cube and say hi to him. When they get to his cube they see Jake lying on the floor covered in blood, it seems he was bludgeoned to death by the telephone. David says \"This reminds me of that scene in the casino where Joe Pesci beat the dude with the phone\" and Mike said, but we are in Bloomington, Indiana, I am pretty sure there is no mafia around here... Right?</span></span></span></span><br><br>And so begins State Farm mafia - There are 13 alive and it takes 7 to lynch. <br><br>Good Luck everyone.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Role PMs are being sent out this morning and the game will begin when all 13 have confirmed</span>"}

Played in a game previously (on my old account before one of you bums say I've never completed a game) where the two different accounts conflicted on votes.

Personally, I think he didn't know how to respond to pressure and choose instead to sub out instead of jeopardizing the town's chances.

He's been really harsh on Xeg and Xeg had been dodge-y previously and their back and forth seems like they haven't interacted with each other.

Lurker's reaction to my questioning has led me to a town-ish feel, though his previous actions really seem scummy as fuck. <br><br>Zoidberg I read town-ish - though their reasonings are short, their statements are too polarizing for confident day 1 scum. I feel similarly about Bacde, though the Hiraki/Bacde back and forth seems weird, though I honestly haven't looked too deeply in either of their posts. Rev I feel is town who got stuck in a weird KBW insulting situation. IFM I really haven't read much about either but has been posting pretty town since BEF left. MM was pretty quiet this game, which was weird, but she did mention being in too many games. RachMarie replaced someone who didn't post much at all. Haven't gotten too much from her either. SafetyDance I feel has been somewhat going under the radar - someone I really do want to focus in on more. Nothing he's said has been particularly scummy, but I also feel like he's lurking during the best situations and pops in once in a while."}

Its just a small thing that people WILL call you scummy for and that scum players WILL avoid doing for that reason.

They are actively partaking in scumhunting, and their methods of doing so feel incredibly genuine. Overall, there is very little that could constitute to call them Scum. They are also willing to give players a second chance, which reads Town to me.<br><blockquote><div><cite>AP wrote:</cite>Why is not having a strong scumread scummy?</div></blockquote>First of all, having a scumread on somebody means that you see them as Scum. This is clear to everyone. Having no strong scumreads on anyone feels like a weak way to justify your vote. It's like he's afraid of actually voicing his opinion on who he thinks is Scum. Additionally, his list of reads had way too many Null-reads to satisfy me in general.<br><br>On the topic of absta, there is still something that I would like to bring forward. Analyse how he acted when his bandwagon shrunk for the first time. Just analyse it. While he was put under pressure, he was sort of active and contributed to things, but when his bandwagon shrunk, he didn't remind people of his presence at all. To me, that seems like Scum who has just been able to throw away a bandwagon off of them, and doesn't want it to rebuild itself.<br><br>Furthermore, his constant push of the Xeg-slot doesn't feel natural. It comes off as intensive bussing to me.

I'ts not a meta case though (knowing your playstyle DOES strengthen my opinion on it a little bit), but I would say this of any number of people if they had done the same thing you did.  KBW was clearly being a douche and trying to PL you / call you a VI.  A LOT OF PEOPLE would take that personally (I KNOW I WOULD HAVE).  So you csating it off (once) by saying that he just random picked you essentially to tunnel on as a scumtactic is reeeaaaaaallly weird because my gut reaction would have been to fight fire with fire - not say that hes lying about hating me and that his push is clearly scum motivated.

Here is the silly part though.  I'm not actually a hider either.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Im a Jack of all Trades {1xHide, 1xDoctor, 1xTrack}. </span> On night 1 I hid behind absta.  On night 2 I protected SD (since I expected him to get killed because of my hide crumbs on him).  Now, the Rach kill is like reaaaaaalllly out of place.  I can't for the life of me imagine why she would get NK'd over the people that were actually big townreads for everyone (and shes VT too, so).  Oh wait, yes I can!  SD is scum and the RM NK would create a lot of WIFOM when AP flips <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town Hider</span></span></span> alongside VT RM.  Because lets face it, I crumbed the shit out of that hide and it was pretty clear to anyone paying attention that I was gunning for SD.  I know for a fact that Bacde and Zoidberg picked up on my crumbs.  And I have meta of being a hider in an open game in which I said I was going to hide behind a player and then lied and hid elsewhere so that argument could also have been used to protect SD from the implications of my death.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">RachMarie is one of the few people that I would have reasonably hid behind which explains why she died - to make SD less suspicious as a result of my crumbs.</span><br><br>DZMD feels so off to me this game and I don't like how quick they were to call SD conftown.  I mean I appreciate the hustle, but you weren't even remotely suspicious of what I may have done since I was clearly being deceptive as fuck in the first place with my BP claim?  I just want you to know that I may have miscalculated slightly with my SD crumbs, but I'm like 95% on SD being scum as a result, so.  I'm always 2 steps ahead of you DGB and don't forget it  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\":cool:\" title=\"Cool\"> ,<br><br>ALSO.  If Bacde is scum then SD is DEFINITELY scum.  I will lynch SD over Bacde Today because if Bacde/SD were scum/town, then Bacde would have to be a step ahead of me in my crazy gambit land.  And I refuse to believe that.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>TL;DR</span>: Im a Joat {Hide on absta N1, doc on SD N2, unused track}.  The scumteam clearly bought my hider story last night because they killed RM and her death makes no sense otherwise unless SD is scum and they were trying to cover for him looking bad on my flip.  Zoid/Bacde are the 2 people that I am 100% certain saw my BP claim for the BS that it was and would have picked up on the hider thing.  But I think SD needs to go.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: SafetyDance</span>"}

Here is the silly part though.  I'm not actually a hider either.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Im a Jack of all Trades {1xHide, 1xDoctor, 1xTrack}. </span> On night 1 I hid behind absta.  On night 2 I protected SD (since I expected him to get killed because of my hide crumbs on him).  Now, the Rach kill is like reaaaaaalllly out of place.  I can't for the life of me imagine why she would get NK'd over the people that were actually big townreads for everyone (and shes VT too, so).  Oh wait, yes I can!  SD is scum and the RM NK would create a lot of WIFOM when AP flips <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town Hider</span></span></span> alongside VT RM.  Because lets face it, I crumbed the shit out of that hide and it was pretty clear to anyone paying attention that I was gunning for SD.  I know for a fact that Bacde and Zoidberg picked up on my crumbs.  And I have meta of being a hider in an open game in which I said I was going to hide behind a player and then lied and hid elsewhere so that argument could also have been used to protect SD from the implications of my death.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">RachMarie is one of the few people that I would have reasonably hid behind which explains why she died - to make SD less suspicious as a result of my crumbs.</span><br><br>DZMD feels so off to me this game and I don't like how quick they were to call SD conftown.  I mean I appreciate the hustle, but you weren't even remotely suspicious of what I may have done since I was clearly being deceptive as fuck in the first place with my BP claim?  I just want you to know that I may have miscalculated slightly with my SD crumbs, but I'm like 95% on SD being scum as a result, so.  I'm always 2 steps ahead of you DGB and don't forget it  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\":cool:\" title=\"Cool\"> ,<br><br>ALSO.  If Bacde is scum then SD is DEFINITELY scum.  I will lynch SD over Bacde Today because if Bacde/SD were scum/town, then Bacde would have to be a step ahead of me in my crazy gambit land.  And I refuse to believe that.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>TL;DR</span>: Im a Joat {Hide on absta N1, doc on SD N2, unused track}.  The scumteam clearly bought my hider story last night because they killed RM and her death makes no sense otherwise unless SD is scum and they were trying to cover for him looking bad on my flip.  Zoid/Bacde are the 2 people that I am 100% certain saw my BP claim for the BS that it was and would have picked up on the hider thing.

I know there is a doctor in the game and either IFM is town and protected me like he says or is scum and defo tried to kill me for the claim.  So I tried to fake something and see how people responded over the longterm.  Honestly its been stressful because Im not used to analyzing peoples reactions on all the levels deep I was going with the claims in my head.  But I realized at some point today that something didnt add up. One of absta/IFM had to be scum.  The scumteam didnt try and kill SD like I thought they would if they had reason to believe I was a hider.  And they kill RM.  Why RM?  Cause shes lurking like a PR.  Also shes unlikely to get protected.  Note the significance here.  The scumteam KNEW I WAS NOT A HIDER ON N2 BECAUSE THEY WERE DOCTOR HUNTING."}

Im finally back at an actual PC.<br><br>We have 5 PR claims.  That is wack.  There are not 5 town PRs in this game.  Doc/Nurse/Cop/IC/Tracker.  I dont see a situation where all of those are town.  How are we going to go about climbing Mount Scummore?  Easy.  Like this.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>1) I know that I am town.  I am a nurse.<br><br>2) Bacde is claiming a provable role.  Im going to look back over some ISOs, but basically he can conftown himself tonight.  If he doesn't, we lynch him immediately regardless of anything.  This could be a gambit to buy him an extra day and knock of another role in the meantime.  Possible.  I dont like that he is assuming absta is town.  Bacde, why did you not claim IC immediately?  Why did you not claim when at L - 1 before I came in?  Did you crumb at all.  Also, if we leave you alive today you are using your role.  If you are not moderator confirmed town by Tomorrow, you self vote.  No RB claims, no anything.<br><br>3) Absta \"Im a cop you idiot\" 102.  Absta/Hiraki team?  I was about to talk about Hiraki's claim first and how I saw connections that could implicate a Hiraki/Zoid team but that would mean there is a Doc/Nurse/Cop/IC in the game which is crap.  Unless Bacde is town and lying, but I tend to doubt that.  So Hiraki/Zoid are not a team (unless Bacde is a VT maybe).  Hiraki/Absta almost could be...Id buy Doc/Nurse/IC.  Absta is acting like a crazy person and that could make sense from him-scum but that is only possible balance wise for Bacde-VT.<br><br>4) IFM - if you are town, then I am sorry.  But I think you will agree that some shit had to go down, because wtf this game.  We dont have 5 town PRs.  We probably dont have 4.  If IFM is scum, then the setup looks like:<br>Doc/goon/goon VS Nurse/{IC/Cop/Tracker}.  I still kind of doubt that the town has 4 PRs, but if IFM is scum and I dont get to use my role until he flips scum, that paints a large target on my back anyways so my PR is meh.<br><br>If IFM is scum, then I tend to doubt that there is another maf pr on top of him (making Hiraki probably town and Bacde scum).  And he clearly is a doctor since no one is CCing and Im in the game as a nurse.<br><br>5) Hiraki.  Hiraki could be scum.  Hiraki looks like scum.  Why is Hiraki always scum.  He feels so town when hes town.<br><br>BBmolla, I know right?  Absta seems so sure of his shit and his play is pretty bold for scum.  If he is town, then I dont think he is shoving an IC claim as a VT.  Absta Cop could make sense which means Bacde is scum or Hiraki is scum."}

His diediedie feels pretty strong for someone just coming in.  But if he is scum with absta or IFM then he realized that all my claiming was bogus so maybe he was just going with some troll flow there.  I thought his comment in response to me doubting absta was unnatural when there was no reason for him to necessarily believe that absta wasn't confirmed town.<br><br>IFM, I love how you talk about how you acted in a very specific manner with me (didnt tell me who you would protect N1 in the QT) because you were worried scum might no-kill gambit, but then at some point here someone says you might be town and you say \"Thats impossible, there was no kill on Night 1!\"  Like what.  You were apparently highly concerned about a NK gambit before.  Cog dissonance there.<br><br>I think BBm is town for his reaction to my claim.  Mollie seems lost which is prolly a big towntell.  SD is a person in this game, but he seems likely town?  2 Prs are claiming good things about him.<br><br>HD/Zoid/Bacde<br>IFM/absta/Hiraki<br><br>---<br>There is no way there is a Town Doctor, Town Nurse, Town Cop, and Town Tracker in the same game (unless I passed the torch of trolling onto absta in which case m work here is done and I leave the game in victory).<br>Sooooo ONE of those claims is prolly a member of the mafia.  Im not mafia and thats like super obvious.  The other three make me nervous.  I could easily see Doc/goon/goon Vs Nurse/Cop/Tracker in part because the nurse PR likely gets vengekilled for being conf-towned on the mafia neighbor flip and thus never gets to role.  And if Bacde is scum, I strongly doubt absta is which would mean:<br><br>Bacde/Hiraki Bacde/IFM are possible.<br><br>If Bacde flips town, then that will be annoying as shiiiit to deal with (Posh Mafia anyone?).  We may as well get Vifam to replace HD, it'll be fun.  If Bacde flips town, then one of the PRs is still lying.  And I still have a hard time believing that absta is going so far to fake this as scum when hes going to die for it.  Like maybe there is some case where that makes sense but I just dont see it?  But if Bacde flips town then absta might be scum which would make the rest of the town power sensible.  Absta/Zoid would kind of make sense.  Maybe Absta/HD.<br><br>If not absta, then Hiraki is almost certainly scum.  I don't have a whole lot of opinions on this one.  I doubt absta/Hiraki are scum unless someone is still sitting on a claim.  Same for IFM really. Hiraki + {HD/Zoid}  Maybe.<br><br>So I guess I can see the following teams as likely:<br><br>Bacde/IFM*<br>Bacde/Hiraki<br>Absta/Zoid<br>Absta/HD*<br>Hiraki/HD<br>Hiraki/Zoid*<br><br>I think I see the starred pairs as more probable."}

(I realize you may think that is speculation, but I am pretty confident he did).  If Scum-Bacde thought that Hider-AP was going to target Town SafetyDance, the obvious course of action is to kill SD.  And I saw Bacde correctly make this play as scum before when he figured someone was a hider.  I really thought that SD would die end of N2.  Thats why I was so rustled up and fowl on D3.  SD not dying meant one of the things broke my theory:<br><br>1)absta is scum and the scumteam realized my hider inno crumb on him was obviously fake.<br>2)IFM is scum and the scumteam knew I was full of shit the entire time.<br><br>--1 and 2 appear to both be false right now<br><br>3)SD is scum and the scumteam obviously wasnt going to target him since I was going to die anyways.  And killing RM casts moderate doubt on my target, esp cause I have hider meta of lying about a future night hide target.<br>4)Bacde/Scum realized that I was being intentionally deceptive with my 1xBP claim and hide crumbs and just did there own thing.<br><br>I pretty much refuse to believe he didn't see my SD N2 hide intentions.  He may have realized they were fake.  IFM/absta are both town apparently, so there is no way scum knew for sure I was totally full of shit."}
