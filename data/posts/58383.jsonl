I didn't like that he was attacking me for being verbose which is a playstyle trait rather than alignment-dependent. But I think newbie-town can mistake it for scumminess and it felt like an original contribution.

It is a weak read though and I am wary of discounting bussing. There are a couple of posts that I felt were manipulative where he calls Rofl town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6009129#p6009129\">Post 49</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6011292#p6011292\">Post 124</a>. Rolf is quite blatantly town and that is the only read that Natirasha has which he states not once but twice. He also tries to hammer me based on no reasoning at all and not even having caught up with the game. Although I am inclined to think that if he was scum, he'd want to check the votecount before pulling it off. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6010676#p6010676\">Post 79</a> feels like posturing though. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Wofly</span> only has one real post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6011084#p6011084\">Post 114</a>). His conclusion of espresso-scum if I am town is reasonable. The one thing that made me hesitate is considering that I'm town even while voting me although I don't find it extremely unlikely to come from town either. I like his hesitance on Natirasha as well and his caution in calling Nati town just because of xdf's post feels like paranoid town much more than scum trying to discredit townreads because it is reasonable.

However, my bjc townread was similar to Konowa's scumread of me so I don't like him saying \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Nothing you said should indicate alignment.</span>\" I townread bjc for his posts being \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">loose, relaxed, natural, and un-selfconscious.</span>\" Konowa scumread me for my posts being \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">awkward.</span>\" Saying one is alignment-indicative and the other is not doesn't make sense.

This could potentially point towards Espresso/Konowa scumteam although implosion voted Konowa so it could just be self-preservation. Me claiming a VT says nothing about my affiliation and the push feels like scum afraid of a mislynch slipping away. His certainty in my scumflip in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6012245#p6012245\">Post 155</a> and desire to end the day is disproportional to the strength of his case which amounts to me having an early townread that he disagrees with and \"posting awkwardly.\" ISO'ing him, he has a total of six posts nearly all of which are interactions with or about me.

I also have a playstyle where I don't normally get townread early game. People call my posting \"awkward\" etc). The green part shows his uncertainty which contradicts his very unreasonable confidence. I also hate his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6010816#p6010816\">Post 101</a>. He calls me town but has no reasoning at all.

You haven't engaged with my posts one bit (neither has Rofl) and have spent literally the entire game talking in the third person and it is really disrespectful to call me an \"expendable piece\" fwiw when I didn't really do anything to offend anyone in this game. You were right about xdf but fucking wrong about me. Your attitude is annoying as well. Not one person (besides implosion) engaged any of my reads or analysis before deciding to push through with a lynch. I just hope you take a step back and re-analyze the game after seeing my town flip or you know, read through what I posted on espresso and Konowa. But your \"expendable piece\" comment makes me feel like you are just horrible at working with people. Your entire case rests on the fact that I called you town in your first post and was right. And no one is even bothered to let RedCoyote, Peabody, and TNO post so I can develop reads and analyze their posting. Two days in, you want to push a lynch. What when I flip town? You just let those three coast doing nothing. Scum are among {RC, TNO, Konowa, espresso, and Peabody}. Allowing them to skate by while all the town push a mislynch is horrible and the attitude is even worse. I get it, you just shot scum and are overconfident about catching another but you are literally confbiasing so hard you ignored every single thing I posted. But good luck. I just hope everyone comes together enough to win it for town. I'm at least glad there is a solid town core in bjc, rofl, maybe nat. Implosion is town. Read that game I linked and is the only one keeping a cool head and is being rational about this. Anyways, going to check out unless someone wants to discuss anything before the hammer."}

But from another perspective, it's just faulty reasoning. What if Fusion had claimed VT, but everyone in there was a town consensus that he was around 95% town? I would argue at that point lynching would be a mistake, yet your reasoning as stated would say that it's fine to lynch him. More importantly, why is possibly outing another PR such a terrible prospect? Outing PRs is unfortunate, sure, but regardless of how ahead we are, we have a finite number of mislynches. Given that we have a finite number of mislynches I would argue that the only impetus should be to maximize the odds that we lynch scum each day; additionally even avoiding outing PRs isn't necessarily giving us anything, because scum could kill a PR either way. It doesn't even guarantee that scum kill a PR, because there could be protective roles. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>We're up one on scum already, so we're obviously way ahead.

It seems pointless to throw a rofl townread in here if rofl is scum, because xfd could've ignored rofl (he's doing fine on his out) or even lightly bussed him because it would've been easy to conceal at this point in the game with all the love rofl is getting.<br><br>For Fusion, it's not as clear. \"I do not know about him\" is hard to decipher. I could see it argued either way, but I think this points ever-so-slightly to Fusion scum. The main reason I lean this way is because xfd says he doesn't know about Fusion, and yet he goes out of his way to say what Fusion did wasn't scummy. He's kind of defending Fusion without specifically mentioning him in that second paragraph. I think if Fusion was town, he would either join in attacking him or he wouldn't have been so disjointed in referring to him. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xfd 76 wrote:</cite>Scum -.- Why the fuck would you be happy if youre getting vig'd.<br><br>That's scum.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Natirasha</span></div></blockquote><br><br>This doesn't strike me as bussing.

Outing PRs is unfortunate, sure, but regardless of how ahead we are, we have a finite number of mislynches. Given that we have a finite number of mislynches I would argue that the only impetus should be to maximize the odds that we lynch scum each day; additionally even avoiding outing PRs isn't necessarily giving us anything, because scum could kill a PR either way.

There's nothing wrong with being humble or being honest about your lack of experience, but you should never, ever vote yourself the way you are. You have just as much weight as anyone else in this game with your vote. Whether you're town or scum, your side is disadvantaged if you go into the game thinking, \"lynching me is a good thing because I hurt my side due to how bad I am\". That's not accurate at all, even in the most basic sense of having one additional number for your side's favor.<br><br>Also, with your latest <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6015001#p6015001\">249</a>, I strongly suggest you either cool it or replace out. Quit acting like a child. This is a game. If it's such a drag to be here, then just replace out and let someone that wants to play Mafia join us."}

It makes sense to claim an important PR when you're so far behind anyway. Having 3 town PRs dead (odds of 4 in a 13 player game when your mafia power only consists of one PR is low) just made its o that claiming sooner than later was in your best interests.

(and bjc obviously)<br>konowa looking most scummy to me at the moment - mostly on implosion push.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: konowa</span><br>will dig deeper during the day.</div></blockquote><br>Expresso is town now for a self vote, however before he was scummy, and fusion being scum made it even more likely; granted a lot happened so its not inconceivable that wolfy changed his mind on expresso, but the REASON is deeply flawed because it doesnt address any of the prior issues. <br><br>He votes Konowa and this may seem okay at first glance, the reasoning is for an \"implosion push\" which if you read the one post prior to this where Konowa votes/criticizes implosion its not a strong accusation and there never was any crusade that should warrant a vote. What makes this particularly interesting is that Konowa was just being bandwagoned as this post was made. You just don't see it show up in the vote count, because unbeknownst to the town at the time, bjc had already hammered on expresso.<br><br>It screams \"impromtu opportunistic scum post to justify vote on wagon against scum friend\". Remember that at the end of the day, scum losing 2 members day 1 is a vital blow that is almost impossible to recover from. As such we expect mafia to vote competing wagons. Which, is what Wolfy consistently did. While I don't believe that scum couldn't have bussed expresso, this suspect appeals to me most right now. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2</span><br>Don't worry this day is just as good of a read.<br><br>Day starts and Wolfy jumps right back onto fusion. Okay well I had assumed that the main reason that expresso wasn't as scummy anymore to Wolfy was that Fusion was town to him. After all, given the posts that came in day 1 with respect to Wolfy's opinions, this is the only logical explanation.<br><br>Okay this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026009#p6026009\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a> is his scum reads: implosion, fusion, konowa. Now ignoring the fact that this opens up issues regarding his early switch to the konowa wagon (his reasoning, the push on implosion, and the fact that he switched off fusion), these reads are very random. We can look at his earlier posts and see the implosion is a town read. There's no explanation to any of this of course.<br><br>He votes Peabody next. Why? Well because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026030#p6026030\" class=\"postlink\">Peabody felt clusk was town for a dumb reason</a>. There can be no other explanation for the vote, because nothing else happened in between the time he implicitly said \"peabody is not mafia\" and \"vote peabody\". The most important aspect of this vote is that it is a big bandwagon, wolfy is just hopping on without having to contribute. There is no reason for this vote that is acceptable other than to kill a random person.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3</span><br><br>So the Peabody lynch goes through and he jumps onto Fusion again with the same 3 scum reads as earlier. It's interesting that he compromised these reads to vote the biggest wagon, and then remarried them after the wagon was finished. He then makes some frustrating posts of how hes a VI but lets ignore them.<br><br>This post... <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6061256#p6061256\" class=\"postlink\">Okay so noggy and SK are town</a> and scum is on his wagon. But you don't know which is scum!??!? This is IMPOSSIBLE if we are to believe that Wolfy is town because two of the people on that wagon have been scum reads of Wolfy. Granted no explanation or evidence that this is true aside from outright stating this as fact has been given to support these reads, but they still exist. Yet he stays conflicted. Oh and did I mention the third scum read is SK?<br><br>He supposedly \"forgot\" what game he was in, I don't buy it. It just shows that he isn't paying attention and is looking at what is right in front of him, and finding the safest way to get town killed. This type of play is heavily supported with blatant bandwagoning, opportunistic reads, and lack of explanation regarding reads.<br><br>There's nothing else of note in this ISO.<br><br>In conclusion (this is not a TLDR), Wolfy has exhibited no evidence of scum hunting despite many reads which he only follows up on when they are the biggest bandwagon. Coincidentally that is also when they are formed, and if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway. The result of this play is a lot of crisscrossing and contradiction of how he feels about the game in correlation to his play. Which I have exposed above."}

(and bjc obviously)<br>konowa looking most scummy to me at the moment - mostly on implosion push.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: konowa</span><br>will dig deeper during the day.</div></blockquote><br>Expresso is town now for a self vote, however before he was scummy, and fusion being scum made it even more likely; granted a lot happened so its not inconceivable that wolfy changed his mind on expresso, but the REASON is deeply flawed because it doesnt address any of the prior issues. <br><br>He votes Konowa and this may seem okay at first glance, the reasoning is for an \"implosion push\" which if you read the one post prior to this where Konowa votes/criticizes implosion its not a strong accusation and there never was any crusade that should warrant a vote. What makes this particularly interesting is that Konowa was just being bandwagoned as this post was made. You just don't see it show up in the vote count, because unbeknownst to the town at the time, bjc had already hammered on expresso.<br><br>It screams \"impromtu opportunistic scum post to justify vote on wagon against scum friend\". Remember that at the end of the day, scum losing 2 members day 1 is a vital blow that is almost impossible to recover from. As such we expect mafia to vote competing wagons. Which, is what Wolfy consistently did. While I don't believe that scum couldn't have bussed expresso, this suspect appeals to me most right now. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2</span><br>Don't worry this day is just as good of a read.<br><br>Day starts and Wolfy jumps right back onto fusion. Okay well I had assumed that the main reason that expresso wasn't as scummy anymore to Wolfy was that Fusion was town to him. After all, given the posts that came in day 1 with respect to Wolfy's opinions, this is the only logical explanation.<br><br>Okay this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026009#p6026009\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a> is his scum reads: implosion, fusion, konowa. Now ignoring the fact that this opens up issues regarding his early switch to the konowa wagon (his reasoning, the push on implosion, and the fact that he switched off fusion), these reads are very random. We can look at his earlier posts and see the implosion is a town read. There's no explanation to any of this of course.<br><br>He votes Peabody next. Why? Well because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026030#p6026030\" class=\"postlink\">Peabody felt clusk was town for a dumb reason</a>. There can be no other explanation for the vote, because nothing else happened in between the time he implicitly said \"peabody is not mafia\" and \"vote peabody\". The most important aspect of this vote is that it is a big bandwagon, wolfy is just hopping on without having to contribute. There is no reason for this vote that is acceptable other than to kill a random person.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3</span><br><br>So the Peabody lynch goes through and he jumps onto Fusion again with the same 3 scum reads as earlier. It's interesting that he compromised these reads to vote the biggest wagon, and then remarried them after the wagon was finished. He then makes some frustrating posts of how hes a VI but lets ignore them.<br><br>This post... <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6061256#p6061256\" class=\"postlink\">Okay so noggy and SK are town</a> and scum is on his wagon. But you don't know which is scum!??!? This is IMPOSSIBLE if we are to believe that Wolfy is town because two of the people on that wagon have been scum reads of Wolfy. Granted no explanation or evidence that this is true aside from outright stating this as fact has been given to support these reads, but they still exist. Yet he stays conflicted. Oh and did I mention the third scum read is SK?<br><br>He supposedly \"forgot\" what game he was in, I don't buy it. It just shows that he isn't paying attention and is looking at what is right in front of him, and finding the safest way to get town killed. This type of play is heavily supported with blatant bandwagoning, opportunistic reads, and lack of explanation regarding reads.<br><br>There's nothing else of note in this ISO.<br><br>In conclusion (this is not a TLDR), Wolfy has exhibited no evidence of scum hunting despite many reads which he only follows up on when they are the biggest bandwagon. Coincidentally that is also when they are formed, and if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway. The result of this play is a lot of crisscrossing and contradiction of how he feels about the game in correlation to his play.

I mean, I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I was very clear that I simply didn't trust him at all regardless of alignment.

I said that we dont have a godfather, but that, simply does not have to be true. Look, Konowa had already investigated RedCoyote and Fusion.

What makes this particularly interesting is that Konowa was just being bandwagoned as this post was made. You just don't see it show up in the vote count, because unbeknownst to the town at the time, bjc had already hammered on expresso.<br><br>It screams \"impromtu opportunistic scum post to justify vote on wagon against scum friend\". Remember that at the end of the day, scum losing 2 members day 1 is a vital blow that is almost impossible to recover from. As such we expect mafia to vote competing wagons. Which, is what Wolfy consistently did. While I don't believe that scum couldn't have bussed expresso, this suspect appeals to me most right now. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2</span><br>Don't worry this day is just as good of a read.<br><br>Day starts and Wolfy jumps right back onto fusion. Okay well I had assumed that the main reason that expresso wasn't as scummy anymore to Wolfy was that Fusion was town to him. After all, given the posts that came in day 1 with respect to Wolfy's opinions, this is the only logical explanation.<br><br>Okay this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026009#p6026009\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a> is his scum reads: implosion, fusion, konowa. Now ignoring the fact that this opens up issues regarding his early switch to the konowa wagon (his reasoning, the push on implosion, and the fact that he switched off fusion), these reads are very random. We can look at his earlier posts and see the implosion is a town read. There's no explanation to any of this of course.<br><br>He votes Peabody next. Why? Well because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026030#p6026030\" class=\"postlink\">Peabody felt clusk was town for a dumb reason</a>. There can be no other explanation for the vote, because nothing else happened in between the time he implicitly said \"peabody is not mafia\" and \"vote peabody\". The most important aspect of this vote is that it is a big bandwagon, wolfy is just hopping on without having to contribute. There is no reason for this vote that is acceptable other than to kill a random person.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3</span><br><br>So the Peabody lynch goes through and he jumps onto Fusion again with the same 3 scum reads as earlier. It's interesting that he compromised these reads to vote the biggest wagon, and then remarried them after the wagon was finished. He then makes some frustrating posts of how hes a VI but lets ignore them.<br><br>This post... <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6061256#p6061256\" class=\"postlink\">Okay so noggy and SK are town</a> and scum is on his wagon. But you don't know which is scum!??!? This is IMPOSSIBLE if we are to believe that Wolfy is town because two of the people on that wagon have been scum reads of Wolfy. Granted no explanation or evidence that this is true aside from outright stating this as fact has been given to support these reads, but they still exist. Yet he stays conflicted. Oh and did I mention the third scum read is SK?<br><br>He supposedly \"forgot\" what game he was in, I don't buy it. It just shows that he isn't paying attention and is looking at what is right in front of him, and finding the safest way to get town killed. This type of play is heavily supported with blatant bandwagoning, opportunistic reads, and lack of explanation regarding reads.<br><br>There's nothing else of note in this ISO.<br><br>In conclusion (this is not a TLDR), Wolfy has exhibited no evidence of scum hunting despite many reads which he only follows up on when they are the biggest bandwagon. Coincidentally that is also when they are formed, and if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway. The result of this play is a lot of crisscrossing and contradiction of how he feels about the game in correlation to his play.

So, Wolfy (or anyone else that wants to), I ask that you respond to this.  <br><br>Another thing, during my reread, I found another couple of little nuggets that I had forgotten about:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion 190 wrote:</cite>itt espressojet continues to be obviously town</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion 229 wrote:</cite>Espresso's play right now just isn't the play that scum-going-down would make... scum-espresso would not say that he is a better lynch than fusion.</div></blockquote><br><br>implosion could defend himself by saying being wrong /= being scum, but remember that the time he said this was right as Espresso was reaching fever pitch. This was right before Espresso self-voted and bjc hammered. Now, scumimplosion may have been thinking he could still save his partner from this, as Nat lovingly referred to it, \"power lynching\", but I'll be he didn't anticipate Espresso voting himself and bjc doing him in immediately thereafter. After all, had bjc not hammered like an absolute boss, that wagon would've collapsed on the next page. I think the safe play for scum at that point (prior to and even immediately after Espresso voting himself) would've been to try and talk down the wagon. Keep in mind, however, that myself, Nat, Wolfy and implosion all did this to a degree at the end of D1. implosion and Wolfy stand out as never having supported the wagon with a vote. implosion stands out for never supporting the wagon with a vote or vocally calling Espresso a scumread of his. <br><br>Last thing I want to point out,<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wolfy 114 wrote:</cite>Expressojet looks scummy to me - will look even more scummy for <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6007253#p6007253\" class=\"postlink\">101</a>if Fusion flips town</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wolfy 276 wrote:</cite>Expresso is probably town for the self vote and feeling sorry for himself.</div></blockquote><br><br>The only purpose of this juxtaposition is to illustrate Wolfy going from calling Espresso scummy to calling him town in a manner with which to slow down the wagon (that Wolfy probably thought at the time hadn't been hammered by bjc ... I know I did).<br><br>So all of this is basically a long way of saying our best bet in hitting scum is by lynching Wolfy and implosion as Espresso's wagon holds the key to victory in this game. <br><br>In other words this is exactly where I was in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6059771#p6059771\">462</a> two weeks ago. Do you understand where I'm coming from now, Junpei?"}

If you read those ~2-3 pages surrounding it... I cannot come up with a good reason for Nat to do that to the last scum partner. If it was a bus, it was kind of a weak one and not very showy. Nat also jumps off of it after Espresso was lynched, which makes zero sense unless you turn up the WIFOM. If you're trying to get credit for bussing, and the target is already lynched, why back off after the fact? Granted, it may have been that, like myself, Nat didn't realize that Espresso was lynched, but still. It doesn't make sense of a partner to act that way.<br><br>That being said, Nat's play hasn't been great, which worries me, but the Espresso wagon trumps that, I think. I also agree with you in the SK/Junpei are playing pretty townie-like. You've also got the report for SK and the rofl credentials for Junpei, both of which are as good as gold."}

If you read those ~2-3 pages surrounding it... I cannot come up with a good reason for Nat to do that to the last scum partner. If it was a bus, it was kind of a weak one and not very showy. Nat also jumps off of it after Espresso was lynched, which makes zero sense unless you turn up the WIFOM. If you're trying to get credit for bussing, and the target is already lynched, why back off after the fact? Granted, it may have been that, like myself, Nat didn't realize that Espresso was lynched, but still. It doesn't make sense of a partner to act that way.<br><br>That being said, Nat's play hasn't been great, which worries me, but the Espresso wagon trumps that, I think. I also agree with you in the SK/Junpei are playing pretty townie-like. You've also got the report for SK and the rofl credentials for Junpei, both of which are as good as gold.</div></blockquote><br>Alright, let's look at Nat's interaction with the Espresso wagon in detail. Before it, he voted Fusion, claiming it as a shameless sheep. We can ask the question then: how would scum-Nat react to a wagon on their last scumbuddy? Well, scum-Nat certainly couldn't ignore it, as that would create a stark contrast between willingness to blindly sheep on Fusion and unwillingness to blindly sheep on Espresso if Espresso flips scum. So, what would be a reasonable course of action? Going all-in with the phrase \"200% fine with powerlynching\" seems to make more sense than limping into the wagon. Sure, after that it was a weak bus, but that leaves Nat with an out if the wagon goes away, which is entirely feasible to have happened after the Fusion wagon earlier. It's quite possible that Nat was trying to just look like a generically sheeping townie, and thus treated the Fusion and Espresso wagons similarly. That isn't really an argument for Nat-scum in and of itself, but it is an argument that the Espresso wagon makes sense from that point of view. Nat also later said:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Colorized, and not my Espresso lead is less due to actually scumreading and more due to me having my vote there.</div></blockquote><br>And then later he unvoted after the hammer. I think it's fair to assume Nat didn't realize the hammer had fell (regardless of alignment). There's no clear reason to make the unvote otherwise. So, Nat-town unvoting doesn't particularly make sense or not make sense. It's feasible. Nat-scum unvoting might look odd, but I can think of multiple lines of reasoning to justify it. Nat could have thought the pattern of the day was a bunch of wagons being built up and torn down, and wanted to continue that pattern in a way that wouldn't get espresso lynched. Nat could have had second thoughts about lynching the only other scum. Nat might have wanted to leave the wagon for some kind of wifom value. They're certainly not the most cogent reasons, but I think they're certainly reasonable."}

The dayvig screws up parity unless the jailkeeper can fix it, etc. I think cop is just a meh role in general, but it should still exist in some games. I also think only letting scum do one thing at night is one of those things that was originally more a realism consideration than a balance consideration and is meh. <br><br>wp Nati."}

How town could have lost after that. . . While the hammer was sorta random-ish, the dayvig shot was breath taking. I never expected it to hit scum, so great job with that. The random kill N1 was what game the scum any sort of hope, really wasn't expecting him to hit a PR. Afterwards it just turned into a series of mislynch after mislynch, with some poor play on behalf of the town. The doubting of the cop made no sense to me, really. I would not consider a Godfather Neighbor balanced, but whatever. Ultimately it seemed like town just started to fall apart and scum took advantage of it"}
