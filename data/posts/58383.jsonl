There are a couple of posts that I felt were manipulative where he calls Rofl town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6009129#p6009129\">Post 49</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6011292#p6011292\">Post 124</a>. Rolf is quite blatantly town and that is the only read that Natirasha has which he states not once but twice. He also tries to hammer me based on no reasoning at all and not even having caught up with the game. Although I am inclined to think that if he was scum, he'd want to check the votecount before pulling it off. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6010676#p6010676\">Post 79</a> feels like posturing though. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Wofly</div> only has one real post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6011084#p6011084\">Post 114</a>). His conclusion of espresso-scum if I am town is reasonable. The one thing that made me hesitate is considering that I'm town even while voting me although I don't find it extremely unlikely to come from town either. I like his hesitance on Natirasha as well and his caution in calling Nati town just because of xdf's post feels like paranoid town much more than scum trying to discredit townreads because it is reasonable. Nati really hasn't done jack.<br>\n<br>\n~~~<br>\n<br>\nI don't have any read yet on The Noggy One or Peabody. I feel conflicted about RedCoyote. I have concerns about Konowa and espressojet.<br>\n<br>\n~~~<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Konowa</div> in his initial interactions with me felt assertive and confident. Scumreading me for an \"awkward tone\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6009264#p6009264\">Post 52</a> looked legitimate. However, my bjc townread was similar to Konowa's scumread of me so I don't like him saying \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Nothing you said should indicate alignment.</div>\" I townread bjc for his posts being \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">loose, relaxed, natural, and un-selfconscious.</div>\" Konowa scumread me for my posts being \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">awkward.</div>\" Saying one is alignment-indicative and the other is not doesn't make sense. I hate Konowa's latest vote on me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6012142#p6012142\">Post 152</a> as it came when pressure was dissipating and turning towards Espressojet. This could potentially point towards Espresso/Konowa scumteam although implosion voted Konowa so it could just be self-preservation. Me claiming a VT says nothing about my affiliation and the push feels like scum afraid of a mislynch slipping away. His certainty in my scumflip in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6012245#p6012245\">Post 155</a> and desire to end the day is disproportional to the strength of his case which amounts to me having an early townread that he disagrees with and \"posting awkwardly.\" ISO'ing him, he has a total of six posts nearly all of which are interactions with or about me.  He provides no opinions on any other player in the game or on my later posting and analysis. I find this lack of fluidity in reads scummy. It is different from bjc's and Rofl's tunneling which feel a lot more town. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Espressojet</div>'s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6009682#p6009682\">Post 56</a> has a jarring disconnect between his confidence and uncertainty. \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">I think I'm feeling pretty confident in my belief that fusion is town...</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">unless he's scum trying to get his buddies to look like town... I'm not sure, I'm still pretty bad at reading people on the forums.</div></div>\" The blue part shows his confidence (which is also heavily unjustified considering I didn't do anything blatantly town by then. I also have a playstyle where I don't normally get townread early game. People call my posting \"awkward\" etc). The green part shows his uncertainty which contradicts his very unreasonable confidence. I also hate his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6010816#p6010816\">Post 101</a>. He calls me town but has no reasoning at all. The tiptoeing through a minfield comment in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6011235#p6011235\">Post 117</a> feels off. His reasoning for a townread on me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6011269#p6011269\">Post 119</a> is absurd to the point I can't believe it: I am town apparently because I had a townread on a townie. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">This makes no sense because he townread me before bjc vigged xfdagent so he couldn't have known that I was townreading a townie at the point he, Espresso initially townread me.

You haven't engaged with my posts one bit (neither has Rofl) and have spent literally the entire game talking in the third person and it is really disrespectful to call me an \"expendable piece\" fwiw when I didn't really do anything to offend anyone in this game. You were right about xdf but fucking wrong about me. Your attitude is annoying as well. Not one person (besides implosion) engaged any of my reads or analysis before deciding to push through with a lynch. I just hope you take a step back and re-analyze the game after seeing my town flip or you know, read through what I posted on espresso and Konowa. But your \"expendable piece\" comment makes me feel like you are just horrible at working with people. Your entire case rests on the fact that I called you town in your first post and was right. And no one is even bothered to let RedCoyote, Peabody, and TNO post so I can develop reads and analyze their posting. Two days in, you want to push a lynch. What when I flip town? You just let those three coast doing nothing. Scum are among {RC, TNO, Konowa, espresso, and Peabody}. Allowing them to skate by while all the town push a mislynch is horrible and the attitude is even worse. I get it, you just shot scum and are overconfident about catching another but you are literally confbiasing so hard you ignored every single thing I posted. But good luck. I just hope everyone comes together enough to win it for town. I'm at least glad there is a solid town core in bjc, rofl, maybe nat. Implosion is town.

But from another perspective, it's just faulty reasoning. What if Fusion had claimed VT, but everyone in there was a town consensus that he was around 95% town? I would argue at that point lynching would be a mistake, yet your reasoning as stated would say that it's fine to lynch him. More importantly, why is possibly outing another PR such a terrible prospect? Outing PRs is unfortunate, sure, but regardless of how ahead we are, we have a finite number of mislynches. Given that we have a finite number of mislynches I would argue that the only impetus should be to maximize the odds that we lynch scum each day; additionally even avoiding outing PRs isn't necessarily giving us anything, because scum could kill a PR either way.

It seems pointless to throw a rofl townread in here if rofl is scum, because xfd could've ignored rofl (he's doing fine on his out) or even lightly bussed him because it would've been easy to conceal at this point in the game with all the love rofl is getting.<br>\n<br>\nFor Fusion, it's not as clear. \"I do not know about him\" is hard to decipher. I could see it argued either way, but I think this points ever-so-slightly to Fusion scum. The main reason I lean this way is because xfd says he doesn't know about Fusion, and yet he goes out of his way to say what Fusion did wasn't scummy. He's kind of defending Fusion without specifically mentioning him in that second paragraph. I think if Fusion was town, he would either join in attacking him or he wouldn't have been so disjointed in referring to him. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>xfd 76 wrote:</cite>Scum -.- Why the fuck would you be happy if youre getting vig'd.<br>\n<br>\nThat's scum.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Natirasha</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis doesn't strike me as bussing.

Outing PRs is unfortunate, sure, but regardless of how ahead we are, we have a finite number of mislynches. Given that we have a finite number of mislynches I would argue that the only impetus should be to maximize the odds that we lynch scum each day; additionally even avoiding outing PRs isn't necessarily giving us anything, because scum could kill a PR either way.

The fact that you think that \"bjc doesn't come across that way\" means you are either an alt, which I ask to confirm now, or you are just trying to justify your townread with an unwarranted/unbased opinion off of just this game?

It makes sense to claim an important PR when you're so far behind anyway. Having 3 town PRs dead (odds of 4 in a 13 player game when your mafia power only consists of one PR is low) just made its o that claiming sooner than later was in your best interests. If you had votes on you it would look worse and worse.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I don't buy the story that Nati forced your claim out of you. You are the one that handed out intricate details of your role and you ar the one that agreed to claim. If you DO believe that the mafia has a godfather then I don't know why you would claim now. If anything you should wait out as long as possible until you have a guilty, because surely you dont know for SURE that mafia has a godfather?..<br>\n<br>\nNatirasha: I agree that a cop living without protective roles alive is very suspicious. But what if the only mafia left was a godfather, then theres no reason to not kill the uncomfirmed cop.

What makes this particularly interesting is that Konowa was just being bandwagoned as this post was made. You just don't see it show up in the vote count, because unbeknownst to the town at the time, bjc had already hammered on expresso.<br>\n<br>\nIt screams \"impromtu opportunistic scum post to justify vote on wagon against scum friend\". Remember that at the end of the day, scum losing 2 members day 1 is a vital blow that is almost impossible to recover from. As such we expect mafia to vote competing wagons. Which, is what Wolfy consistently did. While I don't believe that scum couldn't have bussed expresso, this suspect appeals to me most right now. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2</div><br>\nDon't worry this day is just as good of a read.<br>\n<br>\nDay starts and Wolfy jumps right back onto fusion. Okay well I had assumed that the main reason that expresso wasn't as scummy anymore to Wolfy was that Fusion was town to him. After all, given the posts that came in day 1 with respect to Wolfy's opinions, this is the only logical explanation.<br>\n<br>\nOkay this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026009#p6026009\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a> is his scum reads: implosion, fusion, konowa. Now ignoring the fact that this opens up issues regarding his early switch to the konowa wagon (his reasoning, the push on implosion, and the fact that he switched off fusion), these reads are very random. We can look at his earlier posts and see the implosion is a town read. There's no explanation to any of this of course.<br>\n<br>\nHe votes Peabody next. Why? Well because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026030#p6026030\" class=\"postlink\">Peabody felt clusk was town for a dumb reason</a>. There can be no other explanation for the vote, because nothing else happened in between the time he implicitly said \"peabody is not mafia\" and \"vote peabody\". The most important aspect of this vote is that it is a big bandwagon, wolfy is just hopping on without having to contribute. There is no reason for this vote that is acceptable other than to kill a random person.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3</div><br>\n<br>\nSo the Peabody lynch goes through and he jumps onto Fusion again with the same 3 scum reads as earlier. It's interesting that he compromised these reads to vote the biggest wagon, and then remarried them after the wagon was finished. He then makes some frustrating posts of how hes a VI but lets ignore them.<br>\n<br>\nThis post... <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6061256#p6061256\" class=\"postlink\">Okay so noggy and SK are town</a> and scum is on his wagon. But you don't know which is scum!??!? This is IMPOSSIBLE if we are to believe that Wolfy is town because two of the people on that wagon have been scum reads of Wolfy. Granted no explanation or evidence that this is true aside from outright stating this as fact has been given to support these reads, but they still exist. Yet he stays conflicted. Oh and did I mention the third scum read is SK?<br>\n<br>\nHe supposedly \"forgot\" what game he was in, I don't buy it. It just shows that he isn't paying attention and is looking at what is right in front of him, and finding the safest way to get town killed. This type of play is heavily supported with blatant bandwagoning, opportunistic reads, and lack of explanation regarding reads.<br>\n<br>\nThere's nothing else of note in this ISO.<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion (this is not a TLDR), Wolfy has exhibited no evidence of scum hunting despite many reads which he only follows up on when they are the biggest bandwagon. Coincidentally that is also when they are formed, and if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway. The result of this play is a lot of crisscrossing and contradiction of how he feels about the game in correlation to his play.

What makes this particularly interesting is that Konowa was just being bandwagoned as this post was made. You just don't see it show up in the vote count, because unbeknownst to the town at the time, bjc had already hammered on expresso.<br>\n<br>\nIt screams \"impromtu opportunistic scum post to justify vote on wagon against scum friend\". Remember that at the end of the day, scum losing 2 members day 1 is a vital blow that is almost impossible to recover from. As such we expect mafia to vote competing wagons. Which, is what Wolfy consistently did. While I don't believe that scum couldn't have bussed expresso, this suspect appeals to me most right now. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2</div><br>\nDon't worry this day is just as good of a read.<br>\n<br>\nDay starts and Wolfy jumps right back onto fusion. Okay well I had assumed that the main reason that expresso wasn't as scummy anymore to Wolfy was that Fusion was town to him. After all, given the posts that came in day 1 with respect to Wolfy's opinions, this is the only logical explanation.<br>\n<br>\nOkay this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026009#p6026009\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a> is his scum reads: implosion, fusion, konowa. Now ignoring the fact that this opens up issues regarding his early switch to the konowa wagon (his reasoning, the push on implosion, and the fact that he switched off fusion), these reads are very random. We can look at his earlier posts and see the implosion is a town read. There's no explanation to any of this of course.<br>\n<br>\nHe votes Peabody next. Why? Well because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026030#p6026030\" class=\"postlink\">Peabody felt clusk was town for a dumb reason</a>. There can be no other explanation for the vote, because nothing else happened in between the time he implicitly said \"peabody is not mafia\" and \"vote peabody\". The most important aspect of this vote is that it is a big bandwagon, wolfy is just hopping on without having to contribute. There is no reason for this vote that is acceptable other than to kill a random person.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3</div><br>\n<br>\nSo the Peabody lynch goes through and he jumps onto Fusion again with the same 3 scum reads as earlier. It's interesting that he compromised these reads to vote the biggest wagon, and then remarried them after the wagon was finished. He then makes some frustrating posts of how hes a VI but lets ignore them.<br>\n<br>\nThis post... <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6061256#p6061256\" class=\"postlink\">Okay so noggy and SK are town</a> and scum is on his wagon. But you don't know which is scum!??!? This is IMPOSSIBLE if we are to believe that Wolfy is town because two of the people on that wagon have been scum reads of Wolfy. Granted no explanation or evidence that this is true aside from outright stating this as fact has been given to support these reads, but they still exist. Yet he stays conflicted. Oh and did I mention the third scum read is SK?<br>\n<br>\nHe supposedly \"forgot\" what game he was in, I don't buy it. It just shows that he isn't paying attention and is looking at what is right in front of him, and finding the safest way to get town killed. This type of play is heavily supported with blatant bandwagoning, opportunistic reads, and lack of explanation regarding reads.<br>\n<br>\nThere's nothing else of note in this ISO.<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion (this is not a TLDR), Wolfy has exhibited no evidence of scum hunting despite many reads which he only follows up on when they are the biggest bandwagon. Coincidentally that is also when they are formed, and if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway. The result of this play is a lot of crisscrossing and contradiction of how he feels about the game in correlation to his play. Which I have exposed above.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Noggy</span><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway</div></blockquote><br>\nand yes that was a TLDR.", "time": "Wed Jul 30, 2014 1:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58383&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "58383"}

I freely admit to that. My contention was that he was such a drag on this town and so unpredictable that I thought our town would be in serious jeopardy if he was allowed to survive deep into this game. It was only icing on the cake that Konowa hadn't investigated him. <br>\n<br>\nI am completely open to either a Wolfy or implosion lynch at this point, as I said yesterday. implosion because he's seemingly phoning it in at this point (which I wouldn't blame him if he were scum). Wolfy because he was trying way too hard to defend Noggy yesterday. I don't think anyone on the Noggy wagon (sans possibly Junpei) was really sold on the idea that Noggy was the last scum. I mean, I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I was very clear that I simply didn't trust him at all regardless of alignment. I was deliberately trying to be somewhat harsh in my assessment of Noggy in order to hopefully spur him into action (and if I had saw him give any damn at all about this game whatsoever... any glimmer of interest at all, I may very well have relented in my pursuit).", "time": "Sat Aug 02, 2014 7:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58383&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "58383"}

What makes this particularly interesting is that Konowa was just being bandwagoned as this post was made. You just don't see it show up in the vote count, because unbeknownst to the town at the time, bjc had already hammered on expresso.<br>\n<br>\nIt screams \"impromtu opportunistic scum post to justify vote on wagon against scum friend\". Remember that at the end of the day, scum losing 2 members day 1 is a vital blow that is almost impossible to recover from. As such we expect mafia to vote competing wagons. Which, is what Wolfy consistently did. While I don't believe that scum couldn't have bussed expresso, this suspect appeals to me most right now. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2</div><br>\nDon't worry this day is just as good of a read.<br>\n<br>\nDay starts and Wolfy jumps right back onto fusion. Okay well I had assumed that the main reason that expresso wasn't as scummy anymore to Wolfy was that Fusion was town to him. After all, given the posts that came in day 1 with respect to Wolfy's opinions, this is the only logical explanation.<br>\n<br>\nOkay this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026009#p6026009\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a> is his scum reads: implosion, fusion, konowa. Now ignoring the fact that this opens up issues regarding his early switch to the konowa wagon (his reasoning, the push on implosion, and the fact that he switched off fusion), these reads are very random. We can look at his earlier posts and see the implosion is a town read. There's no explanation to any of this of course.<br>\n<br>\nHe votes Peabody next. Why? Well because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6026030#p6026030\" class=\"postlink\">Peabody felt clusk was town for a dumb reason</a>. There can be no other explanation for the vote, because nothing else happened in between the time he implicitly said \"peabody is not mafia\" and \"vote peabody\". The most important aspect of this vote is that it is a big bandwagon, wolfy is just hopping on without having to contribute. There is no reason for this vote that is acceptable other than to kill a random person.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3</div><br>\n<br>\nSo the Peabody lynch goes through and he jumps onto Fusion again with the same 3 scum reads as earlier. It's interesting that he compromised these reads to vote the biggest wagon, and then remarried them after the wagon was finished. He then makes some frustrating posts of how hes a VI but lets ignore them.<br>\n<br>\nThis post... <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6061256#p6061256\" class=\"postlink\">Okay so noggy and SK are town</a> and scum is on his wagon. But you don't know which is scum!??!? This is IMPOSSIBLE if we are to believe that Wolfy is town because two of the people on that wagon have been scum reads of Wolfy. Granted no explanation or evidence that this is true aside from outright stating this as fact has been given to support these reads, but they still exist. Yet he stays conflicted. Oh and did I mention the third scum read is SK?<br>\n<br>\nHe supposedly \"forgot\" what game he was in, I don't buy it. It just shows that he isn't paying attention and is looking at what is right in front of him, and finding the safest way to get town killed. This type of play is heavily supported with blatant bandwagoning, opportunistic reads, and lack of explanation regarding reads.<br>\n<br>\nThere's nothing else of note in this ISO.<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion (this is not a TLDR), Wolfy has exhibited no evidence of scum hunting despite many reads which he only follows up on when they are the biggest bandwagon. Coincidentally that is also when they are formed, and if one of his reads ISNT the leading wagon, he will vote that wagon anyway. The result of this play is a lot of crisscrossing and contradiction of how he feels about the game in correlation to his play.

{"number": 694, "id": "6095224", "user": "RedCoyote", "user_id": "10223", "content": "You know, I was kind of worried about this. We would all get dragged along for this crap because someone had cold feet (Nat). Nat, by all accounts, should be town here, but I am absolutely not buying that based on his play. He's town because of the report and because of the Espresso lynch. That's it. But going back to reread over the Espresso lynch, no matter how I read it, Nat is very townie about it. <br>\n<br>\nThis is where I am, I guess. I kind of want to read Nat as scum, but my brain tells me that's wrong (godfather isn't powerful enough) and my heart tells me that's wrong (his relationship to Espresso sounds like a town-scum one anyway I slice it). I read over Espresso again pretty closely, but I can't really find any other clues on his end other than <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6008363#p6008363\" class=\"postlink\">more evidence pointing to Nat as town</a>. I've reached the point where I will bet the game on Nat being town. So, Wolfy (or anyone else that wants to), I ask that you respond to this.  <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing, during my reread, I found another couple of little nuggets that I had forgotten about:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>implosion 190 wrote:</cite>itt espressojet continues to be obviously town</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>implosion 229 wrote:</cite>Espresso's play right now just isn't the play that scum-going-down would make... scum-espresso would not say that he is a better lynch than fusion.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nimplosion could defend himself by saying being wrong /= being scum, but remember that the time he said this was right as Espresso was reaching fever pitch. This was right before Espresso self-voted and bjc hammered. Now, scumimplosion may have been thinking he could still save his partner from this, as Nat lovingly referred to it, \"power lynching\", but I'll be he didn't anticipate Espresso voting himself and bjc doing him in immediately thereafter. After all, had bjc not hammered like an absolute boss, that wagon would've collapsed on the next page. I think the safe play for scum at that point (prior to and even immediately after Espresso voting himself) would've been to try and talk down the wagon. Keep in mind, however, that myself, Nat, Wolfy and implosion all did this to a degree at the end of D1. implosion and Wolfy stand out as never having supported the wagon with a vote. implosion stands out for never supporting the wagon with a vote or vocally calling Espresso a scumread of his. <br>\n<br>\nLast thing I want to point out,<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wolfy 114 wrote:</cite>Expressojet looks scummy to me - will look even more scummy for <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6007253#p6007253\" class=\"postlink\">101</a>if Fusion flips town</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wolfy 276 wrote:</cite>Expresso is probably town for the self vote and feeling sorry for himself.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe only purpose of this juxtaposition is to illustrate Wolfy going from calling Espresso scummy to calling him town in a manner with which to slow down the wagon (that Wolfy probably thought at the time hadn't been hammered by bjc ... I know I did).<br>\n<br>\nSo all of this is basically a long way of saying our best bet in hitting scum is by lynching Wolfy and implosion as Espresso's wagon holds the key to victory in this game. <br>\n<br>\nIn other words this is exactly where I was in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6059771#p6059771\">462</a> two weeks ago.

If you read those ~2-3 pages surrounding it... I cannot come up with a good reason for Nat to do that to the last scum partner. If it was a bus, it was kind of a weak one and not very showy. Nat also jumps off of it after Espresso was lynched, which makes zero sense unless you turn up the WIFOM. If you're trying to get credit for bussing, and the target is already lynched, why back off after the fact? Granted, it may have been that, like myself, Nat didn't realize that Espresso was lynched, but still. It doesn't make sense of a partner to act that way.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, Nat's play hasn't been great, which worries me, but the Espresso wagon trumps that, I think. I also agree with you in the SK/Junpei are playing pretty townie-like. You've also got the report for SK and the rofl credentials for Junpei, both of which are as good as gold.", "time": "Fri Aug 08, 2014 10:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58383&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "58383"}

Where I'm at right now (now that I'm actually thinking and not just proddodging) is basically: the game is lost if SK/Junpei are scum, so that's pretty much out of consideration atm for me. I'm convinced in RedCoyote town. Part of that is setup speculation. Neighbor-godfather seems somewhat unlikely. As does the way RC handled the neighbor claim coming from scum. That leaves Wolfy/Nati. Wolfy feels at this point like the default person to see as scum for some unknown reason so I'm basically going to do everything I can to convince myself that Nati is scum, and see if it seems cogent.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTo me, the key to this game is the Espresso wagon. If you read those ~2-3 pages surrounding it... I cannot come up with a good reason for Nat to do that to the last scum partner. If it was a bus, it was kind of a weak one and not very showy. Nat also jumps off of it after Espresso was lynched, which makes zero sense unless you turn up the WIFOM. If you're trying to get credit for bussing, and the target is already lynched, why back off after the fact? Granted, it may have been that, like myself, Nat didn't realize that Espresso was lynched, but still. It doesn't make sense of a partner to act that way.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, Nat's play hasn't been great, which worries me, but the Espresso wagon trumps that, I think. I also agree with you in the SK/Junpei are playing pretty townie-like. You've also got the report for SK and the rofl credentials for Junpei, both of which are as good as gold.</div></blockquote><br>\nAlright, let's look at Nat's interaction with the Espresso wagon in detail. Before it, he voted Fusion, claiming it as a shameless sheep. We can ask the question then: how would scum-Nat react to a wagon on their last scumbuddy? Well, scum-Nat certainly couldn't ignore it, as that would create a stark contrast between willingness to blindly sheep on Fusion and unwillingness to blindly sheep on Espresso if Espresso flips scum. So, what would be a reasonable course of action? Going all-in with the phrase \"200% fine with powerlynching\" seems to make more sense than limping into the wagon. Sure, after that it was a weak bus, but that leaves Nat with an out if the wagon goes away, which is entirely feasible to have happened after the Fusion wagon earlier. It's quite possible that Nat was trying to just look like a generically sheeping townie, and thus treated the Fusion and Espresso wagons similarly. That isn't really an argument for Nat-scum in and of itself, but it is an argument that the Espresso wagon makes sense from that point of view. Nat also later said:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Colorized, and not my Espresso lead is less due to actually scumreading and more due to me having my vote there.</div></blockquote><br>\nAnd then later he unvoted after the hammer. I think it's fair to assume Nat didn't realize the hammer had fell (regardless of alignment). There's no clear reason to make the unvote otherwise. So, Nat-town unvoting doesn't particularly make sense or not make sense. It's feasible. Nat-scum unvoting might look odd, but I can think of multiple lines of reasoning to justify it. Nat could have thought the pattern of the day was a bunch of wagons being built up and torn down, and wanted to continue that pattern in a way that wouldn't get espresso lynched. Nat could have had second thoughts about lynching the only other scum. Nat might have wanted to leave the wagon for some kind of wifom value. They're certainly not the most cogent reasons, but I think they're certainly reasonable.", "time": "Mon Aug 11, 2014 3:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58383&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "58383"}
