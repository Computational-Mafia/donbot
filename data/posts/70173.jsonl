You have decided to leave your home, civilization and all modern technology and comforts behind to sleep in a tent providing nutrition for mosquitoes in an undisclosed location for an indefinite amount of time! After packing all necessary supplies and a few unhealthy snacks, you embarked on a journey to the middle of nowhere. <br>\n<br>\nBut as you get to the middle of nowhere, you discover 13 other people at the exact same camping spot. How inconvenient. You set up your tent next to all the other tents, then gather with your fellow campers to do awkward small talk. <br>\n<br>\nAfter five minutes of uncomfortable conversation, everyone realizes that all 13 tents look exactly the same. Even worse, since there&#8217;s 14 people, and no one can remember which their own tent was, an argument breaks out over who gets to sleep in which tent.<br>\n<br>\nThis argument is interrupted by someone screaming at the top of their lungs. Everyone rushes over to follow the noise. They discover a corpse that has been stabbed, shot, burned and dismembered in a most gruesome fashion.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Leonshade</div> was killed.

(To be fair, I've played only a small number of games where masons are even possible in the setup). <br>\n<br>\nThe reasons I think that mason fake claims are scummy are:<br>\n<br>\n1) Fake claims in general look scummy to me. Someone else here said town shouldn't lie, and I believe that <br>\n2) This particular type of claim is designed to completely remove the people in it from the lynch pool, for at least one day, so people stop trying to read them if the claim is believable<br>\n3) No one ever thinks that both people in the faux masonry might be scum. So if one flips town through whatever means, the other gets flipped because they *must be* the scummy one. If both faux masons are town, this is a bad outcome. <br>\n4) It's a good way to buddy or pocket someone - 'I think you're so town that I'll fake claim masons to save you' <br>\n5) It creates unnecessary diversion from town, who have to indulge in 'is it fake or not' speculation<br>\n<br>\nHow's that?", "time": "Mon Jan 30, 2017 7:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

Could be scum could be town from my experience.

Someone else here said town shouldn't lie, and I believe that <br>\n2) This particular type of claim is designed to completely remove the people in it from the lynch pool, for at least one day, so people stop trying to read them if the claim is believable<br>\n3) No one ever thinks that both people in the faux masonry might be scum. So if one flips town through whatever means, the other gets flipped because they *must be* the scummy one. If both faux masons are town, this is a bad outcome. <br>\n4) It's a good way to buddy or pocket someone - 'I think you're so town that I'll fake claim masons to save you' <br>\n5) It creates unnecessary diversion from town, who have to indulge in 'is it fake or not' speculation<br>\n<br>\nHow's that?</div></blockquote>\n\nSo faking mason claims is scummy, yet you never saw scum do it.

For now though, I believe where my vote is currently is fine where it is until something else/someone else acting scummy pops up.</div></blockquote>\n\nNo my problem is you said a player was screaming scum (Player A). Then you vote a player who has offered nothing (Player B) without ever changing a read on the player screaming scum.<br>\n<br>\nPlayer B is a lurker, waste of space, call it whatever. Could be scum could be town from my experience. I personally agree that Nadpool might be scum albeit for additional reasons than \"offering nothing.\"<br>\n<br>\nSo if Player A is screaming scum, and you never reliquinish that screaming scum read, one you specifically state later was only strengthened by a lack of a reasonable response:<br>\n<br>\n\"I thought id call him out on what I considered him to be doing to see if he'd offer a reasonable response. A page later he hadnt offered one, so I put my vote on him.\"<br>\n<br>\nand then all of a sudden vote a lurker who is doing nothing, yeah that catches my eye.</div></blockquote>\n\nSince my vote wasn't gaining any traction at the time I decided to shift it to another potential scum I had my eye on. I'm under the assumption that during the course of the game people are supposed to make compromises in order to lynch the people they think are scum.</div></blockquote>\nEww I don't like how slimy that post tasted<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fykus</span>", "time": "Wed Feb 01, 2017 9:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

I've played with three of you very recently, in the same game in fact, and I think all of you know how I feel about fake claims. Whether from town or scum, they're unhelpful to town, and by my definition, that's scummy. <br>\n<br>\nIn the game I refer to, LUV fake claimed a role that cleared me, then claimed his actual role, and got lynched for it. Transcend I think it was, claimed a role D1, which was different from his actual role, but I voted him for it because while I can spot a lie, I can't tell whether it's the good kind or the bad kind. We almost lynched Titus because she claimed something that *looked* fake in context.

Shannon doesn't even stick up for TwoFace in 251. She just confirmed what he said was true.<br>\n2. Your whole read on Shannon is based on the fact that you say TwoFace is scum.

Someone else here said town shouldn't lie, and I believe that <br>\n2) This particular type of claim is designed to completely remove the people in it from the lynch pool, for at least one day, so people stop trying to read them if the claim is believable<br>\n3) No one ever thinks that both people in the faux masonry might be scum. So if one flips town through whatever means, the other gets flipped because they *must be* the scummy one. If both faux masons are town, this is a bad outcome. <br>\n4) It's a good way to buddy or pocket someone - 'I think you're so town that I'll fake claim masons to save you' <br>\n5) It creates unnecessary diversion from town, who have to indulge in 'is it fake or not' speculation<br>\n<br>\nHow's that?</div></blockquote>\n\nSo faking mason claims is scummy, yet you never saw scum do it.

So, dealing with suspicion from him isn't going to be easy. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=68822\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1843</a> is the game I was referencing earlier where the scum he was tunneling all of D1 (Sotty7) killed him N1. I think it's very plausible for scum to kill him and play it off as nightkill wifom. There's no guarantee that town would lynch sickofit. It's possible that we'd talk ourselves out of it. With TwoFace alive on the other hand, he'd be constantly reminding everyone to lynch sickofit and I think that would make his lynch more likely. You are welcome to read the game I linked and comment on whether you think Sotty7 was \"that bad\" because I thought she was otherwise quite competent. The point is scum have done it before. In fact, when I brought up suspicion of Sotty7 the following day, her partner immediately tried to dismiss the TwoFace kill as a framejob and pushed me for it. By the way, TwoFace was killed over an outed mason in that game.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8850649#p8850649\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8850649#p8850649\" data-post-id=\"8850649\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 633</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=315\">massive</a> wrote:</cite>I mean, I was one of the tunnellees, and either (a) I'm not scum so Twoface wasn't right or (b) you have to think I'm so bad that I'd let my team basically out me by killing Twoface.

I think it's plausible that you are town and Sickofit is scum and killed TwoFace. I think it's also plausible you are scum and sickofit is town and you killed him because people might disregard his reads if he was wrong on sickofit and we lynched sickofit first. I haven't ruled out you and sickofit being a team together although that's not my primary theory.<br>\n<br>\nIn Musical mafia, when I got killed, you didn't take my reads into consideration and went after Kairal anyways. So, why would you expect that a TwoFace kill means that town would immediately be looking at you and Sickofit?", "time": "Sun Feb 12, 2017 7:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

In fact, you voted her because of a post on page two that wasn't even scummy to begin with and left your vote there for the entirety of D1. Your issue with my predecessor LUV doesn't make sense to me. LUV suspected Lucca because the latter was always just catching up and was rarely ever playing the game in real time and interacting with other players spontaneously. I thought that was a reasonable suspicion. Instead you compared Lucca with Nadpool and asked why LUV wasn't suspicious of Nadpool for doing the same thing. Except Nadpool's and Lucca's play were not similar at all. While I could see Lucca as scum trying to float under the radar by making catchup posts, Nadpool has been a lot more blatant about not contributing anything and there's much less scum motivation in his style of play as opposed to Lucca's. Moving onto D2, I don't like how you voted Fykus for playing an \"obvious newbscum\" game whereas you mostly ignored the rise and fall of the Fykus wagon D1. What changed your mind? If he was such obvious newbscum, why did you need IAI to convince you to join the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8812336#p8812336\">407</a>?", "time": "Sun Feb 12, 2017 8:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

All his \"soft-claim\" does is make people hesitate to lynch him while letting scum know that he's a likely PR if he's town. Having it all out in the open allows us to do setup-spec and solve the game. I don't understand why you have sickofit as town. Apparently, you think he's a bad player. But bad players can draw scum too. Why isn't he bad scum.

Trying to get a sense of why it happened, who was pushing it, etc.<br>\n<br>\nFirst thing I notice is that lucca was voting Fykus but moved off it right before the wagon really picked up steam, then never really commented on it or hopped back on as it got serious. I find that curious, but it could also be a coincidence. Also nothing to expand on unfortunately since like a million other people he replaced out. (Turns out he hopped on again post-claim.)<br>\nIamInnocent clearly did most of the pushing of the wagon, and seems to have been the one to lay out the clearest case. Having gone through that part of the game again, it certainly looks like a genuine and sincere effort on the part of IAI. Regardless of if/when Fykus flips, I think IAI comes off super Town in that.<br>\nNadpool sheeps onto the wagon, which isn't super noteworthy because of the shtick but is worth mentioning. He basically just QFT'd IAI, which is something I don't really like on a wagon that's gaining steam. Again, hard to tell with the shtick.<br>\nLastly, Sick. Wow. Reading this again, I *really* don't like Sick's participation on the wagon. Hops on to make it L-1, gets a claim, then immediately hops back off. Contrary to my prior defense of Sick for other things, that's not something that's at all explainable by my player read on Sick. I really don't like it, and it looks opportunistic as hell.<br>\nPostclaim, SSBM hopped off without any real comment, as did Shannon. Nadpool hopped off while agreeing with 2F that he won't lynch claimed PR D1.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I still remain unconvinced of the wagon and think Fykus could be NewbScum or just a in-over-his-head NewbTown. I think the case on him is legit as I said, but don't know that I'm convinced by it. I do find the actions of people involved in it odd, though, particularly anyone who jumped off. Like I said at the time, any Scum being lynched will claim a PR. I don't understand at all the idea that you won't lynch someone who claims to be a PR. Doesn't that just guarantee you'll get one or more claims and end up lynching a VT on D1 every time?

You get to the middle of the camp and yell for everyone to wake up.

I can't tell whether you're writing in from an 'imagine I'm town' perspective or from an 'imagine i'm scum' one. <br>\n<br>\nIf Fykus thought you were a PR and that you were scum, the only way he could kill you would be if he was a town vigilante, I think. Scum can't kill each other at night. So the theory you've given there makes no sense with Fykus' claim.<br>\n<br>\nIf you were a Town Watcher, why would you want Town Fykus to be night killed? If you were a Scum Watcher, then whether or not Town Fykus was killed was within your control. Makes no sense.  <br>\n<br>\nYou thinking that you were jailed rules out your possible BP claim, IMHO. Also, claiming BP at this point would basically be a scum claim.<br>\n<br>\nIf you were a bodyguard and jailed, you should want to be jailed again. A bodyguard only gets one working shot, so while the other PRs are hidden it's best for you to stay alive until you can be of use. By 'of use', I mean that if we had say a claimed cop, you could be like 'oh hey, I'm protecting them tonight' and that would give the cop an extra night of results (assuming no strongman). If scum thought you were a bodyguard it makes sense to get rid of you early, for that reason - it stops you being really useful later.<br>\n<br>\nAs for watcher, if you were watcher and jailed you should have received 'no result'. Was that the case? <br>\n<br>\nWhat contingency plan could you possibly have had, if you were any of these roles other than bulletproof? It doesn't add up to me. <br>\n<br>\nAnd also - ScumYou might still have tried to kill TownJKFykus, but Fykus may have been protected by another town PR. So his being alive gives no credence to your theory.<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR: I think both Fykus and Jupiter might both be scum.", "time": "Sat Feb 18, 2017 2:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

I do remember us planning to distance/bus but she could never really follow through on bussing me. She distanced but only voted town and eventually found reasons to not push me even after initially calling me scum.<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Shannon</div> - My early game concerns with Shannon are mostly nebulous gut vibes. I didn't like the self-focus in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8782287#p8782287\">149</a>, asking TwoFace and sickofit to simmer down (which she has motive to do if she were scum with sickofit), and the jump on Matt in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8784799#p8784799\">155</a> given Sensfan said a similar thing \"lecturing\" TwoFace and Shannon didn't call him out on that. Shannon's early game scumread of sickofit is a little confusing to me. She votes sickofit because she apparently hates fake-claimers but doesn't seem to mind switching first to Matt for something Sensfan also did and then immediately switching to Lucca for which she doesn't provide a reason. I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8790406#p8790406\">207</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8790433#p8790433\">209</a> especially as I remember her being unwilling to flat-out bus when we were scum together although she distanced plenty.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Nadpool</div> - I think sickofit's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8791443#p8791443\">226</a> is a minor point towards Nadpool as town. Sickofit has twice tried to make other people look guilty by tying them to Fykus. First with Matt in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8790576#p8790576\">213</a> and then with TwoFace in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815796#p8815796\">440</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815834#p8815834\">443</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815874#p8815874\">450</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8816046#p8816046\">453</a>. So the fact that he tried to make Nadpool look scummy for townreading Fykus is a small towntell.

TL;DR - I don't think they are. At least, not all of them.<br>\n<br>\n** <br>\n<br>\nTown have a confirmed tracker and a backup tracker. Whatever mafia's power, then, it must be able to be tracked, or both roles are useless. So they don't have a Ninja.<br>\n<br>\nBut tracking must be important, to be given a backup. We must have limited other ways to find scum, or scum must be immune to other ways of investigating (e.g. jailing to prevent a kill and being found out that way). <br>\n<br>\nSo I'm going to speculate that Mafia has a strongman, at least one shot, or as part of a JOAT. (JOAT might be 1 shot strongman, 1 shot commuter so immune to tracker, 1 shot hider or something like that?)<br>\n<br>\nOn my view, Mafia has a roleblocker and at least a 1 shot strongman, with our without other powers. <br>\n<br>\nClaimed Town Jailkeeper can contain a roleblocker but not a strongman. <br>\nClaimed Town Doctor can be roleblocked and overcome by a strongman, but would be useful against regular kills. That would support my idea that a strongman needs to have limited shots, or else Town has no way of countering him except waiting til very late game when things are 'narrowed down' and tracking where he goes. <br>\n<br>\nFinally, we have our claimed Town JOAT.  Role Cop, Doctor, Bulletproof. <br>\nRole Cop supports the Tracker and backup, without introducing another full tracker.

Then pretended that you were townreading him and didn't offer any reasons why. That made it look as though you were scum and knew he was town because he wasn't part of your scum thread. Then sickofit correctly called you out on it. That made him look like he was actually town scumhunting you. Essentially you gave scum an excuse to make legitimate pushes and look town doing so.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, you had role results on sickofit showing he was a roleblocker. Fykus claimed Jailkeeper. The likelihood of both those roles being town is pretty small and overpowers town a lot.

Roleblocker is much more commonly a scumrole than a town role. It makes no sense for Jupiter to rolecop sick because he was scumreading him and then go about calling him town after getting a highly incriminating result. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8884903#p8884903\">825</a> looks like justification made up after the fact. I don't see how calling someone town when you have ample hard evidence to believe is scum is going to be a good way to look for associatives at all.<br>\n<br>\n2. Even if Jupiter decided to give sick the benefit of the doubt (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8884903#p8884903\">825</a>) then a push on fykus obviously should have followed (because JK and RB don't make much sense together on the same town team) But Jupiter pretty much avoids talking about fykus until sick's claim is shot to pieces.<br>\n<br>\n3. The whole thing where Jupiter first tried to swing things over to sensfan before immediately switching back to sick just reads like scum who thought they had this brilliant idead and then realizing it was dumb.<br>\n<br>\n4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866602#p8866602\">743</a> is kinda incriminating upon further review (I'm thinking fykus is town right now which I will get to later). It looks to me like Jupiter is trying to get fykus' list of targets so the scum team can avoid being blocked (which obviously failed)<br>\n<br>\n5. Jupiter's hard townread of fykus makes absolutely no sense. The PR specs alone should be enough for Jupiter to doubt fykus. I mean Jupiter's shaded matt after his claim despite recently holding a pretty hard tr on him (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8857425#p8857425\">679</a>). Maybe Jupiter is doing this because they're scumbuddies but unless there's another PR claim I think that's unlikely. But the more I've thought about it, the more I realize that Jupiter needs fykus alive as long as possible to avoid getting lynched. I mean, if fykus gets lynched and flips town, Jupiter should and will be powerlynched the following day. Keeping fykus alive prevents that from happening. I feel like Jupiter is pushing for an easy mislynch outside the claims in order to survive an extra day (which is kinda making me think sensfan is town now, but I'm less sure of that).<br>\n<br>\n6. The claim is just weird. I've never heard of the type of BP that Jupiter seems to be describing, and it doesn't seem like it would be under normal guidelines, but I'm not confident enough in this to say for certain. But the combination of powers Jupiter claims don't feel cohesive to me.<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\nNow why is fykus town?<br>\n<br>\nI'll admit, I'm not in love with a lot of his posts. And there's a solid chance he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nBut I don't get super strong feels that he was partners with sick and I don't get super strong feels that he's partnered with Jupiter either, who I'm pretty sure is scum no. 2.<br>\n<br>\nAnd while it may seem a bit odd that he's survived two nights with his claim, at the same time, his claim was never taken for granted - he has remained rather lynchable throughout D2 and D3. Furthermore, it's possible he was the target N2 and blocked Jupiter's shot.<br>\n<br>\nAll in all I just feel a bit iffy about fykus while there is much more incriminating stuff regarding Jupiter. But even if I was 50/50 between them (I'm more like 75 Jupiter scum/15 Fykus scum/5 Both Scum) it makes more sense to lynch Jupiter. Fykus' claimed PR is much more valuable than whatever Jupiter claims to have left (whatever the weird BP is that probably doesn't exist, and even that could be gone if Fykus is in fact scum). And if Jupiter does flip town, it's incredibly easy just to lynch Fykus the next day.<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR - Jupiter is more likely to be scum than fykus and also makes for a less bad mislynch than fykus if we do end up mislynching.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: JupiterCrush</span>", "time": "Sun Feb 19, 2017 10:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

Specifically, if he's well-versed enough on game balance to suspect Matt's claim, then he should also have thought one of Sickofit/Fykus were scum. I wrote it off as him just being a newbie and not knowing game balance but it's inconsistent with his immediate jump on Matt.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure what to make of his trying to keep sickofit alive even after he was confirmed scum. Looks like a ridiculously ballsy play for scum to do. I fully agree with your point #4. I wouldn't rule out town doing it but it does seem so much like scum trying to out Fykus's targets. Why would he want Fykus to out his targets anyways if he was town? If Jupiter really is scum, I don't see why he would do the kill as opposed to letting his partner do it unless the partner is also listed in the top three JK targets which narrows it down to just me or IAI.<br>\n<br>\nWhat are your thoughts on Fykus's reaction to sickofit saying that he visited ssbm? That's pretty damning to me because I'd expect 99% of the time, town would just see that, call it bs and vote sickofit. But Fykus really tried to stall it out as long as possible and we know it wasn't because he didn't have time to log onto the site because he did have time to post in a recently completed game, ask for the scum PT and keep checking in until it was posted. During this time, he prod-dodged here and I find it hard to believe that he completely missed that sickofit had an apparently incriminating result on him.<br>\n<br>\nI agree that Fykus/Jupiter interactions don't feel that much like scum-scum to me. However, I think sickofit and Fykus look very much like a team. Fykus's opening move was to chainsaw sickofit. Sickofit's end of day insistence that TwoFace take a stance on the Fykus wagon looks like him trying to make TwoFace look guilty by association. Sick also puts Fykus at L-1 and immediately unvotes. Fykus never pushes sickofit which is consistent with the latter's roleblocker claim and Fykus not wanting to bus. From the rest of their interactions, I don't see anything that precludes them being partners. Mind going over what I'm missing?

I could see it being plausible but IAI backing off of sickofit when he saw the soft-claim mirrored my own thoughts as I was reading through and that's a pretty hard reaction to fake. I do think Jailkeeper makes more sense as a town role than whatever Jupiter claimed (why does a mod even create a role like 1-shot rolecop, 1-shot doc, and 1-shot BP vest? Mods would want an elegant setup and that role just looks ridiculous). I think Jaack makes some good points about how Jupiter's play makes sense as scum but I'm still hung up on the fact that it would be really complicated to set it all up like he did. Jupiter's actions do make sense with the role he claimed and he would have had to pre-plan having this ridiculous role right from the moment he replaced in and play accordingly. Then there's the fact that Fykus has basically not been playing this game. He's been mega-lurking for a very, very long time. I've seen his newbie town-game. This isn't how he plays.

I should note that it's possible that IAI was the nk choice as he has been widely townread and the only other option, fykus, was highly lynchable.<br>\n<br>\nI think shannon makes a decent amount of sense. Moderately scummy on her own, was part of the first sick wagon D1, but not the second one, and only voted sick D2 after the lynch had pretty much been decided. With the lucca/jupiter slot, shannon was on that flashwagon D1, but joined and left without much of a word on the subject. It was actually shannon's vote that made me give that wagon a closer look initially, and it remains an odd vote.<br>\n<br>\n@Matt - That seems like a reasonable enough narrative, but I still think that Jupiter is the superior lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as I can see it, there are four possible things that can happen today:<br>\n1. We lynch Jupiter, Jupiter flips scum<br>\n2. We lynch Jupiter, Jupiter flips town<br>\n3. We lynch Fykus, Fykus flips scum<br>\n4. We lynch Fykus, Fykus flips town.<br>\n<br>\nSince we have a flipped roleblocker, I'm going to assume that the remaining scum are all goons for the sake of this scenario work.<br>\n<br>\nScenario 1 is pretty awesome. We're down to one remaining scum, and we have a solid role like JK, which only improves when there's a single scum left.<br>\nScenario 3 is also awesome, but an outted 1 shot BP that has to be activated is not particularly powerful. The best it can do is scare scum from shooting Jupiter until lylo, which is ok I guess, but not nearly as cool as a jk. I guess this one practically confirms IAI as town (I guess scum could have holstered, but that seems unlikely. The only other explination is that Matt saved IAI)<br>\nScenario 2 and 4 are about equally bad. We waste a mislynch, Matt gets shot N3, lynch the other scum D4. If fykus was the scum, IAI dies N4, if Jupiter than idk) Either way, we're at 6 players with 2 chances to lynch 1 scum. Not great but still winnable. That being said I don't see much of a tangible difference between these scenarios.<br>\n<br>\nIf I were 50/50 on which one of fykus/jupiter was scum, I'd still support a Jupiter lynch, because it has higher upside. But I also think that Jupiter makes more sense as scum. If y'all decide that fykus is the better lynch, I'm not going to spend too much energy arguing against it - I'm not that confident in my reads. But Jupiter remains the far better lynch option.", "time": "Mon Feb 20, 2017 10:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70173&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "70173"}

I think the low activity level, the disinterest, and the stalling is unlikely to be town especially since I've read through a newbie town-game of his and his play here is nothing like this. I'm not sure why you don't think it's damning. There's also the fact that there's nothing in the D1 ISO of sickofit/Fykus that stops them from being partners. In fact, things like sickofit trying to associate Fykus with TwoFace points more towards them being partners. There's also what I mentioned earlier that sickofit would try harder to lynch Fykus if Fykus were town. What Matt said is the icing on the cake.  <br>\n<br>\nBetween Fykus and Jupiter, I admit I'm annoyed with Jupiter's play and manner of revealing his claim. I'm not even sure I buy the role that he claimed and there's still a tinfoil worry that Lucca and Sickofit were using their previous game to signal to each other that \"weird\" was some kind of code. But I do have to say Jupiter's actions are consistent with his claim in a way that if he's scum, he went through a lot of effort to pre-plan the whole thing. I also like the fact that Lucca didn't bite into sickofit's insistence that because they pushed each other in a previous game, they should be friends now. Lucca pushed against that and voted him. All on balance, I think Fykus is more likely to flip scum and now that Sensfan has posted, I'm ready to vote there.

He slashes at you, and while you attempt to block with your knife, when the knives collide you lose your grip on your weapon.

You find him lying with his eyes open and his throat cut.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nadpool</div> was killed Night Three. He was a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\n\"I caught SensFan red-handed,\" JupiterCrush says. \"Literally.\" Focusing on SensFan's hands, you realize that JupiterCrush is telling the truth. It was easy to miss in the dark, but now that people were shining flashlights on him, the blood stains on SensFan's hands were apparent. \"So you killed Nadpool?\" You ask. \"Why?\"<br>\n<br>\nDespite the situation he is in, SensFan is eerily calm. He turns his gaze at you, not a hint of fear in his eyes. \"Why?\" He repeats. \"Because camping is so... <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">boring.</div>\" His answer takes you by surprise. \"Boring?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Think back to the past few days. How much of it would you describe as fun, or exciting, or interesting? We are in the middle of nowhere, sleeping in uncomfortable tents, swatting away flies and mosquitoes. Camping is nothing more than denying yourself all the modern comforts of our daily lives for no reason. And yet this trip has been quite exciting, wouldn't you agree? And why is that?\"<br>\n<br>\nYou think back to all the people that have been killed, all the days spent trying to figure out who's doing the killing, all the nights spent waiting in fear, wondering if you're going to be the next victim. The trip has been frightening, but you can't deny that it has also been exciting.<br>\n<br>\n\"It is all thanks to me. Fykus, Sickofit, they were just my pawns. I took a knife-wielding psychopath and a mentally unhinged sadist and turned them into entertainers. My little murder mystery is the only thing that has been spicing up our lives here. And now that you've solved the mystery, this trip has reached its end. A bit of an anti-climax, but what are you going to do. I never did like getting my hands dirty, perhaps it is best that this is over.<br>\n<br>\n\"This trip is indeed over,\" JupiterCrush says, \"for you. As is your life.\" <br>\n<br>\nA wide grin spreads over SensFan's face. \"What are you going to do, kill me? We may be in the middle of nature, but that doesn't mean that the laws of man don't apply here. I may be a murderer, but if you end the life of a defenseless man, so are you. Lynching Sickofit was already bad enough, do you really want two murders on your hands? You will take me back to civilization and have me judged in a court of law, to do anything else would be vigilante justice.\"<br>\n<br>\nYou think back to Sickofit's lynch. Fear and the desire for vengeance had guided your hands, but SensFan was right. What you did was still murder.<br>\n<br>\n\"Vigilante justice, I like that,\" says JupiterCrush. \"My fellow campers may be hesitant, but I'm not. Just this once, I will be a vigilante.\" Before anybody has time to react, JupiterCrush shoots SensFan. Unceremoniously, SensFan's body collapses to the ground.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SensFan</div> was killed Night Three.

Trackers are inherently mediocre roles, so a tracker and backup tracker isn't a huge deal (and town mislynching one of its PRs is something surprisingly common in mini normal games).  Doctor improves the tracker role, but doctor/tracker is a strong combo in a micro game, but much weaker in a mini game where PR shots missing entirely is mechanically likelier.  And the JOAT was merely ok; the JOAT rolecop shot hitting the roleblocker was a big boost for town, but that's swing rather than something fundamental (hitting either goon just says vanilla and there goes the utility of that shot).<br>\n<br>\nLooking just at town's power, the roles themselves aren't fantastic, but they ARE coordinated pretty effectively (barring the JOAT horribly misusing the vig shot), which is where the roleblocker comes in.  In mini normal games, roleblocker is considered the scum superpower; of all the normal roles that scum are currently allowed (i.e. not vanillaizer, vigilante, godfather, etc), roleblocker is the strongest by a substantial margin, as it can blast away at town power and shut it down pretty quickly.<br>\n<br>\nOTOH, scum roleblocker pretty much has to be protected from suspicion and the lynch; in just about any mini normal game where the roleblocker bows out early (the only exceptions are where town power is mainly passive like masons, BP, etc), scum are going to be in big trouble.<br>\n<br>\nI'll also quote one of my early posts from the review thread:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8668707#p8668707\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8668707#p8668707\" data-post-id=\"8668707\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 11</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27591\">mhsmith0</a> wrote:</cite>FWIW, 10v3 mini normal games with roleblockers have as a whole been pretty balanced, around 50% town win rate<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">1794 town win<br>\ndoc, gunslinger, cop<br>\nvs rb, encryptor, goon<br>\n<br>\n1772 town win<br>\ndoc, roleblocker, macho tracker<br>\nvs rb, goon, goon<br>\n<br>\n1719 scum win<br>\n1-shot BP, mason, mason, doc<br>\nvs rb, goon, goon (very different game here, town power was mainly passive)<br>\n<br>\n1715 town win<br>\ndoc, cop, role cop, jailkeeper<br>\nvs rb, godfather, goon<br>\n<br>\n1709 scum win<br>\n1-shot gunsmith, JOAT, role cop, doctor<br>\nvs rb, watcher, goon<br>\n<br>\n1666 scum win<br>\ntracker, 1-shot BP, cop, 1-shot vig neighbor, vanilla neighbor<br>\nvs rb, godfather, neighbor<br>\n<br>\n1662 town win<br>\ntracker, vig, doc<br>\nvs rb, goon, goon<br>\n<br>\n1653 scum win<br>\ndoc, cop, 1-shot vig<br>\nvs rb, goon, goon<br>\n<br>\n1596 scum win<br>\nmiller, doc, cop<br>\nvs rb, goon, goon<br>\n<br>\n1527 town win<br>\nbodyguard, cop, 2-shot vig<br>\nvs rb, goon, goon<br>\n<br>\n1514 town win<br>\neven night vig, cowardly gunsmith, cop, odd night vig<br>\nvs rb, godfather, goon</div></div></div><br>\netc<br>\n<br>\nIn general, against a roleblocker, town has had at least one really strong power role, or multiple passives (like 1719).
