Rules may be added, removed, or changed at my discretion.<br><br>2. If you do not post after 72 hours you will be prodded. You then have 48 hours to pick up the prod. If you do not pick it up after that time I will begin looking for a replacement. Weekends and holidays are counted as normal days.<br><br>3. a) The deadline for Day 1 will be 3 weeks, and all subsequent Days will have deadlines of 2 weeks. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If a Day ends early, the remaining amount of time (rounded to days, not hours) will be added to the deadline of the next Day, up to a maximum of 1 week extra.</span> I reserve the right to extend Day length, typically for the purpose of finding a desperately needed replacement.<br><br>b) Night rounds will last for 72 hours. During this time the thread will be locked, and all roles with night actions should send me a message telling me what they're going to do. Nights may be extended, just like Days.<br><br>4. Short version: Vote in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: example</span>. As long as a vote isn't ambiguous, I'll count it. If it is ambiguous it won't ever count, even if clarified. You'll have to redo the vote. Also, unvoting is not necessary.<br><br>Long version: Voting must be made in the format <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: example</span>. The colon is optional, as is the space between the colon and the player's name. Capital letters are also optional. Unvoting is not necessary but appreciated. Votes using abbreviations for player names, misspellings of player names, and even misspellings of abbreviations of player names will all be accepted as long as they meet the above conditions. Abbreviations of misspellings of player names will be treated as mere abbreviations. In the event that a vote is ambiguous however, it will not be counted, not even retroactively. You can vote to not lynch anyone, and the rules for that are the same as regular voting. Trick votes aren't allowed.<br><br>5. No invisible or small text (defined as \"text I have to copy and paste or quote to read\").<br><br>6. To lynch in the Day rounds you need a simple majority of votes, or 50% rounded down +1.<br><br>7. Discussing this game anywhere outside of the game thread itself is forbidden, unless you are specifically told otherwise in your role PM. Discussing other ongoing games in this thread is also forbidden.<br><br>8. If you die you get one contentless \"bah\" post. Note that if you reach the required majority needed for a lynch then you are immediately dead (i.e., claiming that your death scene hadn't yet been posted so you were allowed to keep posting content won't work). During Twilight (after lynch majority is reached/after deadline hits, before round ending scene) anyone who is alive may post content (but the lynchee doesn't count as alive).<br><br>9. Lynch majority will not be reduced at deadline. If a lynch majority is not reached at deadline, No Lynch will occur.<br><br>10. Don't quote PMs you get from me. Paraphrasing is your friend.<br><br>11. If you are going to be gone for 72 or more hours, say so in the thread, or PM me. This will put your inactivity clock on hold. Do not count on me checking the V/LA thread.<br><br>12. Don't intentionally lie about out of game circumstances to gain an advantage in the game.<br><br>13. Flavor is flavor, no story clues or anything.<br><br>14. My color for this game will be <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">blue</span></span>, so don't use it.<br><br>15. In the event that you are modkilled you will automatically lose, regardless of who wins.<br><br>16. Do not lie to me about things related to the game.<br><br>17. Vote counts will hopefully be done close to the top of each page. If a full page goes by without a vote count then one will be edited in at the top of it.<br><br>18. If I make a mistake, tell me.<br><br>19. If you have a question about the rules, just ask.<br><br>20. Be considerate towards your fellow player. Excessive personal attacks will result in a warning, then forced replacement or modkill.<br><br>Note: If you're being insulted, say so in thread or PM me. I'm not you, so I have no idea if you don't care or if you're upset or whatever. Therefore, I will tend not to intervene.<br><br>21. If you think something you're about to do might break the rules, assume it will and message me asking if it's okay to do.<br><br>22. And of course all basic game mechanics of a standard Mafia game apply, such as roles and alignment being revealed on death etc...<br><br>Vanilla Townie PM:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Vanilla Townie, and have nothing but your word and your vote.

For one, JMO initially voted without a reason. My vote very much so has a valid reason behind it. If Dire_Drenz is a townie, then he certainly isn't playing like one. I maybe a dunce, but at least I'm trying to hunt the scum. Dire_Drenz is doing nothing and is content in hopping on wagons, regardless of whether they are town or scum.

If he was scum and intentionally lurking, then it's his strategy and he probably won't replace out no matter how much we ask him to. If the lurking is not game-related, then sure, he can replace out.

Lately, it's more for his latest push on me. I think his assumption that me noticing you suspected him before I voted him means that I was making sure other people suspected him before I voted him is unreasonable, I find his initial refusal to answer my question to him (which he asked me originally) cagey, and the answering without answering bullshit in his most recent response similarly cagey.

He isn't saying anything specific, but instead just being sarcastic and coloring me to look bad.

Doctors are much more common. Therefore, seeing one claimed raises an eyebrow. It's sort of like a watcher role, you just see trackers more often.<br>-Secondly, because they're rare, it's a safer claim for scum to make. Since it's theoretically possible for there to be both a cop and bodyguard in the game, it wouldn't make sense for the more common role (doctor) to counter claim the bodyguard. It would just be bad play.<br>-Lastly, it's a very safe role to confirm. Unless town has a tracker or watcher, literally the ONLY way to confirm his role is to die.<br><br>All 3 of these things, combined with Bacde's scummy play is really giving me a lot of cause to doubt the claim. I always have a knee jerk reaction to unvote claimed power roles, but if we don't want to see Shamrock lynched today I would probably be willing to go ahead with the Bacde lynch."}

Look at how active he was in Dresden Mafia when he was essentially a glorified VT (but thought he was a doctor). Is there really any reason why he would lurk so hard as a PR in one game while playing a PR in another? No. Especially considering his end of the game comment in dresden (the <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> i got a VT bit) shows that it's a role he doesn't care much to play, so his lurking here probably means VT or scum.<br><br>so yes, fucking hammer him<br><br>@absta:<br>no"}

He's newish to the site, so I'm not sure that this is indicative of alignment. Worth bearing in mind.<br><br>Oh god, iamausername's vote was perfectly fine. Silly wagon if I ever saw one. It's really not a big deal. It was a bad joke. I make them all the time. I guess I won't last long here...<br><br>Post #20 - Highly suspect. McStab should explain his vote if it's serious. Also, he definitely shouldn't be both making a serious vote and encouraging people to continue pursuing JMO. He should be taking a position on where pressure should be going early.<br><br>Post #25 - This feels like scum getting pissed off that they're being wagoned for a bad reason. Odd reaction to pressure again. JMO definitely should be looked at.<br><br>Post #31 - Okay, now JMO IS a little OMGUS-y<br><br>Post #34 - Yeah, JMO is scum.<br><br>Post #39 - \"My second highest scum-read is iceninja, but I think iam is scummy for thinking that iceninja deserves votes because he's my highest scum-read.\" Disconnect here. Seems like Bacde is trying to turn everything that iam says into a scum-tell.<br><br>ICEninja's reaction was fine. It doesn't matter that McStab voted him. The fact remains that McStab gave a serious vote and refused to give the reason for it. That's scummy, or as ICEninja put it, \"not good.\"<br><br>Post #43 - JMO is SCUMMMMMMMMMMY<br><br>Post #45 - Mirhawk gains town-points for this new analysis.<br><br>Post #52 - And the scum gives himself away. JMO says the following:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1.I'm not sure what would have happened if I wasn't drunk. But I probably would have made sure I wasn't voting the guy that was already voting for me.<br><br>-snip-<br><br>3. I didn't lie about it. Being drunk doesn't make it look worse. Like I said, I voted randomly. If I hadn't been drunk I would have made sure that I wouldn't have voted disturbed one because he was already voting me and I know people regard that as a scum tell/newb move. Simple.</div></blockquote><br><br>If you're town, why would you care so much to carefully avoid giving off scum tells? Scum, in general, are far more aware of being sure not to give off scum-tells than town. I find this super-scummy.<br><br>Post #53 - Absta is super town.<br><br>Post #60 - Mirhawk is also town.<br><br>Post #61 - Odd post. A very vague defense of JMO. Somewhat suspicious of Bacde. Worth looking at later.<br><br>Post #65 - This is notably the first time JMO posted about something other than the votes on him, IIRC. That isn't something that town would do. Town would have started scumhunting before the third page if they were posting as frequently as JMO.<br><br>Post #68 - \"Good question.\" Combined with post #61, I have some strong suspicions about Bacde and JMO. Their interaction is odd. Call it a gut-read, but I think a Bacda-JMO scum team is very, very possible.<br><br>Post #72 - Disturbed = town. His reasoning regarding Ice = not correct.<br><br>Post #74 - Absta is town for sure. So painfully obv-town.<br><br>Post #78 - Why hasn't this guy (JMO) been lynched yet?<br><br>Post #81 - You're breaking my heart, disturbed. Don't switch off scum.<br><br>Post #84 - The first line of this post made me lol. Also, Mirhawk is my strongest town read by far.<br><br>Post #87 - Not liking ICE's reference of the post where he \"obviously\" forgot to change his vote. We don't know that. We don't know you accidently didn't change your vote. What we do know is that you didn't vote any of the wagons in the first post and then voted later with the claim that you \"forgot.\" In my experience, people don't forget things nearly as often as they claim to in Mafia, and I'm automatically skeptical of that claim. Much more so now that you're bringing it up as an obvious thing that town should take for granted.<br><br>Post #98 - Enter Shamrock. Okay, I cheated. I looked ahead and saw he flipped scum. So, here's the stage when he enters the game. Disturbed has made a good case against JMO. JMO reacted badly (and I mean, BADLY) to pressure from Disturbed and others. Bacde had odd interactions with JMO and has since attacked Disturbed. Shamrock, who we now know is scum, joins the game and hops onto Disturbed while defending ICE. Now, I'd like to assume that Shamrock, who is somewhat experienced, would not defend his partner directly in his first post. But might he defend his partner indirectly by defending ICE, who was being attacked by Disturbed, who was attacking JMO (if that made sense)? I think so. In other words, \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" If Disturbed is attacking JMO and ICE, Shamrock would totally be willing to defend ICE in order to discredit Disturbed (and maybe even secure a lynch). I think a scum-team of {Shamrock, JMO, Bacde} is very possible.<br><br>Post #103 - Hate this post.<br><br>Post #104 - Dislike this OMGUS even more. Post #103 didn't warrant a vote.<br><br>Post #105 - Username is town.<br><br>Post #106 - Woah, woah, woah. This raises giant red flags for me.<br><br>Post #113 - For the record, saying that you should vote someone for pressure greatly reduces the effects of pressure.<br><br>Post #114/Post #115 - The old 1-2 tag team by scum central. Gotta love how JMO chimes in parroting Bacde as soon as Bacde posts. JMO had posted in other places on-site between his last post and this post. There were plenty of things for him to post about in this game. He waited for his scum-partner's cue to post. This is not a coincidence. Look at the Bacde/JMO interactions in this game. They are joined at the hip.<br><br>Post #139 - Great catchup post. Nacho is likely town.<br><br>Post #157 - Ice sounds town to me. I know a lot of pressure has gone to him, but his posts have a lot of good scum-hunting in them.<br><br>Post #160 - Oh god, Bacde. Burn it. Burn it with fire.<br><br>Post #167 - See above.<br><br>Post #177 - HOW DID BACDE SURVIVE DAY ONE?!?!?!?<br><br>Post #178 - In the interest of being fair, I actually agree with this point. I too use rhetorical questions rather liberally.<br><br>Post #184 - This is the point in my re-read that I'm no longer going to comment on Bacde unless I notice something that everyone else seemed to miss. Otherwise, my analysis is going to be cluttered by me getting increasingly agitated that he's still alive. Needless to say, I think he's far and away the best lynch in Day 2.<br><br>Post #187 - Okay, I'm already ignoring what I said earlier, because this might actually be useful. Notice how Bacde votes Shamrock. Some may say he's unlikely to be scum because he drew attention to his partner. This is total hindsight. In reality, his vote didn't put any real pressure on Shamrock. With it did do was twofold. First, it served to allow Bacde to put his vote in a position that is totally non-controversial. I mean, no one would argue with him for wanting lurkers to speak up, especially in this game. This could lessen pressure on him or at least prevent an increase in pressure, and he was certainly under fire. Second, it served as a subtle indicator to Shamrock that he needed to get his ass in the game, which was definitely true at this point. No real pressure was put on Shamrock by this vote. This vote does not make Bacde look like town.<br><br>Post #188 - And by the way, this post proves my point. Ice suddenly becomes conflicted because he doesn't want to disprove of lurker hunting. This is literally Bacde's plan in action.<br><br>Post #191 - Sends up a red flag on Jabberwock. This is entirely a gut read.<br><br>Post #195 - I concur, and this is essentially where I got my gut read. The fact that he hit on two scum in his first post with no stated reasoning is just ... off.<br><br>Post #200 - Nevermind, Jabberwock is probably town. Gut-read overruled.<br><br>Post #203 - Why are you so stuck on McStab, Ice? It sounds so forced.<br><br>Post #207 - @Nacho, where did your read on Bacde go?<br><br>Post #215 - This is full of lulz and definitely makes Bacde the second scum.<br><br>Post #222 - There's a gay joke in here, somewhere. Feel free to pick it up, anyone.<br><br>For the record, Bodygaurd is a great fakeclaim for scum. Common enough to be a believable fake-claim, rare enough to have a much lower probability of a CC as compared to other popular power roles, and just weak enough to be able to explain away the fact that you aren't dead by Day 2 after claiming it.<br><br>Post #252 - This stands out as scummy. JMO contributed nothing this game day. Seriously. And he's still preoccupied with the reasons he was being voted. I get it, he's bitter. This is a classic case of \"caught for the wrong reasons.\"<br><br>Post #261 - This needs to be substantiated, Nacho.<br><br>Post #281 - I lol'd at the discussion of dominance.<br><br>Post #285 - JMO pulling out dat WIFOM.<br><br>Post #286 - Bacde is, again, joined at the hip with JMO. No. JMO's post was bad. It was all WIFOM. Why do you need to qualify it with \"Good post, but...\"? You're like best friends.<br><br>Post #301 - Melmond's post is null.<br><br>Post #312 - This looks like it comes from town (from username).<br><br>Post #324 - Ice's post made me lol. Also, town.<br><br>Post #325 - A proper defense against \"your analysis is crap\" is definitely not \"but I didn't provide any!\" Use this space to do something Cheery, and maybe you'll look more like town.<br><br>Post #336 - Not liking this post by Mirhawk. Sounds too annoyed. Could just be town emotion, or could be \"caught me for the wrong reason.\"<br><br>Post #344 - The first bit is Bacde essentially screaming \"Look! Someone's taking me seriously and thinks I'm town! I AM scumhunting! Give me all of them town-points!\" Also, this \"case\" made me want to throw my computer out of a window. If you are town (highly unlikely), then you're tunnelling on Nacho because you know that a switch at this point would give you away. If Nacho dies during the night, I strongly suspect Bacde because he's backed himself into a corner with his overly aggressive Nacho attack.<br><br>Post #352 - Woah. Where did the backtrack on your position on the Bodygaurd claim come from, Disturbed?<br><br>Post #353 - Cheery is making me paranoid. He's supporting the Shamrock wagon but refusing to hammer on it.

How does this point to him being town at all?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mirhawk wrote:</cite>He's claiming a role that has double the chance to die at night as any other player. Just being alive makes him suspicious.<br></div></blockquote><br>Not at all. The likelihood of scum shooting Bacde is just about zero. If he's scum, obviously. If he's town, then he's going to be an easy mislynch. So the only way he's going to die is if he correctly guesses who scum is going to shoot. I guessed Jabber was going to eat the bullet, apparently Bacde (if he was town) thought so also. Scum shot someone who wasn't the obvious protection. Duh?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mirhawk wrote:</cite>If a doctor ever claims or flips he'll be lynched.<br></div></blockquote><br>Maybe. Is it possible to have both a doctor and a bodyguard in the same game? I haven't seen it personally, but then I've hardly ever seen a bodyguard at all so I can't say for sure.<br><br>What is scum Bacde going to do? Claim VT and eat the lynch? No, the bodyguard claim is brilliant because it even has a chance to pull out a doctor counter claim if anyone is stupid enough to do that on day 1. Or claim cop, and have all the same problems you mentioned before. Seriously, if you take a step back and think about it, you're basically saying that it's a bad play for scum to claim a PR to try and survive.<br><br>ALSO: Since he claimed a weak PR, as opposed to say cop, it makes more sense for him to survive. If he claims cop and survives the night, then yes lynch his ass because scum leaving a cop alive is risky as hell."}

I had that Townread from your reaction to our entrance (it has similarities to what Konowa expected of the Vi/Tierce hydra in Dresdenafia--he had Reverse Mafia-Dresdenafia, you had Dresdenafia-Mini 1398 Without A Cool Name), and while I couldn't mention it in-game with a good, thorough explanation because Dresden was still ongoing, I shared it with Empire and pointed to the similarities in belligerent behavior in early game between the two games. Today that Townread is relevant for analysis of the Shamrock wagon, so it's coming out.<br><br>(Besides, you can't tell me you wouldn't like to pet this cuddly avatar. (\u00baw\u00ba))"}

Everything else he's posted was either discussing things that weren't particularly relevant to him and not relevant to finding scum, or basically saying that he has nothing to say.<br><br>Look at Cheery's day 2 posts in particular. He's made quite a few posts, typed quite a lot of words, and yet I literally can not find a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">single</span> piece of scum hunting whatsoever. There just isn't a shred of any actual ambition in finding scum. Even his day 1 vote was just parking it somewhere useless.<br><br>Also, again in his 315 he said this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Cheery wrote:</cite>I was just about to come and hammer him though <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br></div></blockquote><br>And it just feels really faked to me. It's the only emoticon I've seen him use all game, and reading the context of everything, it just doesn't make sense. ESPECIALLY considering how the rest of the post is his little \"case\" against absta, and he hardly mentions Shamrock from that point on. It reads very much as a fake reaction to me.<br><br>Bacde can die tomorrow, I really think Cheery is a good way to go today. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Cheery Dog</span>."}

Having a wagon on you does not prove that you're town. That's just flat-out false, and I don't like that you pushed that at all. It doesn't make sense. Second part, he basically admits that he has very little case on Nacho. Instead of re-evaluating his read on Nacho when he's unable to defend it, he just refuses to post his reasons or explain them and claims it's just a gut read (but still worthy of voting and getting a wagon going, as he called for earlier). He's not scum-hunting if he's unable to give any reasons for where his vote is.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4523129#p4523129\" class=\"postlink\">post 344</a>, Bacde wrote:</cite>Nacho, I like how you are finally addressing me as a threat to your scumship.

With it did do was twofold. First, it served to allow Bacde to put his vote in a position that is totally non-controversial.

This could lessen pressure on him or at least prevent an increase in pressure, and he was certainly under fire.

If he's town, then he's going to be an easy mislynch. So the only way he's going to die is if he correctly guesses who scum is going to shoot.

Duh?</div></blockquote><br><br>Well, scum may shoot town-Bacde early (probably Night 1, which notably didn't happen) in order to free themselves up to kill a claimed PR later in the game without having to go through Bacde first. As scum, I would have shot Bacde Night 1, even though he was the \"easy\" mislynch. The benefit of potentially killing a claimed PR later in the game that could have horrible effects on scum would outweigh the mislynch of Bacde.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4534851#p4534851\" class=\"postlink\">post 391</a>, Mirhawk wrote:</cite>ebwop<br>@Rob<br>I don't see it that way.

Just look at the other opinions of that post that come from people I think are town, Mirhawk for example. Not everyone is going to agree with that tell.

Scum wants to appear town-like; finding \"scum\" (which would actually mean creating opportunities for mislynches) is second to that.

Shamrock was a non-controversial position that no one can attack him for.

It also distances them for later in the game.<br><br>Having said that, we shouldn't be talking about Bacde this game day.

My introductory moderator notes from there are:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Moderator Notes:<br>Even though the Mafia have to choose who is making the kill, it does not actually matter.<br>Mafia are allowed to kill one of their own members if they so choose -- there may be some instances where killing the Vigilante Enabler themselves is a valid strategy.<br>Kills are indistinct from one another.<br><br>The purpose of this setup is to incorporate a vigilante into a setup without creating a setup where the Town can win even if they never lynch a single Mafia member. Although you could argue that in every setup with a Vigilante the Mafia can always just kill the Vigilante, that didn't seem good enough to me. Therefore, the Mafia have a slight boost in their power so that the odds of the Vigilante killing every single one of them (assuming perfect aim) is only 33% due to the chance of hitting the Vigilante Enabler.<br><br>It's my understanding that the Doctor only protecting against one kill is standard. On the other hand, it would be an extremely minor boost to town power if the Doctor could protect against all kills.<br><br>If this setup has a balance problem then I think it would be that it is biased towards the Mafia. Doctors are not especially powerful, and Vigilantes are swingy. I don't see an obvious solution, though. Reducing the Mafia size would be too much. Increasing the town size is not possible as it is already at 13 players. Adding another town PR would also probably be too much, when you take into account the presence of a Doctor. Anyway, this can be discussed with the reviewers.</div></blockquote><br><br><a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/An4TpupeErvPh\" class=\"postlink\">Mafia Quicktopic</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/3QxsrS8PHtKm4\" class=\"postlink\">Dead People Quicktopic</a> - not a whole lot in here</span></span>"}

It would have literally been a PERFECT town win if absta had only killed iamausername Night 1 instead of Disturbed_One.

He never picked up his prod, either. Game could have gone a lot differently if he had been replaced. He was scummy in his own right, however.<br><br>Bacde's claim was kind of ridiculous. If I hadn't included a Doctor though, it might have let him live to the Day before lylo, considering how ballsy it was. In hindsight, claiming VT and taking the lynch would have been best -- let Shamrock be replaced with someone who will steer the lynch elsewhere.<br><br>iamausername didn't play badly but he didn't play very townily either -- he did get vigged, after all. Winning was always going to be difficult for him after the Shamrock lynch.<br><br>ICEninja sent me this in his protection PM on night 2:<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Is it sad that town as lynched scum 2 days in a row, and it was still sub-optimal play of me? Haha!</div></blockquote>I wanted to reply, but I didn't want to interfere in any way with the game. So I just wrote down my response in Word, to be posted now:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't know what exactly was \"optimal\" play for you. Giving the town closure on Bacde isn't a bad thing, but it'll be difficult to see the effects of that, since it's all subjective and we have no alternative universe where you didn't claim to compare it to.</div></blockquote><br><br>Anyway, this was a pretty interesting game to mod. Setup didn't play too much of a role, but that's fine, that just means that the Day game prevailed.<br><br>Feel free to comment on my modding and the setup. This was the first setup I actually designed myself, so any advice would be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks for playing! My congratulations to the Town and my condolences to the Mafia."}

Care to explain that a bit more?</div></blockquote>Go through the Mafia Discussion forums. Read articles by established players. Town and scum have different goals, and therefore will have different motivations. Yes, scum want to look Town, but they also need to push mislynches through sooner or later, or they need to bus their buddies convincingly. Town will push mislynches accidentally, but scum (at least outside of multiball) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> when they are pushing a mislynch. You shouldn't go after someone because you think (or have proof) that their reads are wrong--but you should put yourself in their place and think if their reads make <span style=\"font-style: italic\">sense</span> from a Town perspective.<br><br>This is one of the reasons that meta is so useful. Not to go \"this player is playing differently from game A and he was Town there, therefore he must be scum here!\", but to get inside the player's head and learn how they think. To understand what kind of reads they usually have as Town and as scum, how they rationalize events, how they act. You need to learn their playstyle, and know what is alignment-null instead of alignment-relevant--it varies from person to person. Empire and I are both very grounded on logic and meta; if we are pushing cases on gut alone, something is off--you'd need to figure out <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what</span> and, most importantly, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> it is off. That <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> is the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">motivation</span> part.<br><br>Going through an ISO and dissecting it post by post to call out scummy <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">behavior</span> won't get you scum lynches, at least more often than random. Scum know how to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">behave</span> like Town--after all, they have more information than you do. (Yes, they might slip, but Town will also unknowingly 'scum-slip' because they usually have no idea what they are doing.) When you say \"I'm going to make a case on X\", you're already going in with a preconceived notion that X is scum without combing for motivation.<br><br>In short, when you are trying to read someone's alignment, one of the best ways of doing it (in my opinion, obviously) is to gather information about that person and then go through their posts (never forget to check their play in context; ISOs are not enough because they strip away everything else that is happening around a person and that they may be willfully ignoring). Do their reads make sense from an uninformed Town point of view? Does their reasoning match their mindset? Do their reads and votes flow naturally at each point in the game, or are there awkward jumps that don't seem to match their expressed train of thought? Do they look like they are behaving in an opportunistic way that does not match their playstyle elsewhere? Are they arguing to figure out alignments, or are they just making noise for the sake of it?<br><br>No method is flawless, and some people <span style=\"font-style: italic\">will</span> have scummy playstyles. For example: in my opinion, MagnaofIllusion and Thor665 are infamous for arguing pointlessly; a 'pointless argument' is defined here as 'an argument you don't drop even after you have reached a conclusion on that person's alignment'. This is why you should have a variety of questions you ask yourself when reading someone--those I listed on the previous paragraph should help you start; a little practice and knowledge of your fellow players goes a long way when learning to read alignments.<br><br>Read finished games without checking the alignments on the first post beforehand. Those are great for training. Yes, it's a lot of work, but no one said that being Town is a cakewalk. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}

The fact that you claimed bodyguard and NOT doctor prevented me from forcing the lynch down your throat day 1, as I had to really mull it over before coming to the conclusion that you couldn't possibly be a real bodyguard. The reasons I presented in my case against you were genuinely valid reasons why it was a perfectly fine claim for you to make in playing to your win condition. In your situation I would have personally claimed cop (and you would have gotten lucky, too, being that no cop would have CCed you, and you could have lived longer, especially since there scum didn't kill day 2 and the vig claim would have made it believable that scum attempted to kill you but didn't).<br>-Shamrock being scum was a little lucky for us, but the case on him was fairly solid. Had he been replaced out, this game would have certainly gone differently. Bacde would have still been on the chopping block, but a solid replacement would have done wonders for the scum team.<br>-I had no scum read on iam. Pity for you I was the doctor and absta was the vig, I would have absolutely killed Melmond. I still feel my case against Melmond was pretty good, actually, even after knowing I was wrong.<br>-The modding was great. I gave Alduskkel a golden star for how promptly he issued prods and replaced inactives. 10/10 would play in his game again.<br>-The setup seems slightly 90% balanced with a slight benefit to scum (though VERY slight), as they have the nice option to bus the shit out of their enabler and gain a shred of town cred (not much, but something) while disabling a town PR.<br>-The setup feels a little boring, though. Doctor is my least favorite roll ever (encourages lurking, which you will never ever see me do unless I'm genuinely too busy to be playing mafia), and 2 of the other non-basic roles had no active night action. Not that this is a terrible thing, but the game is for the most part heavy on the goons vs VTs and is largely won or lost by the day game with a little swing from the vig.<br>-I feel satisfied with my play. I got so many town reads so I started throwing out cases left and right and went guns blazing in hopes that I would get a few people calling me scum to survive the night."}
