{"number": 1, "id": "4494982", "user": "Alduskkel", "user_id": "10070", "content": "<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">The Rules</div><br>\n<br>\n1. Rules may be added, removed, or changed at my discretion.<br>\n<br>\n2. If you do not post after 72 hours you will be prodded. You then have 48 hours to pick up the prod. If you do not pick it up after that time I will begin looking for a replacement. Weekends and holidays are counted as normal days.<br>\n<br>\n3. a) The deadline for Day 1 will be 3 weeks, and all subsequent Days will have deadlines of 2 weeks. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If a Day ends early, the remaining amount of time (rounded to days, not hours) will be added to the deadline of the next Day, up to a maximum of 1 week extra.</div> I reserve the right to extend Day length, typically for the purpose of finding a desperately needed replacement.<br>\n<br>\nb) Night rounds will last for 72 hours. During this time the thread will be locked, and all roles with night actions should send me a message telling me what they're going to do. Nights may be extended, just like Days.<br>\n<br>\n4. Short version: Vote in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: example</div>. As long as a vote isn't ambiguous, I'll count it. If it is ambiguous it won't ever count, even if clarified. You'll have to redo the vote. Also, unvoting is not necessary.<br>\n<br>\nLong version: Voting must be made in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: example</div>. The colon is optional, as is the space between the colon and the player's name. Capital letters are also optional. Unvoting is not necessary but appreciated. Votes using abbreviations for player names, misspellings of player names, and even misspellings of abbreviations of player names will all be accepted as long as they meet the above conditions. Abbreviations of misspellings of player names will be treated as mere abbreviations. In the event that a vote is ambiguous however, it will not be counted, not even retroactively. You can vote to not lynch anyone, and the rules for that are the same as regular voting. Trick votes aren't allowed.<br>\n<br>\n5. No invisible or small text (defined as \"text I have to copy and paste or quote to read\").<br>\n<br>\n6. To lynch in the Day rounds you need a simple majority of votes, or 50% rounded down +1.<br>\n<br>\n7. Discussing this game anywhere outside of the game thread itself is forbidden, unless you are specifically told otherwise in your role PM. Discussing other ongoing games in this thread is also forbidden.<br>\n<br>\n8. If you die you get one contentless \"bah\" post. Note that if you reach the required majority needed for a lynch then you are immediately dead (i.e., claiming that your death scene hadn't yet been posted so you were allowed to keep posting content won't work). During Twilight (after lynch majority is reached/after deadline hits, before round ending scene) anyone who is alive may post content (but the lynchee doesn't count as alive).<br>\n<br>\n9. Lynch majority will not be reduced at deadline. If a lynch majority is not reached at deadline, No Lynch will occur.<br>\n<br>\n10. Don't quote PMs you get from me. Paraphrasing is your friend.<br>\n<br>\n11. If you are going to be gone for 72 or more hours, say so in the thread, or PM me. This will put your inactivity clock on hold. Do not count on me checking the V/LA thread.<br>\n<br>\n12. Don't intentionally lie about out of game circumstances to gain an advantage in the game.<br>\n<br>\n13. Flavor is flavor, no story clues or anything.<br>\n<br>\n14. My color for this game will be <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">blue</div>, so don't use it.<br>\n<br>\n15. In the event that you are modkilled you will automatically lose, regardless of who wins.<br>\n<br>\n16. Do not lie to me about things related to the game.<br>\n<br>\n17. Vote counts will hopefully be done close to the top of each page. If a full page goes by without a vote count then one will be edited in at the top of it.<br>\n<br>\n18. If I make a mistake, tell me.<br>\n<br>\n19. If you have a question about the rules, just ask.<br>\n<br>\n20. Be considerate towards your fellow player. Excessive personal attacks will result in a warning, then forced replacement or modkill.<br>\n<br>\nNote: If you're being insulted, say so in thread or PM me. I'm not you, so I have no idea if you don't care or if you're upset or whatever. Therefore, I will tend not to intervene.<br>\n<br>\n21. If you think something you're about to do might break the rules, assume it will and message me asking if it's okay to do.<br>\n<br>\n22. And of course all basic game mechanics of a standard Mafia game apply, such as roles and alignment being revealed on death etc...<br>\n<br>\nVanilla Townie PM:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Vanilla Townie, and have nothing but your word and your vote.

Dire_Drenz is posting, so he is at least trying to be active and thus has no excuse. <br>\n<br>\nRegardless, McStab in my mind made a very good IceNinja vote early on and actually got something started. People reacted to ICEninja's reaction to McStab's vote, for example. <br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, Dire_Drenz is merely hopping on wagons without really giving any reasoning for doing so. He's not allowing any form of information to be accrued by his posts. <br>\n<br>\n@ Dunhamganger:<br>\n<br>\nNot at all. Despite the debate over semantics between myself and JMO, my case was mostly built off of his reaction. It really came down to the fact that I didn't like his defense and I tried to call his bluff. The resulting discussion of semantics I think is a pretty good indicator that I was wrong. <br>\n<br>\nI feel my vote is very different from the one JMO cast on me. For one, JMO initially voted without a reason. My vote very much so has a valid reason behind it. If Dire_Drenz is a townie, then he certainly isn't playing like one. I maybe a dunce, but at least I'm trying to hunt the scum. Dire_Drenz is doing nothing and is content in hopping on wagons, regardless of whether they are town or scum.

And Bacde reacting as he did to someone who reads town to me just feels icky. If I have time and inclination, I'll do a little meta research to see if Bacde is a particularly good player. If he is, then scum Bacde would have been able to make great logical points like he has.

You are town because of the way Dire_Drenz replaced out and because of your posts like this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4509034#p4509034\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4509034#p4509034\" data-post-id=\"4509034\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 205</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20259\">Jabberwock</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://i.minus.com/iLzLBs1mKDDzJ.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Hi scum.</div></div></div></blockquote><br>\nWhich obviously took effort and is of a style I haven't seen coming from scum.<br>\n<br>\nabsta is town because he is logical, is not buddying with anyone, and I actually tend to agree with most of his reads, or at least his reasoning.<br>\n<br>\nDunhamganger to redrabbit I mostly placed in an arbitrary order, these are my null reads for the most part.

Mirhawk definitely changed opinions on me quickly just like Nacho did (seems like a defensive ploy for when I flip town), and Disturbed gained brownie points with me for not just automatically buying whatever Nacho says.<br>\n<br>\nShamrock just isn't playing in a townlike manner.  I voted him initially because he was a lurker and I was hoping to get pressure off of me so I wouldn't have to claim (although I did see your reasons for suspecting him before I voted), but since then he seems unusually aggressive for a person who isn't helping generate discussion.<br>\n<br>\nAnd of course there is Nachomamma8, this player who was willing to type long \"cases\" on other players at the beginning of the game, underhandedly cut off arguments that other players make, switch opinions on me last second, and then literally question others about how that seems scummy rather than addressing their points.  Note how now he is no longer attempting to build cases but instead types shorter posts as if to check in and say \"yup, I'm town guys\".<br>\n<br>\nSo there you go.  I hope you are happy.

We don't know you accidently didn't change your vote. What we do know is that you didn't vote any of the wagons in the first post and then voted later with the claim that you \"forgot.\" In my experience, people don't forget things nearly as often as they claim to in Mafia, and I'm automatically skeptical of that claim. Much more so now that you're bringing it up as an obvious thing that town should take for granted.<br>\n<br>\nPost #98 - Enter Shamrock. Okay, I cheated. I looked ahead and saw he flipped scum. So, here's the stage when he enters the game. Disturbed has made a good case against JMO. JMO reacted badly (and I mean, BADLY) to pressure from Disturbed and others. Bacde had odd interactions with JMO and has since attacked Disturbed. Shamrock, who we now know is scum, joins the game and hops onto Disturbed while defending ICE. Now, I'd like to assume that Shamrock, who is somewhat experienced, would not defend his partner directly in his first post. But might he defend his partner indirectly by defending ICE, who was being attacked by Disturbed, who was attacking JMO (if that made sense)? I think so. In other words, \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" If Disturbed is attacking JMO and ICE, Shamrock would totally be willing to defend ICE in order to discredit Disturbed (and maybe even secure a lynch). I think a scum-team of {Shamrock, JMO, Bacde} is very possible.<br>\n<br>\nPost #103 - Hate this post.<br>\n<br>\nPost #104 - Dislike this OMGUS even more.

This raises giant red flags for me.<br>\n<br>\nPost #113 - For the record, saying that you should vote someone for pressure greatly reduces the effects of pressure.<br>\n<br>\nPost #114/Post #115 - The old 1-2 tag team by scum central. Gotta love how JMO chimes in parroting Bacde as soon as Bacde posts. JMO had posted in other places on-site between his last post and this post. There were plenty of things for him to post about in this game. He waited for his scum-partner's cue to post. This is not a coincidence. Look at the Bacde/JMO interactions in this game. They are joined at the hip.<br>\n<br>\nPost #139 - Great catchup post. Nacho is likely town.<br>\n<br>\nPost #157 - Ice sounds town to me. I know a lot of pressure has gone to him, but his posts have a lot of good scum-hunting in them.<br>\n<br>\nPost #160 - Oh god, Bacde. Burn it. Burn it with fire.<br>\n<br>\nPost #167 - See above.<br>\n<br>\nPost #177 - HOW DID BACDE SURVIVE DAY ONE?!?!?!?<br>\n<br>\nPost #178 - In the interest of being fair, I actually agree with this point. I too use rhetorical questions rather liberally.<br>\n<br>\nPost #184 - This is the point in my re-read that I'm no longer going to comment on Bacde unless I notice something that everyone else seemed to miss. Otherwise, my analysis is going to be cluttered by me getting increasingly agitated that he's still alive. Needless to say, I think he's far and away the best lynch in Day 2.<br>\n<br>\nPost #187 - Okay, I'm already ignoring what I said earlier, because this might actually be useful. Notice how Bacde votes Shamrock. Some may say he's unlikely to be scum because he drew attention to his partner. This is total hindsight. In reality, his vote didn't put any real pressure on Shamrock. With it did do was twofold. First, it served to allow Bacde to put his vote in a position that is totally non-controversial. I mean, no one would argue with him for wanting lurkers to speak up, especially in this game. This could lessen pressure on him or at least prevent an increase in pressure, and he was certainly under fire. Second, it served as a subtle indicator to Shamrock that he needed to get his ass in the game, which was definitely true at this point. No real pressure was put on Shamrock by this vote. This vote does not make Bacde look like town.<br>\n<br>\nPost #188 - And by the way, this post proves my point. Ice suddenly becomes conflicted because he doesn't want to disprove of lurker hunting. This is literally Bacde's plan in action.<br>\n<br>\nPost #191 - Sends up a red flag on Jabberwock. This is entirely a gut read.<br>\n<br>\nPost #195 - I concur, and this is essentially where I got my gut read. The fact that he hit on two scum in his first post with no stated reasoning is just ... off.<br>\n<br>\nPost #200 - Nevermind, Jabberwock is probably town. Gut-read overruled.<br>\n<br>\nPost #203 - Why are you so stuck on McStab, Ice? It sounds so forced.<br>\n<br>\nPost #207 - @Nacho, where did your read on Bacde go?<br>\n<br>\nPost #215 - This is full of lulz and definitely makes Bacde the second scum.<br>\n<br>\nPost #222 - There's a gay joke in here, somewhere. Feel free to pick it up, anyone.<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, Bodygaurd is a great fakeclaim for scum. Common enough to be a believable fake-claim, rare enough to have a much lower probability of a CC as compared to other popular power roles, and just weak enough to be able to explain away the fact that you aren't dead by Day 2 after claiming it.<br>\n<br>\nPost #252 - This stands out as scummy. JMO contributed nothing this game day. Seriously. And he's still preoccupied with the reasons he was being voted. I get it, he's bitter. This is a classic case of \"caught for the wrong reasons.\"<br>\n<br>\nPost #261 - This needs to be substantiated, Nacho.<br>\n<br>\nPost #281 - I lol'd at the discussion of dominance.<br>\n<br>\nPost #285 - JMO pulling out dat WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\nPost #286 - Bacde is, again, joined at the hip with JMO. No. JMO's post was bad. It was all WIFOM. Why do you need to qualify it with \"Good post, but...\"? You're like best friends.<br>\n<br>\nPost #301 - Melmond's post is null.<br>\n<br>\nPost #312 - This looks like it comes from town (from username).<br>\n<br>\nPost #324 - Ice's post made me lol. Also, town.<br>\n<br>\nPost #325 - A proper defense against \"your analysis is crap\" is definitely not \"but I didn't provide any!\" Use this space to do something Cheery, and maybe you'll look more like town.<br>\n<br>\nPost #336 - Not liking this post by Mirhawk. Sounds too annoyed. Could just be town emotion, or could be \"caught me for the wrong reason.\"<br>\n<br>\nPost #344 - The first bit is Bacde essentially screaming \"Look! Someone's taking me seriously and thinks I'm town! I AM scumhunting! Give me all of them town-points!\" Also, this \"case\" made me want to throw my computer out of a window. If you are town (highly unlikely), then you're tunnelling on Nacho because you know that a switch at this point would give you away. If Nacho dies during the night, I strongly suspect Bacde because he's backed himself into a corner with his overly aggressive Nacho attack.<br>\n<br>\nPost #352 - Woah. Where did the backtrack on your position on the Bodygaurd claim come from, Disturbed?<br>\n<br>\nPost #353 - Cheery is making me paranoid. He's supporting the Shamrock wagon but refusing to hammer on it.

If he's town, then he's going to be an easy mislynch. So the only way he's going to die is if he correctly guesses who scum is going to shoot.

It's going to be a little difficult to explain in detail why I feel this way, but looking over his posts in ISO really showed me reaction based play.

Having a wagon on you does not prove that you're town. That's just flat-out false, and I don't like that you pushed that at all. It doesn't make sense. Second part, he basically admits that he has very little case on Nacho. Instead of re-evaluating his read on Nacho when he's unable to defend it, he just refuses to post his reasons or explain them and claims it's just a gut read (but still worthy of voting and getting a wagon going, as he called for earlier).

Doctors, bodygaurds, roleblockers, bulletproof, etc.</div><br>\n<br>\n3) Why are you focusing on your belief that I am town, rather than my argument that you are scum?  You see, I'm not worried about looking like I'm town.  And I really don't give a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[removed]</div> if you read me as town, because you are scum.

This post reeks of \"I'm caught but disagree with your reasoning\" mentality.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">He's arguing that your premises of your post on him don't even make sense because the outside knowledge you claim he must have had in order to make those assumptions wouldn't even help him make those assumptions.

With it did do was twofold. First, it served to allow Bacde to put his vote in a position that is totally non-controversial. I mean, no one would argue with him for wanting lurkers to speak up, especially in this game. This could lessen pressure on him or at least prevent an increase in pressure, and he was certainly under fire. <br>\n<br>\nSecond, it served as a subtle indicator to Shamrock that he needed to get his ass in the game, which was definitely true at this point. No real pressure was put on Shamrock by this vote because Bacde didn't provide any case against Shamrock - he identified him as a lurker, which was going to happen anyway.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Bacde was trying to put pressure onto Nacho for much of the end of that day. He also didn't keep his vote or pressure on Shamrock. I don't think he intended to put real pressure on Shamrock, and the pressure certainly didn't come from him. The real case on Shamrock came from others.</div></blockquote> Though why would be have chosen his scumbuddy out of the other lurkers at that stage, such as RedRabbit (now me) or dumhamanger (now you)? <br>\nIf either of those happened (looking from what you call your perspective as town - though I currently don't believe you are), wouldn't he have got a mislynch if town went for a lynch all lurkers policy?<br>\nHis vote stayed on Shamrock for the rest of the day after he placed it (at least according to the votecounts, and since it was at the front of the wagon the whole time, I'm fairly sure it didn't move) Shamrock was also still lurking and not interacting with anybody, so what actually is the problem and/or scum motivation from hunting someone else while the person you're voting isn't actually active enough to even be pressured?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirst, I confused his vote on you in his ISO with moving his vote. My mistake.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, I think that he voted Shamrock in part to try to signal to him to get his ass in thread if he was reading but not posting. If Shamrock had gotten in thread early when it was only Bacde's vote and started contributing, I don't think he would have been lynched.<br>\n<br>\nThird, the pressure he put on Nacho was bad, in my opinion. His case was unconvincing and I do not think it came from town. It was a lot of rhetoric and very little substance, as I said earlier. If he had been actually scum-hunting, it wouldn't look bad at all. He wasn't though. He was attacking Nacho for nonexistent reasons, as he had been for a lot of the day. And there's certainly scum motivation in trying to set yourself up to push a mislynch in Day 2.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4540752#p4540752\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4540752#p4540752\" data-post-id=\"4540752\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 453</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19287\">Cheery Dog</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4540490#p4540490\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4540490#p4540490\" data-post-id=\"4540490\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 448</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19999\">Rob14</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4534119#p4534119\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4534119#p4534119\" data-post-id=\"4534119\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 373</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19287\">Cheery Dog</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4533982#p4533982\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4533982#p4533982\" data-post-id=\"4533982\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 369</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19999\">Rob14</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nPost #53 - Absta is super town.</div></blockquote><br>\nI'm not seeing this from that post, it still is just a weird post to me (and in my reasoning for voting absta yesterday), what makes absta super town?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4498095#p4498095\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4498095#p4498095\" data-post-id=\"4498095\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 53</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18562\">absta101</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Disturbed</span><br>\n<br>\nHit a wall with jmo, i'd be okay with a lynch of him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis post struck me as an attempt to see how Disturbed reacted to pressure because he hadn't been under pressure from anyone but iam yet.

At the time Disturbed made that post, I didn't know it would become controversial later. I didn't bother writing about it because I thought it was fairly obvious. Evidently, it wasn't.<br>\n2. \"Outed himself as scum\" is an overstatement - something which there are a lot of in my first post. On page 2-3, he had done the scummiest thing in the game yet. Did it make him definite scum? No. He was the best target at the time. But people miss things all the time or don't agree. Just look at the other opinions of that post that come from people I think are town, Mirhawk for example. Not everyone is going to agree with that tell. Even if JMO is the scummiest person in the game at the time, it's not bad to pressure Disturbed to get as many reactions as possible in the early game.

Although you could argue that in every setup with a Vigilante the Mafia can always just kill the Vigilante, that didn't seem good enough to me. Therefore, the Mafia have a slight boost in their power so that the odds of the Vigilante killing every single one of them (assuming perfect aim) is only 33% due to the chance of hitting the Vigilante Enabler.<br>\n<br>\nIt's my understanding that the Doctor only protecting against one kill is standard. On the other hand, it would be an extremely minor boost to town power if the Doctor could protect against all kills.<br>\n<br>\nIf this setup has a balance problem then I think it would be that it is biased towards the Mafia. Doctors are not especially powerful, and Vigilantes are swingy. I don't see an obvious solution, though. Reducing the Mafia size would be too much. Increasing the town size is not possible as it is already at 13 players. Adding another town PR would also probably be too much, when you take into account the presence of a Doctor. Anyway, this can be discussed with the reviewers.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/An4TpupeErvPh\" class=\"postlink\">Mafia Quicktopic</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/3QxsrS8PHtKm4\" class=\"postlink\">Dead People Quicktopic</a> - not a whole lot in here</div>", "time": "Thu Dec 20, 2012 1:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24075&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "24075"}

It would have literally been a PERFECT town win if absta had only killed iamausername Night 1 instead of Disturbed_One. Speaking of which, here are the Night Actions:<br>\n<br>\nNight 1<br>\nabsta101 kills Disturbed_One (successful)<br>\nBacde kills Jabberwock (unsuccessful)<br>\nICEninja protects Jabberwock (successful)<br>\n<br>\nNight 2<br>\nabsta101 kills iamausername (successful)<br>\niamausername kills ICEninja (successful)<br>\nICEninja protects Nachomamma8 (no effect)<br>\n<br>\nShamrock would have been up for replacement less than 6 hours after he was lynched. He never picked up his prod, either. Game could have gone a lot differently if he had been replaced. He was scummy in his own right, however.<br>\n<br>\nBacde's claim was kind of ridiculous. If I hadn't included a Doctor though, it might have let him live to the Day before lylo, considering how ballsy it was. In hindsight, claiming VT and taking the lynch would have been best -- let Shamrock be replaced with someone who will steer the lynch elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\niamausername didn't play badly but he didn't play very townily either -- he did get vigged, after all. Winning was always going to be difficult for him after the Shamrock lynch.<br>\n<br>\nICEninja sent me this in his protection PM on night 2:<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Is it sad that town as lynched scum 2 days in a row, and it was still sub-optimal play of me? Haha!</div></blockquote>I wanted to reply, but I didn't want to interfere in any way with the game.

Care to explain that a bit more?</div></blockquote>Go through the Mafia Discussion forums. Read articles by established players. Town and scum have different goals, and therefore will have different motivations. Yes, scum want to look Town, but they also need to push mislynches through sooner or later, or they need to bus their buddies convincingly. Town will push mislynches accidentally, but scum (at least outside of multiball) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">know</div> when they are pushing a mislynch. You shouldn't go after someone because you think (or have proof) that their reads are wrong--but you should put yourself in their place and think if their reads make <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">sense</div> from a Town perspective.<br>\n<br>\nThis is one of the reasons that meta is so useful. Not to go \"this player is playing differently from game A and he was Town there, therefore he must be scum here!\", but to get inside the player's head and learn how they think. To understand what kind of reads they usually have as Town and as scum, how they rationalize events, how they act. You need to learn their playstyle, and know what is alignment-null instead of alignment-relevant--it varies from person to person. Empire and I are both very grounded on logic and meta; if we are pushing cases on gut alone, something is off--you'd need to figure out <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">what</div> and, most importantly, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> it is off. That <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> is the <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">motivation</div> part.<br>\n<br>\nGoing through an ISO and dissecting it post by post to call out scummy <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">behavior</div> won't get you scum lynches, at least more often than random. Scum know how to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">behave</div> like Town--after all, they have more information than you do. (Yes, they might slip, but Town will also unknowingly 'scum-slip' because they usually have no idea what they are doing.) When you say \"I'm going to make a case on X\", you're already going in with a preconceived notion that X is scum without combing for motivation.<br>\n<br>\nIn short, when you are trying to read someone's alignment, one of the best ways of doing it (in my opinion, obviously) is to gather information about that person and then go through their posts (never forget to check their play in context; ISOs are not enough because they strip away everything else that is happening around a person and that they may be willfully ignoring). Do their reads make sense from an uninformed Town point of view? Does their reasoning match their mindset? Do their reads and votes flow naturally at each point in the game, or are there awkward jumps that don't seem to match their expressed train of thought? Do they look like they are behaving in an opportunistic way that does not match their playstyle elsewhere? Are they arguing to figure out alignments, or are they just making noise for the sake of it?<br>\n<br>\nNo method is flawless, and some people <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">will</div> have scummy playstyles. For example: in my opinion, MagnaofIllusion and Thor665 are infamous for arguing pointlessly; a 'pointless argument' is defined here as 'an argument you don't drop even after you have reached a conclusion on that person's alignment'. This is why you should have a variety of questions you ask yourself when reading someone--those I listed on the previous paragraph should help you start; a little practice and knowledge of your fellow players goes a long way when learning to read alignments.<br>\n<br>\nRead finished games without checking the alignments on the first post beforehand. Those are great for training. Yes, it's a lot of work, but no one said that being Town is a cakewalk. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">", "time": "Thu Dec 20, 2012 3:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24075&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "24075"}

The fact that you claimed bodyguard and NOT doctor prevented me from forcing the lynch down your throat day 1, as I had to really mull it over before coming to the conclusion that you couldn't possibly be a real bodyguard. The reasons I presented in my case against you were genuinely valid reasons why it was a perfectly fine claim for you to make in playing to your win condition. In your situation I would have personally claimed cop (and you would have gotten lucky, too, being that no cop would have CCed you, and you could have lived longer, especially since there scum didn't kill day 2 and the vig claim would have made it believable that scum attempted to kill you but didn't).<br>\n-Shamrock being scum was a little lucky for us, but the case on him was fairly solid. Had he been replaced out, this game would have certainly gone differently. Bacde would have still been on the chopping block, but a solid replacement would have done wonders for the scum team.<br>\n-I had no scum read on iam. Pity for you I was the doctor and absta was the vig, I would have absolutely killed Melmond. I still feel my case against Melmond was pretty good, actually, even after knowing I was wrong.<br>\n-The modding was great. I gave Alduskkel a golden star for how promptly he issued prods and replaced inactives. 10/10 would play in his game again.<br>\n-The setup seems slightly 90% balanced with a slight benefit to scum (though VERY slight), as they have the nice option to bus the shit out of their enabler and gain a shred of town cred (not much, but something) while disabling a town PR.<br>\n-The setup feels a little boring, though. Doctor is my least favorite roll ever (encourages lurking, which you will never ever see me do unless I'm genuinely too busy to be playing mafia), and 2 of the other non-basic roles had no active night action. Not that this is a terrible thing, but the game is for the most part heavy on the goons vs VTs and is largely won or lost by the day game with a little swing from the vig.<br>\n-I feel satisfied with my play. I got so many town reads so I started throwing out cases left and right and went guns blazing in hopes that I would get a few people calling me scum to survive the night.", "time": "Thu Dec 20, 2012 3:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24075&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "24075"}
