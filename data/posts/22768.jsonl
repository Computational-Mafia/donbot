You return from your nite school.<br>\nYou walk through the nite since you are alone, and don&#8217;t have a license. You BAMF.<br>\nYou pass by a homeless person taking a pee. You wish you didn&#8217;t see that. Carrying on&#8230;<br>\nYou hear a person calling &#8220;Help!!!!&#8221; and you look around, and see no one going to their aid. You feel a bit lazy, but you go anyways. YOU JUST DON&#8217;T GIVE A FUCK.<br>\n<br>\nYou run in, ready to fuck somebody up. (Into an alley)<br>\n<br>\nAs you get to the damsel in distress, you realize that the perpetrator pops her in the back and steals her purse. She falls to the ground, as if her spirit was pulled by the wind. The man in question flees.<br>\n<br>\nThe hero is too late. He tries to help her up, and tries to keep her alive in her last moments. The others hearing the shot, wake up and start coming out. They watch the hero by that lifeless gal&#8217;s side, wondering what he may have done to her. Others start getting these &#8216;looks&#8217;&#8230; And the hero realizes. He cannot do a thing to help at this point in time. He bounces. <br>\n<br>\nHe walks on, jittered up, seeing someone die before him. He thinks to himself &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault, I tried to help&#8221; to make himself feel better. He must know that the others will want someone to blame, and he might be the source of the blame. He gets home. He slips off his sneakers, takes off his coat, and his pants and shirt. He gets into bed, and sleeps it off.<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\nThis man, is YOU. Yes, YOU. You know you are innocent, but the neighbors don&#8217;t think so. They will point fingers&#8230; They will throw rocks at your window&#8230; They will jump you&#8230; Many nasty things. You come out to try and prove yourself innocent, as no guilty person would do such a thing. The neighbors confused, they speak out in anger towards you.<br>\n<br>\nThey start to form plans of action, and it is up to you what they decide to do. Let you go in innocence, or lynch you in their backyard. (Is this illegal? Who knows)<br>\n<br>\nYou decide, hero. Or whatever you are.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Still standing:</div><br>\n<br>\n4. Konowa    <br>\n6. Robbnva<br>\n7.

{"number": 1, "id": "4190854", "user": "Ranmaru", "user_id": "15446", "content": "Borrowing Kat's rules here:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I. Rule set: Fundamentals</div>:<br>\n1. I am the mod of this game.  Any questions, concerns, and actions for the game are to be directed to Me.  <br>\n2. Please enjoy this game, and do not personally attack other players in a manner that is offensive.<br>\n3. Inactivity in this game is not excusable by activity in other games. <br>\n4. If you believe a simple mod mistake has occurred, please address this in-thread and in bold. If you believe a large moderation mistake has occurred, or you have a dispute, please contact me via PM or IM.<br>\n5. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me -- otherwise your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count.<br>\n6. You may make ONE BAW post after you have died. This may not contain game relevant information, and if it does, I will edit it out.<br>\n7. No communication about this game is allowed with non-players or players who are dead, even if you yourself are dead. (And if you are dead, you may not discuss the game with anyone who is currently playing, even if you could while you were alive, unless your role specifically states otherwise).<br>\n8. Unless your role PM specifically allows you the power, you are not to communicate with anyone about this game outside of this game thread. If your role PM does allow you this power, you are to PM all conversations to the mod.<br>\n9. Editing your posts is not allowed (if you have the power to). <br>\n10. You are not allowed to quote your role PM or quote a fake role PM. You must paraphrase all information you wish to claim. You are not allowed to post or refer to any images in your role PM, nor may you post metadata about mod PMs in an attempt to break the game (e.g., message ID in the URL, time of day the message was sent, etc.). If you are unsure if your paraphrase crosses the line, ask me via pm.<br>\n11. You must confirm via PM. When confirming via pm to me, read your role pm and summarize it back to me.<br>\n12. Do not post hidden text. (Spoiler tags are allowed because they are easily noticeable. Posting text with the intent to hide it from other players, e.g. by changing the text colour to resemble the page background, is not permitted.)<br>\n13. Do not post in code.<br>\n14. You must post in English.<br>\n15. Hydras are not allowed. Nor are they as replacements.<br>\n16. Failure to send in your night action(s) will result in no action(s) being taken unless the action is compulsive; then it will be randomized.<br>\n17.  Any action which would be illegal to actually do is also illegal to fake (for example, posting a made-up PM that shows a Cop result of guilty/innocent).<br>\n18. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Do not use this (blue) color as it is the mod's color</div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">II. Voting and Lynching</div>:<br>\n1. Each Day you may vote for a player to be lynched using a bold vote command, e.g. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Crazy</div><br>\n2. You can unvote, e.g. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Crazy</div>, which removes your vote from the player you were voting. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes, but are appreciated.<br>\n3. No lynch is a viable lynch choice, e.g. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div>. A majority voting for this choice will end the Day with no player being lynched.<br>\n4. The Day will end when a majority lynch is decided or a deadline is reached. If a deadline is reached without a majority lynch decided, there will be a no lynch.<br>\n5. No posting at night time, this is not allowed.<br>\n6.  Votes/Unvotes that reasonably follow the guidelines specified above, and are unambiguous with respect to player nicknames/abbreviations, will count.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">III. Activity and Deadline</div>:<br>\n1. You are required to post at least once every 72 hours. You will be prodded otherwise. When prodded, you have 24 hours to post in thread, or be replaced. You will also be replaced if I have to prod you too many times and often. I will tell you if I'm considering replacing . If you have a pre-planned absence, please notify me ahead of time and you will not be prodded. If your absence is for an unreasonable amount of time, you will be forcibly replaced regardless of advance notification.<br>\n2. A single deadline extension will be granted if a majority of players request this, e.g. Request Deadline Extension. This extension will last only 24 hours. This applies to one game day. I will only grant this once.<br>\n3. Each day will last a period of 2 weeks.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IV. Game Specific</div>:<br>\n1. All roles are assigned entirely at random.<br>\n2. Jesters, Survivors, Governors, and Politicians are non-existent in this game.<br>\n3. Modkills only end the Day if the player being killed is town-aligned. All other modkills will continue the game. In the event that a player is modkilled during twilight, the modkill will affect the next day phase (meaning that day would automatically end if the player is town and that day would continue as normal if otherwise).<br>\n4. Town win condition: You win when there are no threats to the town remaining and there is at least one town&#8211;aligned player remaining.<br>\n5. I reserve the right to change it at will, and even in extreme circumstances enforce it retroactively. If a strategy feels shady to you, you might want to take it up with me first.<br>\n6. The setup is closed.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample PM</div><br>\nHello, [Insert Player Name here]! You are a vanilla townie. You have no abilities, poor you. You only have your voice and your vote.

But saying it outright from the beginning of the game (if your actual plan is to not be on wagons) is suicide.<br>\n<br>\nThe \"ABR is PR or scum\" is just as ridiculous considering he said nothing but \"Yo!\".

If he's scum, I know I'm not his buddy so the only motive would be to get townpoints when I flip town and then he can look serious as he goes after xvart.

Saying someone is either scum or a PR is significantly more likely to come from scum; and the fact that it was such a throw away comment defining someone's alignment to the extremes: either scum or a power role without any elaboration or justification makes it one of those back pocket comments to fall back on later if Albert starts getting some negative attention.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4195388#p4195388\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4195388#p4195388\" data-post-id=\"4195388\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 23</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9329\">rblinker123</a> wrote:</cite>Also you changed your vote to Kagelord as you thought he is most likely scum out of the pair, care to explain why?

I didn't realize Albert had another vote; but that isn't really important because the comment about KageLord having a vote already was more a bonus; not the basis of my vote.<br>\n<br>\nThe main part is that I acknowledge the link between KageLord and Albert is fairly tenuous but based on my past relationship with Albert I played it up a little to see his reaction.

I think once KageLord flips scum we can debate whether or not Albert or rblinker are his partner.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that Albert came in and said nothing of my assessment of him and KageLord makes my suspicion of him stronger as the only reason I could see him not engaging in a debate with me about his alignment is the fact that he doesn't want to draw more attention to him being scum.

This is all speculation based on the first two pages so you getting your panties up in a bunch about my name-dropping you is good incentive to keep an eye on your posts. 16 was overly apologetic. That's it. Keep in mind that this game is 9 players, and KL, Robbnva, and myself are already pretty obvious town so that leaves 6/9 to be scum. Konowa is the highest scum read so I keep an eye on him and although I look very hard for people to be individually scummy, if they're scummy in and of themselves and they fit in a hypothetical team with people I have stronger reads on, they earn priority. That's how I play the game. You're getting worked up about a speculation based on practically nothing, which implies that it probably IS something. So. I'm gonna get to page 3 now.

More on drchrist, 64 is more apologizing (for comparison notice the difference between 64 and 71 by umoms, whose slot I have. 64 is exaggerated and has a weird tone, where 71 is just straightforward. \"I'm here so I don't get replaced but I'm not gonna post.\" 74 has a similar feel as 71.) and 67 is pretty half-assed.<br>\nABR's posting style leaves something to be desired but I feel like his comments are intuitive, they look like he's looking through a town spectrum, etc. Our reads match a lot and so I'm inclined to read him as town.<br>\nThis game feels too easy.<br>\ndrchrist gets town points for not only following up on his questions but following up on other peoples' questions too.<br>\n95 makes it seem to me though that it's some sort of general gameplay consistency in his meta that makes him so persistent. So still scum.<br>\nI don't like the attacks on ABR.<br>\nKonowa's dismissal in 119 is really weak and kinda seals the deal for me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod: How was the Smash Bros. tournament?</div><br>\n<br>\nBack to town points for drchrist for initiating deadline extension.

He's still playing town but his reads are so off it seems like intentional misleading to me. Still town but not obv. Pretty sure this game can be won with the deaths of the three I've been talking about this whole post. Still waiting for VE but something, I forgot what, made me lean town on him.

Meaning blinker was obvbuddying me (which would be really stupid if we were both scum) and I didn't bus the hell out of him (which I <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=22267\" class=\"postlink\">would do if I were scum</a>). Also Natalie puts ABR (conf town), me, and VE as her quick scumreads and I don't think she's the quickbussing type.<br>\n<br>\nHonestly, looking at Natalie's play, I would guess Konowa-scum and VE as just lurker-town. The thing that makes me hesitant on Konowa is the quick switch to blinker after it looked like my lynch might not happen. Since it is a probable 2 scum setup, idk if Konowa-scum would be so quick on the bus either.<br>\n<br>\nPacman's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4225962#p4225962\" class=\"postlink\">181</a> gives me a good town feeling. Only thing I don't like about him so far is the hammer before claim.<br>\n<br>\nSo looking back at the remaining players, all of us were either on Natalie's lynch or were her scumreads. The question then is whether it is more likely she wanted to bus someone or someone bussed her. If she was gonna bus, it's VE (last on her scumreads list and the reason was just lurking, plus I obv know I'm town and ABR was town). If someone bussed her (which I think more likely), my suspects in order would be: xvart, Pacman, Drchrist. I was going to put Konowa at the head of this list because his initial vote on blinker made it look like he wanted an out from the wagon, but reading over the followup on blinker (and knowing blinker is scum) makes Konowa just look soooooo town. Drchrist has just picked up a lot of towncred for me over the course of the game (but one of his towncred actions, the deadline extension, can be scum-motivated now that we know Natalie was scum). And no, I'm not going back on the above about Pacman, it's just PoE with a lot of town-looking people.<br>\n<br>\nIf VE doesn't do anything today and is not replaced, I'm down with a lurker lynch.", "time": "Sat Aug 04, 2012 6:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22768&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "22768"}

Skim D1 and early D2. I was scum in that game and Pine was town. He defended the hell out of me. Only problem was that when I flipped scum, this made him probably one of the easiest mislynches in mafia. Now, I could see scum using that idea to defend town which would accomplish one of two things: either the scum gets towncred after the mislynch or the townie gets scumcred after the correct lynch.

{"number": 244, "id": "4238458", "user": "Hoopla", "user_id": "10193", "content": "The ABR kill was unusual given his stoic opposition of the rblinker wagon, at least initially, which leads me to believe that he could easily have remained a suspect, if not today, but deeper in the game when wifom starts to envelope his presence. I think it's unlikely a player like xvart would kill ABR in this situation - he had a placeholder of suspicion for ABR, after several D1 altercations, which could easily be referenced back to in the event of needing to find reason to justify a vote on ABR. In games when a solitary scumbag needs to survive several days, it's usually a very poor play to eliminate a possible lynch option, and I think xvart is acquainted with game theory enough to understand the position he is in. The only motivation he would have to go for an ABR kill is if he believed he could get town credit out of it somehow, and I don't think he'd think this collection of players would ascribe a weird kill to being something he couldn't do (if even discussed at all). I think he's calculating enough to know it's a suboptimal play overall.<br>\n<br>\nSo who can we assign scum motivation to? To be fair, I think we're in \"unusual\" territory when assigning motivation to all players, because you can reasonably construe that the kill was suboptimal for every player if ABR was lynchable. We're not looking for whether the play would be suboptimal for a player though - we're looking for whether a player would either not realise it was suboptimal OR realise it was suboptimal, but think he'd get town credit for making a suboptimal play.<br>\n<br>\nA seductive option is evilpacman being the partner, with a creative NK gambit after realising his hammer was poor overnight. I'm only considering this option due to his opening post of Day 2 in which he declares what a stupid kill it was. I suspect this possibility is bordering on tinfoil though, as pacman expressed a town read on ABR late D1, so he presumably shouldn't have been able to get credit for killing off a mislynch target if he hadn't considered him scum before. Incorporating other aspects of the game, for evilpacman to be scum, it would mean a supreme double-bus would have had to have taken place early in D1 with blinker voting umoms right when his own wagon was in the balance. Given there were other viable options, it's likely he'd want to avoid the possibility of setting up a two-horse race between himself and his buddy. I think all things considered, it's correct to rule out pacman even though his hammer and D2 post initially stand out.<br>\n<br>\nAs a vocal proponent of evilpacman's lynch today, Robbnva is a player I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> see the kill coming from. As I said before, it's a pretty unusual situation when applied to each player in this game, but if I cannot find reason to rule someone out, it validates the process of ruling people out others. The main reason stems from his view about pacman bussing - this is probably a true opinion regardless of alignment. I think if he's scum, he is representing the idea strongly enough to the point, where he thinks this is how he'd view it as town, and that other players will find it scummy. If this is what he believes is convincing, then it stands to reason that the opposite might look town to him - in this instance, the opposite is ABR who was overtly protective of blinker. Regardless of the correctness of either view, if this is how he thinks, then an ABR kill is viable. <br>\n<br>\nAs a side-point, I suspect Robbnva might be a deceptive player or one attracted to making unusual plays. I get this feeling when I read a post like this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4216649#p4216649\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4216649#p4216649\" data-post-id=\"4216649\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 111</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite>actually there is a huge difference, usually scum want to blend in and if they are voting someone they know is town, they want to be in a less obvious spot. in a game where it takes 5 to lynch putting someone at L-2 is far less threatening than putting someone at L-1.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis looks like a pretty sincere representation of his opinions about being scum (regardless of his alignment - I think he's being truthful either way), and it shows he is conscious of constructing unusual/less obvious positions as scum. Off the top of my head, I remember Konowa as once being a heavy busser (I'll need to recheck this), and as such may be willing to make the ABR kill too.<br>\n<br>\nAs a general rule, I think the more deceptive you are as a player, the more likely you are to be creative/willing to gambit - deception/creativity strongly correlate when scum. I only know this, because this is how I used to play as scum ( <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> ), and when you're one privy to these mindsets, it's easy to evaluate the risk/reward of certain plays incorrectly. <br>\n<br>\nI also wouldn't rule out Drchrist for no other reason that he doesn't seem overly insightful to me as a player (not trying to be offensive), and as such might not have thought about the NK as much. This reasoning also applies to my predecessor, but I know I'm town, so obviously, you the reader can consider that.<br>\n<br>\nFor similar reasons to Robbnva, I can't rule out KageLord as the potential killer, solely for this quote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4235272#p4235272\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4235272#p4235272\" data-post-id=\"4235272\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 208</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13472\">KageLord</a> wrote:</cite>Not sure why, but maybe because of the relational tells?

Scum don't typically argue from positions they explicitly disbelieve. Like, if as town, I tend to believe scum like to bus D1, I'm not going to represent the opposite view as scum in my next game. I think Kage could have reasonably believed that ABR may have looked town from Natalie's vote on him, which is enough for me assign possible motivation to ABR's kill.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr?

{"number": 267, "id": "4239552", "user": "Hoopla", "user_id": "10193", "content": "Alright, rereading through Day 1, blinker's interactions definitely need analysing. He seems like a passive, novice sort of player, that are usually fairly easy to pick apart their motivations. A couple of people picked up on it early, but his post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4195388#p4195388\" class=\"postlink\">23</a> was pretty unusual for a page 1 post, especially now that we know he's scum. He seems extremely defensive of the possibility that Kage might come under pressure, and the fact he pokes into why Kage/ABR looks like a scumpair could be because he knows this pair is false, which enables him to make an argument that is correct. I don't know why I missed this post first time around, but it's pretty condemning given the sort of player blinker looks like.<br>\n<br>\nInitially I thought Konowa's early pressure on blinker would have had to have been a super hard bus, but after looking it in context, it's possible that if Konowa is scum, it was only early distancing at first, and then may have got trapped on the wagon when others started piling on. To explain, his page 2 on blinker was the first and he provided decent reason for a page 2 vote - I'm not prepared to given Konowa town credit for this action, as when playing scum, early distancing is a relatively common tactic if you can get away with it. You obviously don't want to create a large bandwagon, but it's difficult to ignore something you see as scummy from them.<br>\n<br>\nKonowa then goes on V/LA for a little while, and the wagon is all of a sudden up to L-2, which isn't exactly the ideal position to be in if he's scum - his early distancing has now effectively locked himself into the wagon. The towniest thing that Konowa did in this sequence of play was to declare intention to still lynch blinker - he did this without procuring suspicion on other players too, which scum often like to do. When there is a chance that their buddy will be lynched D1, providing alternatives for themself is a sensible and common play - it looks more like you're scumhunting and also provides an out. <br>\n<br>\nKonowa and blinker's back-and-forth between post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4197661#p4197661\" class=\"postlink\">50</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4197683#p4197683\" class=\"postlink\">51</a> seems lucid and sincere - when you consider how reactive and defensive some of blinker's posts are, this interaction doesn't seem fabricated. It looks like blinker is genuinely trying to explain himself, and I don't think he'd be so convincing when he knew the inquiries from Konowa were bullshit to begin with. Konowa also ramps up the pressure here, not giving blinker any rope, so looking at the early play, this freezes my Konowa suspicion somewhat.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nLooking at Robbnva, his early focus on umoms could easily be construed as avoiding having to make an early stance on blinker when he's under pressure - scum typically try avoid committing too heavily either way on their buddy in such situations. A strong scum or strong town read is very polarizing and unintuitive because it looks obvious, so responses like focusing on another player instead, casual jabs at someone else like in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4199893#p4199893\" class=\"postlink\">59</a> to create alternatives for the town, and mild suspicious/interrogation on the buddy like post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4200270#p4200270\" class=\"postlink\">60</a> are all viable responses as scum to the situation.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, also on page 3 around the same time as Robbnva's posts, Drchrist beats Robbnva to a blinker vote, right when the umoms/blinker metric is in the balance. I think this is a protown play, as it makes the wagons equal at 3-3, as opposed to skipping umoms ahead 4-2. If it's a bus, it's an aggressive one, as that vote has a lot of influence in swinging the direction the town takes. <br>\n<br>\nRobbnva takes the wagon to L-1 a little while later, so if there is bussing involved, I'm inclined to believe it's this vote, particularly when he found a way to get off the wagon again at some point. Konowa continued to romp blinker's wagon to the finish line with some aggressive posts - he really was tunneled on blinker throughout D1, which could be construed like he already knows the result, but it certainly isn't as likely as Kage or Robbnva being scum based on the early play.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nAfter my second read through the game and taking more disciplines into consideration, Kage still remains my prime suspect, but Konowa is eclipsed by Robbnva for my second suspect, like so;<br>\n<br>\nKage<br>\n...<br>\nRobbnva<br>\n...<br>\n...<br>\nKonowa<br>\nDrchrist", "time": "Mon Aug 06, 2012 8:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22768&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "22768"}
