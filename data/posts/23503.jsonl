{"number": 1, "id": "4363131", "user": "Zar", "user_id": "18249", "content": "Rule Set (Borrowed with Permission from Lost Butterfly)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A) Ethics and Sportsmanship</div><br>\n<br>\nA1) All sitewide rules apply. Read them <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br>\nA2) Play to your faction's win condition, as long as you do not break any game or site rules in doing so.<br>\nA3) You may not discuss this game anywhere outside the game thread unless explicitly permitted to do so in your role PM.<br>\nA4) Quoting or pretending to quote your role PM, quicktopics, private communications with the mod, or (in the case of hydrae) discussion with other heads is strictly forbidden. Loose paraphrasing is permitted, although run it past me first when in doubt.<br>\nA5) Be civil and treat other players with respect--attack the case, not the person. Mafia is a heated game, but I will interfere if anyone resorts to excessive insults, personal attacks, and bullying.<br>\nA6) There is a zero-tolerance policy against offensive comments or slurs based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. You may be harshly punished for even a first violation of this rule.<br>\nA7) Encryption is forbidden, as well as messages hidden in invisible text, small text, or BBCode tags. Always err on the side of caution and ask the mod before leaving a code or breadcrumb. A good rule of thumb is that if the average person cannot decipher the code without outside software after having it pointed out, you can't use it.<br>\nA8) Editing and deleting posts (if you have the power to do so) is strictly forbidden.<br>\nA9) If you have outside information that influences your knowledge of the game, are aware of someone else having outside information, or have any reason to believe that the game has been compromised, it is your responsibility to inform the mod immediately. I will love you for your honesty.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">B) Voting/Lynching Mechanics</div><br>\n<br>\nB1) For your vote or unvote to be counted, it must be completely bolded, and use the format Vote: PlayerName/Unvote: PlayerName or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>/<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Playername</span> (capital letters and colon optional). Any other variation (such Hammer: PlayerName) will not be counted.<br>\nB2) Votes for misspellings or acronyms of players' names (such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playrname</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: PN</span>) are valid as long as the player being voted for is clear. You are not required to unvote before changing your vote. However, votes that are behind spoiler tags, in small or invisible text, or otherwise concealed are invalid.<br>\nB3) A lynch will occur when 50%+1 of the votes are cast for the same player. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight.<br>\nB4) (AKA Zachrulez's Nemesis's Rule) You may vote for \"no lynch\" if you wish. If 50% of the players in the game vote for no-lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\nB5) Dead is dead - no 'Bah' post. Not even one. If the mod hasn't posted the endgame scene, you may not post again, even after a hammer in LYLO. Under absolutely under no circumstances may you reveal game-relevant information after your death.<br>\nB6) (AKA The \"Blame Katsuki\" Rule) Votes from an alt account will be interpreted in the most damaging way to your faction. If you can't log in correctly, you have little to complain about.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">C) Activity and Deadlines</div><br>\n<br>\nC1) Days will be 2 weeks long. <br>\nC2) Deadlines will not be extended barring exceptional circumstances or replacement situations. If a majority lynch is not reached before deadline, no lynch occurs.<br>\nC3) You may continue talking after a lynch or deadline has elapsed until the mod posts to end the day. After that, you may not post even if the mod forgets to lock the thread.<br>\nC4) Night phases will last for 72 hours.<br>\nC5) In order to be accepted, night actions must be PMd to the mod or posted in bold in scum QTs before the deadline is up. If a player does not select one, he or she will default to \"no action.\"<br>\nC6) If a replacement is needed during a night phase, I will extend the night deadline until some time after a replacement is found, regardless of whether that slot has a night action.<br>\nC7) Please treat this game as a commitment and do your best to participate actively.<br>\nC8) Players will be prodded after forty-eight hours without posting. They may also request prods on other players so long that player has not posted for a reasonable amount of time. All prods will be announced in thread.<br>\nC9) Players who do not respond to a (non-player-requested) prod within twenty-four hours or need to be prodded too often will be replaced at the discretion of the mod.<br>\nC10) If you will be unable to post for over forty-eight hours, inform the mod by PM or in the thread of when you'll be V/LA. Assuming the V/LA period is of reasonable length, you will be exempt from prods during that time. All V/LA notifications will be made public by the mod.<br>\nC11) I will try to post vote counts every page or every twenty-four hours if possible. Players may request a new vote count at any time.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">D) Other</div><br>\n<br>\nD1) Abilities follow Natural Action Resolution unless explicitly stated otherwise in your role PM.<br>\nD2) If there is a conflict between the rules and your role PM, the role PM takes precedence.<br>\nD3) <div style=\"display:inline;color:Red\">Red</div> is my color. You may not use it.<br>\nD4) Any methods of verifiable randomness are forbidden. This includes dice tags. Don't use them. <br>\nD5) It is possible something may have been overlooked or left unclear. When in doubt, ask. You may be punished for deliberately exploiting technicalities and vague wording in the rules in order to do something you should know is forbidden or unethical.<br>\nD6) Punishment for breaking any of the above rules may include a private or public warning, force replacement, modkill, or even blacklisting (depending on the seriousness of the offence).<br>\nD7) I will modkill players in the way most detrimental to their faction. Modkilled players may be retroactively made into Neutral Survivors.<br>\nD8) I reserve the right to add, remove, or modify rules at any point of the game if it becomes necessary.", "time": "Wed Sep 26, 2012 5:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23503&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "23503"}

Post 98 was simply a point by point rebuttal to each of Emp's purported \"reasons\" for voting me.  I agree, they are a steaming pile of nothing - which I guess was my point.  The vigor with which he chased a steaming pile of nothing, however, is noteworthy.  As he has admitted himself, there was no good reason to chase that thread.  It was clearly an attempt to try to cast someone [me in this case] in a negative light.  In my experience, that is a scum tactic FAR more often than Town.  I can't, in fact, think of more than one example of Town doing this.  On the other hand, I have pointed out two examples of where *I* have used Empking's tactic as scum.  Therefore, I am obviously much more sensitive to spotting that tactic being used for scum purposes.

As long as it is apparent the text is there any player in the game can copy and paste it into a notepad if their eyesight isn't good enough to read it as it appears on the screen.  The spirit of the law is intended to prevent two or more people from communicating with each other by using text so small a player who doesn't know what to look for will never know it was there.  I believe you have modded games before, you should know this.  You should also know that asking to replace out to force the mod to either side with you or Yates definitely falls in the realm of bad sportsmanship, but I'll let the mod decide that for himself instead of trying to hold him hostage.<br>\n<br>\nComparing Empking and Yates side by side gives me a stark contrast in player composure.<br>\n<br>\nAlso Empking's use of bad rhetoric is disconcerting.  Misquoting or misreading the game, the wiki, and the rules and then asking for quotes that you know don't exist to disprove your position is disingenuous.  The rules in the wiki clearly state that all abilities have to be whitelisted.  That is it, it doesn't say anything about the number of shots available to the JOAT has to equal the number of abilities available to the JOAT.<br>\n<br>\nI also find it interesting that Empking started out by wanting Yates dead but is now voting MonkeyMan, and Johhog wanted MonkeyMan dead and is now voting Yates.  I don't believe in coincidence.<br>\n<br>\nIf MonkeyMan was scum who was fake-claiming, I think that after he realized he got away with it he would full claim without much provoking in order to cement his town status.  A scum would subconsciously be looking to ensure that his town-grab gambit worked and would do anything to ensure that.  However, there is a solution and it comes down to voting.  I suggest everyone either says vote: full claim or vote:no full claim . When one side hits 8 votes, then he should full claim.  Why eight? It ensures that at least half the voters are town (the three scum plus a possible third party which is four potential non-town votes).<br>\n<br>\nvote: no full claim.

The lack of a second kill *could* suggest we don't have a 3rd party killing role [obviously, there could be other reasons but we can only go on the information we have currently].  If we don't have a killing role, we could have as many as 4 scum in this game.  With Monkey gone, that means we have at least two and possibly 3 scum left.<br>\n<br>\nI find it *impossible* to believe that all of Monkey's buddies bussed him.  Even if we were going to assume that one of his buddies bussed [in which case, Zoar makes a strong case for Gorillaz] that still leaves at least one and possibly two scum OFF the Monkey wagon.  For this reason, I think we have to lynch from this pool:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hyperion</div> - honestly, this is the most Town slot of the 4 based solely on Empking's play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PereV</div> - I actually agreed with everything Pere said for the most part.

As with Pere, I agreed with TD a lot.  The fact I said I wouldn't lynch TD and lived to see today *could* indicate he is scum that wanted me to see today.  Of course, scum could also have been hoping to see a Hyperion vs Yates battle [continuation of Yates - Empking].  It's all WIFOMy and nothing solid.  Right now, the only knock I have on TD is that he wasn't on the wagon at the end.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Malp</div> - so that leaves Malp.  By POE, Malp is scum.

To me, that's far more damning than TD's implication of Empking.  As with your play [and mine], I believe you can be wrong and still be Town.  Empking wasn't playing as Town but ultimately was right about Monkey.  That's really the ONLY reason I am comfortable with a Town read on Hyperion's slot today.  Conversely, the ONLY reason I find TD remotely scummy is because he was NOT on the wagon that lynched scum.  I almost wasn't on that wagon either so...  *shrug*<br>\n<br>\nBasically every way you slice it all the evidence points to Malp-scum.  There is not a single thing that suggests otherwise.

Yes, TD was wrong about Monkey's fake claim.  *shrug*  I need more than that to jump to the conclusion that he was wrong on purpose [scum] as opposed to just wrong [Town].  That's the leap of faith you are asking me to make and I'm not there yet.<br>\n<br>\nOn the flip side, you have Malp.  <br>\n1. Malp was happy to jump in to the middle of - what I am going to presume based on Emp''s pressure - a Town vs Town argument to help stir the pot.  That's scum play 101.  <br>\n2. Malp also voted for Monkey [post 77] then unvoted [post 203] AFTER Monkey's fake claim [post 152].  This is the scum behavior you are accusing TD of so it needs to weigh equally against Malp.<br>\n3. THEN Malp tried to save his scum buddy by calling Zoro scum [post 279] for wanting to get rid of the JOAT.  I call that the \"see what sticks\" scum move.<br>\n4. It's only after that Malp started lurking and prod dodging with 5 posts in a row [posts 279, 378, 413, 416, and 459] despite NO prod dodges previous to this. [279 was both a scum post AND a prod dodge - double whammy]<br>\n<br>\nSo, I don't think you can characterize Malp's play as \"lurker\" since this is a recent development.  The rest of his posts read like textbook scum.  He commits the SAME sins you are accusing TD of.  He was ALSO not on the Monkey wagon.  There is literally NOTHING to suggest Malp is Town.

Not just that but the way he claimed and the 'protected Johhog' is unbelievably genuine. He's as close to confirmed town as there is. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Zoroasters</div> scumhunting and posting is incredibly genuine, his meta-points about Monkey/Empking shows a deepish thought process. I also like his 'Yates/Empking town vs town, needs to stop' as I'm fairly sure it's the case. A big example of the genuine scumhunting and posting though is his read on notch, his whole \"This is the shittest posts I've ever read but getting town vibes, ugh, can't explain it, ugh this game\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4373084#p4373084\">Post 189</a>) is exactly how I feel about some of my reads sometimes. His interaction with Monkey of the \"I don't think you know what you've done\" and \"How is this normal\" doesn't come across as partners interactions. Like his read on Yates, like his read on director. Fairly confident he's town. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Dunhams</div> interaction with Monkey is also very genuine; highly doubt they're partners. His push for Monkey to fully-claim and his continument on that comes across as town pushing for a scum-read rather than scum yelling at partner to claim. Also like his 'don't give a shit if it's normal or not, i care if it's scummy' sort of attitude (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4375675#p4375675\">Post 264</a>). His whole, \"you're bad players if you let obvscum like this free\" demeaner is very townish and fits what I think I know of his town meta as well. His statistics is irrelevant argument is sound and his \"Look who's buddying to me\" isn't partner interaction (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4376470#p4376470\">Post 302</a>).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Yates</div> was probably the most frustrating player to read throughout the thread, the entire early game debate was plain stupid and the way it jumped from a mere minor discussion point towards something that led him and Empking to tunnel out of frustration on each other should never have happened. With that said, his reaction to the whole debacle was very genuine and his change of reads as day two has moved on reads highly as if he's town. Matches with the town meta of his I know too. As scum he's a lot more mechanical. His suspicion of Mal is very sound and comes across as if he really believes in the case. Alongside that though Monkeys jump on him and his guess of Yates being scum on page 2 leads highly and I mean highly towards Yates being town and Monkey looking for a way to save himself by jumping on a suspected townie. Not just that though but his comment of if Yates flips town we lynch Empking so he doesn't sneak out of gambit comment only really makes sense if he was anticipating a Yates town flip. Yates whole \"I'm going to be super pissed if he's messing up his role as town\" comments also read as town-tells.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">The Directors</div> early case on Monkey where he puts forward a few points of reasoning (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4366594#p4366594\">Post 43</a>) isn't scum. Come on guys. The wagon on him needs to die. You're saying scum instantly decided 'Oh lets buss our JOAT!!' what's likely their strongest role right out of the gate. His translation of the Emking/Yates fight is near spot on and as scum I think he'd take them two arguing as something that he can abuse by stating a FoS on one of them for it or at least leaving himself open to the possibility. By instantly calling it useless he's locking himself on Monkey which doesn't make sense as scum. His re-read and scumhunting of notch is another point towards him genuinely trying. Furthermore his \"Monkey is good at fake-claims, his confirmation won't be real confirmation!\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4373410#p4373410\">Post 197</a>) again doesn't make sense as scum. Why provide that will instantly demeaner Monkeys claim and kill and decreity any chance of him 'clearing' himself. Oh jesus christ the more I read this guys ISO the more obvtown he is. His reasoning for voting Yates is understandable, wrong but understandable and his point about it not making sense for him to buss as scum and then defend scum buddy last second when it was obvious the lynch was going to go through on him is right. His reaction to Dundan is genuine and his \"No one should be claiming that's god awful\" is spot on and right, BG will die tonight regardless of claims and therefore claiming today will just lead towards them dying the following night while it's possible for them to last longer without claiming until needed. Not just all that but Monkeys pandering to him and attempting to convince him to reconsider is NOT talking to a partner, not in a billion million trillion years, it's him thinking he can get what he thinks is a weaker player to sway votes (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4370509#p4370509\">Post 146</a>). The fact that this guy has votes on him is fucking disgusting. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Peres</div> an interesting case, while he's not super active I do think his content that he's put forward is actually relatively strong and I know he's a stronger town player than scum, as scum he struggles to know what to say. Think his early vote on Monkey and proceeding to point out what Empking was meaning about Non-Normal is townish. Like the majority of his reads and it comes across as he's legitimately trying to solve this game, his VCA analysis is a big point towards that. Take this as some advice though Pere, anaylsis on a scum lynch D1 in mini normals is often very very wrong. I've seen 3 games that have been a scum lynched D1 with 0 partners on the wagon, and 2 with both partners leading the wagon. All up take peoples reads and likelihood of being scum solely on their motivation and reasoning behind their votes rather than placement. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NULL (Need to re-read in all likelihood):<br>\n</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Stefan</div> is someone I'll flat out and admit I have issues reading.

I do agree with him in that Monkeys claim doesn't sound exceedingly overpowered but I don't understand how in the very post where he disagrees with some of the reasoning put against Monkey being scum he votes him (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4377745#p4377745\">Post 346</a>), think he'd have drawn it out and talked more.

Don't like his 'Zora scummy for wanting JOAT dead!' comment though, contradicts with his prior scum-read on Monkey (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4376291#p4376291\">Post 279</a>). His defence about it being the whole \"The claim was meant to be believable!\" is bullshit though, since he's saying that he unvoted due to the claim (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4398068#p4398068\">Post 480</a>) however he unvoted because he 'had reading to do' not because he found the claim beleivable.

Director; What happened to your scum-read on Dun only occurring if Notch flipped town and if you changed your mind overnight to him being scum regardless of flip wheres your large case you promised? If you're just voting him out of annoyance you need to quit it out and actually scumhunt.<br>\n<br>\n#2. Inte; What exactly about my last post do you find scummy and do you think there's a legitimate chance that my slot is scum at all, especially after I absolutely nailed notch to the wall, that's probably the strongest and most confident I've ever been in a case.<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Strong Town-Reads:<br>\n</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Dunhams</div> disagreement with the Notch lynch yesterday and ignorance on the case against him is annoying but I'm still confident he's town, I don't see him bussing hardcore on D1 the way it went down and then defending a partner on D2, it doesn't make sense to do as he'd know it'd be something to catch up to him with. His frustration was entirely based around not getting his way, that's a town frustration motivation and his FoS on Director comes across as he really really believes it's well placed (It's not but that's besides the point), so that combined with earlier reasons I found him town pretty much secure him as never-to-lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Zoroaster</div> was someone I was actually reconsidering being scum a lot at the end of yesterday, slightly because of some meta thing but his comments of 'ugh find notch is town despite his comments being so bad' isn't what I'd expect from scum commenting on their partner. I still very much think he's town. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Director </div> isn't someone I should need to go into, the only two potential legitimate points against him are 1) His lack of activity and 2) His OMGUSish vote on Dunham, 1) is the case with majority of the room and 2) Comes across as him being more frustrated with being pushed on then deserperately seeking a mslynch, if that was his aim I don't think he'd contradict how he FoS'ed Dunham and instead be pushing on someone that has a chance to be lynched, esepcially since I told him yesterday Dunham is never being lynched. He's still town, please see this Dunham.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Yates</div> is someone that everything points to him being town, interactions with both flipped scum, the fact that Notch focused so intently on Yates/Empking debate and ignored Monkey points towards him looking to vote inside of two townies and avoid other partner. That plus his scumhunting is very genuine.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pere</div> wasn't going to be added here initially as my town-read on him was weaker than others but did a meta research on him, checked about 10 of his games and as town he's relatively more analytically whereas as scum he filler and fluff posts and just tries to stay afloat, his play here matches his town meta to a tee.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Weak Town Reads:<br>\n</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Malps</div> interaction with Notch doesn't point towards him being scum at all, notchs vote on Malp and the timing of it alongside with the reasoning and Malps response dont' read as bussing and partner interaction (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4400902#p4400902\">Post 506</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4400955#p4400955\">Post 508</a>).

As long as it is apparent the text is there any player in the game can copy and paste it into a notepad if their eyesight isn't good enough to read it as it appears on the screen.  The spirit of the law is intended to prevent two or more people from communicating with each other by using text so small a player who doesn't know what to look for will never know it was there.  I believe you have modded games before, you should know this.  You should also know that asking to replace out to force the mod to either side with you or Yates definitely falls in the realm of bad sportsmanship, but I'll let the mod decide that for himself instead of trying to hold him hostage.<br>\n<br>\nComparing Empking and Yates side by side gives me a stark contrast in player composure.<br>\n<br>\nAlso Empking's use of bad rhetoric is disconcerting.  Misquoting or misreading the game, the wiki, and the rules and then asking for quotes that you know don't exist to disprove your position is disingenuous.  The rules in the wiki clearly state that all abilities have to be whitelisted.  That is it, it doesn't say anything about the number of shots available to the JOAT has to equal the number of abilities available to the JOAT.<br>\n<br>\nI also find it interesting that Empking started out by wanting Yates dead but is now voting MonkeyMan, and Johhog wanted MonkeyMan dead and is now voting Yates.  I don't believe in coincidence.<br>\n<br>\nIf MonkeyMan was scum who was fake-claiming, I think that after he realized he got away with it he would full claim without much provoking in order to cement his town status.  A scum would subconsciously be looking to ensure that his town-grab gambit worked and would do anything to ensure that.  However, there is a solution and it comes down to voting.  I suggest everyone either says vote: full claim or vote:no full claim . When one side hits 8 votes, then he should full claim.  Why eight? It ensures that at least half the voters are town (the three scum plus a possible third party which is four potential non-town votes).<br>\n<br>\nvote: no full claim. I do vote that Monkey state at the beginning of each day what action he used and the results.

Replaced a slot that was attempting to prod-skip through D1 and D2 until he finally skipped out of the game.  Inte's entrance has had minimal impact, save give D.A.R.E. a poster child for their anti-marijuana campaign.  His vote on notch screams bus, even better highlighted by him calling both zoroaster and malp's votes on notch as \"bussing\", despite the fact that that would literally be impossible in the scope of the game.<br>\n<br>\n - PereV; D1 play was awful, he chased after a gorillaz lynch and defended monkey (for context, his defense of monkey came 20 minutes before Stef hammered.)  Post #463 reads like a scum paranoid they are about to get heat from who was then the most active player and self-declared town mayor.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally my favorite player.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, he was slow out of the gates D1, and attempted to prod the Yates-Empking fight to see if it would go anywhere.  By the time that proved to be a martial bicker and nothing more, Monkey was stealing the show.  Everyone is giving him towncred for going after monkey, but from the scum perspective at the time, it was clear Monkey screwed up his claim and was going down.  Created the perfect opportunity for the long-bus for a lot of town-cred upon flip (which is his only claim to fame currently, and which he makes sure to bring up at every opportunity).  He has done nothing pro-town since then.<br>\n<br>\nOn D2 he tries to take command of the game and run up a quick wagon on me.  Initially he looked like a town, I'll admit 269 (the post dunham is basing his entire case on me) looked really bad at the time, so I effort posted to defend myself and explain what I was thinking.  After dunham continued to post basically the same thing over and over and yell at anyone who wasn't voting for me, I put him in the bad town who was death tunneled on me and dismissed anything else he said.<br>\n<br>\nI really didn't care what he was spewing up until notch started stealing the show.  Dunham called the wagon and town stupid, but never really made any comment about notch.  In fact his only interaction with notch was complaining when notch unvoted me, and #519, which really really bugs me.<br>\n<br>\nAt first I thought it was dunham setting himself up for another towncred grab because notch was going to flip town.  IE the \"i told you guys, director is scum, notch was obv town durr, director is scum\" blah blah blah.  It also didn't make sense that if he was willing to long-bus monkey, he would have no problems quick-switch to notch and ride that train.  So which is why I made the distinction.<br>\n<br>\nAfter notch flipped scum, I've since reconsidered.  Dunham has painted himself in a corner with his death tunnel on me.  Him switching over to bus notch with little to no prompt would have definitely raised some eyebrows.  So he couldn't defend notch, he couldn't vote for notch, so he just had to let it happen.  And D3, he is firing again with what he thinks is even a stronger case.<br>\n<br>\nHowever Dunham is getting desperate.  He is two scum buddies down and he remains stuck on me.  He simply cannot unvote me or do anything else, his best chance to win is get me killed today, hit Baseline tonight, and put the game on the shoulders of generally inactive (except for Yates).  This line right here is awful and is clear cut proof that he is getting very desperate:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>the director has:<br>\n1. Voted for Monkey early, heard the awful claim and immediately begun attacking the Baseline slot that was the source of most of the continued pressure on Monkey.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n\"immediately begun attacking the Baseline slot\" this is blatant manipulation.  He is trying to get the town to think I was going after a slot that is now obvtown, but at the time the slot was actually Empking and the game was far from clear.<br>\n<br>\nHe states that I am the only player alive that hasn't voted for either scum.  That is also patently false.  PereV is alive and hasn't voted for either as well.  More manipulation from dunham.<br>\n<br>\nAnd that's that.", "time": "Thu Oct 18, 2012 11:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23503&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "23503"}
