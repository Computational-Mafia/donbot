There is a large segment of town players who do not see any value in the random voting stage.<br>\n- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.<br>\n- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.<br>\n- Fourth, although I wish it were otherwise, it's not the case that town = polite and scum = rude. There's no particular reason why Revenus insulting people necessarily makes him scum, it could just make him a rather unhelpful town player. There are rather a lot of unhelpful town players.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667272#p4667272\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667272#p4667272\" data-post-id=\"4667272\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 14</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19917\">the director</a> wrote:</cite>The only random vote in RVS is the first one.

I mean, the first vote, if you look at it, wasn't actually random. Someone voted for GoldenMean because they dislike maths. They didn't throw a dice or consult an RNG, they formed a reason and moved from that reason to a vote. We call it random because the reason was irrelevant to the actual game - the reason for our vote will produce no better an outcome than random. As such, there are definitely more random votes than solely the first one. If I am the first poster and just say \"I'm voting Player X because I dislike consonants\", then the next poster doesn't really have that much of a relevant reason either in the sense that reason is strongly likely to produce any particular outcome. The more information we get, the less random our votes will become, but it isn't an instant process.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667302#p4667302\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667302#p4667302\" data-post-id=\"4667302\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 17</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14166\">evilpacman18</a> wrote:</cite>Also from a read of other games of yours, you're not nearly so hostile or pretentious of town.

Remember that nice bloke?)<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, I took the liberty of looking at some of your completed games.

There is a large segment of town players who do not see any value in the random voting stage.<br>\n</div></blockquote>There's a difference between avoiding RVS and talking about avoiding RVS. Not to go biblical here but it's like the whole gospel segment on praying. You don't brag about it. Applies to real life too.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.</div></blockquote>But that's the entire point. He voted on a non-serious accusation. That's randomly voting--not to the definition but still pretty close that the differences are small in number. At any rate, your conclusion to this doesn't make any real conclusion. Both of those options are still bad enough, no?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X is actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.</div></blockquote> This is SleepyKrew writing. Don't deny it. You both have proper shark avatars to. #winning<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, while I agree the hypothesis was a little off--the major point I found was that there's an ad hom attack (which is newbie aligned--I'm not particularly sure myself on scum/town alignment) and that there's a random vote, again, from someone who flaunted that he wouldn't do it.<br>\n<br>\nSo either we're all making mistakes or Revenus' humor is bad (the second is assured) and the first will get him mislynched if he's town. Either way, I'm not sure on his alignment but I can understand why there may be a vote on him.<br>\n<br>\n(note this was at like 12:30 PM EST)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Fourth, although I wish it were otherwise, it's not the case that town = polite and scum = rude.

You play what I like to call \"The Lawyer\" playstyle, long wordy posts that contain analysis.  While a very powerful playstyle, it would be more effective if your thoughts were broken up into bite sized pieces.  Just a suggestion.<br>\n<br>\nAt any rate, Revenus is playing scared and overcompensating for his concerns with attacks and insults.  Here is the story he is telling:<br>\n<br>\n&gt; Posts joke instead of vote in first post.  Classic scared entrance.  Knows that he should post, but doesn't want to make a splash so makes an awkward joke while waiting to see what the other more confident players are doing.  This decision was neither random nor can be written off as \"some players don't like placing RVS votes\" because he places what he calls an RVS vote in his very next post.<br>\n<br>\n&gt; Votes the anti-wagon voter.  This is a very safe play.  Instead of being vote four (the bolder and more risky move) on the current wagon, he attacks the player who decides to not jump on the wagon.  This is a very defensible position, and as such very safe.  This is a theme that I have seen very often.*<br>\n<br>\n&gt; Immediately starts retreating further and further as the heat on him builds.  In order to cover his retreat, he drops insults and attacks to cover the fact that he is scared.<br>\n<br>\nIt is very likely he is scum, with a small chance that he is a survivalist/newbie townie.  Knowing that there is considerable meta on him, it is safe to assume he knows how to play town (and thus not a newbie) and therefore simply does not have a strong scum play.<br>\n<br>\n*Further explanation to what I am talking about.<br>\n<br>\nPlayer A,B, and C start an RVS wagon.<br>\nPlayer D votes either Player B or C for \"weak reasoning to jump on the wagon\".<br>\nPlayer E votes player D for \"stepping in front of the wagon.\"  &lt;---- this is very easy for Player E to defend and rationalize, and thus is very, very safe.<br>\n<br>\nRevenus is Player E, and is usually a scum slot.

There is a large segment of town players who do not see any value in the random voting stage.<br>\n- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.<br>\n- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.<br>\n- Fourth, although I wish it were otherwise, it's not the case that town = polite and scum = rude. There's no particular reason why Revenus insulting people necessarily makes him scum, it could just make him a rather unhelpful town player. There are rather a lot of unhelpful town players.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirstly, Who gives a shit, that wasn't the bad part<br>\nSecondly, so he's allowed to be against random voting and then random vote? Even though he see's no point in it? I honestly don't see how it nullifys ANY of his point's other then the fact that you are willing to bypass them by any means nessecary.<br>\n<br>\nFact, clearly he is against RVing, Also Fact, He RV'd.<br>\n<br>\nCall me odd but most of the time i don't do something i am against.<br>\n<br>\nThirdly, It doesn't stop something look like it is going that way.<br>\nForthly, Being a prick doesn't make him anything but anti-town i agree, but the way he is RVing makes him seem anti town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667272#p4667272\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667272#p4667272\" data-post-id=\"4667272\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 14</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19917\">the director</a> wrote:</cite>The only random vote in RVS is the first one.

I mean, the first vote, if you look at it, wasn't actually random. Someone voted for GoldenMean because they dislike maths. They didn't throw a dice or consult an RNG, they formed a reason and moved from that reason to a vote. We call it random because the reason was irrelevant to the actual game - the reason for our vote will produce no better an outcome than random. As such, there are definitely more random votes than solely the first one. If I am the first poster and just say \"I'm voting Player X because I dislike consonants\", then the next poster doesn't really have that much of a relevant reason either in the sense that reason is strongly likely to produce any particular outcome. The more information we get, the less random our votes will become, but it isn't an instant process.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTL;DR<br>\nHis vote wasn't random but in the sense of information it was.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667302#p4667302\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4667302#p4667302\" data-post-id=\"4667302\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 17</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14166\">evilpacman18</a> wrote:</cite>Also from a read of other games of yours, you're not nearly so hostile or pretentious of town.

Xegarus attacked the wagon, Revenus attacked Xegarus.  Golden has yet to post or offer thoughts, potentially is hiding.<br>\n<br>\n- Jason first to drop vote on Revenus, has continued to push the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n- Fake dayvig by Josh.  Revenus reaction is \"If that was a serious dayvig you're probably scum dayvig.\" and \"You know what else you should try doing? Not daykilling townies, kthx.\" This does not hit me as a town reaction.<br>\n<br>\n- Navarre entrance was awkward.  Seems like he either didn't read the thread and just wanted to post or had read the thread and decided to insert his entry post as a joke in an attempt to stay outside of the storm.

Actually all of his 5 posts have been extremely passive, he is definitely trying to fly below the radar.<br>\n<br>\n- #50 Hume wall, defends Revenus, attacks evilpacman18 for his admittedly forced meta read on Rev.  evil probably needs to receive pressure at some point in this game to see how he reacts.<br>\n<br>\n- couple of players fellatio Hume for his wall.  Those in the party are: Rev, Jacob, in that order.<br>\n<br>\n- Hiraki #60 is almost impossible to follow.  Would like a TL;DR of what he was trying to say, but from what I can tell (based on the vote and overuse of the word 'anal'), it was an attack on Rev using meta and ingame quotes.<br>\n<br>\n- Jason wall (#63).  An attack on the Hume wall, clearly an attempt to undermine the post with respect to its defense on Rev.  Attacks Jacob for liking the Hume wall.<br>\n<br>\n- WT prods Rev for why his vote is still on Xeg, Rev next vote is a vote change.<br>\n<br>\n- #70 Rev posts the first real defense of himself, a few points of props go to him for actually owning up and he continues to post.

Taking that and running with it, I can't see that Revenus has never seen the DayKill-Reaction test before, and I suspect that he may of used it as an attempt to get town points.

All in all, I still think 16 might be the worst just because he became slightly apologetic for his posts really fast. <br>\n<br>\nAlmost more suspicious, though, is Navarre, who completely ignores all of this for a random vote. Kind of late, a little bit of derailment. Really, though, it only works to be suspicious IFF revenus is scum. So, to that point, it's still not helping Revenus's case (Or lack thereof?). <br>\n<br>\nJosh Lynman's fake day vig was VERY transparent. Maybe I've just seen it too much recently. In my eyes, it was SO transparent that I'm wondering if it wasn't put together to give revenus a way out. Right now, I'm looking at him as more a chance of a buddy to Revenus than Navarre and almost just as scummy. It just came off as very set up and Revenus made almost no positive reaction to it whatsoever. Someone else should've done it, Josh had really posted nothing and had no reason to vig. I feel that this was strongly set up by Josh/Revenus (at least Josh) to gain town points. I still see him as probscum. <br>\n<br>\nAm I the only one looking at that and thinking that there wasn't all that much a reaction to go off of? Sure the 'perfect town' would try to give an unbiased set of reads to go off of, if they believed the vig, which Revenus did. I still think that the vig fake was carried out bad and thus came back with not a very good reaction. (Jason already posted this, noticed on a re-read)<br>\n<br>\nI like Hume/Krew up until the top half of 50. I hate those kind of questions, they're unproductive and generally faked. But, the rest of his posts have been more or less solid. I feel that he's probably town, would explain further if it were relevant to the current conversation (it may be, I'm on page 2).<br>\n<br>\nAlso to note, by post 54, the vote count for Golden Mean (now me) was:<br>\n<br>\nGolden Mean - 3/7 (Josh Lyman, WT Snacks, the director)<br>\n<br>\nWho had yet to make one post. Why this? We'd seen quite a bit of discussion on Revenus, nothing on Golden, and you're still all holding RVS votes? Josh and Director had definitely posted and WT would post within the next few (Basically showing off his inability or unwillingness to read a good post). On post 59, I'd expect him to vote. Nothing. <br>\n<br>\nSomeone needs to remind me to go back to post 60 and steal one of those lines into the no-context quote thread. <br>\n<br>\nThe issue with the first three pages is there is so much AtE. It's not right for their to be so much AtE, it's like a giant game of bad morals.<br>\n<br>\nDirector made perhaps the best post of the game (post 61). He's made fairly solid posts this whole game and I really enjoy his view on Revenus. <br>\n<br>\nI don't like WT Snacks. With that sentence, I've added as much substance as her. <br>\n<br>\nHiraki is probably scum. Again, I see him switching a lot of opinions, but not votes. He constantly wants someone to die, missed completely who he had as his number one read, and all in all has been taking advantage of whatever looks like it will tie someone up the fastest. If nothing changes from where I am, he'll be my vote, followed by Revenus. <br>\n<br>\nNothing's changed. While I don't mind Revenus lynch, I really want a Hiraki lynch over that. He's been looking to take advantage of others. Revenus might just be that bad. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Hiraki</span> <br>\n<br>\nYour posts come off bad.

Not saying it's impossible that Hiraki is scum or that I have a town read on him, but I haven't disliked him so far and I think there's better lynches. I think that one of Revenus and Navarre is probably scum, a lot of people have posited that Revenus is just VI which seems likely to me, and same for Navarre. Maybe the only reason for my theory then is that I really hope there isn't two idiots on the town team.<br>\nAlso I hadn't noticed that there was probably two teams until it was brought up by someone.

The game has been going for only a week, but in that time we've come close to lynching two different players (Revenus and Hiraki), we've seen a quickwagon on Navarre, and the game itself is quite active. How exactly has this game stalled? This has to be one of the worst vote argumentation I've ever seen. And on top of that, it's a L-1 vote!<br>\n<br>\nOn the subject of the recent Revenus and Hiraki wagons:<br>\nIt's common knowledge that in mafia games the active players garner the most suspicion while the lurkers go by relatively easily, especially Day 1. This is because the more post, the more likely it is that you post something that other people will interpret as scummy. Now I won't say that Revenus and Hiraki aren't scum, but I will point out that our two most active players are conveniently our two major bandwagons of Day 1. As for my personal opinion, I haven't seem much from Hiraki that I would interpret as scummy. Especially when I look at how much he posted, I feel he's done an ok job so far. I'd rather look at the people with few content, especially those that go into 'prod dodge' mode with a lynch nearby, like Josh Lyman is doing now (gets prodded, says he's reading 'now', then doesn't post anyway).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4682331#p4682331\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4682331#p4682331\" data-post-id=\"4682331\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 258</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19917\">the director</a> wrote:</cite>So Revenus is data-dumping ISOs in an attempt to look like he is scum hunting in order to weasel out of his horrific opening play.<br>\n<br>\nAnd Hikari isn't doing much to sway my read on him either.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'm mainly talking about thoughts like this. You don't like what you see, but you're ignorant of what you don't see.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point my main suspicions lie with Josh Lyman and JacobSavage.<br>\nJosh Lyman has posted nothing worth of value today. He has only been here to vote Revenus and Hiraki (the leading wagons) with argumentation such as 'I'm voting you because you're scum' and 'I don't like this'. Then when we're getting close to a lynch, he disappears and only posts a prod acknowledgement.<br>\nI have stated earlier that I didn't like the fact that JacobSavage relied solely on meta to scumhunt. Since then, he has done next to nothing except join easy wagons (Navarre and Hiraki). Then, there's that terrible terrible 'this game has stalled' vote.<br>\n<br>\nI feel comfortable voting either player. I'm going to vote Jacob because I feel Jacob's behaviour is more serious. If I look at it from a different angle, Jacob could just be a very impatient player by nature that legitly feels this game has stalled. However, going through the meta of other players is something that requires lots of patience.

Sure, let's do it. First, you've just stated twice that you feel this is probably a policy lynch more or less, and basically here we've seen you state that you're prepared to get rid of him because Revenerus is a player \"you don't like\". Great. So, scum lynching, right? No. Newbie aligned (to which you apparently don't know if ad hom is generally town or scum -[Just a hint, AtE (shorter for ad hom/appeal to emotion) is used both ways and is not a tell whatsoever unless you can tell it's faked.]). Not only that, we're attacking his humor as being bad or him being scum, or perhaps both. I personally don't see a correlation between bad humor and scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd you're still lining up a lynch, all too happy to let everyone know you want narrave dead tomorrow. Okay, so here's the deal with this:<br>\nYou're either scum or stupid for this point alone. Why? Scum no longer will KILL narrave. Meaning that a potential flip to benefit you for checking your reads is gone. You basically just stated you're planning on going coal miner on us and tunneling him tomorrow. Which is also scum, in the sense that you have given yourself a lynch that you will sit on to the ends of time, trying to encourage town to take him down for consecutive days of non-you (or your alignment) lynches. The only time you say something like this is really when you're bread crumbing, in my opinion, or if you know someone is scum for certain. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, for questioning ad hom being a tell, you have used it very liberally this game. Almost every post. <br>\n<br>\nPost 68 should've tipped someone that Revenus was probably just a vi. But nope. This is more a side note than anything else. <br>\n<br>\nHey, remember me telling you you lined up lynches? Oh, like every post, right.

Pretty sure it's the latter but we're not 100% sure here so let's not assume.<br>\n<br>\nNot to mention, you're just holding a grudge. Not surprising.

There is a large segment of town players who do not see any value in the random voting stage.<br>\n</div></blockquote>There's a difference between avoiding RVS and talking about avoiding RVS. Not to go biblical here but it's like the whole gospel segment on praying. You don't brag about it. Applies to real life too.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.</div></blockquote>But that's the entire point. He voted on a non-serious accusation. That's randomly voting--not to the definition but still pretty close that the differences are small in number. At any rate, your conclusion to this doesn't make any real conclusion. Both of those options are still bad enough, no?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X is actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.</div></blockquote> This is SleepyKrew writing. Don't deny it. You both have proper shark avatars to. #winning<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, while I agree the hypothesis was a little off--the major point I found was that there's an ad hom attack (which is newbie aligned--I'm not particularly sure myself on scum/town alignment) and that there's a random vote, again, from someone who flaunted that he wouldn't do it.<br>\n<br>\nSo either we're all making mistakes or Revenus' humor is bad (the second is assured) and the first will get him mislynched if he's town.

There's no particular reason why Revenus insulting people necessarily makes him scum, it could just make him a rather unhelpful town player. There are rather a lot of unhelpful town players.</div></blockquote>Yes--which makes a plausible vigshot so fulfilling.

I'm not going to speak for EPM, but I think most of what he posted is self-explanatory.  The fact that at every twist and turn you are asking for \"proof\" when it should be obvious to those who are keeping up with the game makes me believe you are either overly concerned about what exactly people think of you because you are afraid of reacting to the wrong thing, are attempting to purposely stall/cloud the game by being able to argue semantics and meaningless details, or both.<br>\n<br>\nMe: Because I refused to hammer.<br>\nYou: Hardcore bussed Hiraki until veering off on Navarre at the last moment.<br>\nWTSnacks: Called him town initially but then jumped on the \"Hiraki is scum\" wagon which can be seen as distancing.<br>\n<br>\nIt took me 10 seconds to figure all of that out, and EPM is free to correct/clarify if he sees anything different.", "time": "Mon Feb 11, 2013 6:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25357&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "25357"}

I also somewhat doubt Josh is going to post quality content after seeing his response to his 3-votes wagon. I feel like we're dealing with a person that simply doesn't care rather than a lurker. Having said that, I will still support a Josh wagon. Josh is one of those people you definitely do not want to be making the decisions in endgame. The problem though is that I see three players that won't be of any help in the lategame because they're posting next to no content (Josh, Jacob, Snacks). Someone remarked earlier that it's really strange for a hydra to lurk hard, since the whole point of a hydra is to guarantee a certain degree of activity.

Votes and votecounts can be found in the game thread, not in some kind of quicktopic or instant messenger. Especially when they're new at this, you'd think they'd put more effort into making sure they were speaking with one mouth. I feel like this could be soft-bussing as we often see in scumpairs: Showing suspicion on your scumbuddy, but voting someone else.

What stands out is that WT Snacks gets a lot of null/scummy tags and only own townish tag, but this is not followed up by vote or even pressure. Then in post 252, Revenus does vote WT Snacks, but in the exact same post switches to Xegarus, saying he is much more scummy.<br>\n<br>\nInterestingly, both WT Snacks and Revenus called eachother scummy but never went to the point of actually voting eachother. I think we might be dealing with a scum connection here.<br>\n<br>\nOh, but I do agree with Revenus that The Director's sudden hammer on Josh Lyman is awfully suspicious.<br>\nLet's compare:<br>\nD1: The Director was very vocal about hammering, called Hiraki scum, but hesitated on the hammer.<br>\nD2: The Director didn't say anything about hammering, said nothing about Josh, then hammered out of the blue.<br>\n<br>\nI feel that The Director's hesitation on hammering Navarre could have just been a way to cover up for his inconsistency in behaviour between being so vocal about hammering and not hammering Hiraki.

The game has been going for only a week, but in that time we've come close to lynching two different players (Revenus and Hiraki), we've seen a quickwagon on Navarre, and the game itself is quite active. How exactly has this game stalled? This has to be one of the worst vote argumentation I've ever seen. And on top of that, it's a L-1 vote!<br>\n<br>\nOn the subject of the recent Revenus and Hiraki wagons:<br>\nIt's common knowledge that in mafia games the active players garner the most suspicion while the lurkers go by relatively easily, especially Day 1. This is because the more post, the more likely it is that you post something that other people will interpret as scummy. Now I won't say that Revenus and Hiraki aren't scum, but I will point out that our two most active players are conveniently our two major bandwagons of Day 1. As for my personal opinion, I haven't seem much from Hiraki that I would interpret as scummy. Especially when I look at how much he posted, I feel he's done an ok job so far. I'd rather look at the people with few content, especially those that go into 'prod dodge' mode with a lynch nearby, like Josh Lyman is doing now (gets prodded, says he's reading 'now', then doesn't post anyway).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4682331#p4682331\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4682331#p4682331\" data-post-id=\"4682331\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 258</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19917\">the director</a> wrote:</cite>So Revenus is data-dumping ISOs in an attempt to look like he is scum hunting in order to weasel out of his horrific opening play.<br>\n<br>\nAnd Hikari isn't doing much to sway my read on him either.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'm mainly talking about thoughts like this. You don't like what you see, but you're ignorant of what you don't see.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point my main suspicions lie with Josh Lyman and JacobSavage.<br>\nJosh Lyman has posted nothing worth of value today. He has only been here to vote Revenus and Hiraki (the leading wagons) with argumentation such as 'I'm voting you because you're scum' and 'I don't like this'. Then when we're getting close to a lynch, he disappears and only posts a prod acknowledgement.<br>\nI have stated earlier that I didn't like the fact that JacobSavage relied solely on meta to scumhunt. Since then, he has done next to nothing except join easy wagons (Navarre and Hiraki). Then, there's that terrible terrible 'this game has stalled' vote.<br>\n<br>\nI feel comfortable voting either player. I'm going to vote Jacob because I feel Jacob's behaviour is more serious. If I look at it from a different angle, Jacob could just be a very impatient player by nature that legitly feels this game has stalled. However, going through the meta of other players is something that requires lots of patience. No matter how I look at it, his L-1 vote is terrible.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: JacobSavage</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis shows a lot of saving Hiraki<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4688686#p4688686\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4688686#p4688686\" data-post-id=\"4688686\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 365</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20697\">YOLO</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nNull<br>\nHiraki<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIs protecting Hiraki without really putting a town read there<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4672204#p4672204\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4672204#p4672204\" data-post-id=\"4672204\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 130</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14406\">Hiraki</a> wrote:</cite>YOLO is by far the towniest person in the game, thanks.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAlso really attached to keeping YOLO alive.", "time": "Tue Feb 19, 2013 2:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25357&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "25357"}

Unfortunate you lost with the finish line in sight, but like you said claims are of extreme importance, especially in lylo.<br>\n<br>\nWhen Maenara flipped vengeful I too thought this setup was a bit townsided, but I now see that the scum teams had daytalk which evens things out quite a bit. In my opinion the game was balanced well with the town having a bit more power than usual but the scumteams having daytalk.<br>\n<br>\nDoes anyone mind sharing the dead quicktopic? I'd like to see what the thoughts of other players were during the game.", "time": "Fri Feb 22, 2013 1:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25357&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "25357"}
