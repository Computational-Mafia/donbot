There is a large segment of town players who do not see any value in the random voting stage.<br>- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.<br>- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.<br>- Fourth, although I wish it were otherwise, it's not the case that town = polite and scum = rude. There's no particular reason why Revenus insulting people necessarily makes him scum, it could just make him a rather unhelpful town player. There are rather a lot of unhelpful town players.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4667272#p4667272\" class=\"postlink\">post 14</a>, the director wrote:</cite>The only random vote in RVS is the first one.  Everyone else then reacts to that vote and makes a decision with some (albeit very small) amount of knowledge.  You reacted to that first vote by deciding to not vote, then voted on someone who didn't jump on a quick wagon, then went on the attack.</div></blockquote><br>There are elements of this I agree with and elements I disagree with. I mean, the first vote, if you look at it, wasn't actually random. Someone voted for GoldenMean because they dislike maths. They didn't throw a dice or consult an RNG, they formed a reason and moved from that reason to a vote. We call it random because the reason was irrelevant to the actual game - the reason for our vote will produce no better an outcome than random. As such, there are definitely more random votes than solely the first one. If I am the first poster and just say \"I'm voting Player X because I dislike consonants\", then the next poster doesn't really have that much of a relevant reason either in the sense that reason is strongly likely to produce any particular outcome. The more information we get, the less random our votes will become, but it isn't an instant process.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4667302#p4667302\" class=\"postlink\">post 17</a>, evilpacman18 wrote:</cite>Also from a read of other games of yours, you're not nearly so hostile or pretentious of town.

You play what I like to call \"The Lawyer\" playstyle, long wordy posts that contain analysis.  While a very powerful playstyle, it would be more effective if your thoughts were broken up into bite sized pieces.  Just a suggestion.<br><br>At any rate, Revenus is playing scared and overcompensating for his concerns with attacks and insults.  Here is the story he is telling:<br><br>&gt; Posts joke instead of vote in first post.  Classic scared entrance.  Knows that he should post, but doesn't want to make a splash so makes an awkward joke while waiting to see what the other more confident players are doing.  This decision was neither random nor can be written off as \"some players don't like placing RVS votes\" because he places what he calls an RVS vote in his very next post.<br><br>&gt; Votes the anti-wagon voter.  This is a very safe play.  Instead of being vote four (the bolder and more risky move) on the current wagon, he attacks the player who decides to not jump on the wagon.

There is a large segment of town players who do not see any value in the random voting stage.<br>- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.<br>- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.<br>- Fourth, although I wish it were otherwise, it's not the case that town = polite and scum = rude. There's no particular reason why Revenus insulting people necessarily makes him scum, it could just make him a rather unhelpful town player. There are rather a lot of unhelpful town players.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Firstly, Who gives a shit, that wasn't the bad part<br>Secondly, so he's allowed to be against random voting and then random vote? Even though he see's no point in it?

Everyone else then reacts to that vote and makes a decision with some (albeit very small) amount of knowledge.  You reacted to that first vote by deciding to not vote, then voted on someone who didn't jump on a quick wagon, then went on the attack.</div></blockquote><br>There are elements of this I agree with and elements I disagree with. I mean, the first vote, if you look at it, wasn't actually random. Someone voted for GoldenMean because they dislike maths. They didn't throw a dice or consult an RNG, they formed a reason and moved from that reason to a vote. We call it random because the reason was irrelevant to the actual game - the reason for our vote will produce no better an outcome than random. As such, there are definitely more random votes than solely the first one. If I am the first poster and just say \"I'm voting Player X because I dislike consonants\", then the next poster doesn't really have that much of a relevant reason either in the sense that reason is strongly likely to produce any particular outcome. The more information we get, the less random our votes will become, but it isn't an instant process.</div></blockquote><br><br>TL;DR<br>His vote wasn't random but in the sense of information it was.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4667302#p4667302\" class=\"postlink\">post 17</a>, evilpacman18 wrote:</cite>Also from a read of other games of yours, you're not nearly so hostile or pretentious of town.

Few others have only one or two posts.  Game is operating at 3/4 capacity IMO.<br><br>- Early quick wagon on Golden and subsequent fallout has sparked conversation.  Xegarus attacked the wagon, Revenus attacked Xegarus.  Golden has yet to post or offer thoughts, potentially is hiding.<br><br>- Jason first to drop vote on Revenus, has continued to push the wagon.<br><br>- Fake dayvig by Josh.  Revenus reaction is \"If that was a serious dayvig you're probably scum dayvig.\" and \"You know what else you should try doing? Not daykilling townies, kthx.\" This does not hit me as a town reaction.<br><br>- Navarre entrance was awkward.  Seems like he either didn't read the thread and just wanted to post or had read the thread and decided to insert his entry post as a joke in an attempt to stay outside of the storm.  Either way, he is a suspect.<br><br>- #49 Xegarus asks a question which looks like he is trying to stay out of the fray.  Actually all of his 5 posts have been extremely passive, he is definitely trying to fly below the radar.<br><br>- #50 Hume wall, defends Revenus, attacks evilpacman18 for his admittedly forced meta read on Rev.  evil probably needs to receive pressure at some point in this game to see how he reacts.<br><br>- couple of players fellatio Hume for his wall.  Those in the party are: Rev, Jacob, in that order.<br><br>- Hiraki #60 is almost impossible to follow.  Would like a TL;DR of what he was trying to say, but from what I can tell (based on the vote and overuse of the word 'anal'), it was an attack on Rev using meta and ingame quotes.<br><br>- Jason wall (#63).  An attack on the Hume wall, clearly an attempt to undermine the post with respect to its defense on Rev.  Attacks Jacob for liking the Hume wall.<br><br>- WT prods Rev for why his vote is still on Xeg, Rev next vote is a vote change.<br><br>- #70 Rev posts the first real defense of himself, a few points of props go to him for actually owning up and he continues to post.  If I was a betting man I would have expected him to significantly slow his posting.  Don't know what it means, he is a bit of a chatter box, so its a NULL tell overall.<br><br>- Game continues to debate the merit of the fake daykill of Rev, not quite sure what to make of it."}

Really, even his vote wasn't bad, but Director's post seemed to flip a bad switch on with revenus. After post 7, I've only seen bad posts from him. All in all, I still think 16 might be the worst just because he became slightly apologetic for his posts really fast. <br><br>Almost more suspicious, though, is Navarre, who completely ignores all of this for a random vote. Kind of late, a little bit of derailment. Really, though, it only works to be suspicious IFF revenus is scum. So, to that point, it's still not helping Revenus's case (Or lack thereof?). <br><br>Josh Lynman's fake day vig was VERY transparent. Maybe I've just seen it too much recently. In my eyes, it was SO transparent that I'm wondering if it wasn't put together to give revenus a way out. Right now, I'm looking at him as more a chance of a buddy to Revenus than Navarre and almost just as scummy. It just came off as very set up and Revenus made almost no positive reaction to it whatsoever. Someone else should've done it, Josh had really posted nothing and had no reason to vig. I feel that this was strongly set up by Josh/Revenus (at least Josh) to gain town points. I still see him as probscum. <br><br>Am I the only one looking at that and thinking that there wasn't all that much a reaction to go off of? Sure the 'perfect town' would try to give an unbiased set of reads to go off of, if they believed the vig, which Revenus did. I still think that the vig fake was carried out bad and thus came back with not a very good reaction. (Jason already posted this, noticed on a re-read)<br><br>I like Hume/Krew up until the top half of 50. I hate those kind of questions, they're unproductive and generally faked. But, the rest of his posts have been more or less solid. I feel that he's probably town, would explain further if it were relevant to the current conversation (it may be, I'm on page 2).<br><br>Also to note, by post 54, the vote count for Golden Mean (now me) was:<br><br>Golden Mean - 3/7 (Josh Lyman, WT Snacks, the director)<br><br>Who had yet to make one post. Why this? We'd seen quite a bit of discussion on Revenus, nothing on Golden, and you're still all holding RVS votes? Josh and Director had definitely posted and WT would post within the next few (Basically showing off his inability or unwillingness to read a good post). On post 59, I'd expect him to vote. Nothing. <br><br>Someone needs to remind me to go back to post 60 and steal one of those lines into the no-context quote thread. <br><br>The issue with the first three pages is there is so much AtE. It's not right for their to be so much AtE, it's like a giant game of bad morals.<br><br>Director made perhaps the best post of the game (post 61). He's made fairly solid posts this whole game and I really enjoy his view on Revenus. <br><br>I don't like WT Snacks. With that sentence, I've added as much substance as her. <br><br>Hiraki is probably scum. Again, I see him switching a lot of opinions, but not votes. He constantly wants someone to die, missed completely who he had as his number one read, and all in all has been taking advantage of whatever looks like it will tie someone up the fastest. If nothing changes from where I am, he'll be my vote, followed by Revenus. <br><br>Nothing's changed. While I don't mind Revenus lynch, I really want a Hiraki lynch over that. He's been looking to take advantage of others. Revenus might just be that bad. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Hiraki</span> <br><br>Your posts come off bad.

Not saying it's impossible that Hiraki is scum or that I have a town read on him, but I haven't disliked him so far and I think there's better lynches. I think that one of Revenus and Navarre is probably scum, a lot of people have posited that Revenus is just VI which seems likely to me, and same for Navarre.

The game has been going for only a week, but in that time we've come close to lynching two different players (Revenus and Hiraki), we've seen a quickwagon on Navarre, and the game itself is quite active. How exactly has this game stalled? This has to be one of the worst vote argumentation I've ever seen. And on top of that, it's a L-1 vote!<br><br>On the subject of the recent Revenus and Hiraki wagons:<br>It's common knowledge that in mafia games the active players garner the most suspicion while the lurkers go by relatively easily, especially Day 1. This is because the more post, the more likely it is that you post something that other people will interpret as scummy. Now I won't say that Revenus and Hiraki aren't scum, but I will point out that our two most active players are conveniently our two major bandwagons of Day 1. As for my personal opinion, I haven't seem much from Hiraki that I would interpret as scummy. Especially when I look at how much he posted, I feel he's done an ok job so far. I'd rather look at the people with few content, especially those that go into 'prod dodge' mode with a lynch nearby, like Josh Lyman is doing now (gets prodded, says he's reading 'now', then doesn't post anyway).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4682331#p4682331\" class=\"postlink\">post 258</a>, the director wrote:</cite>So Revenus is data-dumping ISOs in an attempt to look like he is scum hunting in order to weasel out of his horrific opening play.<br><br>And Hikari isn't doing much to sway my read on him either.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm mainly talking about thoughts like this. You don't like what you see, but you're ignorant of what you don't see.<br><br>At this point my main suspicions lie with Josh Lyman and JacobSavage.<br>Josh Lyman has posted nothing worth of value today. He has only been here to vote Revenus and Hiraki (the leading wagons) with argumentation such as 'I'm voting you because you're scum' and 'I don't like this'. Then when we're getting close to a lynch, he disappears and only posts a prod acknowledgement.<br>I have stated earlier that I didn't like the fact that JacobSavage relied solely on meta to scumhunt. Since then, he has done next to nothing except join easy wagons (Navarre and Hiraki). Then, there's that terrible terrible 'this game has stalled' vote.<br><br>I feel comfortable voting either player. I'm going to vote Jacob because I feel Jacob's behaviour is more serious. If I look at it from a different angle, Jacob could just be a very impatient player by nature that legitly feels this game has stalled. However, going through the meta of other players is something that requires lots of patience.

Sure, let's do it. First, you've just stated twice that you feel this is probably a policy lynch more or less, and basically here we've seen you state that you're prepared to get rid of him because Revenerus is a player \"you don't like\". Great. So, scum lynching, right? No. Newbie aligned (to which you apparently don't know if ad hom is generally town or scum -[Just a hint, AtE (shorter for ad hom/appeal to emotion) is used both ways and is not a tell whatsoever unless you can tell it's faked.]). Not only that, we're attacking his humor as being bad or him being scum, or perhaps both. I personally don't see a correlation between bad humor and scum.<br><br>And you're still lining up a lynch, all too happy to let everyone know you want narrave dead tomorrow. Okay, so here's the deal with this:<br>You're either scum or stupid for this point alone. Why? Scum no longer will KILL narrave. Meaning that a potential flip to benefit you for checking your reads is gone. You basically just stated you're planning on going coal miner on us and tunneling him tomorrow. Which is also scum, in the sense that you have given yourself a lynch that you will sit on to the ends of time, trying to encourage town to take him down for consecutive days of non-you (or your alignment) lynches. The only time you say something like this is really when you're bread crumbing, in my opinion, or if you know someone is scum for certain. <br><br>Also, for questioning ad hom being a tell, you have used it very liberally this game. Almost every post. <br><br>Post 68 should've tipped someone that Revenus was probably just a vi. But nope. This is more a side note than anything else. <br><br>Hey, remember me telling you you lined up lynches? Oh, like every post, right. Nail, meet coffin. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4669271#p4669271\" class=\"postlink\">post 83</a>, Hiraki wrote:</cite>It is never too early for me to line up lynches.<br><br>I understand the whole theory that \"oh well this flip might effect this read\"<br><br>but the two reads have absolutely nothing to do with each other<br><br>and i like to see dead people</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes, you are scum. I could stop here. In fact, I said I wasn't going to wall. I'd prefer people to read this. <br><br>For bitching about me on the WT part, when I said he hadn't posted anything, you seem to agree.

Applies to real life too.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Secondly, I think Revenus's second post clearly was a random post or quasi-random post. I can understand one misreading of it, as the director may have done. However, especially after Revenus pointed out it wasn't a serious post, I think most people reading that should see it was not intended seriously. This has two consequences - firstly that actually Revenus did enter the RVS, nullifying evilpacman18's first point and third point, and secondly that the vote was not fully rational and was at least partially informed by chance, nullifying evilpacman18's second point.</div></blockquote>But that's the entire point. He voted on a non-serious accusation. That's randomly voting--not to the definition but still pretty close that the differences are small in number. At any rate, your conclusion to this doesn't make any real conclusion. Both of those options are still bad enough, no?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hume wrote:</cite>- Thirdly, as town, if you think someone is setting up a future target at the start of D1, you don't shout all about it. When you think \"Player X is going to target Player Y\", that's a hypothesis. You find out if this hypothesis has any truth or not by testing it. You do that by waiting, and seeing if Player X is actually targeting Player Y. What evilpacman18 has done is prevent his hypothesis from being tested at all, and put forth an assertion with no backing, in a single line.</div></blockquote> This is SleepyKrew writing. Don't deny it. You both have proper shark avatars to. #winning<br><br>Anyway, while I agree the hypothesis was a little off--the major point I found was that there's an ad hom attack (which is newbie aligned--I'm not particularly sure myself on scum/town alignment) and that there's a random vote, again, from someone who flaunted that he wouldn't do it.<br><br>So either we're all making mistakes or Revenus' humor is bad (the second is assured) and the first will get him mislynched if he's town.

Great. So, scum lynching, right?

Navarre, even if town, isn't going to soak up a night kill and has a grand total of 12 posts (made the ISO real easy) over 20something pages which is just awful.  Equally awful is the fact he is on the chopping block over 12 whole posts (I seriously thought he had more).<br><br>The only other possibility is asking Navarre to replace out and picking someone else for the deadline lynch.

I'm not going to speak for EPM, but I think most of what he posted is self-explanatory.  The fact that at every twist and turn you are asking for \"proof\" when it should be obvious to those who are keeping up with the game makes me believe you are either overly concerned about what exactly people think of you because you are afraid of reacting to the wrong thing, are attempting to purposely stall/cloud the game by being able to argue semantics and meaningless details, or both.<br><br>Me: Because I refused to hammer.<br>You: Hardcore bussed Hiraki until veering off on Navarre at the last moment.<br>WTSnacks: Called him town initially but then jumped on the \"Hiraki is scum\" wagon which can be seen as distancing.<br><br>It took me 10 seconds to figure all of that out, and EPM is free to correct/clarify if he sees anything different."}

Having said that, I will still support a Josh wagon. Josh is one of those people you definitely do not want to be making the decisions in endgame. The problem though is that I see three players that won't be of any help in the lategame because they're posting next to no content (Josh, Jacob, Snacks). Someone remarked earlier that it's really strange for a hydra to lurk hard, since the whole point of a hydra is to guarantee a certain degree of activity.

For reference:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4679547#p4679547\" class=\"postlink\">post 241</a>, WT Snacks wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4676048#p4676048\" class=\"postlink\">post 188</a>, Revenus wrote:</cite>WTSnacks seems content with my wagon even as he sits on his RVS vote; oh wait, that's because the only thing he's commented on is me.</div></blockquote><br><br>You can chalk this up to confusion between hydra heads; we're kinda new at this.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't really see what communication between hydra heads has to do with this. Votes and votecounts can be found in the game thread, not in some kind of quicktopic or instant messenger. Especially when they're new at this, you'd think they'd put more effort into making sure they were speaking with one mouth. I feel like this could be soft-bussing as we often see in scumpairs: Showing suspicion on your scumbuddy, but voting someone else. And interestingly, that's exactly what Revenus does with WT Snacks:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4678662#p4678662\" class=\"postlink\">post 225</a>, Revenus wrote:</cite>Mmm, let's iso WTSnacks real quick<br><br>post #4: RVS vote (null)<br>post #57: seems to implicitly agree with the crowd that I'm scum (null), and questions me for finding Hume's \"novel\" good.  He calls Hume town (why?  he didn't even read Hume's post), and seems to imply that I\"m scummy because of this (scummy)<br>post #58: corrects a quote (null)<br>post #59: calls me out for not scumhunting, blah blah blah, which is ironic since he hasn't scumhunted at all so far.  furthermore, he's still sitting on his RVS vote at this point even though he calls me scum (scummy)<br>post #66: asks me why I'm still voting my RVS vote (null)<br>post #84: asks the director why he bothered analyzing the game.  feels like wanting to restrict conversation, especially since I really liked director's post #80, which WTS is referring to (scummy)<br>post #196: calls hiraki town, doesn't really explain why, tell us he doesn't really like one post (null)<br>post #197: again affirms that he thinks hiraki is town, calls out Xegarus for being scummy, but doesn't vote (null)<br>post #210: seizes upon Navarre's terrible antitown post (townish), and lays a decent case out.</div></blockquote><br><br>This post was Revenus's ISO post of WT Snacks. What stands out is that WT Snacks gets a lot of null/scummy tags and only own townish tag, but this is not followed up by vote or even pressure. Then in post 252, Revenus does vote WT Snacks, but in the exact same post switches to Xegarus, saying he is much more scummy.<br><br>Interestingly, both WT Snacks and Revenus called eachother scummy but never went to the point of actually voting eachother. I think we might be dealing with a scum connection here.<br><br>Oh, but I do agree with Revenus that The Director's sudden hammer on Josh Lyman is awfully suspicious.<br>Let's compare:<br>D1: The Director was very vocal about hammering, called Hiraki scum, but hesitated on the hammer.<br>D2: The Director didn't say anything about hammering, said nothing about Josh, then hammered out of the blue.<br><br>I feel that The Director's hesitation on hammering Navarre could have just been a way to cover up for his inconsistency in behaviour between being so vocal about hammering and not hammering Hiraki. He couldn't just hammer anybody after not hammering Hiraki, that would be way too obvious a connection. So he had to hesitate on another lynch before he could just continue hammering anybody. That theory makes sense to me.<br><br>At this point, I'm thinking of a Revenus/WT Snacks and Hiraki/The Director pairing.<br><br>I can vote for either player, but I'm going with Revenus right now. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Revenus</span><br><br>---<br><br>Some leftover stuff from yesterday:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4714096#p4714096\" class=\"postlink\">post 666</a>, Viomi wrote:</cite>You finally post and hop on the biggest wagon. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: YOLO</span><br><br>Good point on director btw.</div></blockquote><br><br>You are aware that I'd been asking for a Jacob/Josh wagon for almost the entire first day, right? Of course I support a wagon that I 'started'.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4714187#p4714187\" class=\"postlink\">post 668</a>, JasonWazza wrote:</cite>@YOLO;<br>Are you only gonna do policy lynches?<br><br>Cause if so i will put your head on the chopping block with the 3 you named</div></blockquote><br><br>No. Like I said, I couldn't find scummy behaviour or connections at the time, but we had a few very anti-town players among us. Wagon'ing those players had to be done. A quicklynch was not my idea though, but it certainly gives us a lot of information.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4721110#p4721110\" class=\"postlink\">post 691</a>, Maenara wrote:</cite>Woah, woah, woah.<br><br>I just realized.<br><br>YOLO has less than 2% of the posts in this game.

Revenus had five votes on him early Day 1 and since then there've been multiple players that have expressed their willingness to lynch him. Revenus is as far from obvtown as one can be.

Director thinks Hiraki is without a doubt scum. This can only lead to the conclusion that Hiraki will be hammered on sight...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4683173#p4683173\" class=\"postlink\">post 263</a>, the director wrote:</cite>intent</div></blockquote><br><br>... but it doesn't happen. As we know by know, Director hammered Viomi on sight. He hammered Josh Lyman, who he barely talked about at all, on sight. But he doesn't hammer 'without a doubt scum' Hiraki.<br><br>As we now know, Hiraki was a Werewolf Goon. There is a very logical reason as to why Director hesitated to hammer Hiraki: Director and Hiraki were scumbuddies. And being just two in numbers, Director didn't want to hammer his buddy on sight.<br><br>In order to make up for this contradiction to his earlier statements, we get this post when Navarre is brought to L-1:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4696968#p4696968\" class=\"postlink\">post 551</a>, the director wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4696827#p4696827\" class=\"postlink\">post 545</a>, YOLO wrote:</cite>Having said that, I think we're ready to end the day.

Director, I suggest you wait for his claim too.

I'm ISOing him right now, and if I get a strong scum read from him, I am going to hammer tonight.</div></blockquote><br><br>Director doesn't hammer Navarre either. How can this be explained? Well, we know that Director didn't lie about being hammer happy, he hammered Josh and Viomi after all. However, if he would hammer everyone except Hiraki, this would be way too obvious a connection in case one of them were to die. So Director doesn't hammer the person after Hiraki either, and that happens to be Navarre.<br>Notice that Director will only hammer if his ISO makes him think Navarre is strong scum.<br><br>Fast forward to Day 2.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4712912#p4712912\" class=\"postlink\">post 662</a>, the director wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4712812#p4712812\" class=\"postlink\">post 661</a>, Maenara wrote:</cite>While you do that, place a vote on Josh, will you? He needs to deliver some more info, regardless of whatever else is going on, and three votes apparently doesn't suffice to convince him of that.

Both were ignored by Director for the most part. Director said he would hammer Navarre if his ISO said 'strong scum'. On Josh's ISO, Director 'admits he could be in the sculm realm', which is very vague, but at least indicates Director doesn't have a strong scum read on Josh. But what happens?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4715612#p4715612\" class=\"postlink\">post 679</a>, the director wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Josh Lyman</span><br><br>You lost the game of chicken.</div></blockquote><br><br>Director hammers.

By making the impression that he was hammer happy by nature, Director would be able to excuse his scummy quickhammers during the game. At the same time, he would be able to dodge nightkills from the mafia team, since it's unlikely the mafia team would want to get rid of a player that is quickhammering anybody. However, he tripped when his scumbuddy was first in line to be quickhammered.<br><br>The Director / Hiraki - Werewolf team"}

The game has been going for only a week, but in that time we've come close to lynching two different players (Revenus and Hiraki), we've seen a quickwagon on Navarre, and the game itself is quite active. How exactly has this game stalled? This has to be one of the worst vote argumentation I've ever seen. And on top of that, it's a L-1 vote!<br><br>On the subject of the recent Revenus and Hiraki wagons:<br>It's common knowledge that in mafia games the active players garner the most suspicion while the lurkers go by relatively easily, especially Day 1. This is because the more post, the more likely it is that you post something that other people will interpret as scummy. Now I won't say that Revenus and Hiraki aren't scum, but I will point out that our two most active players are conveniently our two major bandwagons of Day 1. As for my personal opinion, I haven't seem much from Hiraki that I would interpret as scummy. Especially when I look at how much he posted, I feel he's done an ok job so far. I'd rather look at the people with few content, especially those that go into 'prod dodge' mode with a lynch nearby, like Josh Lyman is doing now (gets prodded, says he's reading 'now', then doesn't post anyway).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4682331#p4682331\" class=\"postlink\">post 258</a>, the director wrote:</cite>So Revenus is data-dumping ISOs in an attempt to look like he is scum hunting in order to weasel out of his horrific opening play.<br><br>And Hikari isn't doing much to sway my read on him either.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm mainly talking about thoughts like this. You don't like what you see, but you're ignorant of what you don't see.<br><br>At this point my main suspicions lie with Josh Lyman and JacobSavage.<br>Josh Lyman has posted nothing worth of value today. He has only been here to vote Revenus and Hiraki (the leading wagons) with argumentation such as 'I'm voting you because you're scum' and 'I don't like this'. Then when we're getting close to a lynch, he disappears and only posts a prod acknowledgement.<br>I have stated earlier that I didn't like the fact that JacobSavage relied solely on meta to scumhunt. Since then, he has done next to nothing except join easy wagons (Navarre and Hiraki). Then, there's that terrible terrible 'this game has stalled' vote.<br><br>I feel comfortable voting either player. I'm going to vote Jacob because I feel Jacob's behaviour is more serious.
