Voting for no lynch for the day is also possible. If no one gains a majority during a day, there will be no lynch for the day, and night will begin.<br>\nRule 8: Days will last a maximum of 2 weeks, but can be shorter if a lynch or no lynch is reached before the deadline. Deadline extensions are possible, but unlikely. Nights will last 48 hours. If I do not receive a night action within that 48 hours, it will not count. <br>\nRule 9: If you die, you are allowed to make one 'bah' post that has no content in it, but after that no talking.<br>\nRule 10: If you are going to be away from the game for an extended period of time, please declare yourself <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">V/LA</div> in thread, and say how long you expect to be gone.<br>\nRule 11: If a player does not declare <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">V/LA</div> and they do not post for 48 hours, they will be prodded. They then have 24 hours to pick up their prod and start posting or they will be replaced out. If a person has been prodded twice and fails to post for 48 hours, instead of recieving another prod they will be replaced out.<br>\nRule 12: If you need to leave the game, please contact me via PM or say so in bold in the thread. It will be much appreciated over just flaking from the game.<br>\nRule 13: Play to your win condition.<br>\nRule 14: I reserve the right to change the rules at any time if I feel it is necessary.<br>\nRule 15: If you break any of the rules, it will be my decision whether you are warned, replaced, or modkilled.<br>\n<br>\nHere is a sample VT role PM:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Vanilla Townie:<br>\nAs a VT, you have no powers, only your voice and your vote to make it through this ordeal.

That knowledge affected her confidence in random voting him because she knew that the vote was fake.

I ask jil to explain her special treatment of hiplop in this post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jilynne1991 wrote:</cite>Oh, right, my FoS was a joke, ok, ummm, unFoS?<br>\n<br>\nLOL <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unFoS hiplop </div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI didn't ask you to unFoS.  I asked you tell me if it was serious or not.  <br>\n<br>\nIf it was joke, then why did you FoS instead of voting?  You had no problem joke voting Barry Allen, Demon Hybrid, or Heliman.  Is there some reason you gave hiplop the softer treatment?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd she ignores it completely, despite answering my earlier question about if the fos was serious for a second time.  <br>\n<br>\nI bring up my question again<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3127623#p3127623\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3127677#p3127677\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3128799#p3128799\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br>\n<br>\nAnd she continuously ignores it, despite answering a different question from me again:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>jilynne1991 wrote:</cite>Oh, crap, I'm so sorry, I don't know what's up with me, ok, so here it is:<br>\n<br>\nAfter going through hiplop's ISO it looks like he wants to appear like he is scumhunting with the least possible content.

It felt like you were trying to make it look like you actually made up reasoning.  Of course you could have just been clarifying that Heliman's reason was why you were voting, that's just what it felt like to me.  The main reason I quoted that post was to show that it was a wagon vote; you didn't spearhead the case.  <br>\n<br>\nHowever, your second (non-RVS) post is the one I had more issue with:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Barry Allen wrote:</cite>maybe it's a time zone issue but we are at L-2 and don't seem to see a defense.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't see why you would post this less than 4 hours since she was at L-2.

Giitah FoS's two people.  Hiplop FoS's giitah.  Quoted nintendoaddict just because it was in there.  Jilynne FoS's hiplop.  Get it?  It was a chain of FoS's.  One person FoS'd, so the next person FoS'd that person for whatever RVS reason, then the next person FoS'd that person for another RVS reason.  <br>\n<br>\nDid you even read the FoS in context or were you just looking at the ISO?  This isn't a case of softer treatment or whatever you said the case was, it's a case of the flow during RVS.  An FoS was more natural than a vote at this moment.  <br>\n<br>\nAs for the other post of hers you quoted - this is a more valid point, however the fact that it was answering a question rather than a spontaneously made up case on hiplop dampens the argument.  She may find hiplop scummy but not the scummiest player in the game, or simply not scummy enough to warrant a vote.  Not voting for anyone isn't always a scumtell, despite what those with more aggressive playstyles may think.<br>\n<br>\nApologies if I spoiled your big plan to get more reactions out of Jil but honestly she's been at L-2 before, we got a reaction from that, and 8 pages later you are still going after her?  I mean with that reasoning, seriously?  At the beginning of your explanation post I figured you had some huge scumtell on Jil that we had all missed but honestly this is not a good case.  Let's forget about it now shall we?<br>\n<br>\nI thought there was stuff worth analyzing past there but on second glance I don't really see anything significant so meh.

Actually, Ace posted very little content before going after me.  Most of Ace's posts were quick one-or-two liners after quotes of others, with little real contribution to the discussion.

You've backed off Bob and seem to be focusing on just me, but surely you have additional reads so let's hear them as well.<br>\n<br>\nOne last note...there seems to be a lot of attention given to jillyne's age.

I'm one of the oldest players on this site (as well as on the other sites where I play mafia), and do not believe that to be an advantage...in fact I've had my hat handed to me by players that age before, so I'm simply playing the round and taking each player seriously.

I'll add that info here, but will also note that while I was re-reading the thread for this post hiplop went V/LA.  I do want to hear from hiplop upon his return, but also feel it important to add my observations while I have my notes from the re-reading at hand.<br>\n<br>\nBefore I do that, though....   <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">UNVOTE Jil</div>  <br>\n<br>\nJil never did really defend herself, but it is obvious that continuing to press won't get us anywhere at this point.  Now, let's get back to hiplop, and why I do have an FoS toward him:<br>\n<br>\n1. After a couple of RVS votes, hiplop flipped to a vote on Bob for \"taking everything too seriously\" (which sounded to me as his first pressure vote...though later in response to DH, hiplop claims this was a joke-vote).  <br>\n2. Afterward, hiplop switched to a vote on DemonHybrid, later claiming he was \"the only one voting DH, I'm thinking for myself.\" (That was not true - hiplop was actually the third vote on DH, with all three votes still active at the time).  <br>\n3. Later, he returns to vote Bob, without explaining the vote at the time (although there had been some back and forth with bob prior to the revote).  <br>\n4. Later, hiplop states about bob, \"unfortunately you're town\" and votes giitah with the only case being \"somethings not sitting right with you\"<br>\n<br>\nThen came a lot of dancing around on the subject of what meta information is valid and what is not.  This started with a post where hiplop contradicted himself in the same post, telling bob \"meta won't cut it\" and then noting Jil's age as being something that could explain her play.  Hiplop was called out on that by other players, and wound up in a series of explanations involving \"psycho-graphic characteristics\" versus other meta information.  The explanations didn't make sense and frankly didn't ring true - it seemed more like being caught in a contradiction and trying to explain why you were OK in spite of your own words.<br>\n<br>\nOne other observation - early in the phase Heliman noted potentially \"purposeful\" typos on the part of hiplop.  I didn't think much of that at the time, as a lot of players post with loose spelling and grammar.  But, I did find it interesting that when getting fired up on DH, hiplop suddenly markedly improved in both grammar and spelling.  It wasn't perfect...but it was MUCH better.  Posts 114, 115 and 128 get increasingly better in terms of typing (again not perfect, but compare it to earlier posts).  Then, things start to go back to prior typing style for the most part.  That is a bit meta...and of course according to hiplop only psycho-graphic data is useful...but it is an interesting note.<br>\n<br>\nNow, does this all add up to scum?  It's not hard evidence, so I would like to hear more from hiplop upon his return.", "time": "Wed Jun 15, 2011 3:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I'm saying that in the context of this game, your decision to continue voting her without doing anything else is too easy, and contributes too little to town.  We may very well still lynch her today, but in the meantime you are accomplishing nothing.  You don't look like town who doesn't know the roles and is trying to figure things out.

{"number": 295, "id": "3137799", "user": "Scumhunter", "user_id": "15473", "content": "First, I apologize for not posting sooner. It has been 2-3 days since I've thought to myself hell, looks like this game has really picked up, time for me to jump in. Up until a couple months ago, I played online poker for a living. It was recently banned here in the U.S. so the gov't essentially laid me off -______-.  So yea, I just started a new job recently. What better place than the corporate world to use my talent at math and being good at lying to and reading people!!! Downside, I am office bitch for the foreseeable future and that I have far less interweb leisure time than I am used to. I woke up an hour early just to post in this game becuase I was too tired last night, but rest assuerd I am committed to this game and finding the scum. I generally am against the concept of V/LA because I think it is a weak excuse scum can use to get out of a lynch towards the deadline, but if I remain super busy I may opt to do something like that. Anyways, this game has my attention and now that I'm caught up it should be easier to stay involved even if for just 10 min spurts here and there.<br>\n<br>\nK. So to respond to the only suspicion on me other than my lurking:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\nFine. I'll be done with RVS. Next vote will be an actual suspicion or have a purpose at least. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Once I start getting involved in the game I often times end up vote-hopping quite a bit. It's not a scumtell from me though.</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nLoudly announcing what you are going to do before you do it is much more characteristic of a mafia mindset than a town one.  Town is secure in the sincerity of their actions, and for the most part just do things.  It is a very common tendency in scum players to reflexively start over-explaining themselves; it gives them an armored vehicle of logic with which they can justify their lies.  <br>\n<br>\nTo my eyes, the italicized section above is really saying:<br>\n<br>\n\"Let me tell you exactly what my play will look like, so that when I start actually posting I can defend myself against anything you might say about me.  If you accuse me of vote hopping I can say 'LOOK!  I already said I might vote hop, and that it's a town tell for me.'\"<br>\n<br>\nThis is filled with way too much nervous energy for town.  It's also CRAZY premature for him to be defending himself against something that not only has he not been attacked for, but that he hasn't even done yet. <br>\n<br>\nWe need to learn more about this guy.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI really don't believe in \"over-explaining\" oneself. Towns often fail because of a lack to communicate clearly even when they think they are being clear with their intentions. Just look at yourself and Heliman this game for example.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3037266#p3037266\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 6#p3037266</a><br>\n<br>\nThis was a recently town finished game of mine where my very first post was \"I'm looking forward to a town win.\" I was quickly wagoned to L-1 for that lulz. I have the tendency to be repetitive and obvious in my pov as town. I think that appearing town is actually a more important job for town than hunting scum. The universe disagrees with me. But it is a strong opinion of mine.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for reads:<br>\n<br>\n1. hiplop: Leaning town. Your posts seem sincere to me. I often share your pov that seriousness in RVS annoys the piss out of me, but really that could come from scum not wanting to begin the uphill battle of defending themselves and faking scumhunting all game. <br>\n<br>\n2. Pine: Null. The fosing people based on typos, etc. is weak scumhunting, but early on its an ok start. Will need to see more when he's back from semi-V/LA to get a better read.<br>\n<br>\n3. Deuxieme Octopus: I'd probably say town, but 2 total posts is a small sample size for any sort of read. I liked your point on Pine. Please post more, god I feel like such a hypocrite saying that. I felt Pine's posts were a little \"vacuous\" as you said and that they could, key word could be insincere.<br>\n<br>\n4. archaebob: Incredibly obv town. Lmfao, are/were people voting him? He has fosed just about everyone in the game. I suppose it's possible that he is a very good scum player trying to take charge from the beginning of the game...but I think it would be hard to fake the legitimacy of the scumhunting he is trying to do. I wouldn't call him overzealous town either has all his pressuring has been getting at something.<br>\n<br>\n5. jilynne1991: Null. There is no chance you are 13 years old nor a girl. If I were a betting man (which I am), I would wager a significant amount of money that you are both male and over the age of 18. Your vocabulary and attitude are not coming from a 13 year old girl. Plus what 13 year old has \"1991\" in their user name. It's incredibly obvious to me that your IRL \"identity\" is faked, I'd assume for game-related advantages of being perceived as a newb. I have no idea what that means about your alignment, I'm just saying your \"Newb 13 year old girl tactic\" isn't going to work on me this game.<br>\n<br>\n6. Barry Allen: Lean Scum. I don't like the way you took your vote off of jilynne. \"Obviously pressuring her isn't going to get us anywhere.\" What the hell is that? You hadn't REALLY pressured her whatsoever. All you really did was explain why you voted her and make 1 post that could be vaguely described as pressuring jilynne. The point of pressure is pressuring until you actually get something from it not giving up after a weak attempt. Also, you noticed early on about jilynne \"I don't see a defense, we are at L-2..\" I read your whole attitude as being lynch-focused so far as opposed to scumhunting focused.<br>\n<br>\n7. nintendoaddict1: Town. You really really are barking up the wrong tree though suspecting archaebob and hiplop. How anyone reads bob as scum is beyond me. I also don't think hiplop is all that scummy either. There are better people to go after Barry Allen,<br>\n<br>\n8. Heliman: Town. Jesus, townies really need to stop arguing with archaebob. Heliman, what it comes down to is you disagree with the way that bob pressures people and votes people. He has done the most to help town, so your vote is really really poor tbh. It is ok to have double standards and crap cases in the beginning because it elicits reactions. The reactions are so important. You get reactions from the player being voted, the way other players interact with that player and with the wagon itself. It is vital information even if the cases and logic are shit. Logic is just one part of the game good sir. Votes aren't always with the intent to lynch..<br>\n<br>\n9. ace5993: Lean Scum. I don't really understand your fos/unfos of Barry. I don't see anything in Barry's play to warrant such a change in opinion. Your fos on bob screams to me that you are scum scared of his influence this game. You said at the beginning of the day \"We don't need a wagon every single time someone does something even the slightest bit scummy.<br>\n\" and now you just said \"We wasted 10 pages on Jil, hopefully that won't happen with these wagons but having the wagons IS NECESSARY.\" Such a contrast in your opinions on the need for wagons/pressuring people makes me go O.o. It would help me if you explained exactly which \"quirks\" in Barry's playing style changed your opinion on him.: I  <br>\n<br>\n10. DemonHybrid: Town. I like how you called bob obv town, I was literally going down the list waiting for someone to point that out. I agree that Jil has contributed squat, but I'd much rather go after Barry/ace today.<br>\n<br>\n11. Spadille: Null. No posts yet.<br>\n<br>\n13. Giitah: Gut scum. I don't have anything condemning on you. I felt like your \"Ugh.\" reaction to me saying I was goign to lurk to page 10 and that you asking deuxieme not to lurk were faked attempts to look town. Town are usually more annoyed by my non-helpful attitude early on. Oh, and also, I don't really know where you stand in relation to who you think is scum or who you would prefer to vote at this point...?<br>\n<br>\nTown reads (strongest to weakest): archaebob, DH, nintendoaddict1, Heliman, hiplop, deuxieme octopus<br>\nNull reads: Pine, jilynne1991, Spadille<br>\nScum reads (strongest to weakest): ace5993, BarryAllen, Giitah<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote ace5993</div>", "time": "Fri Jun 17, 2011 2:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I do have a question and some comments, though...<br>\n<br>\nQuestion: You have a \"null\" read on Pine but you like Octupus's vote on Pine.  Why?<br>\n<br>\nComments: <br>\nYou may have a real point on Jil.  Your note of the \"1991\" in the name is interesting.  It's still somewhat meta, and since I have noted being handed my hat by younger players it doesn't change how I feel about Jil's affiliation.  Whether Jil is a 13 year old girl or a much older male has no bearing on affiliation.  btw, my removing my vote because the pressure wasn't working was a reference to the fact that Jil had gone all the way to L-2 and was down to only 2 votes (one of them mine) without ever having defended herself.  There was certainly interference from other players (including at least one player stating that they were purposely messing with the pressure on Jil), but the bottom line was that I had to realize my vote was not going to result in anything useful to the town at this time.  I have not quit suspecting Jil, I simply moved on to do other scumhunting since the players were obviously not of a mind to continue pressing Jil.<br>\n<br>\nAs for your stand on hiplop, I disagree.  I find hiplop's posting style somewhat suspicious, much in the way you suspect Jil of pretending to be 13.  Please go back and look at how hiplop's typos and grammar seemed to get much better when getting defensive/angry, then later went back to the looser grammar and spelling of earlier posts.  Again that's a bit meta, but I'm still waiting for hiplop to respond to my (and other's) earlier posts before making a judgment call there.<br>\n<br>\nI would like to hear more - like your answer to my question above.  Some of your observations leave a little room for a head-scratching response (such as declaring someone likely town who has barely posted, and liking that person's vote for a \"null\" read).

Let's start by thinking critically about the nature of the two sides who are competing against each other for victory.<br>\n<br>\nThe town far outnumbers the scum, but begins the game not knowing who their enemies are.  Usually the town has one or two PRs with them, but the large number of players makes these special roles relatively ineffective on their own.  Without strong scumhunting efforts during the day to help with aim, PR night actions will certainly be less efficient than the scum NK.  Therefore, the #1 priority of the town needs to be exposing the likely scum in the thread through votes, questions, pressure, and critical analysis. <br>\n<br>\nThere are two fundamental differences between the scum mindset and the town mindset:<br>\n<br>\n1) Objective - Scum are trying to mislynch town.  In the short term, they may bus a partner for strategic purposes, but ultimately the game is won by tricking the town into lynching town.  To do this, they have to make persuasive arguments that they know are false, and push through lynches that they are know are incorrect while appearing sincere.<br>\n<br>\n2) Information - Scum know who the other scum are.  This means they have to feign ignorance in order to blend in with the town.  <br>\n<br>\nALL scumtells come from this disparity in mindset.  A scumtell is a post which demonstrates that the scum lacks either the 1) objective or 2) access to information of town.  <br>\n<br>\nIt is important to note that there is nothing about being scum which makes you inherently less logical, less consistent, or less active.  However, scum (particularly newb scum) often does <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">tend</div> in that direction as a means towards their objective.  Uncreative and/or reckless scum will make bad cases to try and get mislynches, or will lurk to try and avoid posting as much.  But to use a logical inconsistency or lack of activity as a \"scum tell\", you have to show how, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">in this specific situation</div>, the behavior of the individual indicates that they are more likely to have a scum mindset than a town one.<br>\n<br>\nSo how does town win?  <br>\n<br>\nTown wins by taking advantage of this fundamental difference between themselves and the scum.  It is the goal of the town to set up an environment in which town players do one thing, and scum does another.  What sort of environment is that?  The answer, if you think about it, is obvious.  Town benefit from an environment in which scum has to fake the town 1) objective and 2) access to information as much as possible.  If they succeed in this, the scum will reveal themselves plainly in their consistent failures to do what most helps town, and forget what town does not know.<br>\n<br>\nFor town to create this environment, the following needs to be true:<br>\n<br>\n1) Town players must be able to recognize each other.  That means that if you are town, you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">must look town</div>.  This does <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> mean trying to \"appease\" people by giving them what they want to hear.  Anything you say that is fake or calculated will read as scummy to people.  It also does not mean that you should try and do \"what the town is doing\" or do lots of things that are considered \"town tells.\"  All attempts to \"seem\" town will look contrived, because they will be. <br>\n<br>\nWhat I mean by \"town must look town\" is that you must reveal what your role is simply by being truthful.  You aren't trying to \"look town\" as much as you are trying to share your true feelings with the town in a way that is helpful and productive.  This means you want to play honestly, openly, and amicably.  Give your honest reactions to things without channeling them through a million logical filters.  Logic is important, and you should check yourself to make sure you aren't making any stupid mistakes, but you don't want to completely lose the sincerity of gut reactions in your posts, as they will help town recognize you for what you are.  Scum fundamentally cannot replicate a gut reaction, because they are always in the position of knowing who is town and who is not, and therefore having to consciously choose opinions.  If everyone is being honest and open, the scum have to clumsily invent those reactions out of thin air, and thereby make themselves vulnerable to the sharp eyes of the town.<br>\n<br>\n2) The second, harder part, which often conflicts with the first, is that the town needs to force scum to post as much alignment revealing content as possible.  What kind of content is this?  Emotional reactions, gut reads, level of certainty, etc.  Anything that the scum cannot accurately replicate from with their inherently non-town mindset.  <br>\n<br>\nRemember that this does NOT involve logical consistency.  Scum LOVE logic, because it is objective, and works the same way for town as it does for scum.  The only time in which it makes sense to get into a logical debate with someone is when you think their <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">intentions</div> are false.  If someone is deliberately hurting the town, and they are justifying their actions with poor logic, then you can remove their excuse by dismantling their argument.  You then force them to either organically change their action (something scum cannot do), or to be stubborn past the point where they can pretend to have a town objective. <br>\n<br>\nNow lets talk about Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nAt the beginning of Day 1, the environment overwhelmingly favors scum.  Nobody knows anything about anyone, and there are too many players who haven't posted enough for the town to feel confident about who the other town are.  <br>\n<br>\nTherefore, I consider object 2 to be far more important in the early stages of the game.  Everyone should focus their effort on maximizing the information that town has.  The method that I have found and that you all have seen works well for me, but it does not necessarily involve looking like town, and not everyone's personality is suited to it.  A town full of archaebob's would not be ideal, and in games where another player is already playing the part of provocateur, I often mold myself a little to avoid getting in their way.  The main point here is that you pick a technique, and that you use it as efficiently as you can to make people tell you about themselves.<br>\n<br>\nThat has been the Day 1 of this game up till now.  Some players have been more successful than others, but for the most part, individuals have picked out other individuals and enticed content from them with votes and questioning.<br>\n<br>\nAfter 12 pages, we now have the scum in two categories: 1) lurkers, 2) players who have already committed themselves to an active post rate.<br>\n<br>\nWhat needs to happen now is twofold: <br>\n<br>\n1) We need to force these last lurkers out of hiding.  Town cannot win if one of them is sitting on a scum role, abut town also cannot win by indiscriminately policy lynching all them.  This means we need to make it clear to them that the game will not progress in a manner favorable to them without their content.  A focused bandwagon that comes together significantly BEFORE deadline is usually effective.<br>\n<br>\n2) We need to start looking at everyone and thinking about who among the more active posters could be scum.  Everybody, myself included, has a tendency to tunnel on their primary suspect, and only skim conversations between other players.  Now it the time to go back and reread the thread, thinking critically about each player and the conversations that have taken place.  As you begin to form your scumlist, you will observe how players react to these final bandwagons, and notice who is being strangely stubborn, or who is awkwardly changing their vote for no reason.<br>\n<br>\nLadies and gentlemen, it is now time to start looking town, and for everyone in the thread to cooperate in applying maximum pressure to these last few lurkers.  Town doesn't know who is leading the wagons.  Furthermore, town KNOWS that they are town.  Therefore, their response to the wagon will be laced with a million little subconscious elements that will make their reaction feel sincere.  Scum can't invent a gut reaction, and therefore have to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">consciously choose</div> how to react each time.  The latter will stick out like a sore thumb.<br>\n<br>\nIn the meantime, the scum who have already been active have to choose to either support or resist each lurker wagon.  If they suddenly become a lurker and abstain from voting, they will stick out.  If they resist the wagon, they have to justify themselves.  If they join the wagon, they will be helping town be more efficient with its Day 1 efforts, and may make other mistakes along the way.<br>\n<br>\nNow, every time I make a post like this, I invariably get the \"manipulative scumbob telling everyone what to do\" response, so let me quickly explain why I'm posting this:<br>\n<br>\n1) Reading this whole thing will royally fuck with the scum, especially if we actually follow the plan.  Even now as they are reading, their mind is racing as they try to figure out what the most natural-seeming response to this post is, and what they should do next.<br>\n<br>\n2) This post is the beginning of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">my</div> attempts to appear town.  I have made myself deliberately abrasive and enigmatic up till this point, which is something I always do because I think it generates a lot of information.  I recognize, however, that none of you can be sure of my alignment yet, and that many of you have questions about my actions today.  It is in my interest now to make you at ease with me, as I want your cooperation in wagoning these final lurkers and in choosing the lynch.  <br>\n<br>\nBelieve me, I am <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">extremely</div> aware that from your perspective, I could very well be scum who is doing all this as part of one giant ploy for town cred.  Once again, I don't expect you to trust me just yet.  However, I do expect you to recognize that everything I've said above is valid pro-town reasoning, and that it is in your interest to cooperate with it.  We need information from these last lurkers, and the best way to get it is for all of us to work together.  Scum may try to blend in, but they will be doing so under the focused scrutiny of the town.  Once we have all the information we need to move comfortably into Day 2, then we can spend the very last days before deadline arguing over who to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThe main point is that all of you people who are crossvoting and/or are the only person on your wagon need to make a compromise with each other to get shit done. <br>\n<br>\n If you have questions about anything I've done today, I will now answer them.<br>\n<br>\nAnd on that note, PLEASE vote Deuxiem Octopus with me.  I will be commenting on every player, including ace and barry after we have taken care of priorities, which is making sure that a lurker isn't sitting on a scum role.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> unvote vote Deuxiem Octopus</div>", "time": "Fri Jun 17, 2011 4:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

Respond to my actual argument.  It doesn't matter that you see one line from Deuxieme Octopus as a town tell. <br>\n<br>\nYou are trying to justify your refusal to vote for Deuxieme Octopus by asserting that there is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">no way</div> he could <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possibly</div> be scum because he said this: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Deuxieme Octopus wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Vote: Pine </div>.  This will sound like total buddying, but  I've read through the game thus far (sorry for the absence, was at Bonnaroo -- thought i'd have 3G but didn't) and I found that when you read Pine in iso like archaebob suggests, it definitely comes across as more than a bit vacuous and therefore, fishy.  Over 10 pages of posting, Pine drops in a quiet 9 that, with the exception of the \"big\" post where he unvote-votes bob, are generally obsessed with rolefishing.  His last 5 posts have all been like some sort of list of maxims or something, little one-sentence deals such as <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Generally, the only people that start the game looking for third party roles are scum themselves.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell that's enough for the Deuxieme.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Back to lurking.</div>  </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nwhich has \"no conceivable scum motivation\".<br>\n<br>\nI say bullshit for two reasons:<br>\n<br>\n1) He could easily be scum.  You don't have any where near enough information about this player to definitively rule out that one line as a wifom tactic, joke, or even a genuine newbie slip.  Your attitude and forcefulness strongly suggests that you know more about the roles than an uninformed town player would.<br>\n<br>\n2) Saying you think he's town is completely missing the point.  He isn't posting.  He needs to.  Even if he's town, his reads and insights are valuable, because if he gets killed, we can look to his gut reads as being genuine.  But more importantly than that, this wagon will give us more information about the other players in the game as they decide to support or resist it.  Unlike an individual vote on one player, large wagons can't be ignored.  If a player declines to comment on a five person bandwagon, it's conspicuous.  Scum have to stake out a position on each wagon in a way they never have to do with individual votes.  <br>\n<br>\nWhy are you resisting this plan, Demon Hybrid?

Later, he returns to vote Bob, without explaining the vote at the time (although there had been some back and forth with bob prior to the revote).<br>\n4.

However the reason for voting Giitah in the first place - \"Way overreacting to someone skimming RVS and misunderstanding\", still doesn't make sense when applied to bob.  I do think the vote on Giitah was an honest mistake - but it was a lazy scum mistake.  He saw Bob's \"reason\" for voting Giitah, and thought at a glance it was a serious overreaction.  I'm kind of floundering to make sense of the \"misunderstanding\" - it either didn't exist, or it was this post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>Ai ai, captain.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: nintendoaddict1</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: archaebob</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhich means the misunderstanding was that supposedly Giitah thought bob wanted a wagon... on himself?  <br>\n<br>\nThe other reason for the case - \"Jumping on typoes and misunderstandings is very scummy in my book\", also doesn't make sense when applied to either bob or Giitah in either context.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>Ai ai, captain.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: nintendoaddict1</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: archaebob</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI take it you disagree?  Oh are you just defending your buddy?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis post \"which came BEFORE bob's vote on Giitah\", completely negates any possibility that bob was overreacting.<br>\n<br>\nIt's somewhat obvious Pine DID NOT read the thread properly before he started his case on bob, as all three reasons he gave were simply not true.  The fact that he first messed up the names on the posts only further reinforces this.  This is lazy scum trying to look town by posting some sort of a case.  Moving on:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>@archaebob: The only third party roles permitted in Normal games are Serial Killers.

I'm not sure whether it's rolefishing, scum hunting the SK, or what. But it doesn't sit right with me.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOnce again, lazy scum.  Found someone mentioning roles and decided to base a case around it because rolefishing's possible the easiest thing to base a case around.  AGAIN messed up the names, which isn't a scumtell in itself, but it does further the impression that Pine isn't really reading the thread at all.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Giitah gets a token few Townpoints for calmly and rationally responding to my unwarranted accusation.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTranslation: \"Let's make sure Giitah thinks I'm town.\"  Also note that it's possible that Pine's case was originally meant to be on Giitah since it doesn't make a shred of sense either way, and he just changed it to bob because bob pointed out that the original case didn't make sense.  I don't think this is true but it's an outside chance.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Holy crap, I really am just batting 1000 in this game. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS: Heliman</div> for what I said in 127.

None of them make sense.  HOWEVER, it makes me wonder if the rolefishing case you posted on bob was only posted because you thought it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> bob.

I don't really understand your fos/unfos of Barry. I don't see anything in Barry's play to warrant such a change in opinion.

You said at the beginning of the day \"We don't need a wagon every single time someone does something even the slightest bit scummy.<br>\n\" and now you just said \"We wasted 10 pages on Jil, hopefully that won't happen with these wagons but having the wagons IS NECESSARY.\" Such a contrast in your opinions on the need for wagons/pressuring people makes me go O.o.

If someone does something I consider a minor scumtell I don't feel the need to create a wagon on them, I simply bring up the post I had issue with and go from there.  However I like wagons based on lurking/active lurking because then we force the (active) lurkers to post content.  I did support the Jil wagon initially, based on the fact that she needed to get out of RVS since she hadn't posted content, I just don't like that we wasted 10 pages on it when all we really needed was to get her posting content.  After about 3 pages or so it should have been obvious that any more pressuring was going to be fruitless.<br>\n<br>\nAs for BarryAllen it's... difficult to put into words.  Firstly his apparent misunderstanding/complete denial of the points I made on him looked more like obstinate town than scum.

I wouldn't have taken an RVS accusation remotely seriously no matter how intent the accuser seemed to be with it. However, Nintendo64 took the time to calmly and rationally answer archaebob's questions. In general that seems pro-town, but he it much to serious about it.

Labeling a few of them does not make every other vote a serious one.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes, yes they are. Labeling them is strange especially if you already accept the idea that all early votes will be RVS votes.

His reasoning and style of play is pretty offbeat and I can't really get an accurate read of him. I'll probably have to read his history to better understand but I think he might just be noob spelled all over; even so, I'll research what I can to glean something of his alignment.<br>\nWhile it seems like he wants to help, he has horrible reasoning and doesn't seem to have a great grasp of the game theory. No accurate read, really. He occassionally helps out in the questioning but just seems to just as often just get in the way.<br>\nLittle other notes I can pick up is: he has horrible typing (meta) that improves when he defends/attacks well (could be a useful note to eyeball).<br>\nAs of late, he reads pretty scummy giving me the impression of wanting to lynch immediately in post #341, where he stated <br>\n\"atm im fine with lynching;<br>\nBarry<br>\nDK<br>\nGrallie\". <br>\nSee this as OMGUS from me, but the fact that he said it in that way looks kinda scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Foilist</div><br>\nNo accurate read as of yet. Not enough content.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">archaebob</div><br>\nStrong town read. Like ace(?) mentioned earlier, there is a chance he could be playing a mindscrew WIFOM game with us and that he's actually a Mafia, but it's looking pretty low.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">jilynne1991</div><br>\nFucking terrible town player or a really noobie/good at lurking scum.<br>\nShe strikes me as pretty scummy in it that she's really nervous, as seen in really trying to explain herself and why she was lurking and why nothing had happened in post 101; she gives us a really weak sort of response, her only really useful response in post 187; but that's it for content from Jily. Otherwise she has struck me as inattentive, lacking in any dedication and very nervous trying to keep her cool. She needs to post like HELL or be replaced.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Barry Allen</div><br>\nPersonally, I don't have an accurate enough read of him but I'm getting a relatively townie vibe from him overall. He argued with Hiplop throughout page 14 (posts 325 to around 350), where he gave me a pretty passive and understanding tone rather than an offensive mafia. He didn't vote Hiplop until hiplop demonstrated some pretty funky logic. This deserves a read-over if he shows anymore mafia behavior but overall despite not giving off a strong townie vibe he DID give it off when he was arguing with Hiplop here. I'll leave him as a townie read leaning towards the null side.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NintendoAddict</div><br>\nHe reads as a pretty noob town to me. He argues with Archaebob on the game theory a little bit but in general seems to grasp it enough to read decently. He posts some pretty faulty logic at times, in general his ability to reason appears to be somewhat limited to me, which COULD be read as a potential scumtell but it just reads noob to me.

His reasoning and style of play is pretty offbeat and I can't really get an accurate read of him. I'll probably have to read his history to better understand but I think he might just be noob spelled all over; even so, I'll research what I can to glean something of his alignment.<br>\nWhile it seems like he wants to help, he has horrible reasoning and doesn't seem to have a great grasp of the game theory. No accurate read, really. He occassionally helps out in the questioning but just seems to just as often just get in the way.<br>\nLittle other notes I can pick up is: he has horrible typing (meta) that improves when he defends/attacks well (could be a useful note to eyeball).<br>\nAs of late, he reads pretty scummy giving me the impression of wanting to lynch immediately in post #341, where he stated <br>\n\"atm im fine with lynching;<br>\nBarry<br>\nDK<br>\nGrallie\". <br>\nSee this as OMGUS from me, but the fact that he said it in that way looks kinda scummy to me.<br>\n</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Foilist</div><br>\nNo accurate read as of yet.

Otherwise she has struck me as inattentive, lacking in any dedication and very nervous trying to keep her cool. She needs to post like HELL or be replaced.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Barry Allen</div><br>\nPersonally, I don't have an accurate enough read of him but I'm getting a relatively townie vibe from him overall. He argued with Hiplop throughout page 14 (posts 325 to around 350), where he gave me a pretty passive and understanding tone rather than an offensive mafia. He didn't vote Hiplop until hiplop demonstrated some pretty funky logic. This deserves a read-over if he shows anymore mafia behavior but overall despite not giving off a strong townie vibe he DID give it off when he was arguing with Hiplop here. I'll leave him as a townie read leaning towards the null side.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NintendoAddict</div><br>\nHe reads as a pretty noob town to me. He argues with Archaebob on the game theory a little bit but in general seems to grasp it enough to read decently. He posts some pretty faulty logic at times, in general his ability to reason appears to be somewhat limited to me, which COULD be read as a potential scumtell but it just reads noob to me. We can see some bad reasoning and also an example of his somewhat lacking game theory understanding in posts 239 and 250.<br>\nAs for the cases against him, I've read them (hopefully) though I've forgot what they're about and he still seems newb town to me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Heliman</div><br>\nHe passes off to me as scummy because he's far too vocal.

She had only been at L-2 for a few hours (hence my time zone reference), but this had been going on for much longer with her active posting...but no defense.

He's basically protecting himself from being lynched on a technicality while avoiding posting reads, and occasionally calling people wrong or scummy. Personally I get a way bigger gut scum read from Pine than I do from Jillynne.<br>\n<br>\nYes it is possible for scum to active lurk despite massive wagons and get away with it. Furcolow did that in a game I played with him and it was the most irritating thing I've ever seen. That doesn't mean that Jillynne is active lurking, nor does it mean that she is scum. Looking over her play she's pretty much just a lurker, not an active lurker. She avoids posting reads, which is actually counter productive to active lurking. The whole point of active lurking is to avoid attention, where as never posting reads at all drags attention to you. Real active lurkers post vague or unreasoned reads that they can stand by or change later. Jillynne isn't doing that. Pine is. <br>\n<br>\nIf nothing else, recognize that you are not helping the town with your vote. You aren't discussing other players, you are not offering any insight on any issue, you are simply defending your Jillynne vote to the death. The likelihood is that we will not lynch Jillynne today.

It started with <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3124211#p3124211\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, in which DH defends my RVS actions against hiplop and votes him for having &#8220;the sketchiest vote of everyone.&#8221;  Now, this first post isn&#8217;t particularly scummy on its own, but it IS weird, for two reasons:<br>\n<br>\n1) He acts as if Hiplop&#8217;s vote on me is serious, which it clearly isn&#8217;t. <br>\n2) He defends my play, which is clearly not necessary.  <br>\n<br>\nThe first thing I ask of everyone is to reread the first three pages of this game in its entirety, to get an intuitive feel for how everything looked then.  Posts were short then, so it should take very little time.  The important thing is to try and imagine that you are seeing it for the first time.  As we go through the rest of his play, imagine that you are DemonHybrid, and that you are town.  In doing so, try to build an image of what your personality is, how you see things, and what your motivation is for each post.<br>\n<br>\nIn post 54, I vote jilynne without explaining myself at all.  Immediately after, nintendo <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125494#p31254940\" class=\"postlink\">FoSes</a> me because he doesn&#8217;t like the fact that I&#8217;m sheeping Barry Allen.  Now look at DH&#8217;s response to this in post 56:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS: Everyone who is against bob for not realizing how town the guy is</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTry and erase from your memory the majority of this game, and just look at the first few pages.  It&#8217;s hard for me to picture why I, as Demon Hybrid, would feel the need to write this.  Let&#8217;s assume for a moment that I, a town player, have seen players like archaebob before.  In my experience, players that do what he is doing are usually town, and their play is very helpful.   Therefore, I am annoyed at nintendoaddict for accusing him of being a sheep&#8230;and I&#8217;m going to make sure the rest of the town <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">stops suspecting archaebob</div>(because we CAN'T have that) by joke FoSing them.<br>\n<br>\nDoes that feel like town to you?  It really doesn't to me.<br>\n<br>\nTown doesn&#8217;t know the roles, and most of you were very wary of me, at least in the beginning.  How is it that DH was so confident that he felt comfortable not only assuming I was town, but also proactively derailing any suspicions of me as soon as people posted them?  This was page <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">3</div> people.  Town has no reason to buddy that hard.<br>\n<br>\nAnd DH was totally serious about defending me too, as evidenced in his next post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> unvote vote jilynne1991</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNintendo/hiplop, do you really think this post has scum motivation? If so, why?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, there's valid suspicion against jilynne1991. Nintendo's FoS may have just been a townie mistake; hiplop is definitely scum, but jilynne1991 is worth looking into.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis whole post bespeaks of someone whose mind is racing to uncover the reasons for everything archaebob does and appear perceptive and towny by sharing them with everyone.  Let's take a look:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite>Nintendo&#8217;s FoS may have just been a townie mistake;</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\num, okay&#8230;what are you saying here exactly?  I guess this is a description of my thought process, and why I moved my vote off of nintendo?  Why are you even sharing speculations like this?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite>hiplop is definitely scum, but jilynne1991 is worth looking into.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI doubt he means the bit about hiplop seriously at this stage, but either way, it feels really weird.  DH is in the process of defending me, and he seems to be pretty serious about it.  So, saying that hiplop is &#8220;definitely scum&#8221; is a really weird assertion to insert into the middle of that sentence, isn&#8217;t it?  Read the whole post again, in its entirety.  In fact, it feels to me like he&#8217;s trying to explain ahead of time why he isn&#8217;t himself moving his vote over to jilynne.<br>\n<br>\n\"I want everyone to know that I agree with archaebob and think he's town, but BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME OF CONTRADICTING MYSELF, I'm going to keep my vote where it is anyways because hiplop is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">definitely</div> scum.  That's noNOT to say I don't agree with archaebob though!  Honest!  I think hiplop is scum, but I can think that and STILL think that archaebob is doing the right thing by looking into jilynne!  Do you guys all understand what I'm saying????  Good, I'm glad you all think I'm town.\"<br>\n<br>\nThis is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">way too much explanation and qualification to becoming from town at this point in the game.</div>  Why is he posting like this?  He's not even being attacked!  <br>\n<br>\nMeh, whatever the hell it is, it&#8217;s nervous and awkward, and doesn&#8217;t sit with me at all.  <br>\nThink about it.  You are DemonHybrid.  Why are you choosing to defend archaebob, and come up with these super specific hypothetical explanations of his thought process?  Aren&#8217;t you at all curious about what this guy is doing, and if his intentions are true?  Why do you want to be his friend so badly?<br>\n<br>\nThis is all gut, but I really think he would have been more rebellious and even-handed with me if he were town.  It's not adding up.<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, even if you find nothing damning yet, we're getting a very strange and very specific image of who he would have to be if he were town.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125575#p3125575\" class=\"postlink\">Next post</a>, DemonHybrid outs my pressure vote.  Why?<br>\n<br>\nWhy is his top agenda explaining everything that I&#8217;m doing to the town?  If he was town, and he thought my vote was a pressure vote, he&#8217;d be curious to see what came of it, not give away the answer.  From my experience, it&#8217;s scum who is most interested in identifying pressure votes, and this looks to me like another part of his subconscious effort to be ultra-logical, and to neutralize my play.  Why would a town player analyze my pressure vote like that to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">make sure</div> nobody suspected me unfairly?  It doesn&#8217;t add up.<br>\n<br>\nHe <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125654#p3125654\" class=\"postlink\">keeps doing it</a>, too.  I don&#8217;t understand how he&#8217;s so confident in his opinion of what I&#8217;m doing!  And it&#8217;s not just that he seems to somehow know for a fact that I&#8217;m town...he feels completely comfortable <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">saying</div> it too!  Put yourself in his shoes.  If you were town, wouldn&#8217;t you feel awkward explaining someone else&#8217;s play this proactively in the first few pages of the game?  What could his motivation be for doing it?  And I haven&#8217;t even gotten into the biggest problem here, which is that if he genuinely understands that my vote is a pressure vote, w<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">hy is he doing everything in his power to make it worthless</div>?  If he&#8217;s familiar with players like me, he also knows that we don&#8217;t need his help defending ourselves.<br>\n<br>\nThis isn't town thinking, period.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite>Wow.

Nothing has happened yet, so how is his hiplop vote \"decaying\"?  He seems to be serious here about jilynne being &#8220;very likely scum&#8221;, and I just don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s possible.  If he was legit town joining my wagon to help me pressure jil...it would look different, wouldn't it?  And even if we accept that he believes jil is \"still very likely scum\", the phrasing of it as a justification for his belated vote switch is weaksauce and reminds me on every level of how I think about things when I'm scum.  It&#8217;s just too <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">nervous</div>.  The whole thing.  And why the mention of Heliman and Barry Allen at the end?  <br>\n<br>\n\"Just want to make sure no one accuses me of sheeping them, which they totally can't do if I say their names.\" <br>\n<br>\nRead the quote again in its entirety.

He's glib, sometimes clever, and an intelligent and direct poster.<br>\n<br>\n2) Over explaining, nervous, buddying scumbag - You guys see it right?  This side of him always comes out in the same moments, which is when he's fabricating one of the fundamentally town behaviors, such as changing your mind about who to vote, or suspecting someone for reasons that aren't all completely logical.  <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3127385#p3127385\" class=\"postlink\">More weirdness.</a>  He&#8217;s now defending his buddying of me to hiplop and telling him to &#8220;be more serious.&#8221;  This seems to suggest that he&#8217;s not all that confident in his scum read of hiplop.  I assumed that his whole &#8220;hiplop is definitely scum&#8221; thing was a deliberate exaggeration, similar to what I was doing.  That would make sense, right?  But then DemonHybrid posts this sequence of posts:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote<br>\n<br>\nvote archaebob</div>for taking everything too seriously</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis was a joke vote?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote<br>\n<br>\nvote archaebob</div>for taking everything too seriously</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis was a joke vote?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nyea</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOkay, so again, the fact that you're taking nothing seriously shows a lack of scumhunting if that is true (as well as the fact that you completely went pages misleading people without saying anything).

It&#8217;s obvious what you are doing.  &#8220;Let me bring up the flaw so I can show everyone that I noticed it myself and nobody can attack me.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n4) He really doesn&#8217;t deserve it.

Yes, at the time (and because he didn't respond at all), I thought it was a serious vote, and you're really taking a high and mighty after-the-fact attitude if you say that it \"cleary\" wasn't.<br>\n<br>\n2. I defended your play because you were being attacked for what I thought was no reason; for scumhunting and pressuring people at the time, and having that downplayed.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Try and erase from your memory the majority of this game, and just look at the first few pages. It&#8217;s hard for me to picture why I, as Demon Hybrid, would feel the need to write this. Let&#8217;s assume for a moment that I, a town player, have seen players like archaebob before. In my experience, players that do what he is doing are usually town, and their play is very helpful. Therefore, I am annoyed at nintendoaddict for accusing him of being a sheep&#8230;and I&#8217;m going to make sure the rest of the town stops suspecting archaebob(because we CAN'T have that) by joke FoSing them.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI never said it was a joke FoS. I didn't like the fact that everyone was putting down the fact that you were trying to early game scumhunt. You know, something that wins games. So I was supporting you in an effort to try to solidify your reads and have some people take you seriously. Early game pressuring like that, in my experience, has been very indicative of town.<br>\n<br>\nYou assume that I KNOW what the roles are, when I just have very solid reads. You say that I'm a smart player, but treat me like a stupid one. You realize how very little scum motivation was behind an action like that? How scum usually like to take it easy early game in order not to create a base of suspicion on them?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This whole post bespeaks of someone whose mind is racing to uncover the reasons for everything archaebob does and appear perceptive and towny by sharing them with everyone.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo....it sounds like someone who is really trying to get a grasp on why people are seeing scum motivation behind switching onto an early game bandwagon.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I doubt he means the bit about hiplop seriously at this stage, but either way, it feels really weird. DH is in the process of defending me, and he seems to be pretty serious about it. So, saying that hiplop is &#8220;definitely scum&#8221; is a really weird assertion to insert into the middle of that sentence, isn&#8217;t it? Read the whole post again, in its entirety. In fact, it feels to me like he&#8217;s trying to explain ahead of time why he isn&#8217;t himself moving his vote over to jilynne.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd that was when I thought that hiplop's vote on you was serious. Something that he failed to disprove, or even attempt to, in which I thought he was avoiding. He took entirely too long in getting back to me with that and it seemed like a silent confession.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Meh, whatever the hell it is, it&#8217;s nervous and awkward, and doesn&#8217;t sit with me at all. <br>\nThink about it. You are DemonHybrid. Why are you choosing to defend archaebob, and come up with these super specific hypothetical explanations of his thought process? Aren&#8217;t you at all curious about what this guy is doing, and if his intentions are true? Why do you want to be his friend so badly?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI feel your early game actions are town-motivated, and therefore, I felt that you are town. Don't you think pooling together reads from two people who are town can do some damage against scum, especially in the early game, when that shit <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">counts</div>? Scum have yet to have a clear base of evidence in order to cloud their intentions, and you want to sit there and dick around accusing everyone in the game and not double-teaming with town reads in order to take that away from them, basically, is what you're saying. Whether or not you are scum would come later. Early game is far too valuable to do that sort of shit though. Read current meta. You'll find that a LOT of players do that, and a LOT of those players win games as town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This whole response is trying too hard.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOr, it's a response saying \"So, you don't want me to pressure people?

We have two pretty much confirmed townies D1.  Scum have two confirmed PRs (I consider mason a PR until there's only one left).<br>\n<br>\n2. DH is scum and outs his \"partner\".  We still have two (what appear to be) pretty much confirmed townies D1.  Town gets suspicious when both are alive by D3 and lynches one - we then have a confirmed scum in his \"partner\".<br>\n<br>\n3. DH is town and doesn't out his partner.  If there's no CC we still have a confirmed townie, same as option 1.  After DH dies, scum either CC the eventual mason claim or they don't.  But look at it this way: we have two people claiming to be DH's partner, in the worst case scenario, we have one confirmed scum and a dead townie (essentially VT at this point).  Good trade-off  If no-one CCs the mason claim there's no problem.<br>\n<br>\n4. DH is scum and doesn't out his partner.

Scum fakeclaiming mason are pretty much never going to out their \"partner\" for obvious reasons, but then it will be fairly obvious that they were lying about their claim once they survive the night a couple times.  This makes mason one of the worst claims for scum D1, so the chance of DH being scum is tiny at this point.  <br>\n<br>\nFor now, it is best to assume DH is town, which means he should NOT out his partner.  <br>\n<br>\nThe only way scum can get away with fakeclaiming mason is for town to really not know how to handle the claim -preautionary measures that must be taken:<br>\n<br>\n1.

Moving the thread to L-1 sets us up for a \"quickhammer\" that ends all debate, all discussion, and all scumhunting for the phase.  If we did happen to be wrong, it would be all to easy for a scum to \"accidentally\" trip us over to a ML and then spend the night phase laughing their socks off at us.  That's why, in past rounds I've played here, it is not a good idea to go to L-1 while still waiting for a defense.<br>\n<br>\n2. I was ready to go to a vote on Pine tonight when I left this morning if there were no good defense.  I did not, however, anticipate that we would be at L-2 when I returned to thread.  <br>\n<br>\n3. Pine doesn't appear to be <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">that</div> limited in access, posting rather frequently in the thread while claiming to be on V/LA.

As for a quick summary for my reasons for suspecting hiplop:<br>\n1.\tFlip-flopping with votes and FoS.  Going from what he later claimed was a &#8220;joke&#8221; vote for Bob to a claimed &#8220;only&#8221; vote on DH, then back to a &#8220;serious&#8221; vote on Bob without an explanation (no explanation for the second bob vote was given until I called hiplop out for this).<br>\n2.\tHiplop out-and-out lied regarding his vote on DH, claiming he had been the only vote on DH at the time, &#8220;proving&#8221; he was &#8220;thinking for himself&#8221;.  When I pointed out that there were actually two votes already on DH when he voted, he changed his story to say he was the only &#8220;serious&#8221; vote on DH.  This was a false claim intended to give him credibility with the rest of the players.<br>\n3.\tOMGUS&#8217;ing me when I called him out, accusing me of &#8220;clinging to a wagon&#8221; when I had not even voted him at that time.  When I pointed that out, hiplop then claimed he &#8220;thought&#8221; I was voting for him, which makes that even more OMGUS.<br>\nAs for the changes in posting style at various times in the thread, I consider it to be of interest, but not evidence in and of itself.  I do think it is proof that hiplop is playing with us, changing styles to act more LOL when not getting heat and turning quite efficient and eloquent when FoS&#8217;d.   That&#8217;s all I have at this point, as it is just D1.  Let me know if you have more questions.  For right now, I&#8217;m going to bed as it is near 11:30 p.m. my time.

Ace is, at this point in my read, one of my strongest town reads and the fact that he feels the need to throw dirt a little on Ace before responding to him doesn't sit well with me at all. Not sure why I didn't catch this the other day.<br>\n<br>\nHiplop's 231 completely fails to comment on ace/barry's back and forth. Not scummy on its own, but worth noting if it becomes a pattern.<br>\n<br>\nNintendo's 239: I could go on my \"meta doesn't usually mean much\" rant, but suffice to say that Pine posted more as town in a game I played with him recently.<br>\n<br>\nNintendo's 246: Under pressure from Bob, he unvotes him without putting his vote somewhere else. On page 10. Not because he claims he doesn't think Bob is scummy any more, but because he admits his vote isn't doing anything. W. T. F. Beyond useless. Mega scummy.<br>\n<br>\nGiitah 252: comments on how pressuring Jil may have revealed her alignment without committing to what <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">he</div> thinks it is. Scummy!<br>\n<br>\nHeliman's 258 seems misguided but town.<br>\n<br>\nNot really feeling Barry's case on Hiplop [259]. Seems like he's on his case for playstyle more than anything else. More scumminess from Barry, though, as he spends all that space on a Hiplop case and then backs out with a non-commital \"is he scum? i dano lol\" at the end. Looks like Barry is dipping his pinky finger in the waters trying to determine if the water's the right temperature for a Hiplop soup.<br>\n<br>\nHeliman's 267 looks distinctly of OMGUS.<br>\n<br>\nBob's 269 catches on to the same tidbit I did. Good man.<br>\n<br>\nBarry's 273 is noted. I haven't really been reading much of the current pages yet, but I'm aware Pine is the lead wagon and that he's been on V/LA. Interested to see if Barry was consistent with his \"I don't want to vote someone on V/LA before they post a defense\" statement.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: from the top of page 12 to the bottom of 14</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">DH 278, 280, 281 - I can see where DH is coming from on the Jil thing (though I still think she was just an easy wagon) but I can't see why he would fail to comment on or have reads about anything else going on in the game. Scummy.<br>\n<br>\nBarry 292 - he seems to like to comment on people and say things to the effect of finding them voteworthy without actually placing a vote. Why has this guy not gotten more attention?<br>\n<br>\nScumhunter 295 - Fluff. Self-meta. (might just be a playstyle thing, but does he really need to go on about it so long?) Reads are informative, at least, though he is awfully non-commital regarding quite a few of them. (\"Well, I think they're this, but then again they could be that...\") Puts both barry and ace as \"leaning scum\" but votes ace. Possible barry-buddy?<br>\n<br>\nNintendo 297 - catches Scumhunter's non-commital posting re: Bob. +townpoints.<br>\n<br>\nBarry 299 - Like his question at scumhunter regarding pine, suspicious of his relative lack of useful comments on Scumhunter's reads.<br>\n<br>\nScumhunter 300/301 - Scumhunter and Barry seem very willing to talk openly with or about each other. Throws out my Scumhunter/Barry team theory a little. Plus, 301 gives me some townvibes. <br>\n<br>\nSH 305 - \"As for my reads list. I want to change it a little. I'm going to back off both my Barry scum read and my hiplop town read a bit\" -- okay, sure, so he talked with Barry and found him to be slightly townier. I can see that, even if I don't agree with it. But why is hiplop suddenly scummier when he didn't post, unless he's sheeping Barry's logic (who he previously thought was most scummy behind Ace)? SUSPICIOUS.<br>\n<br>\nBarry's response to hiplop [335] cements my feelings that this is scum-on-town.<br>\n<br>\nAce 339 - Finally, that Pine case I knew was coming. He raises some good points about Pine that I hadn't previously noticed but, while I'm thinking about him, I think the most damning thing is that he claims he's able to read the thread and he's obviously able to post but he doesn't spend the time to even try to give us his reads. Contrary to what some people seem to think, quote walls are absolutely not necessary for giving us reads. Defending oneself, maybe, but why can't he post reads other than continuing to think Bob is scum?<br>\n<br>\nBarry 340 - He comes in to respond to hiplop and COMPLETELY IGNORES ace's case on Pine. Afraid of having to fake a reaction? I think so. And regarding his point 1 - if it's not scummy, WHY DOES HE KEEP BRINGING IT UP AND PADDING HIS CASE WITH IT? and \"I don't know if you're scum or not\" sounds like he has to remind himself that he's not supposed to know. That's more of a gut-thing, though.<br>\n<br>\nBarry 346 - Suddenly, the typo thing is scummy enough for a vote, despite him saying it was null in 340!

I have waited as long as I could to say what I have to say now, hoping that my defense would make a difference.  Unfortunately, we are where we are, and that means I have to tell the rest of the story:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I am the Tracker.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAs for why I haven't claimed before now?  It should be obvious that I would not want to out my role as Tracker.  Worse yet, this means we now have two role claims, which is bad for the town no matter what.  But, the wagon is high enough on me, and we have so little time to debate, that I do not believe I have an alternative.  <br>\n<br>\nI have my doubts about Pine's claim, as it came after days of promising a defense that never came. Further, the claim came with a promise of further \"observations\" that also has never been posted.  That just doesn't seem right, and my gut says that Pine is not telling the truth. But, I don't know with certainty at this point whether he is a lying scum or just a poor player who isn't paying attention to the game.  As for me, I had hoped my defense against what should be an obvious counterwagon would be enough to keep me from having to reveal my role. But, we are where we are, and I can only hope that I either survive today and get protection from any doc that may be in the setup tonight, or that the town holds accountable the people who generated this counterwagon if I'm lynched.", "time": "Sat Jun 25, 2011 1:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I was V/LA this past weekend and need some time to really think about what has happened. I will have strong opinions once I catch up. I don't want to throw around any accusations til I get a chance to really review the last 5 pages or so closer, but my inital reads are I believe Barry is town, hiplop's initial comment at the beginning of d2 confused me.<br>\n<br>\n2. My evenhandedness is because I'm not sure if I believe it or not. I do need to read nintendo more. Initially I believe it although it really would be a very beneficial fake claim for scum. <br>\n<br>\n3. Yes I will likely be voting hiplop. Do you not read his assumption as \"wtf?\" I can't imagine thinkign that from town perspective and why the hell would a vig shoot a mason claim.<br>\n<br>\n4. I feel very strongly that Barry should out his report. Close to 95% sure he should unless someone can convince me otherwise. Let's look at the scenarios:<br>\n-Barry is town, his report is on scum rolecop or other visiting role. Scum is forced to fake claim. If they are lynched later in the game and flip scum roleblocker or scum role cop, that makes the person they visited clear.<br>\n-Barry is scum tracker, his report is fake and on a scum buddy. Him outing report harms town in no way really since that makes him a lying scumwad anyways<br>\n-Barry is scum tracker, and his report is on town powerrole. Barry knows a town powerrole already and this doesn't hurt us<br>\n-Barry is town and his report is on town power role. I guess this might hurt us if he is outing specifically doc in a game with no mafia roleblocker.<br>\n<br>\nI'm actually an advocate of a mass claim. I think mass claiming is one of the most underutilized town weapons in the game. We have a lot of pr claims. Its quite possible at least one of them is fake.

He isn't lying about the fact that someone targeted me</div>, it's just definitely not scum, because he's a scum tracker himself. <br>\n<br>\nThat's why he's confirmed scum. There's no way he's faking this result, and that means he can't possibly be town. We do not have a roleblocker, a tracker, a sensor, a doctor, AND a mason team. Get the hell out of here.<br>\n<br>\nWhat is much more likely is that we have a roleblocker, a sensor, a doctor, and a mason team, and that scum has a tracker to counterbalance that. Even that is a little unbalanced towards town, as you can see. It's obvious that Barry tracked whoever tried to protect me, and revealed his result today in a townish seeming way in order to keep playing to his fakeclaim. If you think about it, there's really no scenario that makes sense in which he isn't a scum tracker. Even if you don't believe the sensor claim, there is no way that Barry Allen is a town tracker.If you want to keep pretending to be town, you need to NOT reveal who tracked me today. I have no doubt you will find some excuse though.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis smells like a bus,  Barry Allen could have easily &#8220;Tracked&#8221; the mafia. He only knows who that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">one</div> person visited. <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 3) Barry Allen is a scum tracker - In this event, he probably tracked the doctor or something along those lines. He should NOT reveal who he tracked.</div></blockquote><br>\nThen the only people who know who the lone power role is, would be scum. How is that helpful to the town in any way? You&#8217;re trying way too hard to hide this. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say that Barry should tell who it is, but your logic is very one sided towards the mafia. If he is scum, they already know the PR, but we don&#8217;t. That gives scum an advantage, and since that is what you think he is, why are you opposing him revealing his result? Sounds like you're wanting to keep that edge.<br>\n<br>\nHow do you know, that he isn't lying? <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Barry Allen</span><br>\n<br>\nRead list (from town -&gt; Scum)<br>\nHiplop<br>\nAce<br>\nFoilist<br>\nScumhunter<br>\nNintendo<br>\nHeliman <br>\nBob<br>\nValern<br>\nGiitah<br>\nLittle Grey<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBarry Allen<br>\n<br>\nAs you can see, bob isn't a huge sus of mine, but no one else was willing to consider it, there is a high chance hes scum, but he feels too townie to be scum i guess.<br>\n<br>\nAnyone else have any thoughts? i didnt go far back for quotes as i am busy, bu if you have anything to add, feel free to share<br>\n<br>\nHm, if there is a vig.

Just look at how adamant Bob was that BA absolutely <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">had</div> to be a tracker, followed by continued mentions that the person who targeted him was probably a doctor.  I don't buy that.  It's rather easy for BA as a mafia goon to fakeclaim tracker and a result this early, because no one is expecting a mass claim on day 2.<br>\n<br>\nNow let's assuming BA is a tracker and isn't lying - we clearly don't have a jailkeeper since we already have a roleblocker, so what is the mystery role?  Something less standard for sure, since nothing pops to the front of my mind.  Bob is plainly against Barry revealing who this person is.  BUT, Bob also supports a massclaim.  This is a contradiction.  If bob is telling the truth about his setup speculation he believes that the mass-claim will only out the person who visited him, and the second mason, essentially a VT.  Everyone else will probably claim VT.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point I do believe either nintendo or BA is lying about their claim, however everyone is not considering that scum may have multiple PRs too.  Claiming there's a \"scum tracker\" to balance everything out is near-sighted, there could easily be 2/3 scum with night actions, which also means that town could have another unclaimed PR.  Note that mass-claim is a good way to out any remaining PRs if the scum-team is also highly powerful, but BA outing his tracker result wouldn't do that.  I don't think it's likely that there are more PRs but I don't think it's completely out of the question.<br>\n<br>\nI am against mass-claim at this point.<br>\n<br>\nAll this leads me to believe that bob is scum.  The subtle contradictions are incredibly scummy for bob-town but they aren't contradictions for bob-scum.  If bob is scum I don't believe BA is scum, scum wouldn't bus that hard D2 imo.  Which makes nintendo scum.

As for the claim that I&#8217;m a scum tracker &#8211; that&#8217;s a claim you are pulling out of thin air with nothing other than your opinion to back it up.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 740</div> &#8211; You tell hiplop that Barry should not reveal who he (I) tracked.  You state flatly that I&#8217;m not lying about the fact that someone targeted Bob, but that whoever targeted you is not scum because Barry is a &#8220;scum tracker&#8221;.  You go on to state that there is no way I faked the result and that it proves I cannot be town, because of the number of roles we have in the setup.  You note that it is obvious someone tried to protect you and that there is &#8220;no way that Barry Allen is a town tracker&#8221;.  You tell me not to reveal who tracked you if I &#8220;want to keep pretending to be town.&#8221;   <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">Let&#8217;s talk about contradictions here.  You don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m telling the truth about what I am, but you are CERTAIN you were visited because I said you were?  You told hiplop that I should NOT reveal who I tracked, then you try to bait me into revealing who I tracked in the SAME POST?  Frankly, the contradictions here are amazing.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 756</div> &#8211; You start with saying we are NOT lynching Nintendo today &#8220;no matter what&#8221;.  You state your belief that &#8220;every day he stays alive gives outrageous amounts of information to the town.&#8221;  You then state that you don&#8217;t like my stating you are town at the start of my posts.  You state again your reason for not believing I could be a town tracker &#8211; that you believe the round would be unbalanced if I were a town tracker given the number of roles believed to be in the round so far on behalf of the town.  You state that I should not buy &#8220;for a second&#8221; nintendo&#8217;s claim if I&#8217;m really town and wonder why I&#8217;m voting Heliman instead of of Nintendo (as I was doing at that time).  <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">Again, I don&#8217;t know that I buy the claim from nintendo &#8211; I just don&#8217;t think D2 is the day to take that chance.  You started this post basically saying that very same thing, then turn around and say that I must be scum if I believe the same thing that you do.  </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 758</div> &#8211; You reply to hiplop with the reasons Barry should not out the report, giving three potential scenarios.  The first scenario is that I am the town tracker&#8230;.<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">WAIT, I thought there was &#8220;no scenario&#8221; where I COULD be a town tracker?  Guess there really is, even if you won&#8217;t accept it.<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 767</div> &#8211; You state that I&#8217;m not responding to your arguments and that I&#8217;m not using logic to back up my assertions.  You ask that if I am a tracker, why am I not voting for Nintendo.  Again, you bring up the number of roles.  <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">Once again, I don&#8217;t know that I believe nintendoaddict&#8217;s claim, for the very reason you state.  I just don&#8217;t believe D2 is the day to test that claim.  Bob, you have repeatedly made that same argument, that we should not lynch Nintendo today.  It does not make sense for you to repeatedly argue against lynching a player and then to turn around and vote for me because I agree we should not lynch Nintendo today.  </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 770 </div>&#8211; you call out hiplop for continuing to ask PRs to out themselves.  <div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">I&#8217;ve seen hiplop&#8217;s actions as scummy, and you are calling him out here for what could reasonably be called anti-town behavior, yet my vote means that I&#8217;m scum?  Again, you are not making sense.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 774</div> &#8211; You state, &#8220;That's fair. I guess scum probably does know the report, so it doesn't help us to keep it from the town.  @ everybody - A mass claim might not be a bad idea about now. What do you think?&#8221;  <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">I think it is still a VERY bad idea, Bob, and I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t at this point.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 778 </div>&#8211; You&#8217;ve changed your mind about massclaims after ace votes for you, basically kissing up to ace and agreeing with him about, well, everything.  You also state, &#8220;My scumhunting is based almost entirely on how people express themselves in their writing. That's my thing. I'll leave the \"vote analysis\" and the mass claiming and the whatever to you and all the MD people.&#8221;  You then state that you don&#8217;t believe  both Barry and Nintendo can be truthful, and then go back to work on your Heliman case.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">You know, I knew you were going all over the place in some of your posts, but when I came back to analyze just the posts after you voted me I was amazed at how much you&#8217;ve contradicted yourself.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 788</div> &#8211; You once again claim I haven&#8217;t responded to your arguments and state that I&#8217;m trying to gradually move to a vote on you.  You say that I&#8217;m treating it as a given that I&#8217;m town and am using AtE on you.  You also claim I am using &#8220;fabricated outrage&#8221; on you.  You also flatly defend hiplop as town.   You add some pejorative content directed at me, then ask my opinion on some specific players with an AtE, stating that &#8220;If you are truly town, you have no reason not to do this.&#8221;  You end with one last AtE claiming that &#8220;your mind is already racing about how to respond to this&#8221;.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">OK, Bob, now you&#8217;re getting paranoid.  If I wanted to vote you I would already have done so.  You turned around 180 degrees on massclaiming when Ace voted you, and then you start acting paranoid because I called you out for not helping the town with your loose cannon approach. That&#8217;s your problem, not mine.  As for your question at the end of your post, I&#8217;ve already stated that I think 2/3 scum can be found in: Giitah, Scumhunter and Heliman.  Frankly, that&#8217;s more than the idea of 2 scum being claimed by Nintendo as being on the Pine vote.  I&#8217;ve had bad vibes on each during D1 and haven&#8217;t seen much since to take my worries off them.  Ace appears town to me, Foil leans town, and I don&#8217;t have a read on Valern (although Valern did lead that D1 wagon on me).  <br>\nLet&#8217;s be real here &#8211; I&#8217;m not outraged, just highly irritated at your posting style.  I&#8217;m amazed that you consider yourself logical, given that you really only have one argument (OK, two).  Your arguments are one, that you don&#8217;t believe a balanced round would have so many PRs, and two &#8220;Barry is a poopy face&#8221;.  Witness your next post:</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 789</div> &#8211; &#8220;I mean c'mon people, how do you not see how full of shit this guy is?&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">Again, pejorative posting, without logic, just an AtE.<br>\n<br>\nTLDR: Bob is repeating one argument over and over, that he doesn&#8217;t believe that a fair and balanced round would include this number of PRs.  OK, fair enough, I&#8217;m not sure I believe Nintendo either.  But, Bob and I seem to agree on one point, that we should NOT lynch Nintendo today.  The difference is that Bob wants us to agree that he is town when HE says it, and that I must be scum when I say it.  Frankly, THAT is not logical</div>", "time": "Tue Jun 28, 2011 2:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I've answered this several times, so let me do this one last time.<br>\n<br>\nOf COURSE I worry about Nintendo's claim.  I don't know if it is legit, and in fact I have some doubt as to whether we have a sensor in the round.  However, as I have repeatedly stated, I do not want to take the chance of being wrong on D2 after we lynched a role on D1 and lost another role N1.  That is NOT the same as accepting nintendo's claim on face value, and it is NOT the same as believing we have a million roles in the round.  Bob has repeated agreed that lynching Nintendo is a bad idea, even though Bob also says there is no way we can have that many roles in the round.  I agree with Bob on this, yet I'm finding a lynch coming my way.  <br>\n<br>\nThere are some things I do not get here:<br>\n1. How can Bob agree that it is bad to lynch nintendo today, but think that it is bad when I say the same thing?<br>\n2. How can Bob clear hiplop?  What knowledge does he have, and on what basis has he decided this?<br>\n3. Even if I am wrong about hiplop, how is being wrong on D2 \"proof\" of scum?<br>\n4. How can Bob believe me as tracker but not as town?  What knowledge gives him the certainty that I AM a tracker?<br>\n<br>\nFinally, Bob seems paranoid that I'm trying to lynch him and is basically daring me to put my vote on him.  That is ridiculous and not helping anything here.  <br>\n<br>\nTLDR:  I am NOT accepting at face value Nintendo's claim, and I have no reason to believe we have so many PRs.  However, given our complete fail record as a town, I see no benefit to taking the risk on D2 after two roles are already dead from D1 and N1.   It is ridiculous on its face for Bob to be against lynching nintendo today but in favor of lynching me because I took my vote off nintendo.", "time": "Tue Jun 28, 2011 4:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I'm on vacation right now and can't post 24/7, sorry if that's an inconvenience.<br>\n<br>\nI simply don't understand what's going on with this game right now.  I've been racking my brain trying to think of a role that could possibly explain bob's actions but absolutely nothing comes to mind.  To tell the truth I was originally suspecting a cult and was waiting to see if anything bob posted would help confirm/deny that but apparently cults aren't allowed in normal games.  I can't think of any other role where the targetee would know that they've been targeted (aside from blocking roles).<br>\n<br>\nThis leads me to believe that the real explanation is that bob didn't actually get hit with a role like that and is just scum lying because he knows BA is a townie and thus his tracker report is true.  HOWEVER, in the off chance that I'm blanking on something obvious, I will back off this case at least for now because I don't want to out another PR accidentally.  So we have somewhat of a bob/BA/nintendo triangle here.<br>\n<br>\nIf bob is town, BA is scum and nintendo has to be town.<br>\n<br>\nIf bob is scum, BA is town and nintendo has to be scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically bob and nintendo are on the same side.

If we go BA, we risk losing our tracker, however if so we gain two confirmed scum.  If we go nintendo, we risk losing our sensor, however if so we gain only one confirmed scum.  Nintendo is out of the question for best lynch today by this method.  If bob is town, BA has to be telling the truth about the tracker read, if bob is scum, BA isn't lying about his claim.  I'm almost tempted to go with BA today because it gives us either two dead scum for a town tracker, or a dead scum tracker.  However, BA is also the one out of the three I have the town read on.  Also it's important to note that BA IS A CONFIRMED TRACKER.  If bob is scum, BA is confirmed as town and thus not lying, if BA is scum, bob is town and thus isn't lying about BA being a tracker.<br>\n<br>\nSINCE BA IS A TRACKER PART 2 implications of the mystery person who visited bob:<br>\n<br>\nThis means in the course of the BA lynch we reveal who the mystery PR is.  Note that we don't get the role from this (could still be a regular role if bob is scum, which I think is more likely).<br>\n<br>\nIn the course of the bob lynch we get whatever info he has on the mystery person he has IF HE HAS ANY.  IF BOB IS SCUM HE COULD AND PROBABLY IS LYING ABOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THE TRACKER RESULT.  Sorry for all caps, but I know not all of you will be reading this whole post.<br>\n<br>\nIn the course of the nintendo lynch we don't get any info on that.<br>\n<br>\nI'm HIGHLY not enthusiastic about lynching either potential tracker BA or potential sensor nintendo.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@bob</div> - I've pretty much done a 180 on the outing the PR issue since the beginning of this post, you need to out... something, and fast.

{"number": 825, "id": "3172422", "user": "Barry Allen", "user_id": "14906", "content": "The only thing that I can confirm here is that I DID track Foilist last night. I didn't reveal who I had tracked because I didn't want to risk outing a doc.  Instead, we get a roleclaim of something completely different.  I've played mafia on different sites since 2009 (mainly vendetta-strada.com, with a little faster pace with 48 hour day phases and 24 hour night phases, if you want to try that pace give it a try sometime).  However, I had never played a round with either a sensor or a friendly neighbor, so I looked them up in the wiki to get more info. I don't know that I fully get the idea of foilist setting up the QT with Bob, as being able to do that is NOT listed in the wiki for that role.  However, if Foilist is the neighbor, that WOULD explain why Bob KNOWS I'm the tracker.  He would know that he was visited if the GM sent him the Neighbor message from Foilist.<br>\n<br>\nThis would also explain why Bob is so hyper about \"there can't be that many roles in the game.\"  He knows we had a roleblocker and two masons, along with a neighbor.  That's why he can't accept the town also having both a tracker and sensor, as that would mean we have 6 roles minimum for the town.  That doesn't mean we DON'T have a role-heavy round, but it DOES make Bob's reactions make more sense.<br>\n<br>\n@scumhunter - I didn't have a specific reason for a bad vibe on you D1, it was more of a gut feeling that I couldn't put my finger on.  You WERE on my short list for tracking yesterday, along with Giitah and foilist.  My criteria for picking a target was as follows:<br>\n<br>\n1. People no one would expect me to track - in case they really were town.  I didn't want to have a tracker report on a dead player on D2, and if there were a player who showed up as a potential tracker target that was town, the maf would likely target them to give me a useless report D2.<br>\n2. People who could potentially be maf, but not people I had openly suspected D1.  The first criteria crossed off any names of folks I had openly suspected D1, as they could simply not vote for a hit in order to look inno.<br>\n<br>\nSo, scumhunter, bottom line is I only have two things regarding you - a gut feeling that I couldn't put into words D1, and the potential that if nintendo was telling the truth about being sensor you would be in that 2/3 scum group from the votes on Pine that I talked about at the start of the day.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTLDR: foilist was my tracker target, which I would never have confirmed today without him outing himself.  Believe what you will about me, but if you lynch me please take another look at hiplop, as I hope you will when I flip town.  Further, take a look at folks who have jumped on this BW.  I don't know how to defend myself more than I have, and I think it is frankly insane to lynch a tracker on D2, as there could be more info I could provide the town every day that I live.", "time": "Wed Jun 29, 2011 12:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I've asked the mod.<br>\n<br>\nI had a scumread on Ace and on foilist going into Night 1, but immediately ruled out both of them when I was sent the Neighborhood QT.  Foilist told me that ace was the \"other mason,\" and that made a lot of sense to me.  My scum read on them was based on their inexplicable support for DemonHybrid yesterday, and their duel tunneling on nintendo for a case that I didn't really buy from either of them.  I kept mostly quiet about it because my policy is usually to keep quiet about smart scum, avoid the NK, and then nail them later on when there are less players.   However, the support for DH made perfect sense if they were all masons together, as did the coordinated efforts against nintendo, and at the time I assumed incorrectly that foilist was confirmed.<br>\n<br>\nIn our QT, foilist told me that ace knows I've been neighborized.  Obviously, he didn't also tell him that I was going to be told that.  This leaves us with three possibilities:<br>\n<br>\n1) Foilist is really what he has claimed to be, which is a Mason-Friendly Neighbor, and Ace is a town-aligned mason:<br>\n<br>\nAce has tried very hard today to get me outed, and his entire argument about why I'm looking more like scum to him makes no sense if he's town who knew beforehand that I was going to be neighborized by foilist.<br>\n<br>\n2) Foilist is actually what he claims he is, and Ace is a traitor:<br>\n<br>\nThis is what foilist is now pretending, as evidenced by his ace vote, and a recent post he made in the QT.<br>\n<br>\nBut this doesn't make any sense either.  Why on earth would Ace be playing this way if he was partnered with someone he knew was town?  Foil <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">told</div> him that I was neighborized.  Ace knows this.  By going after me like this today, he is confirming himself as scum.  Why?<br>\n<br>\n3) They are both scum.<br>\n<br>\nThis makes *perfect* sense.  Foilist is a scum neighborizer, who targeted me and pretended that ace, who is actually his scumbuddy, was a mason.  He told ace that I was going to be neighborized, but neglected to warn him about the full scope of his gambit.  Ace didn't know foilist was going to tell me all this, and scum evidently don't have daytalk, and so ace unwittingly picked a strategy that contradicted foilist's ploy.  <br>\n<br>\nThis is the only scenario that makes sense.  Foilist wouldn't have picked a random townie and declared them to be a mason, because that's a confirmable lie that would have come out at the first massclaim, and foilist's whole ploy was obviously to have me believe that two of the scum were masons.<br>\n<br>\nThey are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">both</div> scum.

Given the kill flavor of being shot means vig or serial killer? Mafia don't typically use guns in mini normals? Plus the countless other roles that could have visited including cop, JoAT, etc (but many people weren't thinking outside the doctor box).<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">This \"analysis\" from you is also a classic scumtactic.  You are directing our attention away from my noting who was visited during N1 in that post.  You are instead trying to create connections that don't exist between players, hoping that one or both would look scummy.</div><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3167233#p3167233\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 720</div></a> - Diminishes his own play, acknowledged a bad move on his part.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">Your point being....what?</div><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3167724#p3167724\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 747</div></a> - Barry sensationalizes the night kills saying \"we've already lost too many roles\" when we've actually only lost one.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">This is where you are wrong.  We lost our blocker on D1 through lynch and we lost a mason by night kill N1.  That's two roles we lost, not one.</div><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3170265#p3170265\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Post 786</div></a> - the whole argument for removing votes to not out more PRs is crazy. If you think someone is scum you want to wagon them and get them claim and lynch them, unless you know they are town and might be a PR. Being cautious about who you wagon to not out PRs is terrible because:<br>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>You are scum and don't have a legitimate case;<br>\n</li><li>You are scum and don't want to wagon another town person and look scummy; or,<br>\n</li><li>You are scum and don't want to be the driving force of another mislynch.</li></ol><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">This is another scumtactic.  You disagree with me, so you list several scenarios that all assume I'm scum.  The last scenario is just what I stated it was.  We had lost two roles already (not one as you mistakenly noted above), and I did not want to risk more fail.  On D2 we do have time to continue hunting elsewhere, and if we later choose to not believe the claim and go after Nintendo we certainly have time.  In fact, not going to that very quick lynch has given us a LOT of valuable discussion and information, so in retrospect I still believe I did the right thing.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Barry</div> - why did you choose to track Foilist last night?<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">I've already stated how I looked at my short list for tracking.  How I picked foilist out of that group?  It wasn't just that foilist dropped the hammer, it was that there was a post FoSing foilist before the thread was locked.  Since there was an FoS on foilist, the maf might let a town foilist live in order to try to BW him early on D2, and of course a scum foilist was sure to live and might actually visit someone.  When foilist DID visit and bob lived through the night, I thought at first that I had found the doc, so I only released the name of the person he visited (bob).  The later neighbor/mason claim obviously blew that doc theory out the window.</div></fieldset></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">I'll read the rest of your post, but xvart it doesn't look like you carefully read the thread.  You missed key points like losing two roles instead of one, and you asked me questions I've already answered in thread.  You are also using the same tactics in your posts that you find scummy.  Large posts don't necessarily mean well-reasoned posts, and giving a lot of quotes doesn't mean you really read the thread all that well.  </div>", "time": "Wed Jun 29, 2011 4:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

However, Ace now comments on how \"almost every post since page 4 has been directly related to archaebob's comments or questions. He isn't trying to generate discussion, he's trying to control it and lead the town to a mislynch D1.\" The problem with this is, if his comment about archaebob controlling the conversation is true (which I believe it was) and has been true since page four he could have easily made this comment in his last post.

It's especially strange since he was voting Barry Allen at the end of D1 and the start of D2 so how could he \"just now realize that BA was the scum\"? This is such a scummy contradiction. Also, I would like links to sensor being a common fakeclaim offsite.

As you probably realized, you could have executed it better.

Foil himself said it was a risky gambit of sorts, but what the hell was the motive? I think the best bet would be that Foil was trying to clear himself permanently as a townie.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I'm no longer certain if there's anything to glean from Foil's gambit. Was Foil attempting to convince Archaebob he was Town? If so, what was the point of that? I think we can all safely say that Archaebob was too dangerous to live another day, he was basically a confirmed Town player. So when Foil went forward with his claim, was he trying to force everyone to kill someone else, alleviate the suspiscions on him, and then kill Bob after that? <br>\n<br>\nI think the ultimate point of the gambit was to clear Foil in the eyes of Archaebob, claim, get Archaebob to give him a cleared town read, then murder Archaebob afterwards. That being said, the inclusion of Ace was to make his claim seem more believable.<br>\n<br>\nPost 827:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nintendoaddict1 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>ace5993 wrote:</cite>Ignoring all reads and looking at this from a completely neutral 50/50 of each lynch being scum:<br>\n<br>\nHowever, BA is also the one out of the three I have the town read on.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWait... what?

He didn't even present any reasoning as to why Ace and Foil had to be scum, hell, this should have been caught on ages ago. This was prior to Ace claiming he wasn't a mason and Archaebob declaring Foil &amp; Ace were scum.

This here sounds like it's mostly the scum-Foilist talking.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>foilist13 wrote:</cite>My history with him warranted it. We have reached the point in the game where archaebob will either cease to suspect me entirely or commit himself to lynching me and whomever he thinks is my scum team. My friendly neighbor ability allows me to talk and confirms me as town. It does not confirm anyone to me. I suppose it's like forming an unconfirmed mason team. As far as him saying he thinks I'm town yesterday, that has absolutely no merit. Archaebob is not exactly a transparent player as you might have guessed. The point in targeting him with my neighbor power was to try and alleviate his suspicions. <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I don't know that archaebob is town. He could very well be scum.

Also at this point I'd like to note that there's no paragraph on Pine in Giitah's reads post (51).<br>\n<br>\nDAY 2 ON:<br>\n<br>\nISO #68 isn't really scummy imo since it's a reasonable townie reaction to try to stop any wagon that builds up that fast but it's still worth mentioning that Giitah was the one who slowed down the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nISO #69 isn't town at all (I recall someone saying that earlier), it's just stating the obvious.<br>\n<br>\nISO #70-72 is questioning of nintendo that looks like an attempt to be town by latching onto the early suspicion, however in...<br>\n<br>\nISO #73 all the suspicion of nintendo evaporates.  There's also a bizarre mention of 4-scum which I simply don't see town making.<br>\n<br>\nISO #74 is the inevitable backtrack.  This looks like another weak attempt to be town by thinking that there might be 4 scum.<br>\n<br>\nISO #77 is not wanting to make an opinion on either wagon.<br>\n<br>\nISO #85 is MORE 4 mafia speculation.  What?  Also he doesn't jump onto the xvart wagon but also doesn't play aggressively against nintendo.  This is passive scum active lurking.<br>\n<br>\nAll of his page 40 is horrible, as far as I'm concerned BA was pretty much confirmed town at that point from the last two claimed power roles being fakeclaims, yet Giitah lists him as a main suspect.  Also it's worthwhile to note that scum were keeping BA alive because apparently they thought they could get him lynched.  Post #995 is particularly scummy:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BA has been confirmed tracker since d2, why is he still alive?</div> lolololol... I forgot that piece of evidence. ^^</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat's a scum argument, it doesn't actually make sense.<br>\n<br>\nPage 41 is backing off as he realizes that he can't get BA lynched.  <br>\n<br>\nUnsurprisingly, BA dies.<br>\n<br>\nISO #107+116 is STILL ON THE THEORY THAT THERE ARE FOUR SCUM.  The continued mentions of this are really, really bad.<br>\n<br>\nGoing for an apathy lynch in #119 this late in the game is bad.<br>\n<br>\nContradicts his Valern vote in #124<br>\n<br>\n#126 is bad:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>I can't see everyone's reads being so wrong on hiplop</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOr, \"I don't have an opinion but hiplop's way too hard of a lynch to pull off.<br>\n<br>\nOverall Giitah has been asking too many somewhat irrelevant questions, having too few opinions, non-committal opinions at that, and generally just going with the flow while doing \"subtle\" little things to make him appear town (4 scum theory, little jabs at nintendo without ever following them up until the last second).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Giitah</div><br>\n<br>\nYes I'm aware that it's 3 votes to lynch, a 1 vote wagon is not dangerous in the slightest.", "time": "Sun Jul 17, 2011 8:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}

I think that's where the problem was: the gambit was a mistake from the getgo and thus it was hard to determine exactly what role Ace was in relation to Foilist.<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, from my standpoint I'm saddened by how this ended out, but I'm still not really sure how to go about getting better. Still, it was kinda fun. Difficult, though; I still have a lot to learn to get better at this game.", "time": "Wed Jul 27, 2011 7:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17764&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "17764"}
