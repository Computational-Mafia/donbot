Voting for no lynch for the day is also possible. If no one gains a majority during a day, there will be no lynch for the day, and night will begin.<br>Rule 8: Days will last a maximum of 2 weeks, but can be shorter if a lynch or no lynch is reached before the deadline. Deadline extensions are possible, but unlikely. Nights will last 48 hours. If I do not receive a night action within that 48 hours, it will not count. <br>Rule 9: If you die, you are allowed to make one 'bah' post that has no content in it, but after that no talking.<br>Rule 10: If you are going to be away from the game for an extended period of time, please declare yourself <span class=\"noboldsig\">V/LA</span> in thread, and say how long you expect to be gone.<br>Rule 11: If a player does not declare <span class=\"noboldsig\">V/LA</span> and they do not post for 48 hours, they will be prodded. They then have 24 hours to pick up their prod and start posting or they will be replaced out. If a person has been prodded twice and fails to post for 48 hours, instead of recieving another prod they will be replaced out.<br>Rule 12: If you need to leave the game, please contact me via PM or say so in bold in the thread.

I take stuff like \"I'm voting you for being too serious\" as a serious statement.<br><br>Lets look at the context:<br><br>-You first FoS someone for \"possessing an idiot ball\". Obviously an RVS post.<br>-Bob posts some things<br>-You vote him, and say that he's being too serious.<br><br>Now, what does that look like to anyone but you?<br><br>2. I'm trusting bob's reads and actions because he has ABSOLUTELY NO SCUM MOTIVATION to do anything that he's done so far. Every FoS without a reason, vote without a reason, page 1 seriousness, etc. has absolutely no scum motivation and he's obviously putting pressure on people instead of sitting there with his thumb up his ass.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Btw, you do realize RVS ends at different times, for different people, right? you seem to be very, very confused, or have very low reading comprehension skills.

I can't shake the feeling that you are simply stalling and waiting for everyone's attention to be drawn elsewhere, rather than responding to the fact that the votes went as high as L-2 (I think it is L-3 right now).  I would like to hear from Jillyne more before deciding whether to take the pressure off or leave it there."}

I ask jil to explain her special treatment of hiplop in this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jilynne1991 wrote:</cite>Oh, right, my FoS was a joke, ok, ummm, unFoS?<br><br>LOL <span class=\"noboldsig\">unFoS hiplop </span></div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't ask you to unFoS.  I asked you tell me if it was serious or not.  <br><br>If it was joke, then why did you FoS instead of voting?  You had no problem joke voting Barry Allen, Demon Hybrid, or Heliman.  Is there some reason you gave hiplop the softer treatment?</div></blockquote><br><br>And she ignores it completely, despite answering my earlier question about if the fos was serious for a second time.  <br><br>I bring up my question again<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3127623#p3127623\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3127677#p3127677\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3128799#p3128799\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br><br>And she continuously ignores it, despite answering a different question from me again:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>jilynne1991 wrote:</cite>Oh, crap, I'm so sorry, I don't know what's up with me, ok, so here it is:<br><br>After going through hiplop's ISO it looks like he wants to appear like he is scumhunting with the least possible content.

Actually, Ace posted very little content before going after me.  Most of Ace's posts were quick one-or-two liners after quotes of others, with little real contribution to the discussion.  Certainly there has been more \"content\" in coming after me, and later Bob, but that's been about it.<br>2. Ace, I've only defended myself...something several of us have been asking Jill to do for some time.  It's not being defensive, it's called putting on a defense when you are accused and you respond.<br>3. This is where Ace is being overly defensive.

In the meantime, what are your top 3, Ace?  You've backed off Bob and seem to be focusing on just me, but surely you have additional reads so let's hear them as well.<br><br>One last note...there seems to be a lot of attention given to jillyne's age.  I don't believe that to be a valid factor, as I've seen people that age play exceptionally well in other rounds.  I'm one of the oldest players on this site (as well as on the other sites where I play mafia), and do not believe that to be an advantage...in fact I've had my hat handed to me by players that age before, so I'm simply playing the round and taking each player seriously.  In fact, I don't pay attention to the demographic info for a player (as that may or may not be accurate), but rather I watch the actual game play to make my own determinations."}

I'll add that info here, but will also note that while I was re-reading the thread for this post hiplop went V/LA.  I do want to hear from hiplop upon his return, but also feel it important to add my observations while I have my notes from the re-reading at hand.<br><br>Before I do that, though....   <span class=\"noboldsig\">UNVOTE Jil</span>  <br><br>Jil never did really defend herself, but it is obvious that continuing to press won't get us anywhere at this point.  Now, let's get back to hiplop, and why I do have an FoS toward him:<br><br>1. After a couple of RVS votes, hiplop flipped to a vote on Bob for \"taking everything too seriously\" (which sounded to me as his first pressure vote...though later in response to DH, hiplop claims this was a joke-vote).  <br>2. Afterward, hiplop switched to a vote on DemonHybrid, later claiming he was \"the only one voting DH, I'm thinking for myself.\" (That was not true - hiplop was actually the third vote on DH, with all three votes still active at the time).  <br>3. Later, he returns to vote Bob, without explaining the vote at the time (although there had been some back and forth with bob prior to the revote).  <br>4. Later, hiplop states about bob, \"unfortunately you're town\" and votes giitah with the only case being \"somethings not sitting right with you\"<br><br>Then came a lot of dancing around on the subject of what meta information is valid and what is not.  This started with a post where hiplop contradicted himself in the same post, telling bob \"meta won't cut it\" and then noting Jil's age as being something that could explain her play.  Hiplop was called out on that by other players, and wound up in a series of explanations involving \"psycho-graphic characteristics\" versus other meta information.  The explanations didn't make sense and frankly didn't ring true - it seemed more like being caught in a contradiction and trying to explain why you were OK in spite of your own words.<br><br>One other observation - early in the phase Heliman noted potentially \"purposeful\" typos on the part of hiplop.  I didn't think much of that at the time, as a lot of players post with loose spelling and grammar.  But, I did find it interesting that when getting fired up on DH, hiplop suddenly markedly improved in both grammar and spelling.  It wasn't perfect...but it was MUCH better.  Posts 114, 115 and 128 get increasingly better in terms of typing (again not perfect, but compare it to earlier posts).  Then, things start to go back to prior typing style for the most part.  That is a bit meta...and of course according to hiplop only psycho-graphic data is useful...but it is an interesting note.<br><br>Now, does this all add up to scum?  It's not hard evidence, so I would like to hear more from hiplop upon his return."}

It has been 2-3 days since I've thought to myself hell, looks like this game has really picked up, time for me to jump in. Up until a couple months ago, I played online poker for a living. It was recently banned here in the U.S. so the gov't essentially laid me off -______-.  So yea, I just started a new job recently. What better place than the corporate world to use my talent at math and being good at lying to and reading people!!! Downside, I am office bitch for the foreseeable future and that I have far less interweb leisure time than I am used to. I woke up an hour early just to post in this game becuase I was too tired last night, but rest assuerd I am committed to this game and finding the scum. I generally am against the concept of V/LA because I think it is a weak excuse scum can use to get out of a lynch towards the deadline, but if I remain super busy I may opt to do something like that. Anyways, this game has my attention and now that I'm caught up it should be easier to stay involved even if for just 10 min spurts here and there.<br><br>K. So to respond to the only suspicion on me other than my lurking:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite><br>Fine. I'll be done with RVS. Next vote will be an actual suspicion or have a purpose at least. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Once I start getting involved in the game I often times end up vote-hopping quite a bit. It's not a scumtell from me though.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Loudly announcing what you are going to do before you do it is much more characteristic of a mafia mindset than a town one.  Town is secure in the sincerity of their actions, and for the most part just do things.  It is a very common tendency in scum players to reflexively start over-explaining themselves; it gives them an armored vehicle of logic with which they can justify their lies.  <br><br>To my eyes, the italicized section above is really saying:<br><br>\"Let me tell you exactly what my play will look like, so that when I start actually posting I can defend myself against anything you might say about me.  If you accuse me of vote hopping I can say 'LOOK!  I already said I might vote hop, and that it's a town tell for me.'\"<br><br>This is filled with way too much nervous energy for town.  It's also CRAZY premature for him to be defending himself against something that not only has he not been attacked for, but that he hasn't even done yet. <br><br>We need to learn more about this guy.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>I really don't believe in \"over-explaining\" oneself. Towns often fail because of a lack to communicate clearly even when they think they are being clear with their intentions. Just look at yourself and Heliman this game for example.<br><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3037266#p3037266\">viewtopic.php?p=3037266#p3037266</a><!-- l --><br><br>This was a recently town finished game of mine where my very first post was \"I'm looking forward to a town win.\" I was quickly wagoned to L-1 for that lulz. I have the tendency to be repetitive and obvious in my pov as town. I think that appearing town is actually a more important job for town than hunting scum. The universe disagrees with me. But it is a strong opinion of mine.<br><br><br>As for reads:<br><br>1. hiplop: Leaning town. Your posts seem sincere to me. I often share your pov that seriousness in RVS annoys the piss out of me, but really that could come from scum not wanting to begin the uphill battle of defending themselves and faking scumhunting all game. <br><br>2. Pine: Null. The fosing people based on typos, etc. is weak scumhunting, but early on its an ok start. Will need to see more when he's back from semi-V/LA to get a better read.<br><br>3. Deuxieme Octopus: I'd probably say town, but 2 total posts is a small sample size for any sort of read. I liked your point on Pine. Please post more, god I feel like such a hypocrite saying that. I felt Pine's posts were a little \"vacuous\" as you said and that they could, key word could be insincere.<br><br>4. archaebob: Incredibly obv town. Lmfao, are/were people voting him? He has fosed just about everyone in the game. I suppose it's possible that he is a very good scum player trying to take charge from the beginning of the game...but I think it would be hard to fake the legitimacy of the scumhunting he is trying to do. I wouldn't call him overzealous town either has all his pressuring has been getting at something.<br><br>5. jilynne1991: Null. There is no chance you are 13 years old nor a girl. If I were a betting man (which I am), I would wager a significant amount of money that you are both male and over the age of 18. Your vocabulary and attitude are not coming from a 13 year old girl. Plus what 13 year old has \"1991\" in their user name. It's incredibly obvious to me that your IRL \"identity\" is faked, I'd assume for game-related advantages of being perceived as a newb. I have no idea what that means about your alignment, I'm just saying your \"Newb 13 year old girl tactic\" isn't going to work on me this game.<br><br>6. Barry Allen: Lean Scum. I don't like the way you took your vote off of jilynne. \"Obviously pressuring her isn't going to get us anywhere.\" What the hell is that? You hadn't REALLY pressured her whatsoever. All you really did was explain why you voted her and make 1 post that could be vaguely described as pressuring jilynne. The point of pressure is pressuring until you actually get something from it not giving up after a weak attempt. Also, you noticed early on about jilynne \"I don't see a defense, we are at L-2..\" I read your whole attitude as being lynch-focused so far as opposed to scumhunting focused.<br><br>7. nintendoaddict1: Town. You really really are barking up the wrong tree though suspecting archaebob and hiplop. How anyone reads bob as scum is beyond me. I also don't think hiplop is all that scummy either. There are better people to go after Barry Allen,<br><br>8. Heliman: Town. Jesus, townies really need to stop arguing with archaebob. Heliman, what it comes down to is you disagree with the way that bob pressures people and votes people. He has done the most to help town, so your vote is really really poor tbh. It is ok to have double standards and crap cases in the beginning because it elicits reactions. The reactions are so important. You get reactions from the player being voted, the way other players interact with that player and with the wagon itself. It is vital information even if the cases and logic are shit. Logic is just one part of the game good sir. Votes aren't always with the intent to lynch..<br><br>9. ace5993: Lean Scum. I don't really understand your fos/unfos of Barry. I don't see anything in Barry's play to warrant such a change in opinion. Your fos on bob screams to me that you are scum scared of his influence this game. You said at the beginning of the day \"We don't need a wagon every single time someone does something even the slightest bit scummy.<br>\" and now you just said \"We wasted 10 pages on Jil, hopefully that won't happen with these wagons but having the wagons IS NECESSARY.\" Such a contrast in your opinions on the need for wagons/pressuring people makes me go O.o. It would help me if you explained exactly which \"quirks\" in Barry's playing style changed your opinion on him.: I  <br><br>10. DemonHybrid: Town. I like how you called bob obv town, I was literally going down the list waiting for someone to point that out. I agree that Jil has contributed squat, but I'd much rather go after Barry/ace today.<br><br>11. Spadille: Null. No posts yet.<br><br>13. Giitah: Gut scum. I don't have anything condemning on you. I felt like your \"Ugh.\" reaction to me saying I was goign to lurk to page 10 and that you asking deuxieme not to lurk were faked attempts to look town. Town are usually more annoyed by my non-helpful attitude early on. Oh, and also, I don't really know where you stand in relation to who you think is scum or who you would prefer to vote at this point...?<br><br>Town reads (strongest to weakest): archaebob, DH, nintendoaddict1, Heliman, hiplop, deuxieme octopus<br>Null reads: Pine, jilynne1991, Spadille<br>Scum reads (strongest to weakest): ace5993, BarryAllen, Giitah<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote ace5993</span>"}

Your note of the \"1991\" in the name is interesting.  It's still somewhat meta, and since I have noted being handed my hat by younger players it doesn't change how I feel about Jil's affiliation.  Whether Jil is a 13 year old girl or a much older male has no bearing on affiliation.  btw, my removing my vote because the pressure wasn't working was a reference to the fact that Jil had gone all the way to L-2 and was down to only 2 votes (one of them mine) without ever having defended herself.  There was certainly interference from other players (including at least one player stating that they were purposely messing with the pressure on Jil), but the bottom line was that I had to realize my vote was not going to result in anything useful to the town at this time.  I have not quit suspecting Jil, I simply moved on to do other scumhunting since the players were obviously not of a mind to continue pressing Jil.<br><br>As for your stand on hiplop, I disagree.  I find hiplop's posting style somewhat suspicious, much in the way you suspect Jil of pretending to be 13.  Please go back and look at how hiplop's typos and grammar seemed to get much better when getting defensive/angry, then later went back to the looser grammar and spelling of earlier posts.  Again that's a bit meta, but I'm still waiting for hiplop to respond to my (and other's) earlier posts before making a judgment call there.<br><br>I would like to hear more - like your answer to my question above.  Some of your observations leave a little room for a head-scratching response (such as declaring someone likely town who has barely posted, and liking that person's vote for a \"null\" read).  But, I want to see more from you before I make a call on you."}

Let's start by thinking critically about the nature of the two sides who are competing against each other for victory.<br><br>The town far outnumbers the scum, but begins the game not knowing who their enemies are.  Usually the town has one or two PRs with them, but the large number of players makes these special roles relatively ineffective on their own.  Without strong scumhunting efforts during the day to help with aim, PR night actions will certainly be less efficient than the scum NK.  Therefore, the #1 priority of the town needs to be exposing the likely scum in the thread through votes, questions, pressure, and critical analysis. <br><br>There are two fundamental differences between the scum mindset and the town mindset:<br><br>1) Objective - Scum are trying to mislynch town.  In the short term, they may bus a partner for strategic purposes, but ultimately the game is won by tricking the town into lynching town.  To do this, they have to make persuasive arguments that they know are false, and push through lynches that they are know are incorrect while appearing sincere.<br><br>2) Information - Scum know who the other scum are.  This means they have to feign ignorance in order to blend in with the town.  <br><br>ALL scumtells come from this disparity in mindset.  A scumtell is a post which demonstrates that the scum lacks either the 1) objective or 2) access to information of town.  <br><br>It is important to note that there is nothing about being scum which makes you inherently less logical, less consistent, or less active.  However, scum (particularly newb scum) often does <span style=\"font-style: italic\">tend</span> in that direction as a means towards their objective.  Uncreative and/or reckless scum will make bad cases to try and get mislynches, or will lurk to try and avoid posting as much.  But to use a logical inconsistency or lack of activity as a \"scum tell\", you have to show how, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in this specific situation</span>, the behavior of the individual indicates that they are more likely to have a scum mindset than a town one.<br><br>So how does town win?  <br><br>Town wins by taking advantage of this fundamental difference between themselves and the scum.  It is the goal of the town to set up an environment in which town players do one thing, and scum does another.  What sort of environment is that?  The answer, if you think about it, is obvious.  Town benefit from an environment in which scum has to fake the town 1) objective and 2) access to information as much as possible.  If they succeed in this, the scum will reveal themselves plainly in their consistent failures to do what most helps town, and forget what town does not know.<br><br>For town to create this environment, the following needs to be true:<br><br>1) Town players must be able to recognize each other.  That means that if you are town, you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">must look town</span>.  This does <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> mean trying to \"appease\" people by giving them what they want to hear.  Anything you say that is fake or calculated will read as scummy to people.  It also does not mean that you should try and do \"what the town is doing\" or do lots of things that are considered \"town tells.\"  All attempts to \"seem\" town will look contrived, because they will be. <br><br>What I mean by \"town must look town\" is that you must reveal what your role is simply by being truthful.  You aren't trying to \"look town\" as much as you are trying to share your true feelings with the town in a way that is helpful and productive.  This means you want to play honestly, openly, and amicably.  Give your honest reactions to things without channeling them through a million logical filters.  Logic is important, and you should check yourself to make sure you aren't making any stupid mistakes, but you don't want to completely lose the sincerity of gut reactions in your posts, as they will help town recognize you for what you are.  Scum fundamentally cannot replicate a gut reaction, because they are always in the position of knowing who is town and who is not, and therefore having to consciously choose opinions.  If everyone is being honest and open, the scum have to clumsily invent those reactions out of thin air, and thereby make themselves vulnerable to the sharp eyes of the town.<br><br>2) The second, harder part, which often conflicts with the first, is that the town needs to force scum to post as much alignment revealing content as possible.  What kind of content is this?  Emotional reactions, gut reads, level of certainty, etc.  Anything that the scum cannot accurately replicate from with their inherently non-town mindset.  <br><br>Remember that this does NOT involve logical consistency.  Scum LOVE logic, because it is objective, and works the same way for town as it does for scum.  The only time in which it makes sense to get into a logical debate with someone is when you think their <span style=\"font-style: italic\">intentions</span> are false.  If someone is deliberately hurting the town, and they are justifying their actions with poor logic, then you can remove their excuse by dismantling their argument.  You then force them to either organically change their action (something scum cannot do), or to be stubborn past the point where they can pretend to have a town objective. <br><br>Now lets talk about Day 1.<br><br>At the beginning of Day 1, the environment overwhelmingly favors scum.  Nobody knows anything about anyone, and there are too many players who haven't posted enough for the town to feel confident about who the other town are.  <br><br>Therefore, I consider object 2 to be far more important in the early stages of the game.  Everyone should focus their effort on maximizing the information that town has.  The method that I have found and that you all have seen works well for me, but it does not necessarily involve looking like town, and not everyone's personality is suited to it.  A town full of archaebob's would not be ideal, and in games where another player is already playing the part of provocateur, I often mold myself a little to avoid getting in their way.  The main point here is that you pick a technique, and that you use it as efficiently as you can to make people tell you about themselves.<br><br>That has been the Day 1 of this game up till now.  Some players have been more successful than others, but for the most part, individuals have picked out other individuals and enticed content from them with votes and questioning.<br><br>After 12 pages, we now have the scum in two categories: 1) lurkers, 2) players who have already committed themselves to an active post rate.<br><br>What needs to happen now is twofold: <br><br>1) We need to force these last lurkers out of hiding.  Town cannot win if one of them is sitting on a scum role, abut town also cannot win by indiscriminately policy lynching all them.  This means we need to make it clear to them that the game will not progress in a manner favorable to them without their content.  A focused bandwagon that comes together significantly BEFORE deadline is usually effective.<br><br>2) We need to start looking at everyone and thinking about who among the more active posters could be scum.  Everybody, myself included, has a tendency to tunnel on their primary suspect, and only skim conversations between other players.  Now it the time to go back and reread the thread, thinking critically about each player and the conversations that have taken place.  As you begin to form your scumlist, you will observe how players react to these final bandwagons, and notice who is being strangely stubborn, or who is awkwardly changing their vote for no reason.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time to start looking town, and for everyone in the thread to cooperate in applying maximum pressure to these last few lurkers.  Town doesn't know who is leading the wagons.  Furthermore, town KNOWS that they are town.  Therefore, their response to the wagon will be laced with a million little subconscious elements that will make their reaction feel sincere.  Scum can't invent a gut reaction, and therefore have to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">consciously choose</span> how to react each time.  The latter will stick out like a sore thumb.<br><br>In the meantime, the scum who have already been active have to choose to either support or resist each lurker wagon.  If they suddenly become a lurker and abstain from voting, they will stick out.  If they resist the wagon, they have to justify themselves.  If they join the wagon, they will be helping town be more efficient with its Day 1 efforts, and may make other mistakes along the way.<br><br>Now, every time I make a post like this, I invariably get the \"manipulative scumbob telling everyone what to do\" response, so let me quickly explain why I'm posting this:<br><br>1) Reading this whole thing will royally fuck with the scum, especially if we actually follow the plan.  Even now as they are reading, their mind is racing as they try to figure out what the most natural-seeming response to this post is, and what they should do next.<br><br>2) This post is the beginning of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">my</span> attempts to appear town.  I have made myself deliberately abrasive and enigmatic up till this point, which is something I always do because I think it generates a lot of information.  I recognize, however, that none of you can be sure of my alignment yet, and that many of you have questions about my actions today.  It is in my interest now to make you at ease with me, as I want your cooperation in wagoning these final lurkers and in choosing the lynch.  <br><br>Believe me, I am <span style=\"font-style: italic\">extremely</span> aware that from your perspective, I could very well be scum who is doing all this as part of one giant ploy for town cred.  Once again, I don't expect you to trust me just yet.  However, I do expect you to recognize that everything I've said above is valid pro-town reasoning, and that it is in your interest to cooperate with it.  We need information from these last lurkers, and the best way to get it is for all of us to work together.  Scum may try to blend in, but they will be doing so under the focused scrutiny of the town.  Once we have all the information we need to move comfortably into Day 2, then we can spend the very last days before deadline arguing over who to lynch.<br><br>The main point is that all of you people who are crossvoting and/or are the only person on your wagon need to make a compromise with each other to get shit done. <br><br> If you have questions about anything I've done today, I will now answer them.<br><br>And on that note, PLEASE vote Deuxiem Octopus with me.  I will be commenting on every player, including ace and barry after we have taken care of priorities, which is making sure that a lurker isn't sitting on a scum role.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> unvote vote Deuxiem Octopus</span>"}

Respond to my actual argument.  It doesn't matter that you see one line from Deuxieme Octopus as a town tell. <br><br>You are trying to justify your refusal to vote for Deuxieme Octopus by asserting that there is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no way</span> he could <span style=\"font-style: italic\">possibly</span> be scum because he said this: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Deuxieme Octopus wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: Pine </span>.  This will sound like total buddying, but  I've read through the game thus far (sorry for the absence, was at Bonnaroo -- thought i'd have 3G but didn't) and I found that when you read Pine in iso like archaebob suggests, it definitely comes across as more than a bit vacuous and therefore, fishy.  Over 10 pages of posting, Pine drops in a quiet 9 that, with the exception of the \"big\" post where he unvote-votes bob, are generally obsessed with rolefishing.  His last 5 posts have all been like some sort of list of maxims or something, little one-sentence deals such as <br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Generally, the only people that start the game looking for third party roles are scum themselves.</div></blockquote><br><br>Well that's enough for the Deuxieme.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Back to lurking.</span>  </div></blockquote><br><br>which has \"no conceivable scum motivation\".<br><br>I say bullshit for two reasons:<br><br>1) He could easily be scum.  You don't have any where near enough information about this player to definitively rule out that one line as a wifom tactic, joke, or even a genuine newbie slip.  Your attitude and forcefulness strongly suggests that you know more about the roles than an uninformed town player would.<br><br>2) Saying you think he's town is completely missing the point.  He isn't posting.  He needs to.  Even if he's town, his reads and insights are valuable, because if he gets killed, we can look to his gut reads as being genuine.  But more importantly than that, this wagon will give us more information about the other players in the game as they decide to support or resist it.  Unlike an individual vote on one player, large wagons can't be ignored.  If a player declines to comment on a five person bandwagon, it's conspicuous.  Scum have to stake out a position on each wagon in a way they never have to do with individual votes.  <br><br>Why are you resisting this plan, Demon Hybrid?  I've asked you to explain yourself twice now, and your response each time has just been to reiterate why you think Deuxieme Octopus is probably town based on a three line quote from one of his only two posts in the game.<br><br>I don't buy it."}

But it doesn't sit right with me.<br><br>Preview Edit: Okay, I have egg on my face. I went back to find the quote that caused me to vote for Giitah...and I fucked up with my vote. The person I meant to be voting for had overreacted AT GIITAH, not Giitah overreacting to someone else. Apparently, I fail.<br><br>This is the quote, and combined with my above suspicion, warrants a changing of my vote to where it was meant to be.<br><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>nintendoaddict1 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite>@ nintendoaddict -<br><br>What do you think the purpose of RVS is?</div></blockquote><br><br>Reactions. </div></blockquote><br><br>Exactly.  Do you think you are likely to get a reaction from anyone if you tell the whole world that your vote is random?<br><br>The town starts off the game with <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nothing</span>, and the rvs is designed to be a first step towards content generation.  Believe it or not, even rvs votes contain tiny little pieces of alignment revealing content in them.  It's not much, and it usually becomes unimportant later in the game, but it is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how the town starts figuring out who is who</span>.<br><br>By using a randomizer, you are preventing <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any</span> content from seeping into your vote, and guaranteeing that your target will shrug you off without even one awkward incriminating sentence of defense.  <br><br>Ok?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> unvote vote Giitah</span><br><br>why the <span class=\"noboldsig\">FUCK</span> did you vote me!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!??!??!?!?!?<br><br>You obviously are buddies with nintendoaddict.</div></blockquote><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Giitah</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: archaebob</span><br><br>Thanks for making me dig that up, archaebob!<br><br>Giitah gets a token few Townpoints for calmly and rationally responding to my unwarranted accusation.</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh so the vote on Giitah was a mistake.  However the reason for voting Giitah in the first place - \"Way overreacting to someone skimming RVS and misunderstanding\", still doesn't make sense when applied to bob.  I do think the vote on Giitah was an honest mistake - but it was a lazy scum mistake.  He saw Bob's \"reason\" for voting Giitah, and thought at a glance it was a serious overreaction.  I'm kind of floundering to make sense of the \"misunderstanding\" - it either didn't exist, or it was this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>Ai ai, captain.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: nintendoaddict1</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: archaebob</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Which means the misunderstanding was that supposedly Giitah thought bob wanted a wagon... on himself?  <br><br>The other reason for the case - \"Jumping on typoes and misunderstandings is very scummy in my book\", also doesn't make sense when applied to either bob or Giitah in either context.  <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>Ai ai, captain.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: nintendoaddict1</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: archaebob</span></div></blockquote><br><br>I take it you disagree?  Oh are you just defending your buddy?</div></blockquote><br><br>This post \"which came BEFORE bob's vote on Giitah\", completely negates any possibility that bob was overreacting.<br><br>It's somewhat obvious Pine DID NOT read the thread properly before he started his case on bob, as all three reasons he gave were simply not true.  The fact that he first messed up the names on the posts only further reinforces this.  This is lazy scum trying to look town by posting some sort of a case.  Moving on:<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>@archaebob: The only third party roles permitted in Normal games are Serial Killers. So no, you don't smell survivor or cultist.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS: archaebob</span> For the above. I'm not sure whether it's rolefishing, scum hunting the SK, or what. But it doesn't sit right with me.</div></blockquote><br><br>Once again, lazy scum.  Found someone mentioning roles and decided to base a case around it because rolefishing's possible the easiest thing to base a case around.  AGAIN messed up the names, which isn't a scumtell in itself, but it does further the impression that Pine isn't really reading the thread at all.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Giitah gets a token few Townpoints for calmly and rationally responding to my unwarranted accusation.</div></blockquote><br><br>Translation: \"Let's make sure Giitah thinks I'm town.\"  Also note that it's possible that Pine's case was originally meant to be on Giitah since it doesn't make a shred of sense either way, and he just changed it to bob because bob pointed out that the original case didn't make sense.  I don't think this is true but it's an outside chance.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Holy crap, I really am just batting 1000 in this game. <span class=\"noboldsig\">FOS: Heliman</span> for what I said in 127.

Yes, I'm serious.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not really sure how you thought bob was serious here but even so, this is the only post with any content at all that slightly leans scum.  Everything else screams scum as loudly as it can.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Generally, the only people that start the game looking for third party roles are scum themselves.</div></blockquote><br><br>Expanding on lazy case #2.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Care to explain, Ace? I haven't done any rolefishing at all.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not reading.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Yeah, hunting SK on D1 has gotten me lynched as scum before <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote><br><br>I imagine you were actively hunting for the serial killer though, not merely mentioning the chance of third-party roles in passing.  Also I'll mention here that it didn't feel at all like Heliman was searching for a third party role at all, he was just pointing out that hiplop was playing very oddly.  <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>I'll try to get a more thorough read later (I've only skimmed) but my suspicion of archaebob has not abated one iota.

I find it hard to believe that in building your case against me, you did no re-reading, and my sig is plain as day there.</div></blockquote><br><br>There are no continued accusations, there's three reasons you posted while we were barely out of RVS.  None of them make sense.  HOWEVER, it makes me wonder if the rolefishing case you posted on bob was only posted because you thought it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> bob.  I wouldn't be shocked after reading your other posts that it had slipped your mind that that point was really made on Heliman.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>What's your case on me again, bob?

I don't really understand your fos/unfos of Barry. I don't see anything in Barry's play to warrant such a change in opinion.

You said at the beginning of the day \"We don't need a wagon every single time someone does something even the slightest bit scummy.<br>\" and now you just said \"We wasted 10 pages on Jil, hopefully that won't happen with these wagons but having the wagons IS NECESSARY.\" Such a contrast in your opinions on the need for wagons/pressuring people makes me go O.o. It would help me if you explained exactly which \"quirks\" in Barry's playing style changed your opinion on him.</div></blockquote><br><br>First of all they were votes, not FoS's &gt;_&gt;  There's a difference between wagoning active players who do something slightly scummy and wagoning players who aren't posting.  If someone does something I consider a minor scumtell I don't feel the need to create a wagon on them, I simply bring up the post I had issue with and go from there.  However I like wagons based on lurking/active lurking because then we force the (active) lurkers to post content.  I did support the Jil wagon initially, based on the fact that she needed to get out of RVS since she hadn't posted content, I just don't like that we wasted 10 pages on it when all we really needed was to get her posting content.  After about 3 pages or so it should have been obvious that any more pressuring was going to be fruitless.<br><br>As for BarryAllen it's... difficult to put into words.  Firstly his apparent misunderstanding/complete denial of the points I made on him looked more like obstinate town than scum.  Then his later posts indicate that semi-tunneling is just a quirk of his playstyle.  From the point of view of being really, really set on Jil for the moment he's more likely to make a comment like this (after such a short period of time):<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry Allen wrote:</cite>In the meantime, I really want to hear from jilynne...maybe it's a time zone issue but we are at L-2 and don't seem to see a defense.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>nintendoaddict1 wrote:</cite>Okay, besides the fact that ace suddenly changed his posting style, going from one line posts to walls, there is something I need an answer on.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ace:</span><br>In your post #11 you said 'content later when I have time' after you voted Deux.

However, Nintendo64 took the time to calmly and rationally answer archaebob's questions. In general that seems pro-town, but he it much to serious about it. He is responding as though there was a threat, rather than responding to generate discussion. Scum tend to do that, not town. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SuperNintendo wrote:</cite>No, I like to make it clear when I am using an RVS vote, because some people do not make it known, thus it makes it very confusing as to whether or not it is actually random, so unless I say RVS I am making a serious vote.</div></blockquote><br><br>Now it's painfully fucking obvious that it was an RVS vote without him saying anything. This is clearly redundant and the result of nervous energy. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>NintendoWii wrote:</cite>Aren't all votes early in the game RVS anyway? Labeling a few of them does not make every other vote a serious one.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes, yes they are. Labeling them is strange especially if you already accept the idea that all early votes will be RVS votes.

If you had been, you would have been able to switch your vote more efficiently to another significant read rather than going back to find out who else has been suspicious.

I think him (scum) + me (town) would have loved to just tunnel the crap out of me and have it be to his win condition as well...This entire point is semi-irrelevant because I don't know enough about his mindset to know how he would react once the game started, I was just surprised is all.<br><br>Can someone please explain the case on DH.

Emotional appeals are not a scumtell. I say this every game and no one listens. EMOTIONS ARE PART OF THE GAME. The only reason people go to the default \"aTe is a scumtell\" is because they are too shit to actually read people and make complicated, calculated decisions. I say this every game no one ever listens. It's much easier to play by a rote system and blame the people you misread once they flip town by saying \"they were scummy\" not my fault. I mean jesus christ, its really sad tbh."}

Furcolow did that in a game I played with him and it was the most irritating thing I've ever seen. That doesn't mean that Jillynne is active lurking, nor does it mean that she is scum. Looking over her play she's pretty much just a lurker, not an active lurker. She avoids posting reads, which is actually counter productive to active lurking. The whole point of active lurking is to avoid attention, where as never posting reads at all drags attention to you. Real active lurkers post vague or unreasoned reads that they can stand by or change later. Jillynne isn't doing that. Pine is. <br><br>If nothing else, recognize that you are not helping the town with your vote. You aren't discussing other players, you are not offering any insight on any issue, you are simply defending your Jillynne vote to the death. The likelihood is that we will not lynch Jillynne today. Right now there isn't the support for it. So why don't you figure out the next best lynch and tell us who it is and why. At least then you'll be doing something."}

This makes me wonder why there are still 2 votes on him.  Pine and/or Heliman please restate your case, because I do not understand those votes.  My vote is still on hiplop for now, but those votes staying on bob are something I don't get.  <br><br>- As for DH staying on Jil, I have to say that although I share the concern about Jil (I still think she could be scum), I don't know that the continued pushing on Jil is moving us forward as a group.  We either need an argument that can bring the players together on that case or we need to come back to her at a later time.  I was (and am) of a mind that she could very well be scum, but I wasn't able to convince others and I don't think DH is doing any better on this case than I did.  I don't know that all this means DH is scum, but I do think that continuing to push isn't helping us at this point."}

That's my point.  Unless there is something much better on bob (and I don't believe there is), then I have to wonder why Pine and Heliman are still voting for bob.<br><br>- To respond to the walls of text on Nintendoaddict: To me there is a definite difference in the play between bob and nintendoaddict, one that I think is important at this point.  Both have been aggressive.  But, when I go back and read bob, I get a lot more content and pro-town behavior.  There's a lot more heat than light in most of Nintendoaddict's posts. That doesn't make nintendoaddict obvscum, but it certainly leaves him vulnerable to getting a lot of heat in order to find out just what he is."}

It started with <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3124211#p3124211\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, in which DH defends my RVS actions against hiplop and votes him for having \u201cthe sketchiest vote of everyone.\u201d  Now, this first post isn\u2019t particularly scummy on its own, but it IS weird, for two reasons:<br><br>1) He acts as if Hiplop\u2019s vote on me is serious, which it clearly isn\u2019t. <br>2) He defends my play, which is clearly not necessary.  <br><br>The first thing I ask of everyone is to reread the first three pages of this game in its entirety, to get an intuitive feel for how everything looked then.  Posts were short then, so it should take very little time.  The important thing is to try and imagine that you are seeing it for the first time.  As we go through the rest of his play, imagine that you are DemonHybrid, and that you are town.  In doing so, try to build an image of what your personality is, how you see things, and what your motivation is for each post.<br><br>In post 54, I vote jilynne without explaining myself at all.  Immediately after, nintendo <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125494#p31254940\" class=\"postlink\">FoSes</a> me because he doesn\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m sheeping Barry Allen.  Now look at DH\u2019s response to this in post 56:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS: Everyone who is against bob for not realizing how town the guy is</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Try and erase from your memory the majority of this game, and just look at the first few pages.  It\u2019s hard for me to picture why I, as Demon Hybrid, would feel the need to write this.  Let\u2019s assume for a moment that I, a town player, have seen players like archaebob before.  In my experience, players that do what he is doing are usually town, and their play is very helpful.   Therefore, I am annoyed at nintendoaddict for accusing him of being a sheep\u2026and I\u2019m going to make sure the rest of the town <span style=\"font-style: italic\">stops suspecting archaebob</span>(because we CAN'T have that) by joke FoSing them.<br><br>Does that feel like town to you?  It really doesn't to me.<br><br>Town doesn\u2019t know the roles, and most of you were very wary of me, at least in the beginning.  How is it that DH was so confident that he felt comfortable not only assuming I was town, but also proactively derailing any suspicions of me as soon as people posted them?  This was page <span style=\"font-style: italic\">3</span> people.  Town has no reason to buddy that hard.<br><br>And DH was totally serious about defending me too, as evidenced in his next post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\"> unvote vote jilynne1991</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Nintendo/hiplop, do you really think this post has scum motivation? If so, why?<br><br>Also, there's valid suspicion against jilynne1991. Nintendo's FoS may have just been a townie mistake; hiplop is definitely scum, but jilynne1991 is worth looking into.</div></blockquote><br><br>This whole post bespeaks of someone whose mind is racing to uncover the reasons for everything archaebob does and appear perceptive and towny by sharing them with everyone.  Let's take a look:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite>Nintendo\u2019s FoS may have just been a townie mistake;</div></blockquote><br><br>um, okay\u2026what are you saying here exactly?  I guess this is a description of my thought process, and why I moved my vote off of nintendo?  Why are you even sharing speculations like this?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite>hiplop is definitely scum, but jilynne1991 is worth looking into.</div></blockquote><br><br>I doubt he means the bit about hiplop seriously at this stage, but either way, it feels really weird.  DH is in the process of defending me, and he seems to be pretty serious about it.  So, saying that hiplop is \u201cdefinitely scum\u201d is a really weird assertion to insert into the middle of that sentence, isn\u2019t it?  Read the whole post again, in its entirety.  In fact, it feels to me like he\u2019s trying to explain ahead of time why he isn\u2019t himself moving his vote over to jilynne.<br><br>\"I want everyone to know that I agree with archaebob and think he's town, but BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME OF CONTRADICTING MYSELF, I'm going to keep my vote where it is anyways because hiplop is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">definitely</span> scum.  That's noNOT to say I don't agree with archaebob though!  Honest!  I think hiplop is scum, but I can think that and STILL think that archaebob is doing the right thing by looking into jilynne!

Why are you choosing to defend archaebob, and come up with these super specific hypothetical explanations of his thought process?  Aren\u2019t you at all curious about what this guy is doing, and if his intentions are true?  Why do you want to be his friend so badly?<br><br>This is all gut, but I really think he would have been more rebellious and even-handed with me if he were town.  It's not adding up.<br><br>In any case, even if you find nothing damning yet, we're getting a very strange and very specific image of who he would have to be if he were town.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125575#p3125575\" class=\"postlink\">Next post</a>, DemonHybrid outs my pressure vote.

From my experience, it\u2019s scum who is most interested in identifying pressure votes, and this looks to me like another part of his subconscious effort to be ultra-logical, and to neutralize my play.

If he was legit town joining my wagon to help me pressure jil...it would look different, wouldn't it?  And even if we accept that he believes jil is \"still very likely scum\", the phrasing of it as a justification for his belated vote switch is weaksauce and reminds me on every level of how I think about things when I'm scum.  It\u2019s just too <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nervous</span>.  The whole thing.

He's glib, sometimes clever, and an intelligent and direct poster.<br><br>2) Over explaining, nervous, buddying scumbag - You guys see it right?  This side of him always comes out in the same moments, which is when he's fabricating one of the fundamentally town behaviors, such as changing your mind about who to vote, or suspecting someone for reasons that aren't all completely logical.  <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3127385#p3127385\" class=\"postlink\">More weirdness.</a>  He\u2019s now defending his buddying of me to hiplop and telling him to \u201cbe more serious.\u201d  This seems to suggest that he\u2019s not all that confident in his scum read of hiplop.  I assumed that his whole \u201chiplop is definitely scum\u201d thing was a deliberate exaggeration, similar to what I was doing.  That would make sense, right?

It\u2019s obvious what you are doing.  \u201cLet me bring up the flaw so I can show everyone that I noticed it myself and nobody can attack me.\u201d<br><br>4) He really doesn\u2019t deserve it.  And if you really thought he did, if you REALLY thought he was SO scummy that he deserved a flawed argument even though you KNEW it was flawed beforehand, then you would have been voting <span style=\"font-style: italic\">him</span> instead of the thirteen year old who wasn\u2019t doing anything.  <br><br>*cue DemonHybrid dedicating his whole defense to attacking the very last line above this one<br><br>You guys, look at this whole post in its entirety again:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote<br><br>vote archaebob</span>for taking everything too seriously</div></blockquote><br><br>This was a joke vote?</div></blockquote><br><br>yea</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay, so again, the fact that you're taking nothing seriously shows a lack of scumhunting if that is true (as well as the fact that you completely went pages misleading people without saying anything).

I defended you as town once and you lynched me for it. That was a very long time ago, but it was a fairly similar situation and I was town then. Now, I have not yet gone back and put myself in his shoes the way you asked me to. I'm still basing this off my initial reread of the thread and his ISO.

DH is town and outs his partner.  We have two pretty much confirmed townies D1.  Scum have two confirmed PRs (I consider mason a PR until there's only one left).<br><br>2. DH is scum and outs his \"partner\".  We still have two (what appear to be) pretty much confirmed townies D1.  Town gets suspicious when both are alive by D3 and lynches one - we then have a confirmed scum in his \"partner\".<br><br>3. DH is town and doesn't out his partner.  If there's no CC we still have a confirmed townie, same as option 1.  After DH dies, scum either CC the eventual mason claim or they don't.  But look at it this way: we have two people claiming to be DH's partner, in the worst case scenario, we have one confirmed scum and a dead townie (essentially VT at this point).  Good trade-off  If no-one CCs the mason claim there's no problem.<br><br>4. DH is scum and doesn't out his partner.  After DH doesn't die for a couple nights, town gets suspicious and make him claim.  DH is then faced with the choice of either giving up or outing his scumbuddy in the chance that town will believe him.<br><br>Note how 3 is a much better option than 1, unless it happens in LyLo.  If town-DH dies his partner needs to claim the day before LyLo just to prevent scenario 3 from actually being a bad scenario.  <br><br>Now notice how both 2 and 4 are not too great for scum, making mason a terrible fakeclaim.  Scum fakeclaiming mason are pretty much never going to out their \"partner\" for obvious reasons, but then it will be fairly obvious that they were lying about their claim once they survive the night a couple times.  This makes mason one of the worst claims for scum D1, so the chance of DH being scum is tiny at this point.  <br><br>For now, it is best to assume DH is town, which means he should NOT out his partner.  <br><br>The only way scum can get away with fakeclaiming mason is for town to really not know how to handle the claim -preautionary measures that must be taken:<br><br>1. If DH is still alive after a little while we need an investigation/lynch on him.<br>2. DH's partner needs to claim the day before LyLo so scum can't effectively CC.<br><br>That's it.

If we did happen to be wrong, it would be all to easy for a scum to \"accidentally\" trip us over to a ML and then spend the night phase laughing their socks off at us.  That's why, in past rounds I've played here, it is not a good idea to go to L-1 while still waiting for a defense.<br><br>2.

Pine doesn't appear to be <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">that</span> limited in access, posting rather frequently in the thread while claiming to be on V/LA.  At this point, I have to wonder whether that is an accurate claim, or whether Pine is simply hoping that an additional 48 hours will allow the heat to go elsewhere (as it is obviously doing right now). <br><br>I'm being targeted because I pointed out Pine was acting scummy but didn't immediately move my vote.  Then, I came back to the thread and refused to move us to L-1, but still pointed out that Pine was acting scummy.  Now, I'm supposedly scummy for not moving us to L-1, but also for continuing to believe Pine is scummy and voting when my vote would <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">not</span> take us to L-1.  That allows the rest of the players to consider the fact that Pine (I believe) is playing us for time rather than actually making a defense.<br><br>Even if Pine has only smart phone access (must be a great smart phone to allow him to keep up with the thread and post as much as he has while \"V/LA\", let's think for just a moment.

The idea that we should wait for 48 hours for any sort of defense in not appropriate.  It would be much more understandable to post part of a defense and then to say he would give us more when he could get to a computer, but NOT okay to claim he can't access us for a real defense.<br><br>Let's also look at other ways to contribute.  If he is visiting friends or family, they likely have a computer he could use.  If he is in a hotel (as I am right now) he could either use a company-supplied laptop (if he has one) or simply go down to the lobby and use the computer that just about every hotel now has available for use.  If he is in school he can use a computer there (some schools set up firewalls but I've played with plenty of folks who could get around the firewall to play).  <br><br>Simply claiming \"I'm just on a smart phone, poor me\" doesn't ring true - not when asking for 48 additional hours and still actively posting while on \"V/LA\"."}

Going from what he later claimed was a \u201cjoke\u201d vote for Bob to a claimed \u201conly\u201d vote on DH, then back to a \u201cserious\u201d vote on Bob without an explanation (no explanation for the second bob vote was given until I called hiplop out for this).<br>2.\tHiplop out-and-out lied regarding his vote on DH, claiming he had been the only vote on DH at the time, \u201cproving\u201d he was \u201cthinking for himself\u201d.  When I pointed out that there were actually two votes already on DH when he voted, he changed his story to say he was the only \u201cserious\u201d vote on DH.  This was a false claim intended to give him credibility with the rest of the players.<br>3.\tOMGUS\u2019ing me when I called him out, accusing me of \u201cclinging to a wagon\u201d when I had not even voted him at that time.  When I pointed that out, hiplop then claimed he \u201cthought\u201d I was voting for him, which makes that even more OMGUS.<br>As for the changes in posting style at various times in the thread, I consider it to be of interest, but not evidence in and of itself.  I do think it is proof that hiplop is playing with us, changing styles to act more LOL when not getting heat and turning quite efficient and eloquent when FoS\u2019d.   That\u2019s all I have at this point, as it is just D1.  Let me know if you have more questions.  For right now, I\u2019m going to bed as it is near 11:30 p.m. my time.

The kinds of points he is making are what I would expect from an older player who is relatively new to this and is convinced that methodical and fair-minded logic is the key to success.  Also, his reaction and defense to my posts sound towny to me. <br><br>Everything he's said about you is true, hiplop.

About 90% of the case is from posts before you were on vacation and the other 10% comes from scumminess in what you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> post while on vacation.

There's simply not time for anything else.</div></blockquote><br>Ace may well be right, but there is a real problem with that being the case.  I have waited as long as I could to say what I have to say now, hoping that my defense would make a difference.  Unfortunately, we are where we are, and that means I have to tell the rest of the story:<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I am the Tracker.</span></span><br><br>As for why I haven't claimed before now?  It should be obvious that I would not want to out my role as Tracker.  Worse yet, this means we now have two role claims, which is bad for the town no matter what.  But, the wagon is high enough on me, and we have so little time to debate, that I do not believe I have an alternative.  <br><br>I have my doubts about Pine's claim, as it came after days of promising a defense that never came. Further, the claim came with a promise of further \"observations\" that also has never been posted.  That just doesn't seem right, and my gut says that Pine is not telling the truth. But, I don't know with certainty at this point whether he is a lying scum or just a poor player who isn't paying attention to the game.  As for me, I had hoped my defense against what should be an obvious counterwagon would be enough to keep me from having to reveal my role. But, we are where we are, and I can only hope that I either survive today and get protection from any doc that may be in the setup tonight, or that the town holds accountable the people who generated this counterwagon if I'm lynched."}

I was V/LA this past weekend and need some time to really think about what has happened. I will have strong opinions once I catch up. I don't want to throw around any accusations til I get a chance to really review the last 5 pages or so closer, but my inital reads are I believe Barry is town, hiplop's initial comment at the beginning of d2 confused me.<br><br>2. My evenhandedness is because I'm not sure if I believe it or not. I do need to read nintendo more. Initially I believe it although it really would be a very beneficial fake claim for scum. <br><br>3.

I feel very strongly that Barry should out his report. Close to 95% sure he should unless someone can convince me otherwise. Let's look at the scenarios:<br>-Barry is town, his report is on scum rolecop or other visiting role. Scum is forced to fake claim. If they are lynched later in the game and flip scum roleblocker or scum role cop, that makes the person they visited clear.<br>-Barry is scum tracker, his report is fake and on a scum buddy. Him outing report harms town in no way really since that makes him a lying scumwad anyways<br>-Barry is scum tracker, and his report is on town powerrole. Barry knows a town powerrole already and this doesn't hurt us<br>-Barry is town and his report is on town power role. I guess this might hurt us if he is outing specifically doc in a game with no mafia roleblocker.<br><br>I'm actually an advocate of a mass claim. I think mass claiming is one of the most underutilized town weapons in the game. We have a lot of pr claims. Its quite possible at least one of them is fake. Although with 2 potential anti-town killing roles, outing clears this early could be dangerous, meh."}

At this point in time im going to focus on the two right in the middle, Bob and Barry. Just note: Barry is super obv scum, im just trying to consider all scenarios for a buddy. Barry has essentially claimed scum by not going after Nintendo. Its true, its damn true.<br><br><br>Ok, so in the beginning of the day, I mention how weird it is that Bob is still alive, so I assumed the Mafia kill got blocked when attempting to kill Bob, and some sort of Vig killed DH. With Barry Allens tracker claim, this implies that there is a roleblocker, tracker, sensor, a mason team, and another PR (likely doctor, vig, cop etc) on the town\u2019s side.<br><br>There\u2019s no way we have THAT many power roles, and it sounds to me like Barry is covering Bob\u2019s ass.  Mafia would have tried to kill bob no matter what, he\u2019s too strong of a player/pretty much everyone agrees that he is town. Much more dangerous than a Mason.  That's why i thought a vig killed DH, because of how strong Bob is.<span class=\"noboldsig\"> But since the Mafia killed DH, that makes it seem like Bob is mafia.</span> I highly doubt we have a killing role on our side, plus all of the others. The tracker result, even if Barry is town: DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING, it just means that someone visited bob, That guy could have been the mafia godfather, easily....<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Bob, I do believe you're town, because you were visited last night and somehow you are still alive. That says you were likely doc'd. That being said, I believe you should check the springs in your shoes, as they must be worn out from jumping to conclusions. We've lost too many roles at this point, and if you want to lynch me and watch another PR for the town go down you will only be entertaining the mafia. \"There's no scenario that makes sense in which he isn't a scum tracker?\" Are you kidding me? How about the scenario where I'm the tracker for the town? I do believe you are town, and in fact I have really good evidence of that fact, but the impact of your out-there posts is anti-town. Please take a chill pill and stop it.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why do you keep bringing up how town bob is? It doesn\u2019t sound natural at all, and sounds like you\u2019re trying to give him town cred after your inevitable flip. Explain your \u201cevidence\u201d that makes bob town, now.  Again, it sounds like you\u2019re trying to protect bob by continuously bringing up how townie he is due to some unknown evidence<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Barry shouldn't reveal who he tracked, because it won't help us<span class=\"noboldsig\">. He isn't lying about the fact that someone targeted me</span>, it's just definitely not scum, because he's a scum tracker himself. <br><br>That's why he's confirmed scum. There's no way he's faking this result, and that means he can't possibly be town. We do not have a roleblocker, a tracker, a sensor, a doctor, AND a mason team. Get the hell out of here.<br><br>What is much more likely is that we have a roleblocker, a sensor, a doctor, and a mason team, and that scum has a tracker to counterbalance that. Even that is a little unbalanced towards town, as you can see. It's obvious that Barry tracked whoever tried to protect me, and revealed his result today in a townish seeming way in order to keep playing to his fakeclaim. If you think about it, there's really no scenario that makes sense in which he isn't a scum tracker. Even if you don't believe the sensor claim, there is no way that Barry Allen is a town tracker.If you want to keep pretending to be town, you need to NOT reveal who tracked me today. I have no doubt you will find some excuse though.</div></blockquote><br>This smells like a bus,  Barry Allen could have easily \u201cTracked\u201d the mafia. He only knows who that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">one</span> person visited. <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 3) Barry Allen is a scum tracker - In this event, he probably tracked the doctor or something along those lines. He should NOT reveal who he tracked.</div></blockquote><br>Then the only people who know who the lone power role is, would be scum. How is that helpful to the town in any way? You\u2019re trying way too hard to hide this. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that Barry should tell who it is, but your logic is very one sided towards the mafia. If he is scum, they already know the PR, but we don\u2019t. That gives scum an advantage, and since that is what you think he is, why are you opposing him revealing his result? Sounds like you're wanting to keep that edge.<br><br>How do you know, that he isn't lying? <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Barry Allen</span><br><br>Read list (from town -&gt; Scum)<br>Hiplop<br>Ace<br>Foilist<br>Scumhunter<br>Nintendo<br>Heliman <br>Bob<br>Valern<br>Giitah<br>Little Grey<br><br><br>Barry Allen<br><br>As you can see, bob isn't a huge sus of mine, but no one else was willing to consider it, there is a high chance hes scum, but he feels too townie to be scum i guess.<br><br>Anyone else have any thoughts? i didnt go far back for quotes as i am busy, bu if you have anything to add, feel free to share<br><br>Hm, if there is a vig.

Just look at how adamant Bob was that BA absolutely <span style=\"font-style: italic\">had</span> to be a tracker, followed by continued mentions that the person who targeted him was probably a doctor.  I don't buy that.  It's rather easy for BA as a mafia goon to fakeclaim tracker and a result this early, because no one is expecting a mass claim on day 2.<br><br>Now let's assuming BA is a tracker and isn't lying - we clearly don't have a jailkeeper since we already have a roleblocker, so what is the mystery role?  Something less standard for sure, since nothing pops to the front of my mind.  Bob is plainly against Barry revealing who this person is.  BUT, Bob also supports a massclaim.  This is a contradiction.  If bob is telling the truth about his setup speculation he believes that the mass-claim will only out the person who visited him, and the second mason, essentially a VT.  Everyone else will probably claim VT.<br><br>At this point I do believe either nintendo or BA is lying about their claim, however everyone is not considering that scum may have multiple PRs too.  Claiming there's a \"scum tracker\" to balance everything out is near-sighted, there could easily be 2/3 scum with night actions, which also means that town could have another unclaimed PR.  Note that mass-claim is a good way to out any remaining PRs if the scum-team is also highly powerful, but BA outing his tracker result wouldn't do that.  I don't think it's likely that there are more PRs but I don't think it's completely out of the question.<br><br>I am against mass-claim at this point.<br><br>All this leads me to believe that bob is scum.  The subtle contradictions are incredibly scummy for bob-town but they aren't contradictions for bob-scum.  If bob is scum I don't believe BA is scum, scum wouldn't bus that hard D2 imo.

I have made a specific argument about why I think you are lying, and frankly, your posts have bothered me for the entire game.  The last few pages have been a charade of you hitting me over the head with as much fabricated outrage as you can, because you think it looks like a townish reaction.  It doesn't.  Give up.<br><br>I mean seriously, Hiplop is so town it's not even funny.  His play hasn't been very good, but there's no way in hell it's coming from scum, and you know it.  You're picking him now for the same reason you picked him yesterday: it's easy, and it's defensible.  <br><br>You are scum, Barry.  You are also panicking, which I can understand.  But there is nothing you can do to win this game.  Even if you manage to deflect the lynch onto someone else today, you will be dead long before this game reaches lylo.  Do you think I'm wrong about that?  Think again.<br><br>By all means though, please continue pretending to be town.  I look forwards to how much fake anger you can pack into your next post while dodging my arguments again.<br><br>On the other hand, if you want to switch gears now and take a more conciliatory approach to being full of shit, I would love to hear your opinion of the following players:<br><br>Scumhunter<br>Valern<br>foilist13<br>ace<br>Heliman<br><br>Write a full paragraph on each, if you can. If you are truly town, you have no reason not to do this, as your reads will be very useful after you become confirmed.<br><br>Your response to this is also your very last chance to persuade me that I'm wrong.  Be completely honest, and do NOT try to filter your gut inclinations.  Scum has no gut inclinations to filter, which is why your mind is already racing about how to respond to this."}

I've answered this several times, so let me do this one last time.<br><br>Of COURSE I worry about Nintendo's claim.  I don't know if it is legit, and in fact I have some doubt as to whether we have a sensor in the round.  However, as I have repeatedly stated, I do not want to take the chance of being wrong on D2 after we lynched a role on D1 and lost another role N1.  That is NOT the same as accepting nintendo's claim on face value, and it is NOT the same as believing we have a million roles in the round.  Bob has repeated agreed that lynching Nintendo is a bad idea, even though Bob also says there is no way we can have that many roles in the round.  I agree with Bob on this, yet I'm finding a lynch coming my way.  <br><br>There are some things I do not get here:<br>1. How can Bob agree that it is bad to lynch nintendo today, but think that it is bad when I say the same thing?<br>2. How can Bob clear hiplop?  What knowledge does he have, and on what basis has he decided this?<br>3. Even if I am wrong about hiplop, how is being wrong on D2 \"proof\" of scum?<br>4. How can Bob believe me as tracker but not as town?  What knowledge gives him the certainty that I AM a tracker?<br><br>Finally, Bob seems paranoid that I'm trying to lynch him and is basically daring me to put my vote on him.  That is ridiculous and not helping anything here.  <br><br>TLDR:  I am NOT accepting at face value Nintendo's claim, and I have no reason to believe we have so many PRs.  However, given our complete fail record as a town, I see no benefit to taking the risk on D2 after two roles are already dead from D1 and N1.   It is ridiculous on its face for Bob to be against lynching nintendo today but in favor of lynching me because I took my vote off nintendo."}

I haven't been on.  I'm on vacation right now and can't post 24/7, sorry if that's an inconvenience.<br><br>I simply don't understand what's going on with this game right now.  I've been racking my brain trying to think of a role that could possibly explain bob's actions but absolutely nothing comes to mind.  To tell the truth I was originally suspecting a cult and was waiting to see if anything bob posted would help confirm/deny that but apparently cults aren't allowed in normal games.  I can't think of any other role where the targetee would know that they've been targeted (aside from blocking roles).<br><br>This leads me to believe that the real explanation is that bob didn't actually get hit with a role like that and is just scum lying because he knows BA is a townie and thus his tracker report is true.  HOWEVER, in the off chance that I'm blanking on something obvious, I will back off this case at least for now because I don't want to out another PR accidentally.  So we have somewhat of a bob/BA/nintendo triangle here.<br><br>If bob is town, BA is scum and nintendo has to be town.<br><br>If bob is scum, BA is town and nintendo has to be scum.<br><br>So basically bob and nintendo are on the same side.  I don't see any other possible situation.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>.<br><br>Ignoring all reads and looking at this from a completely neutral 50/50 of each lynch being scum:<br><br>If we go bob and he turns out to be town, we risk outing another PR.  If we go BA, we risk losing our tracker, however if so we gain two confirmed scum.  If we go nintendo, we risk losing our sensor, however if so we gain only one confirmed scum.  Nintendo is out of the question for best lynch today by this method.  If bob is town, BA has to be telling the truth about the tracker read, if bob is scum, BA isn't lying about his claim.  I'm almost tempted to go with BA today because it gives us either two dead scum for a town tracker, or a dead scum tracker.  However, BA is also the one out of the three I have the town read on.  Also it's important to note that BA IS A CONFIRMED TRACKER.  If bob is scum, BA is confirmed as town and thus not lying, if BA is scum, bob is town and thus isn't lying about BA being a tracker.<br><br>SINCE BA IS A TRACKER PART 2 implications of the mystery person who visited bob:<br><br>This means in the course of the BA lynch we reveal who the mystery PR is.  Note that we don't get the role from this (could still be a regular role if bob is scum, which I think is more likely).<br><br>In the course of the bob lynch we get whatever info he has on the mystery person he has IF HE HAS ANY.  IF BOB IS SCUM HE COULD AND PROBABLY IS LYING ABOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THE TRACKER RESULT.  Sorry for all caps, but I know not all of you will be reading this whole post.<br><br>In the course of the nintendo lynch we don't get any info on that.<br><br>I'm HIGHLY not enthusiastic about lynching either potential tracker BA or potential sensor nintendo.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@bob</span> - I've pretty much done a 180 on the outing the PR issue since the beginning of this post, you need to out... something, and fast.

I didn't reveal who I had tracked because I didn't want to risk outing a doc.  Instead, we get a roleclaim of something completely different.  I've played mafia on different sites since 2009 (mainly vendetta-strada.com, with a little faster pace with 48 hour day phases and 24 hour night phases, if you want to try that pace give it a try sometime).  However, I had never played a round with either a sensor or a friendly neighbor, so I looked them up in the wiki to get more info. I don't know that I fully get the idea of foilist setting up the QT with Bob, as being able to do that is NOT listed in the wiki for that role.  However, if Foilist is the neighbor, that WOULD explain why Bob KNOWS I'm the tracker.  He would know that he was visited if the GM sent him the Neighbor message from Foilist.<br><br>This would also explain why Bob is so hyper about \"there can't be that many roles in the game.\"  He knows we had a roleblocker and two masons, along with a neighbor.  That's why he can't accept the town also having both a tracker and sensor, as that would mean we have 6 roles minimum for the town.  That doesn't mean we DON'T have a role-heavy round, but it DOES make Bob's reactions make more sense.<br><br>@scumhunter - I didn't have a specific reason for a bad vibe on you D1, it was more of a gut feeling that I couldn't put my finger on.  You WERE on my short list for tracking yesterday, along with Giitah and foilist.  My criteria for picking a target was as follows:<br><br>1. People no one would expect me to track - in case they really were town.  I didn't want to have a tracker report on a dead player on D2, and if there were a player who showed up as a potential tracker target that was town, the maf would likely target them to give me a useless report D2.<br>2. People who could potentially be maf, but not people I had openly suspected D1.  The first criteria crossed off any names of folks I had openly suspected D1, as they could simply not vote for a hit in order to look inno.<br><br>So, scumhunter, bottom line is I only have two things regarding you - a gut feeling that I couldn't put into words D1, and the potential that if nintendo was telling the truth about being sensor you would be in that 2/3 scum group from the votes on Pine that I talked about at the start of the day.<br><br><br>TLDR: foilist was my tracker target, which I would never have confirmed today without him outing himself.  Believe what you will about me, but if you lynch me please take another look at hiplop, as I hope you will when I flip town.  Further, take a look at folks who have jumped on this BW.  I don't know how to defend myself more than I have, and I think it is frankly insane to lynch a tracker on D2, as there could be more info I could provide the town every day that I live."}

I've asked the mod.<br><br>I had a scumread on Ace and on foilist going into Night 1, but immediately ruled out both of them when I was sent the Neighborhood QT.  Foilist told me that ace was the \"other mason,\" and that made a lot of sense to me.  My scum read on them was based on their inexplicable support for DemonHybrid yesterday, and their duel tunneling on nintendo for a case that I didn't really buy from either of them.  I kept mostly quiet about it because my policy is usually to keep quiet about smart scum, avoid the NK, and then nail them later on when there are less players.   However, the support for DH made perfect sense if they were all masons together, as did the coordinated efforts against nintendo, and at the time I assumed incorrectly that foilist was confirmed.<br><br>In our QT, foilist told me that ace knows I've been neighborized.  Obviously, he didn't also tell him that I was going to be told that.  This leaves us with three possibilities:<br><br>1) Foilist is really what he has claimed to be, which is a Mason-Friendly Neighbor, and Ace is a town-aligned mason:<br><br>Ace has tried very hard today to get me outed, and his entire argument about why I'm looking more like scum to him makes no sense if he's town who knew beforehand that I was going to be neighborized by foilist.<br><br>2) Foilist is actually what he claims he is, and Ace is a traitor:<br><br>This is what foilist is now pretending, as evidenced by his ace vote, and a recent post he made in the QT.<br><br>But this doesn't make any sense either.  Why on earth would Ace be playing this way if he was partnered with someone he knew was town?  Foil <span style=\"font-style: italic\">told</span> him that I was neighborized.  Ace knows this.  By going after me like this today, he is confirming himself as scum.  Why?<br><br>3) They are both scum.<br><br>This makes *perfect* sense.  Foilist is a scum neighborizer, who targeted me and pretended that ace, who is actually his scumbuddy, was a mason.  He told ace that I was going to be neighborized, but neglected to warn him about the full scope of his gambit.  Ace didn't know foilist was going to tell me all this, and scum evidently don't have daytalk, and so ace unwittingly picked a strategy that contradicted foilist's ploy.  <br><br>This is the only scenario that makes sense.  Foilist wouldn't have picked a random townie and declared them to be a mason, because that's a confirmable lie that would have come out at the first massclaim, and foilist's whole ploy was obviously to have me believe that two of the scum were masons.<br><br>They are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">both</span> scum.

And I fail to see the connection with this one thing meaning I didn't read the thread carefully, especially since, at the time of this post, you had only read the section specifically about you. <br><sup><span class=\"noboldsig\">2</span></sup> Well, that is an unfortunate byproduct of reading 35 pages in about 28 hours. <br><sup><span class=\"noboldsig\">3</span></sup> This is highly debatable since you claim I am using these scum tactics in a wholly different manner while avoiding the underlying point I was making.<br><sup><span class=\"noboldsig\">4</span></sup> OOooohhh... The whole \"long pretty posts don't make you town and don't mean you read the thread\". Do you think I'm scum or not? Is there scum motivation behind what you are saying because it seems to me that you think I am scum but you aren't saying it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter, 875 wrote:</cite>Don't you like lynching scum?</div></blockquote><br>This is just stupid; especially in a game where all of D1 was discussion about how important it is to provide content and I have specifically asked to wait on the hammer so I could get everything typed up.

Otherwise you are lying scum. I have to give you props on the Sensor fake claim though, even thought it isn't sustainable long term (obviously). As you probably realized, you could have executed it better.

Best guess at this point is that BA is scum (someone that, given our day end interactions, archaebob and I probably would have gotten lynched together).

However, how you sound isn't the point.  Basically, we have a very interesting situation here.  If nintendo is a lying scum as you say, then he has completely backed himself into a corner.  He has mathematically left no possibility other than either 1. xvart is scum or 2. nintendo is fake-claiming and therefore scum.  <br><br>This mean xvart's lynch tells us something really important, because we learn something important for the town either way.  Now, xvart's own reaction looks scummy enough to make it more likely than not that nintendo's claim is accurate (I mean, really, pleading for \"mod error\"?).  That's why I'm more than comfortable with my vote.  But, if by some chance we are wrong, we have an absolute lock on who needs to be lynched the next day.  This is why I don't understand Ace's vote, nor do I understand his reaction. <br><br>One last note on the number of powers:  If this does turn out to be such a role-heavy round, it has taught me something interesting about mafia rounds.  I had always assumed such role-heavy rounds would result in a quick read of reports and a quick win.  Instead, it has created intense debate over whether each role exists and whether we should believe a claim. It also opened the door to at least one mafioso (Foilist) fake claiming a town role and almost getting away with it.  For today's phase, I'm willing to go along with our sensor, especially knowing that if he isn't what he claims to be, then he's backed himself into a very lynchable corner.  I'm leaving my vote on xvart."}

Was Foil attempting to convince Archaebob he was Town? If so, what was the point of that? I think we can all safely say that Archaebob was too dangerous to live another day, he was basically a confirmed Town player. So when Foil went forward with his claim, was he trying to force everyone to kill someone else, alleviate the suspiscions on him, and then kill Bob after that? <br><br>I think the ultimate point of the gambit was to clear Foil in the eyes of Archaebob, claim, get Archaebob to give him a cleared town read, then murder Archaebob afterwards.

He didn't even present any reasoning as to why Ace and Foil had to be scum, hell, this should have been caught on ages ago. This was prior to Ace claiming he wasn't a mason and Archaebob declaring Foil &amp; Ace were scum.

This here sounds like it's mostly the scum-Foilist talking.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>foilist13 wrote:</cite>My history with him warranted it. We have reached the point in the game where archaebob will either cease to suspect me entirely or commit himself to lynching me and whomever he thinks is my scum team. My friendly neighbor ability allows me to talk and confirms me as town. It does not confirm anyone to me. I suppose it's like forming an unconfirmed mason team. As far as him saying he thinks I'm town yesterday, that has absolutely no merit. Archaebob is not exactly a transparent player as you might have guessed. The point in targeting him with my neighbor power was to try and alleviate his suspicions. <br><br>That being said, I don't know that archaebob is town. He could very well be scum.

He seems to not be able to decide whether Pine is a super scummy or just the best lynch out of a few bad ones.  Also at this point I'd like to note that there's no paragraph on Pine in Giitah's reads post (51).<br><br>DAY 2 ON:<br><br>ISO #68 isn't really scummy imo since it's a reasonable townie reaction to try to stop any wagon that builds up that fast but it's still worth mentioning that Giitah was the one who slowed down the wagon.<br><br>ISO #69 isn't town at all (I recall someone saying that earlier), it's just stating the obvious.<br><br>ISO #70-72 is questioning of nintendo that looks like an attempt to be town by latching onto the early suspicion, however in...<br><br>ISO #73 all the suspicion of nintendo evaporates.  There's also a bizarre mention of 4-scum which I simply don't see town making.<br><br>ISO #74 is the inevitable backtrack.  This looks like another weak attempt to be town by thinking that there might be 4 scum.<br><br>ISO #77 is not wanting to make an opinion on either wagon.<br><br>ISO #85 is MORE 4 mafia speculation.  What?  Also he doesn't jump onto the xvart wagon but also doesn't play aggressively against nintendo.  This is passive scum active lurking.<br><br>All of his page 40 is horrible, as far as I'm concerned BA was pretty much confirmed town at that point from the last two claimed power roles being fakeclaims, yet Giitah lists him as a main suspect.  Also it's worthwhile to note that scum were keeping BA alive because apparently they thought they could get him lynched.  Post #995 is particularly scummy:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">BA has been confirmed tracker since d2, why is he still alive?</span> lolololol... I forgot that piece of evidence. ^^</div></blockquote><br><br>That's a scum argument, it doesn't actually make sense.<br><br>Page 41 is backing off as he realizes that he can't get BA lynched.  <br><br>Unsurprisingly, BA dies.<br><br>ISO #107+116 is STILL ON THE THEORY THAT THERE ARE FOUR SCUM.  The continued mentions of this are really, really bad.<br><br>Going for an apathy lynch in #119 this late in the game is bad.<br><br>Contradicts his Valern vote in #124<br><br>#126 is bad:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>I can't see everyone's reads being so wrong on hiplop</div></blockquote><br><br>Or, \"I don't have an opinion but hiplop's way too hard of a lynch to pull off.<br><br>Overall Giitah has been asking too many somewhat irrelevant questions, having too few opinions, non-committal opinions at that, and generally just going with the flow while doing \"subtle\" little things to make him appear town (4 scum theory, little jabs at nintendo without ever following them up until the last second).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Giitah</span><br><br>Yes I'm aware that it's 3 votes to lynch, a 1 vote wagon is not dangerous in the slightest."}

I realize that some of it was for reaction tells which is fine, but most of it was just you being thrifty with your information.

Poor handling of role claims by town.<br><br>Day 3 was just atrocious.  If you know through common sense that one of the power roles is lying you don't just follow all the claimed PR's blindly.  We were planning to have nintendo lynched that day and I even outlined why nintendo HAD to be scum but xvart was still lynched and we got an extra day.  This was absolutely the biggest mistake town made, I honestly did not think we had a hope of winning after foil's gambit but nintendo actually made a really good play here, shifted town's attention away from me, and ended up getting us an extra day and perhaps even more importantly, an extra day + night cycle to forget why the foil situation was important.  As insignificant as the day may have seemed, in my opinion town lost the game day 3.<br><br>After day 3 of course nintendo had to be lynched, which gave everyone more time to forget about foil.  By that time the situation had somehow been twisted and WIFOM'd enough for the foil gambit to be a town tell on me.  I have no idea why Valern was lynched but it was fine with me.  hiplop and Giitah were arguing a bit during day 4 so I just set up the Giitah case day 4 and let then fight it out day 5.  They both had tunnel vision at that point. I could have basically been doing anything in day 5.  It's not that they were playing badly it was just the result of a long sequence of events starting in day 3.<br><br>As for scum play, foil's gambit was dumb but aside from that we were solid imo."}
