This is dumb, because townies would want to play a fair game too.  Also, it's kind of clear (at least to me) that no-lynches are more beneficial to scum (because it limits info for the town), so instead allowing for scum to be killed even though they successfully divided the town enough for a no-lynch would be anti-scum.  As a townie this would be good for your win-condition, sure, but it'd be unfair, and less fun for everybody.  I don't think this is really scummy from FourTrouble, just kind of silly.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's a lot of boring talk between Selkies, MafiaSSK, and Cabd filling the thread.<br>\n<br>\nIn post #135 MafiaSSK looks at FourTrouble's (pretty weak) argument against Katsuki based on the rule thing, says \"yup, sound's about right\" and votes.  Sheeping a wee bit, eh?<br>\n<br>\nPost #149, Selkies votes Katsuki without any kind of reason.  Selkies also professes a town read on MafiaSSK, again without giving a good reason (this was just after SSK aped FourTrouble).  This is a pet peeve of mine, because of how achingly useless it is.  Giving reasons when you vote/give reads is kinda important for explaining how you reached those conclusions.<br>\n<br>\nPost #152, Muffin lists a bunch of reads without any, ANY, explanation for why he has them.  This bugs me, see above.

First piece:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5626894#p5626894\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5626894#p5626894\" data-post-id=\"5626894\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 268</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10647\">Idiotking</a> wrote:</cite>@SSK:  Sure people can be convinced by other people's reasoning, but just kind of \"oh, sure\" is both utterly useless and suggests that you are just accepting it wholesale, without going back and making sure it makes sense.

It adds to the discourse of discussion and whatnot which is definitely a very pro-town action. <br>\nSo when I latch on to this pro-town action, I could see how it could be construed as me trying to get onto their \"town credit\".<br>\nBut that's not what I'm doing here, nor would I have any need to. Not only had multiple people had me as solid town reads, but it's also early enough that it truly doesn't matter.<br>\n<br>\nLet's explore that first sentence though. How the agreeing is useless, and how I'm just accepting it wholesale. I will gladly accept it wholesale that I am accepting those arguments wholesale. That is why I agreed to them without adding any questions or analysis that is true. But I think to address your point of how an \"oh, sure\" is totally useless, I'll have to put it into a more familiar perspective.<br>\nOn occasion there will be political facebook statuses. Then almost undoubtedly there will be a controversial response. Then the original author will respond with another controversial response from the other side. However, both comments will get a certain amount of \"likes\" from people who agree with their statement. Whoever has the most likes is  seen as winning. <br>\nSo what I'm doing by giving a wholesale agree to a statement, is I'm \"liking\" that comment and giving it more credit in relation to other wagons. It is not anti-town. It is not as pro-town as giving a whole other reason, but it is not anti-town and you are wrong to say that.<br>\n<br>\nBut you really do try to hammer it in that all I'm doing is \"copy/paste\"ing and that's scummy. The only real situations that I can think of where it would be as solidly and truly scummy as I think you're seeing it as is if a person were to copy/paste or give a wholesale agreement to a wagon late in the wagon or dare I say even at the hammer. <br>\nAnd that is definitely widely seen and is almost surely going to be called out upon especially by players as talented as say Cabd or Ffery or orcinus. But they didn't. You know why? Because this situation is different.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo let's move onto the second part of your quote there, because that is also wrong. Actually, you know what I'm going to break it up into two. Just for more unique analysis.:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5626894#p5626894\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5626894#p5626894\" data-post-id=\"5626894\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 268</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10647\">Idiotking</a> wrote:</cite>\nAlso, quantity does not mean quality.

I am responding to players as their posts come in. It is not just me posting to myself about cheese for over 100 posts. I am making connections with players and if you cannot see that, then you should learn it. All interactions with players are connections that you can analyze when others flip.<br>\nIt's not fluff. It's me analyzing the situations around me. If the situations around me are fluff, then sure, I'll put in a little bit of humor, but it sure as hell is going to have content. <br>\n\n <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5626894#p5626894\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5626894#p5626894\" data-post-id=\"5626894\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 268</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10647\">Idiotking</a> wrote:</cite> As for what I think was directly \"not unique\", it's your votes.

That's an awful fast turnaround, don't you think?</div></blockquote>\nBut then you say this, that my votes aren't unique. And let's note here that you said my votes, not some of my votes but my votes. So right away, no matter how you look at it, you can see that my vote on Selkies was unique and this tremendously breaks your theory for not only did I give unique reasoning once but I did it twice when I voted them on the two different occasions.<br>\nBut then you reference my opinion switch. This is one of those places where I think your opinion becomes too entrenched in the basics of scumtells. Normally, when a person would switch votes very rapidly it could be seen as scummy. That holds value from the fact that they have no true opinion in the first place and are willing to vote whomever, whenever.<br>\nThere's a couple of problems with this in this circumstance. First, my opnions were never that strong. Ffs, I went back to Selkies on a gut vote. I had no strong opinions on anybody. So when I see logical cases, that I'm willing to put my vote behind, I'm willing to switch my opinion. So that addresses the whomever standpoint. The whenever standpoint is also wrong. For you see, it's still the very beginning of the game, within the first few hours, and there's always a lot of vote-shifting from everyone. People react very strongly  and give out tons of different posts, especially in a game as active as this one. <br>\nSo no, that's not a fast turnaround.<br>\n<br>\nYour vote is based off a large base of inconsistencies and I sincerely hope you reconsider it.", "time": "Tue Jan 21, 2014 8:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

Also, why does it matter that multiple people had you as solid town reads?  Does the fact that several people thought you were town make it true, or that you shouldn't be attacked for scummy behavior?  Also, wouldn't the fact that people could have \"valid\" town reads on you counter your argument that it was too early to matter that you were sheeping?  I'm confused, because you seem to be thinking that 1.  it was too early to matter that you were sheeping, and 2.  it was late enough for people to have valid town reads on you.

I see it as an individually minded town player being worried that even if he or she is actively hunting and aiding the town, he or she might still get randomly lynched because the rest of the town is lazy or indecisive. Although town shouldn't be worried about getting lynched, because the point of the game isn't to make it to the end, it's to find scum. This isn't Survivor. <br>\n<br>\nIn regards to Selkies, pointing out who might be an easy lynch isn't good for the town.

The first paragraph is just saying there is nothing scummy about rule 6, a position that had already been argued and was mostly irrelevant to the game at this point. The analysis of Selkies is just a mundane theoretical point, again not really telling us anything in terms of who the scum are. Ross even frames it in terms of \"not good for the town\" rather than saying Selkies is scummy. It's too safe and shows a lack of scunhunting.<br>\n<br>\nTo put it another way, it feels like Ross is trying to find theoretical positions to disagree/agree with, a lens more likely to come from scum, rather than attempting to genuinely figure out who the scum are. Scum tend to read the game looking for these sorts of theoretical points to comment on because they are safe and don't really expose your motivations. If you look back over the game, the reason Selkies is town is precisely because he has moments where it shows that he's genuinely trying to figure out who the scum are. Ross doesn't have any of that here, while making what appears to be a substantive post, and that's a major red flag, my opinion. There are also some minor points about this post that I really don't like -- the phrase \"This isn't Survivor,\" for example, just feels really fake. It feels like Ross is overstating the point, something scum are prone to do.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5627774#p5627774\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5627774#p5627774\" data-post-id=\"5627774\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 301</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8514\">RossWilliam</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5627705#p5627705\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5627705#p5627705\" data-post-id=\"5627705\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 297</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21303\">Selkies</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5627585#p5627585\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5627585#p5627585\" data-post-id=\"5627585\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 291</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8514\">RossWilliam</a> wrote:</cite>In regards to Selkies, pointing out who might be an easy lynch isn't good for the town.

When I think of people who would be targetted for easy lynches, I think of new players who have no idea what they're doing but are trying to keep up with people posting text walls, so they rack their brains and end up with bs, which gets them targetted pretty easily. Not that new players can't be scum, but I think new player scum tend to be quiet and stay under the radar and try to get as little attention as possible. <br>\n<br>\nWhich is why I think we need to pay attention to Aronis, and also to Mafiassk for saying we should leave him alone just because he's new, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">because if Aronis is scum</div>, that's exactly what we should do if we want to let him keep slipping and scumming along</div></blockquote>\n\nThe first paragraph here, again, is just disagreeing with a theoretical point -- are scum on easy lynches? -- rather than trying to figure out Selkies' alignment. I just don't see why Ross is putting this much effort discussing this point when it has literally no bearing on Selkies' alignment.<br>\n<br>\nThe second point -- pay attention to Aronis/SSK -- is basically saying, \"let's go after easy lynches,\" because they COULD be scum. I'm bolding the key phrase here that really bugs me. When someone is reading the game in terms of what is possible, like X \"could\" be scum, then that person is not really hunting for scum. They're just looking for people they \"could\" get lynched. Town don't read the game that way. They read the game in terms of probabilities, things like X is \"probably\" scum because of Y reason. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5630489#p5630489\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5630489#p5630489\" data-post-id=\"5630489\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 323</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8514\">RossWilliam</a> wrote:</cite>Selkies, if we're laboring under different ideas, could you just explain to me simply what you mean?<br>\n<br>\nAnd Bert, I haven't played mafia in a few years, so anything out of the norm is probably just me resharpening my rusty tools.

And if I was going after easy lynches, I'd be campaigning hard against some who would have a hard time defending himself, this game has a couple. My vote isn't on anyone yet and it'll stay that way until I have more to go on.

what's the fucking point of posts like this?<br>\n<br>\ni'm not a fan of any of the scum hunting they've done so far. a lot of it feels really empty, questions for the sake of asking questions, but doing nothing with the answers. i have no idea what they're doing with their reads at the moment, and i'm not seeing any sort of progression towards something, if that makes sense? like they're probing you about aronis, asking questions about goodfather, etc, but then... nothing.<br>\n<br>\nalso i'm not sure what to make of ffery unvoting me. there are two possible reasons i can think of. one i'm not going to talk about right now. the other is that ffery actually believes she spotted something in my play that she thinks is more likely to come from me as town than me as scum. but she was very vague on what that something is (something to do with me probing people for opinions, when i really wasn't doing anything of the sort at the time). i dunno. didn't really make a lot of sense at the time, and i woulda thought ffery would be trying to engage me and find out why i'm still voting their slot or something. orcinus didn't seem to like ffery's unvote, but he's not doing anything about it, soooooo i dunno what's going on with their read on me now.<br>\n<br>\nso yeah, this isn't exactly a case, just where i'm at with them at the moment and how my read on them has progressed. this is about... half of my thought processes regarding them, actually. there's some stuff i've left out, but i don't want to talk about it right now, and i probably won't any time soon. i don't actually know what i'm supposed to look for in ffery's scum game because i've never seen it, but this isn't making me think of her town game at all, and everything orcinus posts just makes me want to lynch them with fire.<br>\n<br>\ni'm also not putting this much effort into any other read you want me to explain. this is a special exception, just for you, because i'm such a nice guy and all", "time": "Mon Jan 27, 2014 10:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

This is dumb, because townies would want to play a fair game too.  Also, it's kind of clear (at least to me) that no-lynches are more beneficial to scum (because it limits info for the town), so instead allowing for scum to be killed even though they successfully divided the town enough for a no-lynch would be anti-scum.  As a townie this would be good for your win-condition, sure, but it'd be unfair, and less fun for everybody.  I don't think this is really scummy from FourTrouble, just kind of silly.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's a lot of boring talk between Selkies, MafiaSSK, and Cabd filling the thread.<br>\n<br>\nIn post #135 MafiaSSK looks at FourTrouble's (pretty weak) argument against Katsuki based on the rule thing, says \"yup, sound's about right\" and votes.

Selkies also professes a town read on MafiaSSK, again without giving a good reason (this was just after SSK aped FourTrouble).  This is a pet peeve of mine, because of how achingly useless it is.  Giving reasons when you vote/give reads is kinda important for explaining how you reached those conclusions.<br>\n<br>\nPost #152, Muffin lists a bunch of reads without any, ANY, explanation for why he has them.

Although town shouldn't be worried about getting lynched, because the point of the game isn't to make it to the end, it's to find scum. This isn't Survivor. <br>\n<br>\nIn regards to Selkies, pointing out who might be an easy lynch isn't good for the town.

IME scum worry about being perceived as going after easy lynches even in cases where there's some justification.  And even when they don't worry about it, town players who tend to defend easy lynches or scumhunt in easy-lynch bandwagons wind up finding scum.  I'll be happy to provide some recent examples of this, including a micro game where a hydra that Cabd and I were in turned out to be correct about one of the players who jumped on a day 1 \"easy lynch\".<br>\n<br>\nI'm not calling this scummy.  I'm not  even sure it's outdated site meta.  It may just be different approaches to mafia theory.

The first paragraph is just saying there is nothing scummy about rule 6, a position that had already been argued and was mostly irrelevant to the game at this point. The analysis of Selkies is just a mundane theoretical point, again not really telling us anything in terms of who the scum are. Ross even frames it in terms of \"not good for the town\" rather than saying Selkies is scummy. It's too safe and shows a lack of scunhunting.<br>\n<br>\nTo put it another way, it feels like Ross is trying to find theoretical positions to disagree/agree with, a lens more likely to come from scum, rather than attempting to genuinely figure out who the scum are. Scum tend to read the game looking for these sorts of theoretical points to comment on because they are safe and don't really expose your motivations. If you look back over the game, the reason Selkies is town is precisely because he has moments where it shows that he's genuinely trying to figure out who the scum are. Ross doesn't have any of that here, while making what appears to be a substantive post, and that's a major red flag, my opinion. There are also some minor points about this post that I really don't like -- the phrase \"This isn't Survivor,\" for example, just feels really fake. It feels like Ross is overstating the point, something scum are prone to do.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis isn't what I got out of Ross' post, but you do make some good points.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I remember getting really wound up in players calling me 'anti-town' instead of 'scummy' in the Paradox Prime game, and I thought it was horrifically and obviously scummy.

When I think of people who would be targetted for easy lynches, I think of new players who have no idea what they're doing but are trying to keep up with people posting text walls, so they rack their brains and end up with bs, which gets them targetted pretty easily. Not that new players can't be scum, but I think new player scum tend to be quiet and stay under the radar and try to get as little attention as possible. <br>\n<br>\nWhich is why I think we need to pay attention to Aronis, and also to Mafiassk for saying we should leave him alone just because he's new, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">because if Aronis is scum</div>, that's exactly what we should do if we want to let him keep slipping and scumming along</div></blockquote>\n\nThe first paragraph here, again, is just disagreeing with a theoretical point -- are scum on easy lynches? -- rather than trying to figure out Selkies' alignment. I just don't see why Ross is putting this much effort discussing this point when it has literally no bearing on Selkies' alignment.<br>\n<br>\nThe second point -- pay attention to Aronis/SSK -- is basically saying, \"let's go after easy lynches,\" because they COULD be scum. I'm bolding the key phrase here that really bugs me. When someone is reading the game in terms of what is possible, like X \"could\" be scum, then that person is not really hunting for scum. They're just looking for people they \"could\" get lynched. Town don't read the game that way. They read the game in terms of probabilities, things like X is \"probably\" scum because of Y reason. </div></blockquote>\n\nYou do make a good point that he's arguing theory with someone he's not scumreading rather than going after the players he said were in his scumpile.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5630489#p5630489\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5630489#p5630489\" data-post-id=\"5630489\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 323</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8514\">RossWilliam</a> wrote:</cite>Selkies, if we're laboring under different ideas, could you just explain to me simply what you mean?<br>\n<br>\nAnd Bert, I haven't played mafia in a few years, so anything out of the norm is probably just me resharpening my rusty tools.

{"number": 681, "id": "5644471", "user": "Selkies", "user_id": "21303", "content": "I had a look at some of Ross' earlier games.  Without going back to 2009 or earlier, I only found one scum game and he replaced out on day 1 of that game.  In fact, he replaced out of all his 2011 games, though his two town games may have been mod-discretion because of inactivity.  I didn't see anything in the game thread that indicated the reason, other than his last posts being v/la announcements.<br>\n<br>\nGames from 2011:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=15952\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=15952</a> No Exit Mafia<br>\n<br>\nRossWilliams was active in the game for most of day 1.  He was replaced on day 2 after going on v/la.  He was vanilla town.  He came under lynch pressure during day 1, so that factors into the tone of his posts.<br>\n<br>\nReading his ISO I'm seeing a similar style of occasional rhetorical questions with a kind of theory basis,  and providing his own answers.  But, he's putting his votes down in line with the theory he talks about, and he's actively engaging the players he's calling scummy.  He also puts his vote down quite early and moves it around.  He listens to others' arguments and is sometimes swayed by them, or by negative feedback about his play.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=15934\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=15934</a><br>\n<br>\nVanilla town, was replaced on day 2 after going on v/la..  Similar to previous, but he interacts with more players in this game.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=15968\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=15968</a><br>\n<br>\nScum goon.  Made 3 posts before being replaced, including one unsupported vote.  First post was an apology for missing the start of the game.<br>\n<br>\nNext group of games are from 2009 or earlier and I'm not really comfortable drawing conclusions from them.<br>\n<br>\nI had a look at this one:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=10452\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=10452</a><br>\n<br>\nHe was town and his first post was a very short &#8220;my bad&#8221; apology which is in contrast to his scum game above.  In this game his posts were shorter and he posted less reasoning and theory stuff, which is probably a style-evolution thing.<br>\n<br>\nHis initial post in this game <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5627532#p5627532\">289</a> feels more like the second apology than the first.<br>\n<br>\nIf I have time, I'll delve a little deeper.  The main thing is what FourTrouble picked up, that at least early on, he didn't engage his scum suspects in this game, which is different from the 2011 town games.  Also, not voting early in this game is different from those two games.", "time": "Wed Jan 29, 2014 6:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

The post looked genuine to me, something town would say.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So it went from they're most likely to be scum to \"they're just a bit suspicious\" It's kinda like going from a scumread to a 3/4 null 1/4 scum read without any justification. It's like he came under heat and \"Oh nah man it's just a nullscum\"</div><br>\n<br>\n280 - There is nothing scummy about changing your opinion. He explains the logic behind his reads, and it looks more like town given his level of competence (clearly not very high).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">There was no logic behind his Selkies read yet he avoids voting Selkies altogether. Does competence level imply alignment in your opinion?</div><br>\n<br>\n295 - We know scum have daytalk cause of the rules. It isn't a scumslip. He further explains his change in opinion, which in retrospect was a very natural and fluid change in opinion.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Oh, missed that. Okay, I can agree on this point.</div><br>\n<br>\n345 - What do you mean this is a chainsaw defense? To me, this post was pretty town. I don't see scum responding to my request for thoughts on Ross.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why wouldn't they? By that, I mean pseudo-attacking the person suggesting ross being scum.

{"number": 775, "id": "5648888", "user": "Idiotking", "user_id": "10647", "content": "So I'm going to do this person-by-person, alphabetically.  Will post a synopsis of major actions thusfar and my analysis of what that means, followed by a read.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Aronis</div><br>\n<br>\nStarted off in #187 by voting Muffin, calling SSK and Fourtrouble town while calling (in #203) Muffin, Selkies, and Katsuki scum.  None of these are explained.  The only things that had happened so far in the game were the RVS bantering, FourTrouble's Katsuki vote based on Rule 6, and the beginning of the Selkies wagon.  In #228 says that the only reason he has those scumreads is because they \"seem suspicious\" (this is after SSK asks him if it's just because those players had the most votes).  In #280, when asked to elaborate by Katsuki, Aronis repeats the \"Rule 6 being anti-mafia\" thing being suspicious for Katsuki, and implied a Katsuki-Muffin scumteam because Muffin had an unexplained town-read on Katsuki.  He then unvotes, without any explanation for why, since he just gave a reason (weak though it may be) for Muffin to be scum.  Also note the lack of explanation for a Selkies scumread, even though that was directly requested.  In #293 he says the reason he unvoted was because scum would discuss that in their day-QT, and thus drops his reads.  In #391 Aronis outright says he's just trying to blend in, because he's not used to MafiaScum play.  In #603, he votes Selkies for joking and making a lot of clutter posts (neither of which are scummy; Aronis even says joking isn't an \"obvious scumtell\", but it's not even slightly scummy, it's null).  #642 is a post-by-post defense against Notscience's attacks.  OMGUS votes Notscience in #660, without reasoning.  Switches to Ross in #677, again without reasoning.  In #685 he says he had a NULL read on Ross, he just wanted to move off of a Notscience vote because that wasn't going to go anywhere.  Also says he voted Notscience not because he thought he was scum, but because he thought Notscience was an idiot.<br>\n<br>\nAronis has been scummy to the point of being goofy, but his scumtells are all explainable by the fact that he's brand spanking new (joined Jan. 19th), and he's playing exactly how a dumb newbie would.  Unexplained vote switching, OMGUS votes, voting for people he specifically did NOT have a scumread on, etc. are all behaviors of a total newbie.  Aronis is at best a VI, and I would be totally ok with a policy lynch on him, because heaven help us if we go into LYLO with him still in tow.  However, I cannot honestly say he's any scummier than any other newbie (though this is because I have an incredibly difficult time reading newbies).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Null/VI</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Bert</div><br>\n<br>\nReplaced in in #299.  First vote was on Fourtrouble in #313, saying that he didn't buy FourTrouble's explanation for switching to Muffin from Katsuki (because of Muffin's defense of Katsuki because of the Rule 6 thing, Muffin was here and Katsuki wasn't).  Questions the Muffin wagon in #314, basically saying Muffin hasn't been present enough to warrant a wagon.  In #327 he proclaims null reads across the board except pro-town Muffin (and maybe scum FT), and null-scum on Aronis because of weird Muffin vote/unvote.  In #358, says FT asking for everybody's thoughts on Ross (before giving his own) didn't feel \"sincere\".  There were also a few comments here and there about Ross and Goodfather appearing townie, but says Ross might just be his \"2007 playstyle\".  Also scattered around a lot is discussion about VisCon 1523 or something, where apparently Bert did badly.  In #431 votes Ross because Ross's comment about \"I think we'll find scum\" felt cautious.  Also says that 90% of his reads are gut, and demands that we don't ask him about them.  In #440 he goes ahead and lists his reads anyway.  Sigh.  Only scumreads are Ross and FT, so at least there are no contradictions, and his explanation for those reads also meshes with what he stated earlier.  In #474, he says that what he doesn't find convincing about the Muffin wagon is FT's argument that it was scummy for Muffin to say Katsuki was too scummy to be scum because of Katsuki's argument about Rule 6 being unfair to scum (also of note, writing this sentence has given me a nosebleed).  All the while he is saying why he gets FT's reasons for doing pretty much everything, including FT's Aronis and Kenny townreads.  There was some back and forth here, but I can't follow it.  Next vote was on Katsuki in #504, with reasoning (I'm guessing) being Katsuki saying Selkies is scum because it's in their role PM.  Disses Ross's argument about Katsuki not being scum because scum would not check out on D1 (#525).  In #680, says the Aronis and Katsuki wagons are easy to latch onto.  I don't know what this means; does that mean they are easy wagons, and thus we should vote for them?  Or that they are easy wagons, and thus scum would vote for them?  In #689, says he has a 50/50 read on Katsuki and Aronis both, but saying they are both conventionally scummy, while switching his vote to Selkies.  In #690 he upgrades the 50/50 to gut-town reads on both.  In #699 he goes ahead and switches to Aronis (a townread) because he proclaims a town read on Cabd and Notscience (the two people who were pushing him for an Aronis lynch).  In #750, after he has ONE vote on himself, he warns the town that he will self-hammer at L-1.  I would lynch just for this.<br>\n<br>\nBert has made basically constant references to past games, acting as though he's been laughably scummy, saying he's been regularly policy lynched, and most recently saying that he's prone to self-voting at L-1.  This all stinks of appeal to emotion to me, because \"woe is me, I get picked on so much because I am bad\".  It happens often enough (at least once every 10 of his 80-some odd posts) that it seems calculated.  There's just no reason for him to hammer down his VI history so much if he were a townie.  Mentioning it once, maybe twice, sure, if you're the self-loathing type, but over and over and over again?  It looks intentional.  The alternative is that Bert is really just that defensive, but he's doing it with 0 or 1 vote on him.  NOBODY should be that kneejerk defensive.  Overall this is scummy to me because it's putting too much effort into not getting lynched compared to trying to actually scumhunt.  As for the gut reads, I don't like them, because it's easy for scum to fake them if the site as a whole says they're OK, but since it's just a playstyle thing I will let them pass.  The Ross and FT votes at least had some reasoning behind them, and they were consistent, but the Aronis vote is pathetic, and seems sheep-y.  Sure, Aronis is an easy policy lynch, but JUST after professing a town read?  AND after saying that we wouldn't get any info from the lynch?  That just smells of opportunism.  Also, the circumstances behind his Aronis vote make me wonder about a Bert/Cabd/Notscience connection, though at this point I am unsure of other evidence; will watch for further developments.<br>\n<br>\n As a side note Bert, you need to talk less and with more substance.  You are way, way too chatty, and it's clogging up the damn thread.  It's nearly impossible to tell which of your posts are worth looking at and which aren't.  Condense, at least.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Leaning Scum</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-------------------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Cabd</div><br>\n<br>\nVotes Selkies in #27, looks like a RVS vote.  Confirmed later during the RVS chatter.  #227, Goodfather townread without reasoning.  #233, Aronis vote, again without reasoning.  #237, defends his Aronis vote by saying that Aronis being new does not preclude him from being scum, and implying that Cabd has some special newb-reading superpower.  Activity takes a nosedive about now, to the point of calling <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">himself</div> out in #368.  Lots of active lurking, presumably because of illness.  In #520 we finally see some reasoning for the Aronis vote, that being that Cabd \"didn't like the entry\" or SSK's defense of Aronis that Aronis is just new.  #547, Cabd calls out people on the Selkies wagon, asking for reasoning (all but Katsuki).  People on the Selkies wagon at this point were Muffin, Kaboom, Goodfather, and Katsuki.  After this there's a bit of back and forth with Muffin about Muffin's Selkies read, but doesn't post any analysis (just some \"waiting for your wallpost\" type posts).  In #646 calls out selkies wagon again, specifically Kaboom, Goodfather, and Aronis (who had just joined it).  In #697 says \"Really, bert?\" to Bert's explanation that the reason he doesn't want an Aronis vote was because there would be little information gained from the lynch.  This is one of the two (very slight) pushes that makes Bert switch his vote to Aronis (see above).  In #713 says that some of ffery's (who is one of the Selkies heads, I've gathered (I r such a gud detektiv)) responses seem \"off\", specifically quoting Selkies' #703.  In #719 Cabd does not answer Selkies question about the Aronis vote except that \"he's scum\".<br>\n<br>\nCabd's play has been consistently lurky (though at least some of it with good reason), but has not done a whole lot even when present.  He questioned the people on the Selkies wagon, about their reasoning, but never followed up.   I would give Cabd townie points for calling out his own lurking in 368, but given his overtly hostile reaction to the suggestion that it was intentional, I'm not sure this is townie, because any such pressure would have just led to that reaction.  Cabd also seems to want reasoning for votes, but gives very weak reasons himself, such as voting Aronis because he \"didn't like the entry\".  What the hell does that even mean?  That's basically a non-response.  It's equivalent to saying \"because I think he's scummy\" (which, note, he did in #719).  The SSK-defending-Aronis-because-of-newness thing is at least a genuine reason, but seems too weak to carry a vote to me, especially considering there are other people doing more scummy things.  Ultimately this is a null read, because the lurking combined with the odd mix of towntells (wanting to know the reasoning from folks on the Selkies wagon) and scumtells (having crap reasons for his vote on Aronis, minor potential for a connection with Bert) kind of just makes a big bowl of meh.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Null</div><br>\n<br>\n--------------------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">FourTrouble</div><br>\n<br>\nFirst vote was on Katsuki in #32, reasoning being the Rule 6 thing.  Posts reason in #134, that being that scum would be more interested in attacking an anti-scum rule (this is crap reasoning as has been mentioned by many players many times).  Starting in post #159, FT begins bickering with Muffin over the Rule 6 Katsuki vote, leading to a vote on Muffin at #178, reasoning being that Muffin was present, with the underlying reasoning being that Muffin was defending Katsuki for making a pro-scum argument about Rule 6, so by association Muffin is scum.  This goes on for some time.  At post #336 there is the switch to Ross (while calling Selkies town without explaining why).  The Ross vote is unexplained, but later FT asks for other people's thoughts on Ross before he will give his own.  In #327 says Selkies, SSK, Bert, and Goodfather are town, but doesn't say why.  In #341 he says his Muffin vote was because Muffin was overcompensating in the Katsuki defense, going so far as to say Katsuki was TOWN because of that argument.  In #414 he gives his reason for voting Ross, which boils down to Ross using IIOA, and that Ross's posts seem \"fake\".  Also calls out Ross for saying we should go after easy lynches because they (Aronis and SSK) \"could\" be scum.  After defending his delayed-reasoning for the Ross vote, he calls a Ross/Muffin/Katsuki scumteam in #449.  Posts a full list of reads in #457 consistent with past reads.  Strangely claims that one post is all that is necessary to determine a read - unless it's a major screwup I don't think that's true, but whatever.  Most posts since have been consistent with this without adding much.  In #633 he responds to Notscience's post-by-post calling out Aronis.  In the response he effectively just calls Aronis \"weak town\", saying weak townies spend their time trying to survive as well, rather than scumhunt.  His defense boils down to Aronis being stupid, and therefore town, somehow?  (as above, I say Null/VI).  Spends a lot of time after this asking other players for their reads.<br>\n<br>\nI'm getting a town lean from all of this.  Yeah, the Katsuki/Muffin thing was stupid, but considering how long FT kept it up, and considering how controversial it wound up being, it seems town, because scum would have let go eventually, while FT still stands by it.  This is probably just FT being stubborn, but scum have a strong reason to NOT be stubborn, so town points.  I also like the constantly demanding people for reads thing, it keeps people on their toes.  The only major gripe is the Ross non-explanation-for-vote thing, which just seemed very weird.  As I said before, I don't think FT was stupid enough to do something that overtly scummy if he was scum, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, especially since he did follow up with (at least seemingly-though-out) reasoning later.  FT's reads have also been remarkably consistent, which is a plus.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Town</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Idiotking</div><br>\n<br>\nThis would be kind of pointless.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Hell if I know, I didn't read my PM</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-----------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Kabooom</div><br>\n<br>\nJoined at #254, gave an unreasoned vote for Selkies in #355, actively refused to scumhunt in #435, and proddodged in #612.<br>\n<br>\nLurker is lurking.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Null/Anti-town</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Katsuki</div><br>\n<br>\nMade the oft-mentioned statement that Rule 6 was anti-scum in #24.  Voted Selkies in #253, no reasoning.  Said SSK's defense of Aronis based on newness was \"interesting\".  Blatant active lurking ever since.<br>\n<br>\nLurking is bad.  ACTUALLY SAYING YOU ARE GOING TO INTENTIONALLY LURK FOR MULTIPLE DAYS is worse.  Also, voting.  What do YOU think my read is?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Scum/Actively Playing Against Win-con If Town</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">MafiaSSK</div><br>\n<br>\nBunch of RVS chatter at first, though a decent point about how Selkies-town shouldn't be classifying players as strong/weak.  Said Katsuki was giving Nat pre-game advice about Rule 6 rather than being scummy (post #131), but then sheeps FT's Katsuki vote in #135.  In #166 sheeps Muffin's counterargument about Katsuki Rule 6 thing and goes back to voting Selkies (was the RVS vote).  Reasoning (per #172) being gut.  More chatter.  Says Muffin is town in #202, later says Muffin is overdefending Katsuki, and votes Muffin (following Selkies' reasoning) in #231.  Defends Aronis from Cabd's attack in #236, saying Aronis is new, and thus town?  I guess?  Later in #240 says the defense was just because new people wouldn't explain their scumreads (oh come on, you can't ALL be new, people).  Note that Cabd's vote was unexplained, so why did SSK assume that was the reason?  #263 was the start of our little adventure, ultimately leading to a wallpost that I assume was supposed to be impressive in length.  Basically lurked until #467, when he said he wasn't going to respond to me anymore (so I guess that's lurking too).  Nothing much since then, still seems pretty intent on Muffin and nobody else.<br>\n<br>\nI still don't like the sheeping, because it's weaksauce and lets you coast without scumhunting.  And coasting is what SSK has been doing pretty much the entire game.  Has ONLY focused on Muffin the entire time, from what I've seen.  Defense of Aronis was strange, not just because of how unwarranted it was, but because he automatically assumed Cabd was voting because of the lack of explanation for scumreads.  It seems overeager, and thus scummy.  While I share the view that Aronis is newbie and thus his scumtells seem to largely be newbie mistakes, I don't think this absolves Aronis of anything; I'd be OK with an Aronis policy lynch.  SSK seems to think otherwise.  Town props for not breaking under my pressure outweighed by general scumminess.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Leaning Scum</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-------------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">notscience</div><br>\n<br>\nReplaced in at #600.  Votes Aronis in #615, doesn't give a reason beyond quoting Aronis' out-of-nowhere Muffin vote (though it does sort of speak for itself).  Calls out SSK's defense of Aronis as being lynchworthy if Aronis flips scum.  Calls Katsuki town for also calling out SSK and asking why people think she is scum.  #616, calls me out for posting IIOA (which I admit is something I have a tendency to default to on D1, though if my #261 counts as IIOA this post is gonna make him shit bricks).  Also doesn't seem to like policy lynches.  Asks why there aren't any wagons on me or Aronis.  Seems to inexplicably take a liking to Bert without showing any reason why that should be a thing.  Votes Aronis again in #621, just to be double-sure, I guess.  Does a post-by-post analysis of Aronis' play in #629, with the takeaway being \"He's hardcore lurking and trying to sit in the background and push popular wagons in an attempt to blend in and survive\".  More explanation of thoughts in #730, in response to questions from FT.  More stuff, later calls folks out for not posting a lot.<br>\n<br>\nI hate to say it, but this looks town to me.  Very prompt catch-up post, latches on to Aronis immediately and doesn't let go, actually posts reasons for his scumtells (at least when asked) and the reasons make sense.  My major complaints are playstyle/gametheory complaints (for example, I like policy lynches by preference, but he seems to think it's scummy) (also I don't like people who make a lot of very little posts, I like few, big posts), and obviously those aren't scumtells.  The only big, potentially legitimate issue is the kneejerk Bert and Katsuki town reads, but I'm trying to shelf my bitter hatred of gut reads for this game, else I go mad.  However, treating Bert like they are obviously town together is obnoxious, and is a major factor in my thinking there is a connection.  Other than that though, everything seems perfectly town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Town</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWill post reads on Ross, Selkies, Goodfather, and Muffin tomorrow/Saturday, but as it sits (before I determine those reads), I would lynch Aronis on policy, Bert for actively calling attention to past bad play as a ploy to woo town into thinking he's town, or Katsuki for just generally being awful.  SSK would wait until I saw an Aronis flip, due to a major part of the case against him being the silly Aronis defense.", "time": "Thu Jan 30, 2014 10:02 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

First vote was on Fourtrouble in #313, saying that he didn't buy FourTrouble's explanation for switching to Muffin from Katsuki (because of Muffin's defense of Katsuki because of the Rule 6 thing, Muffin was here and Katsuki wasn't).  Questions the Muffin wagon in #314, basically saying Muffin hasn't been present enough to warrant a wagon.  In #327 he proclaims null reads across the board except pro-town Muffin (and maybe scum FT), and null-scum on Aronis because of weird Muffin vote/unvote.  In #358, says FT asking for everybody's thoughts on Ross (before giving his own) didn't feel \"sincere\".  There were also a few comments here and there about Ross and Goodfather appearing townie, but says Ross might just be his \"2007 playstyle\".  Also scattered around a lot is discussion about VisCon 1523 or something, where apparently Bert did badly.  In #431 votes Ross because Ross's comment about \"I think we'll find scum\" felt cautious.  Also says that 90% of his reads are gut, and demands that we don't ask him about them.  In #440 he goes ahead and lists his reads anyway.  Sigh.  Only scumreads are Ross and FT, so at least there are no contradictions, and his explanation for those reads also meshes with what he stated earlier.  In #474, he says that what he doesn't find convincing about the Muffin wagon is FT's argument that it was scummy for Muffin to say Katsuki was too scummy to be scum because of Katsuki's argument about Rule 6 being unfair to scum (also of note, writing this sentence has given me a nosebleed).  All the while he is saying why he gets FT's reasons for doing pretty much everything, including FT's Aronis and Kenny townreads.  There was some back and forth here, but I can't follow it.  Next vote was on Katsuki in #504, with reasoning (I'm guessing) being Katsuki saying Selkies is scum because it's in their role PM.  Disses Ross's argument about Katsuki not being scum because scum would not check out on D1 (#525).  In #680, says the Aronis and Katsuki wagons are easy to latch onto.  I don't know what this means; does that mean they are easy wagons, and thus we should vote for them?  Or that they are easy wagons, and thus scum would vote for them?  In #689, says he has a 50/50 read on Katsuki and Aronis both, but saying they are both conventionally scummy, while switching his vote to Selkies.  In #690 he upgrades the 50/50 to gut-town reads on both.  In #699 he goes ahead and switches to Aronis (a townread) because he proclaims a town read on Cabd and Notscience (the two people who were pushing him for an Aronis lynch).  In #750, after he has ONE vote on himself, he warns the town that he will self-hammer at L-1.  I would lynch just for this.<br>\n<br>\nBert has made basically constant references to past games, acting as though he's been laughably scummy, saying he's been regularly policy lynched, and most recently saying that he's prone to self-voting at L-1.  This all stinks of appeal to emotion to me, because \"woe is me, I get picked on so much because I am bad\".  It happens often enough (at least once every 10 of his 80-some odd posts) that it seems calculated.  There's just no reason for him to hammer down his VI history so much if he were a townie.  Mentioning it once, maybe twice, sure, if you're the self-loathing type, but over and over and over again?  It looks intentional.  The alternative is that Bert is really just that defensive, but he's doing it with 0 or 1 vote on him.  NOBODY should be that kneejerk defensive.  Overall this is scummy to me because it's putting too much effort into not getting lynched compared to trying to actually scumhunt.  As for the gut reads, I don't like them, because it's easy for scum to fake them if the site as a whole says they're OK, but since it's just a playstyle thing I will let them pass.  The Ross and FT votes at least had some reasoning behind them, and they were consistent, but the Aronis vote is pathetic, and seems sheep-y.  Sure, Aronis is an easy policy lynch, but JUST after professing a town read?  AND after saying that we wouldn't get any info from the lynch?  That just smells of opportunism.  Also, the circumstances behind his Aronis vote make me wonder about a Bert/Cabd/Notscience connection, though at this point I am unsure of other evidence; will watch for further developments.<br>\n<br>\n As a side note Bert, you need to talk less and with more substance.  You are way, way too chatty, and it's clogging up the damn thread.  It's nearly impossible to tell which of your posts are worth looking at and which aren't.  Condense, at least.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Leaning Scum</div><br>\n\n</div></blockquote>\n\nBasically, this is a summary/analysis of my every move. What I would like you to see through my shoes is that I look up to some of the players in this game and believe in their reads (if town) more than I would ever trust my own gut-weak reads. I don't have to understand why they are voting someone - as long as I think they're a strong townread, I can sheep them as they KNOW how to scumhunt competitively - the goal is to WIN. Sheeping strong townreads, while swingy as you pointed out and an easy way to coast, CAN be a tactic for weaker players. As for me playing the \"victim card,\" you'd be hardpressed to find anyone say I'm stronger than any other given experienced player in this 13-player game. <br>\n<br>\nNext, appeal to emotion comes through in the posts I write. The chattiness - I think you're not chatty enough - shows how different-styled games we are used to being around.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, the \"referencing past games\" part. That is how I got my title underneath my name \"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.\" I remember feelings that people gave me in past games, and going through this game brings me back to who I remember giving me these similar vibes. It is a way in which I operate. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the self-hammer thing, I was planning to post a similar blurb in ALL of my future games, at the start. This idea just dawned upon me like a day or two ago. You don't know my past and how often I'm lynched - humor is a way to relieve the negativity of having been lynched so much. It's almost like a joke to me, and if I don't see the humor, I'll be all down and stuff. That's not the way to go for me...<br>\n<br>\n\"\"nobody\" should be that defensive\" is something you said about my reaction - the thing is, this wasn't because of Muffin's vote. I was planning, again, to do it in ALL of my future games. Now, I have reconsidered and will definitely modify and use as needed OR with caution. <br>\n<br>\nIf you're looking for good reasoning OR non-gut reads OR voting patterns that make lots of sense, then you will always read me as scum. My votes were all either sheeps of players I townread and believe in, OR I believe to be quite strong players and likely town. You've probably never been in this position (in a sort of hierarchy/level), but imagine being a newbie and not knowing what you're doing. Sheeping might seem appealing if you don't feel like you're going in the right direction.<br>\n<br>\nI appreciate your constructive criticism of the self-hammer bit (trust me, I have heard that many times, maybe just not as harsh), and the condensing thing a million times, but again I'm not really worried about getting lynched in this game because of the players. I believe. <br>\n<br>\nBelief is key.</div></div></div>", "time": "Fri Jan 31, 2014 9:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

You didn't explore Goodfather further despite empty promises, you asked for reasoning on the Aronis read but didn't show concentration/focus on Aronis. <br>\n<br>\nI also feel your only two 'past scumreads' are the only people who had a reasonable chance of being lynched in the fairly recent past. Until we probed you last-minute, you would probably have gone into Night 1 without us having a sort of sense of direction from you. I can't remember many past completed games where this happened with you-town (not Newbie 1429, not Open 534). Might have happened in AA, but you and Nat were leaders there and a huge presence - heck, you LED the Brian Wagon D1. That was no bravado. I don't feel you have used your meta or persuasion powers to your advantage in this game.<br>\n<br>\n/rant over, and no I don't expect you to be lynched today, but that vote is a wake-up call and I'm gonna lead out a vote on you D2 if things don't change real soon.<br>\n<br>\nBert</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5660214#p5660214\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5660214#p5660214\" data-post-id=\"5660214\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1062</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18833\">Bert</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div> <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Selkies</div><br>\n<br>\nNot presenting your reads in clear sight...AH I guess I'm not surprised and I shouldn't be.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I do give you some kudos for saying how a REAL interactive game with Ross TRUMPS the past meta.

Seems like i have a wagon on me, and it seems like its nobody's fault but mine for not being particularly active this game. I don't wanna to be lynched today, so here a breakdown of how i see the game so far:<br>\n<br>\n1. MafiaSSK* - 135 ( seemingly blindly accepts a case on katsuki), 166 (another blind acceptance of a selkies lynch), 231 (gets convinced by selkies of a muffin lynch) 236 and 914 (defends aronis the first time, then jumps on the lynch)<br>\n<br>\nover 100 plus posts with almost no content, multiple vote shifts with little to no justification except for blindly accepting other arguments. 270 is the only semblance of scumhunting<br>\n<br>\nSSK is one of my scum reads<br>\n<br>\n2. Cabd - town; seems to be scumhunting in earnest<br>\n<br>\n3. Selkies(fferyllt+orcinus_theoriginal) - null; not sure about selkies. Still adjusting to hydras<br>\n<br>\n4. zMuffinMan - null leaning town; his playstyle is very foreign to me, a lot of his posts lack justification, but it seems as if he reserves his reasoning for posts like 590. out of the three in the neighborhood, he is 2nd most likely to be town imo (after IK and before aronis)<br>\n<br>\n6. notscience King Kenny - null leaning town; this read is a lot my read on bert. Their posts, also kinda like nachos are more conversational than i am used to. i am also thrown off by the whole in thread qt thing they have going on.<br>\n<br>\n7. The Goodfather** - town<br>\n<br>\n8. Nachomamma8 kabooooom - like bert and NS, i am getting a mostly null vibe, but i am leaning scum just because that was how i read his slot while kaboooom was playing.<br>\n<br>\n9. Bert Karlos4 - same as not science, null leaning town<br>\n<br>\n11. Aronis** - scum (most likely scum in the neighborhood). He has changed his votes almost 10 times, altogether voting for 6 or 7 different people, with little to no reasoning each time. seems to just hop on whatever wagon is convenient<br>\n<br>\n12. Idiotking* - like his playstyle, and i think he is the most likely town in the neighborhood<br>\n<br>\n13. Katsuki* - scum -  seems to be trying to skate by without doing anything. Maybe his meta, but if this is his town game, he is not an asset to our game at all<br>\n<br>\nthose are my thoughts.<br>\n<br>\nI am gonna try to post more in the next couple of days, but i may be busy.</div></blockquote>\n\nHow did you develop a read on kaboooom?<br>\n<br>\nWhat's the basis for your pushing us to scum to null?  You haven't changed the reasoning at all from what I can tell.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's the basis for your notsci town lean?  You've described stuff about his style of play, but there's nothing about what's alignment indicative to it.

Well I have dug into this game as far as Bert can dig in, as far as Day 1 is concerned. <br>\n<br>\nI feel the whole neighborhood is town-ish, especially Aronis after looking at the discrepancies in that scum game I linked to. I had some worries earlier in D2 and at the end of D1 - was trying to decide whether he was more Yiley-1429 Newbie-past or myself-1462-past-mini...but those worries are resolved for now. I feel IK is *probably* town, gives me mathcam/halfpint vibes every which way...<br>\n<br>\nI actually think if there's scum in the neighborhood, it's probably sneaky Muffin. Especially when I think about how he hasn't really done anything of note other than paint a broad-based case on you (Ffery hydra). He seemed to just say \"hey guys, Ross and Aronis wagons are town, so ain't touching unless I gotta at deadline.' Other than that, he has been rather mute. However, what gives me some hesitation is that they are in a neighborhood...HOWEVER, Aronis commented on how the neighborhood has been mostly quiet lately anyway...so................. but my main issue is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">he did not seem particularly interested in discussing why Ross OR Aronis are town</div> I also feel like Muffin should look into what i'm doing and ask me stuff, you know, if he really wanted to find out what alignment I am. But nooooooooooo.... it would also help if you know Muffin he could form a decent scum read too. DIATRIBE OVER!<br>\n<br>\nNow, Cabd is just really town and I don't even know why but I have wanted to call him town like all game. A few days ago I saw a post in this game and was like ugh Cabd please don't gambit again, but whatever it doesn't matter lol. still town IMO. At least, even if he's not super active, he's writing about things that at least look important and to the point. Whoever said that his productivity (or lack thereof) is a scumtell is just wrong wrong wrong. What I really want to know if why he put his vote on Ffery to start today. How was that a viable play for reactions or whatever he was looking for? An immediate jump after creating some doubt at the end of D1 on the Ffery-hydra, and then a jump off just like that.<br>\n<br>\nSo.... probs <div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\">gut</div><br>\n<br>\nTown &lt;Cabddd, IK, Aronis arizona Brony&gt;<br>\n<br>\nnot so town &lt;McMuffin&gt;<br>\n<br>\nNext post coming up after snack time is a post about notscience cos he is worrying me a lil bit.

But with all the discussion about \"oh he has been coached,\" it's an awkward time to change playstyles between nights (that's really suspicious) when scum have daytalk anyway. It's going to garner more suspicion than before, and if he/she survived D1 and all that momentum wasn't enough, what's to say that continuing that scummy play that doesn't stand out as much after a while will lead to death D2? Why change what worked, when there are people like Katsuki being just as scummy where Aronis can hide behind that? Aronis's lynch seems long overdue, and in his/her mindset I don't see the need to change a playstyle between days when it looks so...easy to attack via coaching theories.<br>\n<br>\nI'm biased right now because Ffery-dra really bothers me.

Today, she/he seems to be playing to \"impress\" or \"appear town,\" rather than actually scumhunt.<br>\n<br>\nI just talked myself through this and I kinda wanna vote Aronis now.

So far today, the pattern remains - short posts.<br>\n<br>\nbut yeah, I looked at Aronis's play in that Jester nightless, and was like DUDE this Aronis played the newb card damn well. Aronis was so much more hyperactive and reactive in that game, but here Aronis is so...sullen. and the beginning of the game, which people have said is scummy, he/she actually looked like he/she was trying to scumhunt. <br>\n<br>\nUnlike 292, where each post looked loose and fluffy and off-kilter. So the playstyle change COULD be due to Jester now being used for meta purposes.

I will keep my vote off SSK til we hear from every player, then i will reassess my vote.<br>\n<br>\ndunno if that makes sense, but so far none of the players have called bs, and i have my own reasons for believing his claim", "time": "Fri Feb 14, 2014 10:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=1750", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

As for why he does it as town, fuck if I know but his title is based on him bringing up random fucking games and making random fucking comparisons to them so you picking on that because you don't see the town motivation behind that is invalid because it's happened so many times before when he was town.

{"number": 1896, "id": "5689721", "user": "Idiotking", "user_id": "10647", "content": "So here's how I see things:<br>\n<br>\nAssume that 1 of the neighborhood is scum, and assume that there are 3 scum (which I think is about average for this size of game).  I don't think Nat would be so cruel as to make there be two scum in the neighborhood.<br>\n<br>\nWe have 11 players.<br>\n-3 neighbors is 8 players.<br>\n1 has claimed a confirmable role (at least so far as confirming a distinct NK), so most likely is not scum.<br>\n1 has claimed a doc (which can be verified either via getting scum NK-d or by blocking a scum kill.)<br>\nThat leaves 6 players with about 2 of them being scum.  Assuming Cabd is telling the truth (which he most likely is, because why would scum false-claim a confirmable role?), we have a shot at killing 2 of these players, 1 with a lynch and 1 with a NK.<br>\n<br>\nI think it would be wise for Cabd to specify who is going to shoot tonight, and have SSK protect someone else (or have Cabd put up a short list and SSK protect someone else).  On the off chance that Cabd lists town in the shortlist, scum won't want to run the risk of double-shooting and wasting a NK, so if one of Cabd's list is killed we will have reason to trust him.

Given the sheer amount of spam, it is likely one of these three is scum, out of the three, I'd say SSK is my strongest town read because of his interactions with idiotking on page 11. Specifically post 270, in response from post 261 from idiot king. And on that note, <br>\n<br>\nI get a strong town vibe from idiotking. His posts seem genuine, and his desire for justified votes is not only reasonable, its downright common sense.

The stuff I didn't like about it at the time I still don't like.  There's a lot of hedge to some of these reads, and his vote choice (us) looked opportunistic both for the reasoning (including parroting complaints that other players made to get us to change our posting style and frequency, but calling it scummy) and the timing: 4th on the wagon, which pushed us over the halfway mark.  It's where newbscum votes often fall, especially if the player isn't super aggressive.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635422#p5635422\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635422#p5635422\" data-post-id=\"5635422\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 393</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23369\">The Goodfather</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635395#p5635395\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635395#p5635395\" data-post-id=\"5635395\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 392</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20847\">Cabd</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635297#p5635297\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635297#p5635297\" data-post-id=\"5635297\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 390</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23369\">The Goodfather</a> wrote:</cite>Cabd(overactivity first 6 pages, and then suddenly disappearing.

You can argue that Cabd was also reactive but he had the actual excuse of being ill.  GF upped the ante in a way that added nothing to the game, and it stands out given his low-key play for most of the rest of the game.  I find that when there's tension in a game, some scum players will look controlled and calm until they suddenly don't.  This was an overreaction and I think it was a scummy overreaction.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635549#p5635549\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635549#p5635549\" data-post-id=\"5635549\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 397</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23369\">The Goodfather</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635524#p5635524\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635524#p5635524\" data-post-id=\"5635524\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 396</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21303\">Selkies</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635297#p5635297\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5635297#p5635297\" data-post-id=\"5635297\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 390</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23369\">The Goodfather</a> wrote:</cite>In fact, selkies is my biggest scum read: spamming pages 1-6.

I don't wanna to be lynched today, so here a breakdown of how i see the game so far:<br>\n<br>\n1. MafiaSSK* - 135 ( seemingly blindly accepts a case on katsuki), 166 (another blind acceptance of a selkies lynch), 231 (gets convinced by selkies of a muffin lynch) 236 and 914 (defends aronis the first time, then jumps on the lynch)<br>\n<br>\nover 100 plus posts with almost no content, multiple vote shifts with little to no justification except for blindly accepting other arguments. 270 is the only semblance of scumhunting<br>\n<br>\nSSK is one of my scum reads<br>\n<br>\n2. Cabd - town; seems to be scumhunting in earnest<br>\n<br>\n3. Selkies(fferyllt+orcinus_theoriginal) - null; not sure about selkies. Still adjusting to hydras<br>\n<br>\n4. zMuffinMan - null leaning town; his playstyle is very foreign to me, a lot of his posts lack justification, but it seems as if he reserves his reasoning for posts like 590. out of the three in the neighborhood, he is 2nd most likely to be town imo (after IK and before aronis)<br>\n<br>\n6. notscience King Kenny - null leaning town; this read is a lot my read on bert. Their posts, also kinda like nachos are more conversational than i am used to. i am also thrown off by the whole in thread qt thing they have going on.<br>\n<br>\n7. The Goodfather** - town<br>\n<br>\n8. Nachomamma8 kabooooom - like bert and NS, i am getting a mostly null vibe, but i am leaning scum just because that was how i read his slot while kaboooom was playing.<br>\n<br>\n9. Bert Karlos4 - same as not science, null leaning town<br>\n<br>\n11. Aronis** - scum (most likely scum in the neighborhood). He has changed his votes almost 10 times, altogether voting for 6 or 7 different people, with little to no reasoning each time. seems to just hop on whatever wagon is convenient<br>\n<br>\n12. Idiotking* - like his playstyle, and i think he is the most likely town in the neighborhood<br>\n<br>\n13. Katsuki* - scum -  seems to be trying to skate by without doing anything. Maybe his meta, but if this is his town game, he is not an asset to our game at all<br>\n<br>\nthose are my thoughts.<br>\n<br>\nI am gonna try to post more in the next couple of days, but i may be busy.</div></blockquote>\n\nHow did you develop a read on kaboooom?<br>\n<br>\nWhat's the basis for your pushing us to scum to null?  You haven't changed the reasoning at all from what I can tell.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's the basis for your notsci town lean?  You've described stuff about his style of play, but there's nothing about what's alignment indicative to it.  And how the hell can you characterize bert's play as similar to notsci's in any meaningful way?</div></blockquote>\n\nThey reason why I asked about his kaboooom read is because he's scumreading Nacho on the basis of having developed a scum read on kaboooom.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI want to know where in this:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=37251&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=23421&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... er_sort=Go</a><br>\n<br>\nhe found the data to develop a scum read, especially since his other reads have been so influenced by other players' irritabilities.<br>\n<br>\nThe other two reads I asked about, I don't want to say why at this time.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5678499#p5678499\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5678499#p5678499\" data-post-id=\"5678499\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1414</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23369\">The Goodfather</a> wrote:</cite>I agree with the ssk lynch.

You also didn't do the comically scummy move and jump on the next best wagon (Aronis) - so no panic. <br>\n<br>\nFfery's defense isn't great either. She just sorta melts, which I interpreted as quite scummy. She didn't generate a defense that people go \"wow\" at. Like our past game 1526, where she started flowing some emotional AtE. She didn't even make a defense that worked. However, the lack of reads and cohesion has made me lean scum too. <br>\n<br>\nYou're also not being that interactive with people in this game. Whether that's alignment-indicative, I don't know. You don't ask people who they care about going after the most. The interaction as a whole has been lacking. <br>\n<br>\nLastly, I understand that paranoia can be dangerous, but I feel like you seem to be letting people like me or Cabd or muffin or Nacho off way too easily. I expect you to check and see and make sure we are town, instead of just moving on quickly like you would when reading a newbie in a newbie game.<br>\n<br>\nI do give you kudos (to Ffery, not Orc) for not trying to dig and understand why I'm scumreading you. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5692132#p5692132\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5692132#p5692132\" data-post-id=\"5692132\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2056</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21303\">Selkies</a> wrote:</cite>A lot of stating the obvious here, which I'd consider newbie-null in a more charitable mood.</div></blockquote>\n\nIn this post, I don't see the purpose of saying \"I consider him newbie-null\" in a more charitable mood.

Sorry, rambling here.<br>\n<br>\nI also want to address IK:<br>\n<br>\nYes, sheeping votes is something I'm trying to stop when possible, as it shows I value other people's reads more than I value my own (which from hydraing I have learned is inherently scummy). I defend inactive players sometimes too, you know why? maybe they haven't posted enough, or there's not enough to read from, to get a clear picture. Some players give very little reasoning, which can be scummy. <br>\n<br>\nHere's Guyett. He's kinda giddy about voting people even without having caught up. He hasn't convinced us of anything. And he's comically scummy. But from past experience, I find myself not too concerned about him because it's his playstyle. He emulates that as scum. Some things are never considered town in terms of tells, and so I defend people and take a side. Not fairly quickly, but eventually as the newer/scummy player posts more and more.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also back to null on muffin. It's not alignment indicative for him to poke fun at people.<br>\n<br>\nOK, back to IK. This is the following, and it sums up my view very well.

Some people throw votes and pressure around and use that to find scum, I tend to think out loud and see what people respond to and see how they interact with eachother. You can call it cautious or unagressive, but in my opinion you're more likely to find scum in someone who is trying too hard or being ingenuine. There's no room for townies to be deceptive. And if I was going after easy lynches, I'd be campaigning hard against some who would have a hard time defending himself, this game has a couple. My vote isn't on anyone yet and it'll stay that way until I have more to go on.

I assume that the balance was shifted back to town's favor a little bit with a backup doctor: I don't think neighbors are generally regarded as a strong town force unless they're confirmed to each other, and I don't think that doctor and backup doctor plus a normal mafia team is balanced. So, I think Cabd is telling the truth regardless of his shot failing to go through (trust me, I had a hell of a moment of paranoia earlier about that but double protection roles can be expected to stop at least one kill so Cabd's shot won't eat up a mislynch, so that checks out as well). I think a full roleblocker is a pretty fucking laughable suggestion to make: one shot vig that's compulsive and may be forced to eat up a mislynch when Natirasha thinks vigs are shitty + backup doctor isn't equivalent to cop and cop+roleblocker is acceptably close to balanced. I think that a limited roleblocker punishes power roles that out early, especially since Cabd is forced to shoot Night 2 and thus a successful Roleblock on him shuts down a kill and protective role shenanigans. A bulletproof also makes sense, but I don't think it makes as much sense as a limited roleblocker since less skill and randomly screwing Cabd over for shooting the wrong scum is bleh (although admittedly still a possibility since Natriasha is an ass).", "time": "Sat Feb 22, 2014 11:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=2600", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

It also helps that Cabd was shot last night (which we know since no one has a reason to no kill except for the three claims which all look town to me and make the setup make sense by being town) because that was a stupid fucking kill for the scum team and ffery is pretty night phase focused and wouldn't make a fuckup like that. <br>\n<br>\nI also read Muffin as town: I find his way of sorting me to be pretty convincing, pretty okay.

Bert, I think you can see it even though you don't like the lack of walling about it.  Cabd was basically calling the wagons  on day 2.  People followed and let him because of the timing.  And maybe because he was bleeding vig tells and had been bleeding them basically since his first post of the game where he said his votes counted 3 times as much as anyone else's.

When I'm unsure, it's a decision I put off hoping for more data.<br>\n<br>\nUp until this game day, that has been a factor.  The main reason I wouldn't call him scum was what I've said a couple times.  I think if he were scum he'd put more effort into looking town and doing town stuff.  Paradoxical.<br>\n<br>\nAfter our interactions this weekend, I still feel there's something missing, but maybe it would only come out in his play en extremis right now.  Not going to say specifically what I'm not seeing because I am hoping this game is another data point indicating I have made some good adjustments in how I read him.

I've been noticing in meta dives and in newbie games that more and more, scum players are \"townslipping\" about being ignorant of known data.

Every game i've seen with a vig, the vig has been more than 1 shot. In fact, if i only had a 1 shot ability of any kind, I wouldn't say thats what I was. If I was a neighborizer with only one shot, then I wouldn't really call myself a neighborizer. if i only had 1 vig shot, I wouldn't really call my self a vig. I would say I am a 1 shot vig. You did that once, maybe twice, but not for quite some time.

So, I think Cabd is telling the truth regardless of his shot failing to go through (trust me, I had a hell of a moment of paranoia earlier about that but double protection roles can be expected to stop at least one kill so Cabd's shot won't eat up a mislynch, so that checks out as well). I think a full roleblocker is a pretty fucking laughable suggestion to make: one shot vig that's compulsive and may be forced to eat up a mislynch when Natirasha thinks vigs are shitty + backup doctor isn't equivalent to cop and cop+roleblocker is acceptably close to balanced. I think that a limited roleblocker punishes power roles that out early, especially since Cabd is forced to shoot Night 2 and thus a successful Roleblock on him shuts down a kill and protective role shenanigans. A bulletproof also makes sense, but I don't think it makes as much sense as a limited roleblocker since less skill and randomly screwing Cabd over for shooting the wrong scum is bleh (although admittedly still a possibility since Natriasha is an ass).</div></blockquote>", "time": "Fri Mar 21, 2014 4:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=3600", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

It also helps that Cabd was shot last night (which we know since no one has a reason to no kill except for the three claims which all look town to me and make the setup make sense by being town) because that was a stupid fucking kill for the scum team and ffery is pretty night phase focused and wouldn't make a fuckup like that. <br>\n<br>\nI also read Muffin as town: I find his way of sorting me to be pretty convincing, pretty okay.

Seems like i have a wagon on me, and it seems like its nobody's fault but mine for not being particularly active this game. I don't wanna to be lynched today, so here a breakdown of how i see the game so far:<br>\n<br>\n1. MafiaSSK* - 135 ( seemingly blindly accepts a case on katsuki), 166 (another blind acceptance of a selkies lynch), 231 (gets convinced by selkies of a muffin lynch) 236 and 914 (defends aronis the first time, then jumps on the lynch)<br>\n<br>\nover 100 plus posts with almost no content, multiple vote shifts with little to no justification except for blindly accepting other arguments. 270 is the only semblance of scumhunting<br>\n<br>\nSSK is one of my scum reads<br>\n<br>\n2. Cabd - town; seems to be scumhunting in earnest<br>\n<br>\n3. Selkies(fferyllt+orcinus_theoriginal) - null; not sure about selkies. Still adjusting to hydras<br>\n<br>\n4. zMuffinMan - null leaning town; his playstyle is very foreign to me, a lot of his posts lack justification, but it seems as if he reserves his reasoning for posts like 590. out of the three in the neighborhood, he is 2nd most likely to be town imo (after IK and before aronis)<br>\n<br>\n6. notscience King Kenny - null leaning town; this read is a lot my read on bert. Their posts, also kinda like nachos are more conversational than i am used to. i am also thrown off by the whole in thread qt thing they have going on.<br>\n<br>\n7. The Goodfather** - town<br>\n<br>\n8. Nachomamma8 kabooooom - like bert and NS, i am getting a mostly null vibe, but i am leaning scum just because that was how i read his slot while kaboooom was playing.<br>\n<br>\n9. Bert Karlos4 - same as not science, null leaning town<br>\n<br>\n11. Aronis** - scum (most likely scum in the neighborhood). He has changed his votes almost 10 times, altogether voting for 6 or 7 different people, with little to no reasoning each time. seems to just hop on whatever wagon is convenient<br>\n<br>\n12. Idiotking* - like his playstyle, and i think he is the most likely town in the neighborhood<br>\n<br>\n13. Katsuki* - scum -  seems to be trying to skate by without doing anything. Maybe his meta, but if this is his town game, he is not an asset to our game at all<br>\n<br>\nthose are my thoughts.<br>\n<br>\nI am gonna try to post more in the next couple of days, but i may be busy.</div></blockquote>\nIn this reads list, Goodfather assumes one scum in the neighborhood, which is a nice little mind game for him if he was scum and not in the neighborhood. Having both partners in null leaning town is odd, but not unheard of: interestingly enough, when talking about both Notscience and Muffin, he talks about how he's thrown off by their posting style, talks about how he doesn't like things they are doing... Yet they both end up as town.", "time": "Sat Mar 22, 2014 9:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=37251&start=3825", "forum": "53", "thread": "37251"}

The guy who taught me how to play mafia was the mod, and after the game he pointed up what he felt was a near-fatal error on my part on night 3 or 4.  The cop had claimed and had a guilty on another scum player.  Scum thought there was a protective role in the game and we chose to kill the player we thought was a doc that night rather than target the cop.<br>\n<br>\nThere was no doc.<br>\n<br>\nThe cop had an inno the next day and we had one very precarious path of mislynches left that could get us to lylo and a win.<br>\n<br>\nMy mentor very kindly yelled at me after the game for not targeting the cop for the kill and risking the action failing.
