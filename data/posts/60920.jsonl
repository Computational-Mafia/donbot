His reasoning in #163 has a tone to it that could be interpreted as him looking through Odd's ISO knowing that momentum was building on his wagon and looking for reasons to call Odd a scumread.<br>\n-Elyse: In #168, she says she would be fine with voting for Odd but stops short of placing a vote. Doesn't give reasons but rather implies that it's all already been said, which very well may be true but looks like she's leaving a back door open to come after Odd should he look like the day's lynch.<br>\n-Aqua: More or less does the same thing as Elyse in #172 but is even less open about whether he'd vote for Odd. Most of what he says is a defense, but his wording (\"I see where y'all be coming from on the Oddmusic tone read but I'm not quite sold\") look somewhat like he's letting player know that maybe if they push Odd a little more he would be willing to join in.<br>\n<br>\nLest I be misunderstood, I'll say it right now -- I don't have Insidious or Aqua on the scum side of my reads list.

And yes, your pressuring did have a final influence in my unvoting, but I did this out of fear that people(IE, you and others) would use my own words against me. I really believed I was making valid points over mykonian, and at the time(I was in a frustrated mindset) I was panicked and defensive because I thought you were dismissing my efforts to try and find info. from people. Of course, this probably doesn't even justify that I did indirectly lied to you, but this doesn't mean I'm exactly worthy of a scum vote because I put effort in trying to get opinions.<br>\n<br>\nI just thought people were detracting from getting progress on finding out the readings of others.

He's pushing I guess but he's posted very little and so it's impossible to know what he thinks of current events due to the pace of the game. Not inherently scummy but for the most part nothing constructive and fairly anti-town. He's certainly not helping much. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6645965#p6645965\">Post 140</a> especially emphasizes this.<br>\nVerdict: Somewhat anti-town.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">oddmusic</div>: He'd been waffling a bit before and still hasn't posted a huge amount but I'm definitely liking his posts more now.

Once pressured to unvote, and now, three posts after his initial post on RC, he suddenly decides to go for the vote when Metal does. I don't like his play very much up to this point, and while he has done some good work I don't like how wishy washy he's being.<br>\nVerdict: Slight to moderate scum lean.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Metalcyanide</div>: Good head on his shoulders, posts fairly regularly and with substance. Overall fairly good play, I like him a fair deal.<br>\nVerdict: Moderate town read. There really isn't much to say, he's a decent player.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">mykonian</div>: I agree with odd's points on mykonian, he hasn't posted much and what he has has been mostly useless and unexplanatory. He's being confusing but ballsy and drawing attention to himself deliberately (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6643842#p6643842\">Post 76</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647567#p6647567\">Post 180</a>), which is not typically what scum are wont to do.

People, especially RC, are focusing a bit too much on his apparent correlation with oddmusic. I mean yeah sure I get it, they could be buddies, and the wagon jumping points that eektor had made are valid, but it seems more likely to me that Aqua just saw a point he didn't agree with and argued it.<br>\nVerdict: Slight town read. Conflicted feelings based on others' reads as well as my own reviewing of his posts.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">eektor</div>: Mixed feelings. Aqua makes a somewhat solid case about superficiality but he's been posting alright since then and I think I like him a little. I don't really know what to make of him overall though, I think I'm going to withhold judgement for a while.<br>\nVerdict: Null. No significant lean.

I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649380#p6649380\">260</a>, fairly substantial, he makes good points. I look forward to his hopeful participation.<br>\nVerdict: Null, slight town lean.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">pisskop</div>: There's something to be said for brevity, and though kop's posts have almost never been more than one line, as he says, he does take positions and stances on things, pushes people and questions regularly.<br>\nVerdict: Moderate town lean. He's done good and certainly isn't doing any harm. In general, I like him.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elyse</div>: Elyse is almost boringly town. She's a leader, which scares me a bit as she could just be an extremely competent scum, but when your entire scum case for someone is based on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">just how goddamn town</div> they are, especially on day one, it's a moot point.<br>\nVerdict: Town, until if and when evidence suggests otherwise. I'm quite confident in this one.<br>\n-----<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RadiantCowbells</div>: She takes after my own heart, taking an unrelated plural noun and adjective and slapping them together to form a name. Perfect. Jokes aside, I don't know if I really like RC or not. Aggressive and headstrong, she's either a pushy towny or a regular scum. Still, she makes good points and drives a hard bargain, and I have to appreciate that.<br>\nVerdict: Null. There are scum lean and town lean aspects here so I'm just going to say \"Null\" rather than \"I'm confused as fuck.\"<br>\n<br>\nPhew. That took longer than expected. I'm pretty sure I've adequately collected my thoughts here, and I've decided I'm happy with a Taly lynch today.

Explaining what you did and why you did things tends to put people at ease. Since scum hasn't really bothered to make any moves, they haven't been in tight spots yet (hey, we just finished the RVS), this is \"easy\". Which is wrong with this post and post 124. <br>\n<br>\nThe second thing that is very wrong with this post in particular is the emphasis on \"openly\". This is a given when you are town. The emphasis doesn't make half as much sense when you are town (you are open anyway), but makes more sense from a scum mindset \"I can still be honest about my gameplay so far, there's nothing to find\". <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo the way I see it, Taly is a prime candidate for scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI think you got me backwards, I think the more people understand about what you're trying to achieve gives them more insight instead of just waiting for people to slip up, and then go on about votes with little reasoning behind it.<br>\n<br>\nI'm honest about how things are going because I'm trying to get on page with others in terms of what people are thinking, and how something would affect the town. I can see where you're coming from, but I think the idea of 'I can still be honest so theres nothing to find' to be an instantly scum-motivated mindset just makes me think you're rendering the ability for people to freely communicate their analysis and opinion because you think their putting up a front, instead of actually trying to get something done.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, I never said I was being honest because \"there would be nothing to find,\" I'm being a upfront with people on this so they can see my thought process, and it would be easier to collaborate and get better and less contrived input.<br>\n<br>\nI appreciate your explanation, but it seems to me this type of explanation seems threatening to you, do you think people who are trying to make a bold effort in finding people are the ones who are the most scummy in themselves? I think this can be seen as both scum and town depending on what you see, but I don't think that is a useful reason to pin at someone, when they've made it clear of what their intentions are.</div></blockquote><br>\nWell, could you summarize what you were trying to achieve with this post?

Let see what I can put together in 50 min.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think post by post analysis is very useful, nobody reads it anyway, but otoh I like posting when I read something, so bear with me.<br>\n<br>\nFirst things first, I don't like RC. In general. A post like post 8 puts me off straight away anyway. I think the game would be better off without him, and knowing from the next pages, I'm going to keep thinking that.<br>\n<br>\nMy initial read of Eektor was his random vote as well. His explanation of \"I got tagged, lets pass it on\" is super awkward and scummy. You'd be fine without a reason, and shift of responsibility is just sucky. <br>\n<br>\npage 2 is a giant waste of time. Oh, page three, I remember this one. Taly's unvote of eektor. I did not get this at all. We've really not reached escape velocity from the start of the game, given MC's random vote and subsequent inconsequental responses. Eektor had shown nothing positive yet. And somehow, this was taly's time to unvote and not make any positive move. Just to make sure you understand me, a positive move would be accusing someone, preferably without being prompted by someone else. Initiative would have been a more correct term. Taly shows none here. Which btw is going to come back. The moment Taly gets moving again is when I poke around with half posts (call it whatever you like, either laziness or \"reaction tests\" or w/e, I posted less than I could in the early game and that tends to annoy people). Anyway, that's the point that Taly gets moving against me, that was prompted. So there's that pattern there.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6645385#p6645385\" class=\"postlink\">post 121 by toolenduso[/ur] is pushing taly on a good point. I can't help but like toolen for that, Lemons has voiced similar statements before and after but did less to act on it. In similar way, elyse has voice opinions I had in mind at that time. All can go on the town pile for thinking like I do though. Borders on tunneling from me, but I can afford that day one, I think. In response, 124 is horrible. That's as passive as you are going to get. <br>\n<br>\nHmm, I have lemons as a scumread at that point, lets see if I can retrace what post made me think that. (rereading, he was the first person to talk about dude and my claim being fake. That's a small blemish, really. But i'd expect scum to make such a post more easily. Something to keep in mind)<br>\n<br>\nPage 8 converts my earlier promise of seeing scum in posts of taly into the real case when he finally bites and makes a vote again. As mentioned before, I don't want to call this initiative, it's very reactive to a vague post by me.<br>\n<br>\nAt which point RC goes off on idk what tangent, pushes practically policy lynch suddenly and idk, it's not as if we are playing with shotty here.

Even if they would do that for town cred, I don't think you can just pass that off as me being scum either way. I've justified myself, and even though at this point that really doesn't seem to hold up a lot, that's my defense and I don't agree with all the reasons people are on my wagon. I'm pretty sure there are 1, maybe 2 people on my wagon that aren't even voting for alignment reasons. (RC specifically for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647901#p6647901\">199</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6652354#p6652354\">326</a>)<br>\n<br>\nOverall, it seems like the people who are town-reading me(or not voting against me) are as plentiful as the people who are on a wagon against me. So in terms of me being a D1 lynch, that seems very likely but I don't know what everyone elses thoughts are on about that yet. Nor does it matter much because I've said almost everything I possibly can to make a case, defend myself, give reasons for my thoughts on most everything else, and try to make it known that I am town. I have made mistakes, and that is to be expected since I'm a noob(I am not saying that this an excuse, just something I expected from playing several games on a forum at once.) I just knew this would happen in one of them.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, we are only in the first half of D1 and quite a few people seem confident in a lynch? That seems odd, but nevertheless. I know I haven't been as helpful as town to you guys as I could have been (since Elyses and part of your case is valid on me), but the mentality some people have displayed here really are inconsistent, and I feel like that contributes a lot to most D1 lynches being a townie, or someone who has made accurate predictions about someone.<br>\n<br>\nThis post kind of turned from me defending myself to me talking about logistics of the game. I know few people will actually listen to me now since they probably are happy they aren't getting lynched, I just hope people know the consequences that'd come from lynching someone.

Explaining what you did and why you did things tends to put people at ease. Since scum hasn't really bothered to make any moves, they haven't been in tight spots yet (hey, we just finished the RVS), this is \"easy\". Which is wrong with this post and post 124. <br>\n<br>\nThe second thing that is very wrong with this post in particular is the emphasis on \"openly\". This is a given when you are town. The emphasis doesn't make half as much sense when you are town (you are open anyway), but makes more sense from a scum mindset \"I can still be honest about my gameplay so far, there's nothing to find\".<br>\n<br>\nSo the way I see it, Taly is a prime candidate for scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't think this is really all that good.<br>\n<br>\nAt the time of #124 Taly had just been voted by toolenduso; responding to a vote with a \"defence mechanism\" seems entirely reasonable to me. I am perhaps biased because telling people to ask me questions about my reads and actions so as to understand them is one of my primary \"defence mechanisms\", as a townie.

(even though I don't know how it started really.) Even though her other statements in this back and forth concerned me, she did show that she had a better idea on who is who(she gave indirect reads on aqua and what she knew aqua knew of her), and ultimately said that the whole thing wasn't helping town and I liked to hear that motivation, she seemed willing to do good.<br>\n<br>\nShe's still on my scum list, just not as strong as before.... <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think I'd be willing to not lynch her now because I want to see more before I'm certain she is crazy.... ;p (half-joking)</div><br>\n<br>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Other than her, Myko has really worried me.

You are correct about that, but generalizing that this \"isn't a thing\" gives me a bad gut feeling.

I can get why he would want more info. but I don't think it goes well with him asserting his already validated argument, to someone who could have just been so easily lynched if people change at that point. I didn't see much help it did to others.<br>\n<br>\nMykonian may just be stronger vote than RC, but since everyone seems to be having changed reads, votes, and ideas lately....

He's softening the blow and hoping to not get flak from metal rather than taking a hard stance with his scumread that he was confident enough in to vote for.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then he throws down a horrible vote on RC after RC brought various legitimate points against him.<br>\n<br>\nHe keeps making excuses for himself about how he can't get into the game but he doesn't comment on what's happening in the thread very much when it's easy to do so.<br>\n<br>\nThis post:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6651359#p6651359\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6651359#p6651359\" data-post-id=\"6651359\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 287</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25352\">oddmusic</a> wrote:</cite>Additional thoughts on a couple of players.<br>\n<br>\nMykonian's posting a lot without actually giving reasons for his posts.

A lot of your posts seem like you keep trying to prove a point that has already been proven halfway in this thread already. Can you try to just look at other people right now and see if you change your outlook on this? I think refreshing it gives you quite a bit of insight on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">who really is who.</div> So please, can you give me a read on others? I already know you want me lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Here we go.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIs this your way of indirectly telling everyone that you're not willing to hear what I say because you think everything I do at this point indicates scum?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the real problem here is that you were lying and I pressed you to get the truth.

Now let me show you a few posts where Mykonian was defending you:<br>\n<br>\nMy post emphasizing this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6656970#p6656970\">456</a> did pretty well on this subject. Why was Mykonian complaining to Aqua? It felt like Aqua genuinely believed you guys were headed for a mislynch and you not only:<br>\n<br>\nA) Dismiss him(you and mykonian)<br>\nB) Insult him(mykonian)<br>\nC) Validate that you both were against me and defending each other(mostly mykonian)<br>\nD) Question him on why he was so bent on helping me(you - Elyse)<br>\n<br>\nElyse, why don't you just reflect on yourself for a moment? Have you done that much different?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If eektor should be lynched then why aren't you voting for him?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI already told eektor to dismiss the error in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6657086#p6657086\">459</a> It was a minor calculation error on my part.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I still think you and Mykonian are likely scum candidates. If you're unsure, just as me questions over this.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>No you haven't considering this is the first time you've brought it up.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt was the first time I brought up you and Mykonian being scum, yes.<br>\n<br>\nBut I've elaborated so many times on my reasons and justified myself on my claims and ideas and defended myself. Which saying this again loses credibility, but I'm willing to say it to let everyone know I don't know what more they want from me.<br>\n<br>\nI've also suspected mykonian ever since like.... 13-14 pages ago?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't know what this means.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt means that Mykonian hasn't really elaborated on some of his reads until recently, which most were to defend himself from MY posts. And a lot of what your posts just seems to validate your already validated case, and you're just pushing for me to get mislynched. Not that you'd know until everyone sees on D2 that I was right. If people really do want me out of here.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And then Taly insists he's being genuine. And he softclaims. Softclaiming is a pet peeve of mine and I hate it so so much. It's also a scumtell. A newbtown like Taly would be more likely to blurt out his entire role as a last minute defense. Instead, he's holding his cards close to his chest and leaving an option to claim whatever he wants, but also claiming PR to make people scared of lynching him. He clearly thought about using it as a defense rather than it being a gut reaction. He's scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOh, so you want to know my role? I'm a Town Role-Blocker. I can keep you from NKing everyone who doesn't agree with you. Does that upset you?<br>\n<br>\nI hope this post made you feel better about yourself just for a moment.<br>\n<br>\nNow that Odd is gone, everyones going to want to lynch me now as a scapegoat. If Odd is town, and then I'm lynched as town(which proves I was right)<br>\n<br>\nScum will have an advantage over this game - At least, nobody would have much reason to suspect Aqua anymore. And everyone would know how wrong they were.

Wouldn't surprise me.<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing about this is that Taly did it in response to a post from Elyse where she basically said \"if you were town you would just claim instead of softclaim.\" It's like Taly saw that and thought \"Elyse is telling me how to look town, so I'll do that.\"<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that (and I'll admit I haven't read Taly's last few books word-for-word, but rather skimmed), it looks to me like Taly is calling Elyse scum while talking to her like she's town (as in, \"I hope you're happy with yourself,\" which implies that town has pushed another townie toward lynch, because why would say to scum that you hope they're happy with themselves?).<br>\n<br>\nI do want to go back and actually read Taly's last couple of posts.

His view of lemon as clearly on my side is only because lemon is voting him. It doesn't enter his thoughts that someone might be worried about people buddying. He's just looking at who votes him and who doesn't.<br>\n<br>\nIt's just the entire mindset. Not just defensiveness, but a selfcentered look at the game.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis post eloquently explains my biggest problem with Taly.

My issue with your Tool read is I feel like he hasn't said enough for you to place him on this list as just neutral, but that may be my own issues with his low post count (although his last post is extensive).

The flip which would give the most information this day is Taly, and that's been obvious all day. Metal acknowledges that a Taly lynch would give more information in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6664700#p6664700\" class=\"postlink\">#682</a>, for some reason which seems unrelated to me (\"slips\" pointed out by Elyse - I don't see why this would make a Taly lynch more informative, as opposed to (hypothetically) more likely to flip scum). That being said, I don't see why a town-Metal made that statement about an RC flip. The only way I can make that make sense is, essentially, he's scum and making it up as he goes along.<br>\n<br>\nI may say more later but I'll post this for now.", "time": "Fri Mar 13, 2015 12:12 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60920&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "60920"}

I disagree with a few, notably Tool and Odd but otherwise they seem okay. My issue with your Tool read is I feel like he hasn't said enough for you to place him on this list as just neutral, but that may be my own issues with his low post count (although his last post is extensive). Odd I feel like should be a cautious scum lean that would change to probably town if RC is were to flip scum.<br>\n<br>\nWith that last part said <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RadiantCowbells</span>.

The flip which would give the most information this day is Taly, and that's been obvious all day. Metal acknowledges that a Taly lynch would give more information in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6664700#p6664700\" class=\"postlink\">#682</a>, for some reason which seems unrelated to me (\"slips\" pointed out by Elyse - I don't see why this would make a Taly lynch more informative, as opposed to (hypothetically) more likely to flip scum). That being said, I don't see why a town-Metal made that statement about an RC flip. The only way I can make that make sense is, essentially, he's scum and making it up as he goes along.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt makes about as much sense to me as him assuming that RC's \"result\" on Annie was actually a result on Boon. And for the same reason, it doesn't tell me much about his alignment -- it doesn't really make sense to me whether Metal is town or scum. If he's town, why does he think RC's info would give more information than a flip on somebody who's had more attention paid to them and who he doesn't have information about? If he's scum, why push such a shallow angle on RC when there were far easier things to pick on?", "time": "Fri Mar 13, 2015 7:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60920&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "60920"}

Even if I might wish you'd done it differently (which is to say, more concise and less wallposts) effort is all I have a right to ask for. I don't like that this day has focused just about only on you and the players attacking you (to the exclusion of encouraging other players, who I am scumreading more, to contribute) but I don't think that is something you set out to accomplish, even if it was (partially) a result of the way in which you defended yourself.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What would you do, or think, if I flipped scum?

I might look at them to try to work out which were serious pushes to try to get somebody lynched and which were bussing done for form's sake.<br>\nIn terms of your hypothetical scumbuddies... for starters, a scum flip on you would put Elyse off the table, for a couple of days at least. I don't see her bussing you in this way as very plausible. Mykonian as your partner is slightly more plausible but I'd need an exceptionally good case to do anything about it, even if I came to that conclusion. Given that your wagon has been a primary focus of the entire day I'd be especially looking hard at the people who haven't been committing to much (eektor, TheDudeAbides, Boonskiies... yes I know he's voting for Metal but that's about all he's done, he could switch easily enough) and people trying to push an alternate wagon (which is to say, RadiantCowbells). InsidiousLemons would be entirely plausible as scum bussing you for towncred, toolenduso less so.<br>\n<br>\n...I'm not sure I actually eliminated anyone there.

I'm not anymore. -_- I'm done with defending myself and arguing with some of these people.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">6)</div> I've said all I can, and I'm still probably going to be lynched - and if I happen to survive to D2, I'm going to have a hell of a time trying to get back into a safe position with people.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">7)</div> I don't know how people can say I've faked my role claim, and play...

Otherwise, I don't know why I am in this situation. I've fought against my lynch as Aqua said, other people seem just as scummy as me right now, and most of the people that are TUNNELING me have NOT even MOVED their VOTE since they first put it on ME.<br>\n<br>\nIt's like their play is fully directed in lynching me at this point....

I do think your actions so far are town-motivated as you've clarified, which is where I see a lean of that for you.<br>\n<br>\nRC - I have said my town lean for her is partially gut. Other than this, she has contributed to parts of the thread - I did like her push on you pisskop, about you shooting odd without saying much about it at the time. It tells me she is willing to sit back and find valid reasoning before trying to lynch a person. I think her aggressiveness is more of a town play, it is genuine - and it has received the type of reactions she has been looking for when she uses it. It is useful, hopefully she is town.<br>\n<br>\nAqua - I believe Aqua has said some things where people weren't paying enough attention too. Where is the conversation of the lurkers in this game to be scum? They are just as capable as being scum as the people who have posted the most in this game. He's also done some voting and much-necessary bluffing in his actions - where people haven't really taken him seriously. I think Aqua has deeper insight into this game than people have given credit for - this is partially gut feeling, and the two of our overall interaction in this game.  But he is one of my strongest, just wish some people weren't so bent on lynching me, and try to find other more important things in this game.<br>\n<br>\nSo there are my 2 top town reads.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Just think you missed the joke. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> Nothing too malicious.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOh right, sorry for being negative.

His being nervous about committing to a mislynch he believed would go through, as scum, is the best reason (of a collection of not-that-good reasons) that I can see.

That does raise the possibility of him dying between now and then but if he shoots a townie we probably lose ANOTHER mislynch (between the first shot and the modkill) so it would not be a total disaster.

Mafia dayvig makes little sense to me and SK dayvig makes absolutely zero sense to me. Mafia dayvig because since when do scum get both a nightkill and a daykill? And why would he use it on a player who could have been easily mislynched? SK dayvig because since when do SKs get both a nightkill and a daykill? And why would he out himself as a target for scum to kill so early in the game? And if there were both a mafia faction and an SK faction, what mod/reviewers in their right mind would let that SK make kills during the day and during the night? That's four kills by the end of N1. I mean, come on.<br>\n-At first glance, the idea of having pisskop wait until D2 to take his second shot makes sense to me, if for no other reason than that it should kill any doubts in his claim.

I really think we should be focusing on finding scum on Taly's wagon instead of going for the \"most informative\" lynch.

What I don't like here, is he admittedly was skimming saw the PR claim and kept his vote on Taly.  In fact it seems like his scum read of Taly was strengthened by the PR claim.  I think town would be more cautious especially if they were just skimming.  You don't want to accidentally lynch a town PR.  <br>\n<br>\nSo basically his eagerness to jump on wagons that are gaining momentum and keeping his vote on Taly when Taly soft claimed as well as when Taly outed his role, is what I find scummy.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nThese points are better but I don't find them convincing enough.<br>\n- It's possible that a scum would be slightly more likely to not realise they were not pushing someone to L-1, but that's a pretty big reach. I don't see any particular scum motivation behind it as a deliberate ploy.<br>\n- I kind of like the sequence of posts from #86 through #94 myself, though that is possibly because InsidiousLemons was (apparently) trying to get someone to justify their vote. I don't feel like moving from pushing people to vote for your \"wagon\" to jumping onto another is scummy that early in the game; indeed it might well get the game moving.<br>\n- The jumping onto Oddmusic and Taly is a quite valid point and the one which I find most compelling, considering they both flipped town. However, that's only enough for me to want to take another good look at him tomorrow when he returns or is replaced, rather than lynch him for it today.<br>\n- Considering that InsidiousLemons' posts were pretty sparse beyond the point where Taly claimed I doubt he was thinking the game through thoroughly at that point. It's an interesting point, but there is precedent for townies sticking to Taly after that claim... obviously not all four of {Elyse, Mykonian, IL, Tool} can be scum, and I'd be shocked to find that three of them were.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: pisskop's reasons</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6675692#p6675692\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6675692#p6675692\" data-post-id=\"6675692\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 946</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22990\">pisskop</a> wrote:</cite>I would prefer IL to Metal because IL seems harder to pin down, but I could swing Metal too.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6675701#p6675701\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6675701#p6675701\" data-post-id=\"6675701\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 948</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22990\">pisskop</a> wrote:</cite>I think IL's initial push on Metal was a bus.

If Taly had not been modkilled, I would say go for it. Boonskiies really needs policy shooting, for one. BUT. Since we are now back at an ODD number of people, your shot equates to a lynch. If you shoot town, we have one less mislynch and thus one less day to work this game out, if it comes to that. Unless you're ABSOLUTELY positive you know who the scum are, which I don't get the impresssion you are, taking your shot probably lowers town's chances of winning this game.

I think one of either Elyse or mykonian is scum, but I can't really decide which one is more scummy.  Elyse quickly votes for metal saying its the most informative lynch.  I really think we should be focusing on finding scum on Taly's wagon instead of going for the \"most informative\" lynch.  Then mykonian also doesn't pay attention to the people on Taly's wagon and tries to find interest in getting me lynched. It took him a while to vote for me, though.  <br>\n<br>\nThe reason why I voted for IL is he has been shady all game I think and I think his vote on Taly was pretty low key and he did mention he wasn't sure that Taly was scum, but once Taly claimed he kept his vote on Taly like the claim made him want to keep his vote on Taly.<br>\n<br>\nOther thoughts, I think RC is town, as well as pisskop.

There is an argument to be made for this, along the lines of \"we are better off lynching a slot we can know is scum rather than a coinflip\". That's a reasonable point to make, though I'm not sure I agree - but it is NOT a reason to TOWNREAD Boonskiies. I do not think a reason to strongly townread Boonskiies exists in this game. It also presumably only applies to today's lynch - if Boonskiies is scum, which is quite possible, we can't just never lynch him if we want to win.<br>\n<br>\nIn the final part of this post Mykonian applies process-of-elimination to determine that Toolenduso, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">But he has not actually eliminated Boonskiies</div>. I do not think there is any possible way for Mykonian, as town, to come to the conclusion that Boonskiies is certainly town and that therefore one of Tool, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThe most likely reason for this is that Boonskiies is Mykonian's scumbuddy, and that having come up with a reason to \"eliminate\" him from the pool (a reason which only applies to today's lynch, at best, in fact) Mykonian felt able to ignore him in his process-of-elimination, even though this does not actually make any sense from a town perspective.<br>\n<br>\nIt is also possible, though less likely, that Boonskiies is town and that Mykonian was just lazy. I do find it hard to believe that Mykonian would rule out so juicy a mislynch as Boonskiies though.<br>\n<br>\nI see no way that Mykonian can have come to this conclusion as town. It simply doesn't make any sense for a townie to hard townread Boonskiies here.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\nI also think Metalcyanide is scum but there is the outside possibility that Mykonian is white-knighting him.

Wouldn't surprise me.<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing about this is that Taly did it in response to a post from Elyse where she basically said \"if you were town you would just claim instead of softclaim.\" It's like Taly saw that and thought \"Elyse is telling me how to look town, so I'll do that.\"<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that (and I'll admit I haven't read Taly's last few books word-for-word, but rather skimmed), it looks to me like Taly is calling Elyse scum while talking to her like she's town (as in, \"I hope you're happy with yourself,\" which implies that town has pushed another townie toward lynch, because why would say to scum that you hope they're happy with themselves?).<br>\n<br>\nI do want to go back and actually read Taly's last couple of posts.

There is an argument to be made for this, along the lines of \"we are better off lynching a slot we can know is scum rather than a coinflip\". That's a reasonable point to make, though I'm not sure I agree - but it is NOT a reason to TOWNREAD Boonskiies. I do not think a reason to strongly townread Boonskiies exists in this game. It also presumably only applies to today's lynch - if Boonskiies is scum, which is quite possible, we can't just never lynch him if we want to win.<br>\n<br>\nIn the final part of this post Mykonian applies process-of-elimination to determine that Toolenduso, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">But he has not actually eliminated Boonskiies</div>. I do not think there is any possible way for Mykonian, as town, to come to the conclusion that Boonskiies is certainly town and that therefore one of Tool, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThe most likely reason for this is that Boonskiies is Mykonian's scumbuddy, and that having come up with a reason to \"eliminate\" him from the pool (a reason which only applies to today's lynch, at best, in fact) Mykonian felt able to ignore him in his process-of-elimination, even though this does not actually make any sense from a town perspective.<br>\n<br>\nIt is also possible, though less likely, that Boonskiies is town and that Mykonian was just lazy. I do find it hard to believe that Mykonian would rule out so juicy a mislynch as Boonskiies though.<br>\n<br>\nI see no way that Mykonian can have come to this conclusion as town. It simply doesn't make any sense for a townie to hard townread Boonskiies here.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\nI also think Metalcyanide is scum but there is the outside possibility that Mykonian is white-knighting him. One way or another, given the certainty which Mykonian has displayed towards the slot despite paltry evidence, Mykonian either knows certainly Metal is town or is pushing all-in to try to avoid a Metal lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think I would prefer to lynch Mykonian today</div> but given the trouble we've had actually putting together the votes for a lynch consolidation on Metal may be safer.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Regarding Metaltown and Lemonscum</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Given the way the Metalcyanide and InsidiousLemons wagons formed at the end of day 1, with a Metal wagon remaining from before Taly's flip and then an Insidious wagon forming in response - I do not think that InsidiousLemons scum and Metalcyanide town is a feasible theory.

And it suits me in this light to talk about RC anyway. <br>\n<br>\nNow at the start of the game I had some rememberance of RC, don't even know if I played with him or read games with him. Regardless, early on that memory got quite reinforced. RC is a detriment to his team and the game as a whole. He's not looking to work together and is quite aggressive in that. I don't believe pages filled with argumentation between two or three people get anywhere. Usually it just rehashes the same arguments anyway and people get more mad with each other, making the argument more about emotion than anything.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's the issue that this annoys me. Now, just like with people arguing, that doesn't make me read the opposite party any better. I'd be inclined to call such a person scum. Don't want to though, for one, RC doesn't live long anyway because of his play, and for second, if he was scum, playing the way he did, he'd go over the top somewhere \"leading the town to their doom\". So I don't want to lynch him, on the other hand I know he's not helpful. Gotten that far, I stopped acknowledging him and only spoke about his person anymore, that part of the game could wait two or three days. I wasn't going to put a stamp on his allignment at that point, and reading him and arguing with him would likely make my chances worse than actually letting it go and playing with other people.<br>\n<br>\nNot that it helped anything, in the end. Still think it was the proper course.

There is an argument to be made for this, along the lines of \"we are better off lynching a slot we can know is scum rather than a coinflip\". That's a reasonable point to make, though I'm not sure I agree - but it is NOT a reason to TOWNREAD Boonskiies. I do not think a reason to strongly townread Boonskiies exists in this game. It also presumably only applies to today's lynch - if Boonskiies is scum, which is quite possible, we can't just never lynch him if we want to win.<br>\n<br>\nIn the final part of this post Mykonian applies process-of-elimination to determine that Toolenduso, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">But he has not actually eliminated Boonskiies</div>. I do not think there is any possible way for Mykonian, as town, to come to the conclusion that Boonskiies is certainly town and that therefore one of Tool, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThe most likely reason for this is that Boonskiies is Mykonian's scumbuddy, and that having come up with a reason to \"eliminate\" him from the pool (a reason which only applies to today's lynch, at best, in fact) Mykonian felt able to ignore him in his process-of-elimination, even though this does not actually make any sense from a town perspective.<br>\n<br>\nIt is also possible, though less likely, that Boonskiies is town and that Mykonian was just lazy. I do find it hard to believe that Mykonian would rule out so juicy a mislynch as Boonskiies though.<br>\n<br>\nI see no way that Mykonian can have come to this conclusion as town. It simply doesn't make any sense for a townie to hard townread Boonskiies here.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\nI also think Metalcyanide is scum but there is the outside possibility that Mykonian is white-knighting him.

This happens later when he votes Myk after Aqua's case.<br>\n-#1012 is another good example of this, but a particularly weird one. He gives a list of three people he wants town to consider lynching, then all it takes is Aqua asking about eektor for Metal to say eektor should be on the list as well. It looks like scum testing the waters for as many lynches as possible/not having a valid reason to scumread people.<br>\n-Metal's vote for RC in #1143 is weird because I don't think there was like any support for an RC lynch at that point. There are several possible scum explanations, him not caring about lynching because he's not town/being too scared of how he would look if he voted for IL/not wanting to vote for a buddy. This happened the day before the D1 deadline.<br>\n-Same with the vote for mykonian in #1202. RC was the only other person voting myk at that point, and it's p weird in my opinion that so close to deadline he goes from scumreading RC to voting with RC on a wagon nobody else is interested in.<br>\n-He finally votes for IL in #1263, but it's an hour before deadline and he makes sure to point out that everybody else made him do it by not going along with his unpopular wagons.<br>\n-Level of anger at Boon in #1349 isn't justified and therefore seems manufactured.<br>\n-The whole \"semi-crazy\" and \"just a theory\" thing in #1412 doesn't make sense given his later explanations. I asked him about this and he said he put that in there as a reaction test, but if you want to reaction test then it doesn't make sense to say that your read isn't even really a read, but more just a wild idea. I think this comes from a scummy mindset of wanting to test the waters and give yourself an out if people don't agree.

The below was written before that hammer, to give it a little context.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\nOkay, dealing with the less likely stuff first.<br>\n<br>\nIf Mykonian flips town then I'm not sure why Boonskiies would spaz out at me like he did if he is mafia. If he really thinks that having a go at lynching me is a good idea, why not wait until after Mykonian flips town? His present behaviour makes sense (kinda) only if he's trying to stop a Mykonian lynch. I'm not certain Boonskiies is town in this case but I think I would require a good explanation as to his recent actions to lynch him.<br>\n<br>\nBesides that I'd basically need to rethink the entire game if Mykonian flips town.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\nIf Mykonian flips scum, lynch Boonskiies. Do not go lynching into possible scum (eektor, say) when there's an obvious one under your nose. I'm not saying you can't think about other people but don't go flipping them until you've lynched Boon (and probably Metal, too).<br>\n<br>\nIf Boonskiies (somehow) flips town... I dunno. The below probably still holds to some degree, except you'll now be looking for two mafia rather than one. The only difference is that there will have been NO mafia on Metal before the Taly flip.<br>\n<br>\n---//---<br>\n<br>\nThe remainder of this post (at least, most of it) assumes that Mykonian and Boonskiies will flip mafia. I was going to make some huge wallpost summing up the game... but I spent a lot of time not getting anywhere and eventually gave up. The following will have to do.<br>\n<br>\nMetalcyanide is probably the most likely to flip mafia for reasons previously mentioned. The one thing which makes me seriously question this is Mykonian's attitude towards him at the end of day 1... my feeling is that Mykonian knew something I didn't about Metal. (The whole \"I think he'll flip town; do you still think he'll flip scum?\" thing.) Then again, I think Mykonian and Metal knew they had to distance there, maybe my feeling here was Mykonian's actual intent. &lt;shrug&gt;.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If Metal flips town</div>, take a really good look at Elyse. In that case, the two wagons Elyse has pushed (Taly and Metal) were both town, and she's been rather unenthusiastic about a Mykonian lynch. (Though I'm not sure why she would push all-in to get the Metal lynch today, since if he flips town today Mykonian and Boonskiies probably get lynched in the next days anyway and it would compromise her a fair bit). I tried to meta Elyse but didn't really get anywhere worthwhile. If she hasn't played for 6 months or a year her meta could be different anyway.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Toolenduso</div>: You said you'd lost to Elyse's scumgame at some point IIRC. Keeping that in mind, what makes you confident she is town here?<br>\n<br>\nI still have a hard time believing that I failed to get a Metal lynch D1 if the Insidious slot is scum but Boonskiies was voting Metal and Mykonian tried to \"hammer\" Metal at some stage... maybe the scumteam just couldn't help that wagon any more than they did.<br>\n<br>\nAbout eektor... I dunno. I kind of liked the way he came at me over the \"defensive\" posts in d2, in that he did not try to make a bigger thing out of it than it was but also did not just ignore it (I feel that scum might have just not bothered pursuing an angle on such an unlikely lynch). That is a pretty piss-poor reason for a read, mind you. Eektor has been V/LA at some rather awkward stages as far as reading him is concerned. I have made other comments about eektor (in particular in response to tool's arguments), you can search my ISO for them. I think I found on a cursory read of eektor's meta that he tends towards the \"reciting facts\" rather than \"making judgements\" style as town, so that might not be a good point against him.<br>\n<br>\nTool is probably town, though his defending Mykonian lately made me a little worried.<br>\n<br>\nTheDudeAbides is very likely town. Don't lynch him unless you have some amazing case which I can't see.<br>\n<br>\nUnless there's another town PR Pisskop is town, no matter who (if anyone) gets shot before him. If someone else claims another town PR I'd probably lynch them before Pisskop, so there's that too.<br>\n<br>\nSo, the short version of the above... if you lynch Mykonian, Boonskiies and Metalcyanide and the game still isn't over, I'd lynch one of {Elyse, Bellaphant, Eektor}. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'd like to talk about those three in the remaining time</div>.

At the time, I believed this was to draw attention away from his \"scumbuddy\" Mykonian, which obviously was disproved by the Mykonian flip.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, if Metal and Mykonian are both town, then I can well imagine Boonskiies bussing the hell out of his scumbuddy in that situation.<br>\n<br>\nTool's lack of reaction to this case sticks out like a sore thumb too. Sure, he mentioned it... but either he should be scumreading Boonskiies (in which case he should have done something about it by now) or townreading Boonskiies (in which case he should be concerned that a townie is voting for and scumreading him at MYLO). I suppose maybe I can buy that Tool's just more interested in pursuing Eektor, but... meh.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Process of Elimination</div><br>\nI believe that Elyse and TheDudeAbides are town. Recent interactions with Eektor have persuaded me that he is likely also town. That leaves Metalcyanide, Toolenduso, Bellaphant and Boonskiies. <br>\n<br>\nMetal-Tool-Bellaphant is the only other likely possibility given those townreads. It's possible, but... meh. Tool has looked pretty genuinely interested in lynching Metal.<br>\n<br>\nThere is also the point that <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Pisskop</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Mykonian</div>, Eektor and TheDudeAbides all townread Metal. I am not so stuck on myself as to think I can't have been wrong about Metal. It's possible he's scum... but at this stage I feel it is less likely. His posts towards the end of both days looking desperate to get a flip on someone, and his push on Elyse today being pointlessly suicidal if he's mafia, tend to support that theory.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, Metal and especially TheDude have been lurking hardcore day 3, and that does not please me at all.<br>\n<br>\nAssuming that the scumteam includes Bellaphant, I think at least one of Boonskiies and Tool just about has to be mafia. I could conceivably replace Boonskiies with Metalcyanide or mayybe TDA/Elyse, or replace Tool with Elyse (as the other person on neither Insidious nor Mykonian) or TheDudeAbides (perhaps a scum bussed IL and voted Mykonian early, and I don't think it's Eektor).

I don't even care how scummy he made himself look, if he'd posted SOME argument for that read, I'd have read it and evaluated it. I might even have been persuaded by it. But if he isn't even attempting to convince other players his reads are right with arguments to that effect, that's not him playing to his wincon, as far as I'm concerned.", "time": "Thu Apr 23, 2015 8:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60920&start=1950", "forum": "53", "thread": "60920"}

I also was rereading the first part of the game and it confirmed my suspicion that IL was scum.<br>\n<br>\nI have to admit this game was pretty frustrating, especially after day 1 which couldn't have ended worse for town.  And everytime I'm town, my reads are always wrong.  The only reade I was correct in was Aqua town but everyone had that.  And also metal town but I wasn't too sure about that one.  <br>\n<br>\nIn regards to Boons, I started Day 3 thinking Bella is scum and Elyse was probably scum (but most people thought she was town and so best to deal with it after Bella), then Boon posted and I went to Bella is scum and Boon is her scum buddy.  Boon gave no explanation of reads and had a cocky attitude that he was 100% correct and since he had me as scum I knew his theory was full of crap.  Figuring out the game is one thing, but if you make yourself look scummy or can't explain your reads, it is useless.  <br>\n<br>\nScum team played well but town just couldn't get together and challenge the scum team at all.  There were some clues, I think we should have lynched tool when he was asking Aqua to vote for metal so he would feel comfortable voting.  I also thought it strange when I was questioning TDA and Elyse came on and tried to deflect the attention from him to other people.  I thought that she defended TDA there, but I was set on Bella and Boon at that point.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I think I will take a break from playing mafia.

I was pretty sure we were going to win as soon as I saw that Elyse was on the team, and I'm happy I got to be on a scum team with her. The strength of this team, I think, was in the way we interacted with each other. I think each member did a good job of paying attention to the other two without giving them a free pass or bussing them outright, as well as avoiding suspicious statements/observations about them.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know why y'all are so down on boonskiies, I enjoyed having him in the game. He's a fun player to have around and brings a more light-hearted style of play to the table which I think is often lacking in games.

It wasn't my intent and it's not something I want to do, even if it's scum theater.

As for the twilight mechanic, I wasn't a huge fan -- just because it lengthened the nights by quite a bit and honestly because it was something I didn't know how to deal with as scum. When I play scum I'm used to just scoring a mislynch and then allowing myself a bit of a cool-off period during the night where I can take a little focus away from the game for a couple days (not that I ignore the scum thread or anything), but twilight was kind of like this awkward place for me where I had to keep up the charade of not knowing what the person would flip.<br>\n<br>\nIf it's nice for players in different time zones to have, though, then I can definitely understand why more mods would consider doing it and I would accept it.", "time": "Fri Apr 24, 2015 4:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60920&start=1950", "forum": "53", "thread": "60920"}
