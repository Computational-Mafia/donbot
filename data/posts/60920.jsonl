Treat others with respect, play the game the way it was meant to be played, and have a good time!<br>2. You may PM me at any time if your have a question, I'm human and I make mistakes. Any in game mod request should be bolded, so that I can see it. You may post any vote count errors in thread.<br>3. I have the final say in all rule disputes, and may change a rule at any time.<br>4. Days will last 14 days, and nights will last 3 days.<br>5. You must post once every three days. The you will receive two prods, the third offence will result in replacement. If you are unable to meet your posting obligations please VLA.<br>6. Red is my color, don't use it.<br>7. You may have up to 4 V/LA's total, 3 V/LA's in a 2 game day period, or 2 V/LA's in a one game day period. If any of these are exceeded, I will look for a replacement.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">Important game rules(breaking these rules can result in punishment including modkill.)</span></span></span><br>1. Do not quote your role pm. You may paraphrase your role pm if you decide to do so.<br>2. Do not paste any correspondance you receive from me. You may paraphrase.<br>3. Do not talk about this game outside of the game while the game is still in progress, unless you are given permission to do so in your role PM.<br>4. Do not post any game information after you die.<br>5. Play to your win condition. This means do not out your teammates out of spite, etc.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">Voting rules:</span></span></span><br>1. You may vote by typing <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Monkeyman576</span> in bold.  Anything close to the correct format will count, but it must be bolded. Misspellings and votes without a colon will count. You do not have to type unvote to unvote, although if you do it helps keep track of things.<br>2. A player is lynched when the vote count reaches (X/2)+1 votes, where X is the number of players alive. So it there are 13 alive, it wout be 7 to lynch, with 11 alive, it would be 6 to lynch, etc. <br>3. There will be 12 hours of twilight following each lynch, regardless of when I log in to check the vote count or when the lynch is announced.<br>4. If any player has a vote count other than 1(i.e. a non voter or double voter), it will be reflected in the vote count.<br>5. Each player is allowed one \"bah!\" post after they are lynched, but may not reveal any game related information after the lynch is announced."}

This is why my vote was retracted, and until I can get a better view within all this jungle of requotes and replies, I haven't seen much to indicate anyone is much town or scum.

I'm trying to find a way to be more concise and shorter in my paragraphs. Aside from that, I'm just thinking it is easier for others to get on the same page as me if I explain my position, it gives people more upfront information about me instead of them needing to poke information from me. I am receptive to peoples questions because I want a better idea of who is most likely to be town or scum as much as they do. I don't really get why me justifying my position on my actions seem panicky, I'm just doing what I think is best to put things in perspective."}

To me it sounds like he is scum hunting based off the people who seem to show awareness and thought process in their words, which can be a townie and scum thing depending on whether it is used to help town or to manipulate them. It's valid, but it doesn't seem to hold up as a strong scummy read, at least to only try and get information. So I'd say his vote is gauging for reactions, which can be either alignment, it is too early to tell someones intentions just off of that."}

Even though her scumhunting may be town-motivated, I just haven\u2019t seen something I liked yet. <span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Reading: Slight Lean Scum</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Can you elaborate on your case on Aquanim? <span style=\"font-style: italic\">And supposedly the other 3 people you've seem to think were good lynches this early in D1?</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Toolenduso</span></span></span> \u2013 I do believe Tool has made some good points in assessing how I\u2019ve come across to others, and his idea of putting up a scum case towards me seems a little incoherent. I wouldn\u2019t say he has put up a strong case with me, but from what I\u2019ve seen of Tool in his interactions to others, he seems to be a stronger player in how he words himself. I haven\u2019t seen enough to tell alignment, but my reading on him so far would be: <span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Neutral</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Tool, what are your opinions on the most prominent posters so far?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">oddmusic</span></span></span> \u2013 The only thing I\u2019ve defended with odd over was the possibility that the wagon against him wasn\u2019t credible. He already justified he had a bad day, and only one post of frustration can come from either a town or scum. That said, it really rubbed me the wrong way when he talked about the possibility of Aquanim and I being a scum team, especially when we were the ones trying to keep a detracting wagon from forming. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Where did that come from?</span>  I have done very little to buddy with Aquanim other than stating my opinion that I think his patience and approach to this game is a lot easier and more efficient to deal with than most other peoples\u2019 reactions so far. (I\u2019m not one to talk, but those are my thoughts.) I am unsure of him. I think odd is trying to find credible and justified reasons to appear safe, which I can see from both alignments with a wagon on them. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Reading: Neutral</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Do you think the wagon against you is justified? If not, who do you think is worth a push for scumreading?<br><br><span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">mykonian</span></span></span> \u2013 My reactions to mykonian were a little off, I\u2019ve understood that now. I guess I have a better view on his thinking, the small opinion posts he is dropping indicate that he wants to get reactions from others. (Wanting to drive responses through votes.) Which I think is necessary for getting information, even though I feel his suspicions are misplaced I have found some posts that I think are decent from him. I wish he posted more though. <span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Reading: Slight Town Lean</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">After you have read this entire post</span> what are your thoughts on me?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Elyse</span></span></span> \u2013 I have mixed thoughts about Elyse. Her getting us out of RVS and her assessing everyone for info and greater desire to find progress in questioning others seems very town-motivated. I think she\u2019s one of the strongest players in here. But this also makes me worry because she could be a very smart scum, and in looking at her win ratio, she seems to be very good at either alignment. I also don\u2019t see her readings on everyone particularly, and I say this to encourage some insight form her. Anyway my gut tells me she is town, I just hope that is and that her vote on me is realized to be misplaced. (Even though I\u2019ve given her valid reason to vote due to sketchy play, that is all I can say but I hope my vibe gets across.) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Reading: Slight Town Lean</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> What do you think about RadiantCowbells?<br><br><span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Metalcyanide </span></span></span>\u2013 I was skeptic due to the attention he seemed to have obtained earlier in this day, but at seeing his recent posts, I\u2019m liking them. I appreciated him giving concise reads about everyone so far, and I took his read on me as encouragement from him to explain my reads to you guys. Which is good for keeping the town together and getting useful information instead of just wagons and reactions. <span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Reading: Moderate Town Lean</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Since you basically just did a read, what do you think about the people who have <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> responded? Also, what do you think about my reads?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Aquanim</span></span></span> \u2013 I think out of everyone in this game Aquanim has been the most revealing in his actions, reads, and analysis\u2019. He is yet to jump on others with a vote(something I kind of failed to do), and openly admits that he doesn\u2019t know enough of someone to have a read on them and I like that. RCs argument against him seems to be very fluffy and lacking real substance. I do have doubts about what are his readings on the most active people so far, but he seems genuine. This is subject to change, especially since this is early in the game but Reading: <span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Moderate Town Lean</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Do you have any specific opinions on me, so far?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">InsidiousLemons</span></span></span> \u2013 I don\u2019t know much about his reads, I do think he is genuine. He\u2019s expressed at the very least polite opinions in and outside of game speak on the thread. I think being genuine is a good town trait, it gives others deeper insight to your emotions and thought processes. Other than this, I think the thoughts he has put on about peoples posts are so far useful in contributing to a case on someone.

His reasoning in #163 has a tone to it that could be interpreted as him looking through Odd's ISO knowing that momentum was building on his wagon and looking for reasons to call Odd a scumread.<br>-Elyse: In #168, she says she would be fine with voting for Odd but stops short of placing a vote. Doesn't give reasons but rather implies that it's all already been said, which very well may be true but looks like she's leaving a back door open to come after Odd should he look like the day's lynch.<br>-Aqua: More or less does the same thing as Elyse in #172 but is even less open about whether he'd vote for Odd. Most of what he says is a defense, but his wording (\"I see where y'all be coming from on the Oddmusic tone read but I'm not quite sold\") look somewhat like he's letting player know that maybe if they push Odd a little more he would be willing to join in.<br><br>Lest I be misunderstood, I'll say it right now -- I don't have Insidious or Aqua on the scum side of my reads list.

And yes, your pressuring did have a final influence in my unvoting, but I did this out of fear that people(IE, you and others) would use my own words against me. I really believed I was making valid points over mykonian, and at the time(I was in a frustrated mindset) I was panicked and defensive because I thought you were dismissing my efforts to try and find info. from people. Of course, this probably doesn't even justify that I did indirectly lied to you, but this doesn't mean I'm exactly worthy of a scum vote because I put effort in trying to get opinions.<br><br>I just thought people were detracting from getting progress on finding out the readings of others. I'm sorry I won't be dishonest like that again, I know these words don't have so much credibility, but I really have nothing else that I can say to that. If I were scum, I probably would have just kept avoiding you about admitting this. I just realized at that moment it would be best for me to be open and tell you what I really thought so I would not have anything to suspect or hide.<br><br>If this doesn't make you see my position then I don't know what will, can you tell me what you don't understand in my post if you don't?<br><br>*Also, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649309#p6649309\">259</a> are where my full reads so far are at, if you've read them.

He's pushing I guess but he's posted very little and so it's impossible to know what he thinks of current events due to the pace of the game. Not inherently scummy but for the most part nothing constructive and fairly anti-town. He's certainly not helping much. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6645965#p6645965\">Post 140</a> especially emphasizes this.<br>Verdict: Somewhat anti-town.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">oddmusic</span>: He'd been waffling a bit before and still hasn't posted a huge amount but I'm definitely liking his posts more now. He seems more focused and sure of himself, and what he has posted is solid. Not much to go on but I'm liking what I see for the most part, especially his last 3 or 4 posts.<br>Verdict: Tentative town lean. I hope to see more good things to come from him.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Taly</span>: Oft panicky under pressure, as I've said before, and while this isn't necessarily a super bad thing I don't like how he's twice now sheeped another player. Once pressured to unvote, and now, three posts after his initial post on RC, he suddenly decides to go for the vote when Metal does. I don't like his play very much up to this point, and while he has done some good work I don't like how wishy washy he's being.<br>Verdict: Slight to moderate scum lean.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Metalcyanide</span>: Good head on his shoulders, posts fairly regularly and with substance. Overall fairly good play, I like him a fair deal.<br>Verdict: Moderate town read. There really isn't much to say, he's a decent player.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">mykonian</span>: I agree with odd's points on mykonian, he hasn't posted much and what he has has been mostly useless and unexplanatory. He's being confusing but ballsy and drawing attention to himself deliberately (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6643842#p6643842\">Post 76</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647567#p6647567\">Post 180</a>), which is not typically what scum are wont to do. He's certainly a strange player and he's been fairly unreadable.<br>Verdict: Slight scum lean. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Question @mykonian</span>: Did you ever explain your personal reasons for immediately disliking eek's posts?<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Aquanim</span>:  Posts often and makes good points, hunting, responding to questions. People, especially RC, are focusing a bit too much on his apparent correlation with oddmusic. I mean yeah sure I get it, they could be buddies, and the wagon jumping points that eektor had made are valid, but it seems more likely to me that Aqua just saw a point he didn't agree with and argued it.<br>Verdict: Slight town read. Conflicted feelings based on others' reads as well as my own reviewing of his posts.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">eektor</span>: Mixed feelings. Aqua makes a somewhat solid case about superficiality but he's been posting alright since then and I think I like him a little. I don't really know what to make of him overall though, I think I'm going to withhold judgement for a while.<br>Verdict: Null. No significant lean. Convince me, if anyone would like to try.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">toolenduso</span>: Barely anything to go on here. I'm working with 6 posts, only half of which were in the last two days. I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649380#p6649380\">260</a>, fairly substantial, he makes good points. I look forward to his hopeful participation.<br>Verdict: Null, slight town lean.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">pisskop</span>: There's something to be said for brevity, and though kop's posts have almost never been more than one line, as he says, he does take positions and stances on things, pushes people and questions regularly.<br>Verdict: Moderate town lean. He's done good and certainly isn't doing any harm. In general, I like him.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span>: Elyse is almost boringly town. She's a leader, which scares me a bit as she could just be an extremely competent scum, but when your entire scum case for someone is based on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">just how goddamn town</span> they are, especially on day one, it's a moot point.<br>Verdict: Town, until if and when evidence suggests otherwise. I'm quite confident in this one.<br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">RadiantCowbells</span>: She takes after my own heart, taking an unrelated plural noun and adjective and slapping them together to form a name. Perfect. Jokes aside, I don't know if I really like RC or not. Aggressive and headstrong, she's either a pushy towny or a regular scum. Still, she makes good points and drives a hard bargain, and I have to appreciate that.<br>Verdict: Null. There are scum lean and town lean aspects here so I'm just going to say \"Null\" rather than \"I'm confused as fuck.\"<br><br>Phew. That took longer than expected. I'm pretty sure I've adequately collected my thoughts here, and I've decided I'm happy with a Taly lynch today. Even I was unsure of my exact feelings on everyone until this post forced me to consider every player individually, and I've come to the conclusion that Taly is at the top of my scum list.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Taly</span>"}

Explaining what you did and why you did things tends to put people at ease. Since scum hasn't really bothered to make any moves, they haven't been in tight spots yet (hey, we just finished the RVS), this is \"easy\". Which is wrong with this post and post 124. <br><br>The second thing that is very wrong with this post in particular is the emphasis on \"openly\". This is a given when you are town. The emphasis doesn't make half as much sense when you are town (you are open anyway), but makes more sense from a scum mindset \"I can still be honest about my gameplay so far, there's nothing to find\". <br><br><br>So the way I see it, Taly is a prime candidate for scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think you got me backwards, I think the more people understand about what you're trying to achieve gives them more insight instead of just waiting for people to slip up, and then go on about votes with little reasoning behind it.<br><br>I'm honest about how things are going because I'm trying to get on page with others in terms of what people are thinking, and how something would affect the town. I can see where you're coming from, but I think the idea of 'I can still be honest so theres nothing to find' to be an instantly scum-motivated mindset just makes me think you're rendering the ability for people to freely communicate their analysis and opinion because you think their putting up a front, instead of actually trying to get something done.<br><br>Furthermore, I never said I was being honest because \"there would be nothing to find,\" I'm being a upfront with people on this so they can see my thought process, and it would be easier to collaborate and get better and less contrived input.<br><br>I appreciate your explanation, but it seems to me this type of explanation seems threatening to you, do you think people who are trying to make a bold effort in finding people are the ones who are the most scummy in themselves?

Oh, page three, I remember this one. Taly's unvote of eektor. I did not get this at all. We've really not reached escape velocity from the start of the game, given MC's random vote and subsequent inconsequental responses. Eektor had shown nothing positive yet. And somehow, this was taly's time to unvote and not make any positive move. Just to make sure you understand me, a positive move would be accusing someone, preferably without being prompted by someone else. Initiative would have been a more correct term. Taly shows none here. Which btw is going to come back. The moment Taly gets moving again is when I poke around with half posts (call it whatever you like, either laziness or \"reaction tests\" or w/e, I posted less than I could in the early game and that tends to annoy people). Anyway, that's the point that Taly gets moving against me, that was prompted.

I can't help but like toolen for that, Lemons has voiced similar statements before and after but did less to act on it. In similar way, elyse has voice opinions I had in mind at that time. All can go on the town pile for thinking like I do though. Borders on tunneling from me, but I can afford that day one, I think. In response, 124 is horrible.

Even if they would do that for town cred, I don't think you can just pass that off as me being scum either way. I've justified myself, and even though at this point that really doesn't seem to hold up a lot, that's my defense and I don't agree with all the reasons people are on my wagon. I'm pretty sure there are 1, maybe 2 people on my wagon that aren't even voting for alignment reasons. (RC specifically for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647901#p6647901\">199</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6652354#p6652354\">326</a>)<br><br>Overall, it seems like the people who are town-reading me(or not voting against me) are as plentiful as the people who are on a wagon against me. So in terms of me being a D1 lynch, that seems very likely but I don't know what everyone elses thoughts are on about that yet. Nor does it matter much because I've said almost everything I possibly can to make a case, defend myself, give reasons for my thoughts on most everything else, and try to make it known that I am town. I have made mistakes, and that is to be expected since I'm a noob(I am not saying that this an excuse, just something I expected from playing several games on a forum at once.) I just knew this would happen in one of them.<br><br>Also, we are only in the first half of D1 and quite a few people seem confident in a lynch? That seems odd, but nevertheless. I know I haven't been as helpful as town to you guys as I could have been (since Elyses and part of your case is valid on me), but the mentality some people have displayed here really are inconsistent, and I feel like that contributes a lot to most D1 lynches being a townie, or someone who has made accurate predictions about someone.<br><br>This post kind of turned from me defending myself to me talking about logistics of the game. I know few people will actually listen to me now since they probably are happy they aren't getting lynched, I just hope people know the consequences that'd come from lynching someone.

Explaining what you did and why you did things tends to put people at ease. Since scum hasn't really bothered to make any moves, they haven't been in tight spots yet (hey, we just finished the RVS), this is \"easy\". Which is wrong with this post and post 124. <br><br>The second thing that is very wrong with this post in particular is the emphasis on \"openly\". This is a given when you are town. The emphasis doesn't make half as much sense when you are town (you are open anyway), but makes more sense from a scum mindset \"I can still be honest about my gameplay so far, there's nothing to find\".<br><br>So the way I see it, Taly is a prime candidate for scum.</div></blockquote><br>I don't think this is really all that good.<br><br>At the time of #124 Taly had just been voted by toolenduso; responding to a vote with a \"defence mechanism\" seems entirely reasonable to me. I am perhaps biased because telling people to ask me questions about my reads and actions so as to understand them is one of my primary \"defence mechanisms\", as a townie. It is a thing I do when my reaction to a case is \"Yes, those facts have been accurately reported; do you want to know why I did what I did as town?\".<br><br>As for the second, laying emphasis on the choice of words of a player who does not appear to be particularly skilled at writing clearly, concisely and accurately (no offence <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">) seems rather unreliable to me.<br><br>I have two questions for you:<br>1) Do you think Taly is willingly revealing his own reasoning for his reads and motivation for his actions?<br>2) Do you think Taly is trying to draw information out of other players to further his own reads?"}

(even though I don't know how it started really.) Even though her other statements in this back and forth concerned me, she did show that she had a better idea on who is who(she gave indirect reads on aqua and what she knew aqua knew of her), and ultimately said that the whole thing wasn't helping town and I liked to hear that motivation, she seemed willing to do good.<br><br>She's still on my scum list, just not as strong as before.... <span class=\"noboldsig\">I think I'd be willing to not lynch her now because I want to see more before I'm certain she is crazy.... ;p (half-joking)</span><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Other than her, Myko has really worried me.

If you are scum at the start of the game, you are scum for the entirity of the game. You can't say \"sorry\" about a post that exposes you.\"<br><br>1) The problem I have the MOST with this. \"Coming clean isn't a thing in mafia.\" &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Sure coming clean can make people suspect scum, but this tells me you really wouldn't be honest to help the town if it meant making you look bad. You are correct about that, but generalizing that this \"isn't a thing\" gives me a bad gut feeling.

Also, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6652943#p6652943\">353</a> he makes it known I'm going to be the D1 lynch, and gives only 5 other people reads that aren't even explained. I can get why he would want more info. but I don't think it goes well with him asserting his already validated argument, to someone who could have just been so easily lynched if people change at that point. I didn't see much help it did to others.<br><br>Mykonian may just be stronger vote than RC, but since everyone seems to be having changed reads, votes, and ideas lately....

Making a list or a pbpe is a solid way to get enough focus to get a good sized town looking post out which circumvents such a persons usual struggles of getting a vote down.

I wouldn\u2019t say he has put up a strong case with me, but from what I\u2019ve seen of Tool in his interactions to others, he seems to be a stronger player in how he words himself. I haven\u2019t seen enough to tell alignment, but my reading on him so far would be: <span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Neutral</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Tool, what are your opinions on the most prominent posters so far?</div></blockquote><br><br>filler.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">oddmusic</span></span></span> \u2013 The only thing I\u2019ve defended with odd over was the possibility that the wagon against him wasn\u2019t credible. He already justified he had a bad day, and only one post of frustration can come from either a town or scum. That said, it really rubbed me the wrong way when he talked about the possibility of Aquanim and I being a scum team, especially when we were the ones trying to keep a detracting wagon from forming. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Where did that come from?</span>  I have done very little to buddy with Aquanim other than stating my opinion that I think his patience and approach to this game is a lot easier and more efficient to deal with than most other peoples\u2019 reactions so far. (I\u2019m not one to talk, but those are my thoughts.) I am unsure of him. I think odd is trying to find credible and justified reasons to appear safe, which I can see from both alignments with a wagon on them. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Reading: Neutral</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Do you think the wagon against you is justified?

Otherwise, can't call this as much filler as toolen, but.<br><br>lets see how to put this. I mean, the big part of this post is about defending taly, first his defensiveness over oddmusic, then defending the accusation that came (which is fair, but I don't know if it should belong in a reads post). Only the last sentence is a \"read\", but then that doesn't go anywhere. The question is because taly feels he should ask people questions, just like with toolen. It isn't helpful. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">mykonian</span></span></span> \u2013 My reactions to mykonian were a little off, I\u2019ve understood that now. I guess I have a better view on his thinking, the small opinion posts he is dropping indicate that he wants to get reactions from others. (Wanting to drive responses through votes.) Which I think is necessary for getting information, even though I feel his suspicions are misplaced I have found some posts that I think are decent from him.

Her getting us out of RVS and her assessing everyone for info and greater desire to find progress in questioning others seems very town-motivated. I think she\u2019s one of the strongest players in here. But this also makes me worry because she could be a very smart scum, and in looking at her win ratio, she seems to be very good at either alignment. I also don\u2019t see her readings on everyone particularly, and I say this to encourage some insight form her. Anyway my gut tells me she is town, I just hope that is and that her vote on me is realized to be misplaced. (Even though I\u2019ve given her valid reason to vote due to sketchy play, that is all I can say but I hope my vibe gets across.) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Reading: Slight Town Lean</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> What do you think about RadiantCowbells?</div></blockquote>This is an odd one to make as town.

He is yet to jump on others with a vote(something I kind of failed to do), and openly admits that he doesn\u2019t know enough of someone to have a read on them and I like that. RCs argument against him seems to be very fluffy and lacking real substance. I do have doubts about what are his readings on the most active people so far, but he seems genuine. This is subject to change, especially since this is early in the game but Reading: <span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Moderate Town Lean</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Question:</span> Do you have any specific opinions on me, so far?</span></span></div></blockquote>I mean, this is a continuation of the read on RC, but same as before, this is fair.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">InsidiousLemons</span></span></span> \u2013 I don\u2019t know much about his reads, I do think he is genuine. He\u2019s expressed at the very least polite opinions in and outside of game speak on the thread. I think being genuine is a good town trait, it gives others deeper insight to your emotions and thought processes. Other than this, I think the thoughts he has put on about peoples posts are so far useful in contributing to a case on someone.

I don't think any of them could result in an answer that could get things going or expose something. I think only 3 of the reads in this list have any basis, of which 2 are connected. I think one of the reads posts is scummy. This post could have been two lines. \"I don't like the way rc makes a case on aquanim, who has been very open and honest about his reads, or when he doesn't have them, which I like too. I have been liking metal cyanide in the recent posts as well. vote: RC\". And those two sentences wouldn't have any of the forced commitment to the game feeling that this list post gave."}

I can see \"make a listpost to simulate content\" as a scum motivation, or \"tell everyone what I'm thinking\" as a town motivation - and having decided to make a listpost for whichever reason, at this stage of the game, some of those reads aren't going to be any good. As for the scummy read, a small amount of distrust for Elyse from Taly isn't suprising given the distrust going the other way - and to be honest, if I had to say something about Elyse beyond \"town\", it would indeed be \"town, but quite possibly is good enough to be fooling me\".<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This post could have been two lines. \"I don't like the way rc makes a case on aquanim, who has been very open and honest about his reads, or when he doesn't have them, which I like too.

And those two sentences wouldn't have any of the forced commitment to the game feeling that this list post gave.</div></blockquote><br>Yeah, pretty much. That leaves the possibility of a townie who doesn't know any better, or a scum who doesn't know any better. I'm leaning toward the first, since I'm inclined to think a first-time scummer (disregarding ongoing games) would be hard put to it to write as much as Taly has."}

Seem a little weird? Why is she the main person who has made a major case on anyone yet? Do you have something to say, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Miss Mafia?</span> You seem very inclined to say all of my behavior is noobscum but you've yet to say anything about the thoughts you \"seemed to have had for me\" earlier in the game that indicated noobtown.

Are you always this provocative when you feel like <span class=\"noboldsig\">you're losing an edge?</span><br><br>Aqua and the 5 other people not on top of me right now have different reads than you, and you go off on Aqua(whos contributing to NEW ideas for the town) with these posts? You're way too critical and way too eager to lynch and assume the other person is wrong. I've seen that you're becoming a bit more defensive than I was. You're dismissal of Aqua and your emotions in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6656876#p6656876\">455</a> seem vague and not so justified.<br><br>Like I've said before, this is just a hunch - but something tells me Mykonian and Elyse are a possible scum team - they've been working and defending one another and they're both most active on my wagon. (I don't see Tools logic, <span class=\"noboldsig\">eektor should be lynched for his lack of help assuming he doesn't even know why he voted for me other than being a sheep on a wagon</span>, and assuming RC will revote for Odd again - that's all of everyone who thinks I'm really scum. Which, by he way, is not even half the people against me right now.)<br><br>But what I said to Aqua in my first few sentences in this post stand true, I'm just bringing to light that Mykonian and Elyse are scum.

This is behavior that would continually assert the idea that they were scum. Because:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">A)</span> Of course, people will be shifty about ANYBODY claiming a role, and would likely want to proceed to go for them(via vote, or questioning)<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">B)</span> This could also render the other scums' efforts in wanting to seem townie. (Scummies win a lot because people quickly assume that they are town for how they appear) Well, I'd be putting myself and my scum team in trouble for claiming a town role not only for suspicion, but it would damage and go against the very win condition of the scum team. (Indirectly and technically speaking.)<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">2)</span> People will naturally conclude that that person is scum - and that could lead to misreps provided their survival in the future, and can ultimately lead to a town win.<br><br>Now, let's say that I really am what I say(Town):<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">1)</span> Claiming roles would put be at a disadvantage because people would still be shifty on my true role and people could even misrep and count it as further reason that I am scum. Here is my argument to this and my reason/logic behind it:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">A)</span> I'm at L-2, and I've really nothing else to defend myself over at this point, at least I'm still making analysis' about people and continuing to paly the game despite the adversity. Even though making a role claim at this point could lead to my lynch - I say I am being honest, (and you really don't have a lot to just take my word for it) - if my claim was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">TRUE</span>, and it led to my <span style=\"font-style: italic\">LYNCH</span>....<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">*It could give some seriously helpful data to townies in questioning who is truly and possibly scum in the game, based off all the info I have given in analysis and claims so far.* IF, I were to be mislynched with this claim holding true.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">B)</span> It could alternatively make people see my genuine thoughts and help keep me in the game awhile longer. Which helps town in any case, provided that I am being honest. (Which all people can do is take what I said as a bluff, or the truth. And I already said what it was)<br><br>---- That's just my logic behind it. It's not like I'm in a good position to say something like this anyway in the first place<span class=\"noboldsig\">,(not discrediting myself anyhow)</span> so that's all there is to it."}

If people really do want me out of here.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And then Taly insists he's being genuine. And he softclaims. Softclaiming is a pet peeve of mine and I hate it so so much. It's also a scumtell. A newbtown like Taly would be more likely to blurt out his entire role as a last minute defense. Instead, he's holding his cards close to his chest and leaving an option to claim whatever he wants, but also claiming PR to make people scared of lynching him. He clearly thought about using it as a defense rather than it being a gut reaction. He's scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh, so you want to know my role? I'm a Town Role-Blocker. I can keep you from NKing everyone who doesn't agree with you.

Which is possible for a townie to do, but is really more indicative of scum IMO.</div></blockquote><br><br>Meh, I'd go with the pressure thing - and the fact that I still wasn't trusting mykonian at all since he literally took no part in the conversation after Elyse butted in.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>-In #259, posts a readslist where his only scumread is RC, who he lists as slightly leaning scum.

That being said, I don't see why a town-Metal made that statement about an RC flip.

And for the same reason, it doesn't tell me much about his alignment -- it doesn't really make sense to me whether Metal is town or scum. If he's town, why does he think RC's info would give more information than a flip on somebody who's had more attention paid to them and who he doesn't have information about? If he's scum, why push such a shallow angle on RC when there were far easier things to pick on?"}

I might look at them to try to work out which were serious pushes to try to get somebody lynched and which were bussing done for form's sake.<br>In terms of your hypothetical scumbuddies... for starters, a scum flip on you would put Elyse off the table, for a couple of days at least. I don't see her bussing you in this way as very plausible. Mykonian as your partner is slightly more plausible but I'd need an exceptionally good case to do anything about it, even if I came to that conclusion. Given that your wagon has been a primary focus of the entire day I'd be especially looking hard at the people who haven't been committing to much (eektor, TheDudeAbides, Boonskiies... yes I know he's voting for Metal but that's about all he's done, he could switch easily enough) and people trying to push an alternate wagon (which is to say, RadiantCowbells). InsidiousLemons would be entirely plausible as scum bussing you for towncred, toolenduso less so.<br><br>...I'm not sure I actually eliminated anyone there. I'm not making many townreads this game, and I'll have to rethink a lot if you flip scum."}

Other than this, she has contributed to parts of the thread - I did like her push on you pisskop, about you shooting odd without saying much about it at the time. It tells me she is willing to sit back and find valid reasoning before trying to lynch a person. I think her aggressiveness is more of a town play, it is genuine - and it has received the type of reactions she has been looking for when she uses it. It is useful, hopefully she is town.<br><br>Aqua - I believe Aqua has said some things where people weren't paying enough attention too. Where is the conversation of the lurkers in this game to be scum? They are just as capable as being scum as the people who have posted the most in this game. He's also done some voting and much-necessary bluffing in his actions - where people haven't really taken him seriously. I think Aqua has deeper insight into this game than people have given credit for - this is partially gut feeling, and the two of our overall interaction in this game.

In fact, there isn't any good reason I can see why he didn't. His being nervous about committing to a mislynch he believed would go through, as scum, is the best reason (of a collection of not-that-good reasons) that I can see. Even if in my opinion he could have gotten away with it on the pretext of self-preservation, he might not have felt that he wanted to risk it unless necessary. A good scum player would almost certainly have switched to Taly but I don't think Metal is particularly good or experienced as scum.<br><br>An alternate hypothesis (which would be more plausible as an action from Metal, though the conditions are a bit of a leap of faith) is that one or both of his scumbuddies were already on the Taly wagon, and (especially in the case of both scumbuddies) he was nervous about committing such a large number of the scum-team's votes to a single mislynch wagon.<br><br>Both possibilities make sense of his positioning himself to jump onto the Taly wagon (by giving a scumread on Taly) without actually doing it."}

I think you and the town in general would have been better served by inquiring who pisskop planned to shoot and verifying that he in fact intended to kill you before claiming, but it's done now.<br><br>I don't like the idea of giving a vigilante a specific shot on the offchance that scum have a protective role of some kind (not particularly standard, but under the circumstances of this game, not entirely unbelievable). For preference I would give him a shortlist. A claimed cop would be unlikely to be on that shortlist, barring exceptionally good reasons to the contrary.<br><br>Even better, if the role works that way, he might want to hold the shot until tomorrow and take another unblockable and unprotectable shot. That does raise the possibility of him dying between now and then but if he shoots a townie we probably lose ANOTHER mislynch (between the first shot and the modkill) so it would not be a total disaster. It also confirms that the second shot was a result of his power as claimed and not something he's covered up with a scum or serial killer standard NK."}

Mafia dayvig makes little sense to me and SK dayvig makes absolutely zero sense to me. Mafia dayvig because since when do scum get both a nightkill and a daykill? And why would he use it on a player who could have been easily mislynched? SK dayvig because since when do SKs get both a nightkill and a daykill? And why would he out himself as a target for scum to kill so early in the game? And if there were both a mafia faction and an SK faction, what mod/reviewers in their right mind would let that SK make kills during the day and during the night? That's four kills by the end of N1. I mean, come on.<br>-At first glance, the idea of having pisskop wait until D2 to take his second shot makes sense to me, if for no other reason than that it should kill any doubts in his claim. But I want to mull over the options a little more and make sure I'm not missing some potential pitfall.<br>-Yes, I buy RC's claim.

I really think we should be focusing on finding scum on Taly's wagon instead of going for the \"most informative\" lynch.  Then mykonian also doesn't pay attention to the people on Taly's wagon and tries to find interest in getting me lynched. It took him a while to vote for me, though.  <br><br>The reason why I voted for IL is he has been shady all game I think and I think his vote on Taly was pretty low key and he did mention he wasn't sure that Taly was scum, but once Taly claimed he kept his vote on Taly like the claim made him want to keep his vote on Taly.<br><br>Other thoughts, I think RC is town, as well as pisskop.

Sorry bud.<br><br><br>Some further arguments regarding Pisskop that I have yet to bring up in thread.<br><br>1) \"Can't be scum/SK dayvig in mini normal.\"<br><br>Sure there can, when you consider that town already has two major PRs and would likely have others. It's balanced. Is it what you'd see standard? No, but nor are day shots in the first place, so once we've already established it's not exactly a \"normal\" normal setup, things change a bit.<br><br>2) \"had to announce his shot!\"<br><br>Did he, though? Excluding the whole WIFOM aspect, just because he did announce his shot, didn't mean he had to. And even if he did, why not balance a scum dayvig by requiring them to be outed to thread? And, perhaps, requiring them to take their shot D1?<br><br>What's super towny about him taking his shot D1 anyhow? He basically shot the lowest hanging fruit, didn't really end up helping town at all.<br><br>3) \"why would he shoot D1 tho.\"<br><br>Any number of reasons.<br><br>1) Quick grab for towncred.<br>2) Compulsive. (Most compelling!)<br>3) Mafia and has setup info that suggests no other night kills, leading to 1)<br><br><br>What if he's a compulsive single day shot scum who had to shoot today? Really fills in the blanks regarding his bringing up the shot before he takes it (he wants to be townread), his super defensive responses to any pressure, and his refusal to take another day shot tomorrow (hint: he can't.)"}

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to want to ask pisskop to hold off on his shot until tomorrow, right?

What I don't like here, is he admittedly was skimming saw the PR claim and kept his vote on Taly.  In fact it seems like his scum read of Taly was strengthened by the PR claim.  I think town would be more cautious especially if they were just skimming.  You don't want to accidentally lynch a town PR.  <br><br>So basically his eagerness to jump on wagons that are gaining momentum and keeping his vote on Taly when Taly soft claimed as well as when Taly outed his role, is what I find scummy."}

What I don't like here, is he admittedly was skimming saw the PR claim and kept his vote on Taly.  In fact it seems like his scum read of Taly was strengthened by the PR claim.  I think town would be more cautious especially if they were just skimming.  You don't want to accidentally lynch a town PR.  <br><br>So basically his eagerness to jump on wagons that are gaining momentum and keeping his vote on Taly when Taly soft claimed as well as when Taly outed his role, is what I find scummy.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>These points are better but I don't find them convincing enough.<br>- It's possible that a scum would be slightly more likely to not realise they were not pushing someone to L-1, but that's a pretty big reach. I don't see any particular scum motivation behind it as a deliberate ploy.<br>- I kind of like the sequence of posts from #86 through #94 myself, though that is possibly because InsidiousLemons was (apparently) trying to get someone to justify their vote. I don't feel like moving from pushing people to vote for your \"wagon\" to jumping onto another is scummy that early in the game; indeed it might well get the game moving.<br>- The jumping onto Oddmusic and Taly is a quite valid point and the one which I find most compelling, considering they both flipped town. However, that's only enough for me to want to take another good look at him tomorrow when he returns or is replaced, rather than lynch him for it today.<br>- Considering that InsidiousLemons' posts were pretty sparse beyond the point where Taly claimed I doubt he was thinking the game through thoroughly at that point. It's an interesting point, but there is precedent for townies sticking to Taly after that claim... obviously not all four of {Elyse, Mykonian, IL, Tool} can be scum, and I'd be shocked to find that three of them were.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: pisskop's reasons</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6675692#p6675692\" class=\"postlink\">post 946</a>, pisskop wrote:</cite>I would prefer IL to Metal because IL seems harder to pin down, but I could swing Metal too.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6675701#p6675701\" class=\"postlink\">post 948</a>, pisskop wrote:</cite>I think IL's initial push on Metal was a bus.

If Taly had not been modkilled, I would say go for it. Boonskiies really needs policy shooting, for one. BUT. Since we are now back at an ODD number of people, your shot equates to a lynch. If you shoot town, we have one less mislynch and thus one less day to work this game out, if it comes to that. Unless you're ABSOLUTELY positive you know who the scum are, which I don't get the impresssion you are, taking your shot probably lowers town's chances of winning this game.

There is an argument to be made for this, along the lines of \"we are better off lynching a slot we can know is scum rather than a coinflip\". That's a reasonable point to make, though I'm not sure I agree - but it is NOT a reason to TOWNREAD Boonskiies. I do not think a reason to strongly townread Boonskiies exists in this game. It also presumably only applies to today's lynch - if Boonskiies is scum, which is quite possible, we can't just never lynch him if we want to win.<br><br>In the final part of this post Mykonian applies process-of-elimination to determine that Toolenduso, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">But he has not actually eliminated Boonskiies</span>. I do not think there is any possible way for Mykonian, as town, to come to the conclusion that Boonskiies is certainly town and that therefore one of Tool, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br><br>The most likely reason for this is that Boonskiies is Mykonian's scumbuddy, and that having come up with a reason to \"eliminate\" him from the pool (a reason which only applies to today's lynch, at best, in fact) Mykonian felt able to ignore him in his process-of-elimination, even though this does not actually make any sense from a town perspective.<br><br>It is also possible, though less likely, that Boonskiies is town and that Mykonian was just lazy.

The way the InsidiousLemons wagon assembled in response seems to be to be quite likely to be at least partially a scum response, whether it is a town wagon or a bus on inactive scum."}

There is an argument to be made for this, along the lines of \"we are better off lynching a slot we can know is scum rather than a coinflip\". That's a reasonable point to make, though I'm not sure I agree - but it is NOT a reason to TOWNREAD Boonskiies. I do not think a reason to strongly townread Boonskiies exists in this game. It also presumably only applies to today's lynch - if Boonskiies is scum, which is quite possible, we can't just never lynch him if we want to win.<br><br>In the final part of this post Mykonian applies process-of-elimination to determine that Toolenduso, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">But he has not actually eliminated Boonskiies</span>.

Now, just like with people arguing, that doesn't make me read the opposite party any better. I'd be inclined to call such a person scum.

So I don't want to lynch him, on the other hand I know he's not helpful. Gotten that far, I stopped acknowledging him and only spoke about his person anymore, that part of the game could wait two or three days. I wasn't going to put a stamp on his allignment at that point, and reading him and arguing with him would likely make my chances worse than actually letting it go and playing with other people.<br><br>Not that it helped anything, in the end.

There is an argument to be made for this, along the lines of \"we are better off lynching a slot we can know is scum rather than a coinflip\". That's a reasonable point to make, though I'm not sure I agree - but it is NOT a reason to TOWNREAD Boonskiies. I do not think a reason to strongly townread Boonskiies exists in this game. It also presumably only applies to today's lynch - if Boonskiies is scum, which is quite possible, we can't just never lynch him if we want to win.<br><br>In the final part of this post Mykonian applies process-of-elimination to determine that Toolenduso, Elyse or myself must be mafia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">But he has not actually eliminated Boonskiies</span>.

He gives a list of three people he wants town to consider lynching, then all it takes is Aqua asking about eektor for Metal to say eektor should be on the list as well.

There are several possible scum explanations, him not caring about lynching because he's not town/being too scared of how he would look if he voted for IL/not wanting to vote for a buddy. This happened the day before the D1 deadline.<br>-Same with the vote for mykonian in #1202. RC was the only other person voting myk at that point, and it's p weird in my opinion that so close to deadline he goes from scumreading RC to voting with RC on a wagon nobody else is interested in.<br>-He finally votes for IL in #1263, but it's an hour before deadline and he makes sure to point out that everybody else made him do it by not going along with his unpopular wagons.<br>-Level of anger at Boon in #1349 isn't justified and therefore seems manufactured.<br>-The whole \"semi-crazy\" and \"just a theory\" thing in #1412 doesn't make sense given his later explanations. I asked him about this and he said he put that in there as a reaction test, but if you want to reaction test then it doesn't make sense to say that your read isn't even really a read, but more just a wild idea.

His present behaviour makes sense (kinda) only if he's trying to stop a Mykonian lynch. I'm not certain Boonskiies is town in this case but I think I would require a good explanation as to his recent actions to lynch him.<br><br>Besides that I'd basically need to rethink the entire game if Mykonian flips town.<br><br>---//---<br><br>If Mykonian flips scum, lynch Boonskiies. Do not go lynching into possible scum (eektor, say) when there's an obvious one under your nose. I'm not saying you can't think about other people but don't go flipping them until you've lynched Boon (and probably Metal, too).<br><br>If Boonskiies (somehow) flips town... I dunno. The below probably still holds to some degree, except you'll now be looking for two mafia rather than one. The only difference is that there will have been NO mafia on Metal before the Taly flip.<br><br>---//---<br><br>The remainder of this post (at least, most of it) assumes that Mykonian and Boonskiies will flip mafia. I was going to make some huge wallpost summing up the game... but I spent a lot of time not getting anywhere and eventually gave up. The following will have to do.<br><br>Metalcyanide is probably the most likely to flip mafia for reasons previously mentioned. The one thing which makes me seriously question this is Mykonian's attitude towards him at the end of day 1... my feeling is that Mykonian knew something I didn't about Metal. (The whole \"I think he'll flip town; do you still think he'll flip scum?\" thing.) Then again, I think Mykonian and Metal knew they had to distance there, maybe my feeling here was Mykonian's actual intent. &lt;shrug&gt;.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">If Metal flips town</span>, take a really good look at Elyse. In that case, the two wagons Elyse has pushed (Taly and Metal) were both town, and she's been rather unenthusiastic about a Mykonian lynch. (Though I'm not sure why she would push all-in to get the Metal lynch today, since if he flips town today Mykonian and Boonskiies probably get lynched in the next days anyway and it would compromise her a fair bit). I tried to meta Elyse but didn't really get anywhere worthwhile. If she hasn't played for 6 months or a year her meta could be different anyway.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Toolenduso</span>: You said you'd lost to Elyse's scumgame at some point IIRC. Keeping that in mind, what makes you confident she is town here?<br><br>I still have a hard time believing that I failed to get a Metal lynch D1 if the Insidious slot is scum but Boonskiies was voting Metal and Mykonian tried to \"hammer\" Metal at some stage... maybe the scumteam just couldn't help that wagon any more than they did.<br><br>About eektor... I dunno. I kind of liked the way he came at me over the \"defensive\" posts in d2, in that he did not try to make a bigger thing out of it than it was but also did not just ignore it (I feel that scum might have just not bothered pursuing an angle on such an unlikely lynch). That is a pretty piss-poor reason for a read, mind you. Eektor has been V/LA at some rather awkward stages as far as reading him is concerned. I have made other comments about eektor (in particular in response to tool's arguments), you can search my ISO for them. I think I found on a cursory read of eektor's meta that he tends towards the \"reciting facts\" rather than \"making judgements\" style as town, so that might not be a good point against him.<br><br>Tool is probably town, though his defending Mykonian lately made me a little worried.<br><br>TheDudeAbides is very likely town. Don't lynch him unless you have some amazing case which I can't see.<br><br>Unless there's another town PR Pisskop is town, no matter who (if anyone) gets shot before him. If someone else claims another town PR I'd probably lynch them before Pisskop, so there's that too.<br><br>So, the short version of the above... if you lynch Mykonian, Boonskiies and Metalcyanide and the game still isn't over, I'd lynch one of {Elyse, Bellaphant, Eektor}. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I'd like to talk about those three in the remaining time</span>. I imagine I'm likely to be long dead before that decision has to actually be made. That being said I am willing to discuss anybody."}

I'm pretty sure I know who will die at night and it's most likely the only one that is engaging everyone and the person that most of us trust as townie.  If he's gone, I don't think town can get together the next day.  Which is frustrating me, because I think town has basically given up this game and scum is content to sit back and watch this train wreck happen.  So no I don't think a no lynch is a good idea."}

Sure, he mentioned it... but either he should be scumreading Boonskiies (in which case he should have done something about it by now) or townreading Boonskiies (in which case he should be concerned that a townie is voting for and scumreading him at MYLO). I suppose maybe I can buy that Tool's just more interested in pursuing Eektor, but... meh.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Process of Elimination</span><br>I believe that Elyse and TheDudeAbides are town.

I am not so stuck on myself as to think I can't have been wrong about Metal. It's possible he's scum... but at this stage I feel it is less likely. His posts towards the end of both days looking desperate to get a flip on someone, and his push on Elyse today being pointlessly suicidal if he's mafia, tend to support that theory.<br><br>On the other hand, Metal and especially TheDude have been lurking hardcore day 3, and that does not please me at all.<br><br>Assuming that the scumteam includes Bellaphant, I think at least one of Boonskiies and Tool just about has to be mafia. I could conceivably replace Boonskiies with Metalcyanide or mayybe TDA/Elyse, or replace Tool with Elyse (as the other person on neither Insidious nor Mykonian) or TheDudeAbides (perhaps a scum bussed IL and voted Mykonian early, and I don't think it's Eektor). I should probably give further consideration to theese possibilities."}

Wouldn't voting for Bella be the same as you getting mislynched.  The game would be over according to your thoughts which are 100% correct.  So why not vote for Bella and be done with this game?

Eek is pushing for my lynch pretty hard, and his initial move out of the day of the gate seemed planned. However, it is also a hang-over from my predecessor.  I disagree with him about my meta, but I do understand where he is coming from.

I imagine I'm a fun person to play with, at least for some people. I put effort in, talk reasonably to people, don't just scream at my scumreads (mostly). (My attitude to Boonskiies was an aberration, which I'll get to.)<br><br>The trouble is, I'm not having fun. Joining this game was a mistake I regretted from start to finish. The last game I played, I played more or less like this, except I pretty much carried town to victory. Apart from the high from actually winning, playing that game was bloody miserable too.  It's not always the fault of whoever I'm frusturated with. Going V/LA or replacing out is sometimes unexpected and unavoidable, but it messes up the game for me. I take care to play one game at once, so they can't get in each other's way, and play only when I know (barring some accident) I won't have to just ditch the thread for days at a time. Not being practiced or skilled isn't really a town player's fault either, but again (especially in extreme cases) it makes the game frusturating for me to play. I can deal with those. Sometimes I'll lose because of them. That I think I can deal with, but it does all add up.<br><br>What I saw when I looked at Boonskiies was a player who DELIBERATELY sabotages his towngame, so as to be able to have fun in and autowin his scumgames. That is pretty much everything I loathe about Mafia. I have to be able to know, as a townie, that everyone on my team is playing to their wincon first and foremost. (Some players' egos get in the way of their towngame - that really annoys me but even then at least they were trying.) I don't think I can play the game when I know some people care less about their wincon than deliberately fucking their town meta over. I can't even dodge all such players - I wouldn't have signed up for this game had I know Boonskiies was going to be in it, but what the hell am I supposed to do when he replaces in?<br><br>I've tried to quit Mafia for more-or-less these reasons before. The problem was, each time I was leaving on a win. I always kept looking back at random games and thinking \"Jeez, those townies are awful. I could do better than that.\" , and remembering the high from winning my last game as opposed to the misery it was to actually play the game. I've also always wondered what my scumgame would be like, having never rolled scum before. But the game is seriously bad for me. I get stressed, it sucks up large quantities of time, and though I've learned how to persuasively argue with people that don't trust me (a useful skill which I perhaps needed) I'm now learning how to flame people who annoy me (which I think I should not learn).<br><br>I've lost games as town before (offsite); in each of them, the scumteam (and in one case, the third party) was entirely catchable, but the town was either mindbogglingly lazy or let their humongous egos draw them into dick-waving contests rather than actually playing the game. (I am no longer enamoured of my previous site.) It annoys me that in this game I might have seen a truly good scumteam that a good town would still not have caught, they played really very well... but I'll never know for sure whether you were that good, because instead you were playing against this clusterfuck of a town-team.<br><br>For the record, I don't have a problem with the play of Pisskop, or Eektor (though I wished you'd turned on a little sooner). Metalcyanide, Taly, Oddmusic, IL, and Bellaphant have a fair bit to learn, but all had the right attitude. I feel like Boonskiies, and to a lesser extent Mykonian and RC, just pissed some fraction of a month and a half of my time down the drain, and that makes me seriously mad."}

I imagine I'm a fun person to play with, at least for some people. I put effort in, talk reasonably to people, don't just scream at my scumreads (mostly). (My attitude to Boonskiies was an aberration, which I'll get to.)<br><br>The trouble is, I'm not having fun. Joining this game was a mistake I regretted from start to finish. The last game I played, I played more or less like this, except I pretty much carried town to victory. Apart from the high from actually winning, playing that game was bloody miserable too.  It's not always the fault of whoever I'm frusturated with. Going V/LA or replacing out is sometimes unexpected and unavoidable, but it messes up the game for me. I take care to play one game at once, so they can't get in each other's way, and play only when I know (barring some accident) I won't have to just ditch the thread for days at a time. Not being practiced or skilled isn't really a town player's fault either, but again (especially in extreme cases) it makes the game frusturating for me to play. I can deal with those. Sometimes I'll lose because of them. That I think I can deal with, but it does all add up.<br><br>What I saw when I looked at Boonskiies was a player who DELIBERATELY sabotages his towngame, so as to be able to have fun in and autowin his scumgames. That is pretty much everything I loathe about Mafia. I have to be able to know, as a townie, that everyone on my team is playing to their wincon first and foremost. (Some players' egos get in the way of their towngame - that really annoys me but even then at least they were trying.) I don't think I can play the game when I know some people care less about their wincon than deliberately fucking their town meta over. I can't even dodge all such players - I wouldn't have signed up for this game had I know Boonskiies was going to be in it, but what the hell am I supposed to do when he replaces in?<br><br>I've tried to quit Mafia for more-or-less these reasons before. The problem was, each time I was leaving on a win. I always kept looking back at random games and thinking \"Jeez, those townies are awful. I could do better than that.\" , and remembering the high from winning my last game as opposed to the misery it was to actually play the game. I've also always wondered what my scumgame would be like, having never rolled scum before. But the game is seriously bad for me. I get stressed, it sucks up large quantities of time, and though I've learned how to persuasively argue with people that don't trust me (a useful skill which I perhaps needed) I'm now learning how to flame people who annoy me (which I think I should not learn).<br><br>I've lost games as town before (offsite); in each of them, the scumteam (and in one case, the third party) was entirely catchable, but the town was either mindbogglingly lazy or let their humongous egos draw them into dick-waving contests rather than actually playing the game. (I am no longer enamoured of my previous site.) It annoys me that in this game I might have seen a truly good scumteam that a good town would still not have caught, they played really very well... but I'll never know for sure whether you were that good, because instead you were playing against this clusterfuck of a town-team.<br><br>For the record, I don't have a problem with the play of Pisskop, or Eektor (though I wished you'd turned on a little sooner). Metalcyanide, Taly, Oddmusic, IL, and Bellaphant have a fair bit to learn, but all had the right attitude. I feel like Boonskiies, and to a lesser extent Mykonian and RC, just pissed some fraction of a month and a half of my time down the drain, and that makes me seriously mad.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't think Boonskies deliberatly sabotages his town games.  I think he knows that it's beneficial in some instances to be difficult to read.  A think a lot of players mistakingly take issue with players who don't play to their town meta, or don't have a town meta.  Boonskies was more right about his reads than a lot of the players were.   Now, he made it more difficult for himself to convince others of his reads by not appearing town, but I'm sure he'll realize that 2/3's of his games will be town and that might not be the best strategy.   If it were me, I would adjust my scum game to fit my town game, not the other way around, but to each their own.   I still feel like he was playing to his win condition, for the most part."}

Let that sink in.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6800156#p6800156\" class=\"postlink\">post 1969</a>, mykonian wrote:</cite>You were at the center of this town. You had more than average say in who got lynched. But the posts here complain about people you dislike, and how you didn't win. <br><br>I'm very sorry aqua, but all that doesn't fit together. If you want to win and you are in the position to call the lynches, go find the scum. Elyse will always play as elyse, RC will play as RC, I will be myko.</div></blockquote><br>I can go find scum in a game where the townies are actually trying and playing to wincon.

If I ever intended to play a game again, I would go and look (privately!) at how my reads were wrong.<br><br>I've lost games before, and learned how to play better from them... but I look at this game, and what I see is \"I could never have carried this town\"."}

You never gave so much as an indication of why you were scumreading Elyse. I literally have no way to distinguish that play from you simply making up reads as scum.

Of course, I imagine that's unacceptable to you because it would give you no excuse for surviving to later days as mafia."}
