Justify this in detail. What games have you played with Elyse in the past?

In a nutshell, you are saying that Elyse is town because: If Elyse were mafia, she's be on the MattP wagon as opposed to the Supreme Overlord wagon because the MattP wagon is \"easier\" and she had better reasons for scumreading MattP than Supreme Overlord.<br>\n<br>\nI find this whole read rather silly. Elyse is doing something that doesn't make sense. Instead of asking Elyse why she's voting Supreme Overlord over MattP, you wifom a convoluted series of scenarios why it wouldn't make sense for her to do as mafia and call her town for it. Other issues with it:<br>\n<br>\n1. Elyse had voted Supreme Overlord pages ago and simply may not have thought to actively change her vote.<br>\n2. I disagree that MattP would be an easier wagon than Supreme Overlord. In fact, Elyse states in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7534158#p7534158\">Post 92</a> that she believes MattP to be a strong player which in her eyes makes him a harder target to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nWhile we're on the subject of bad townreads, correct me if I'm wrong but your townread on MattP comes down to the following: MattP is town because a) if he left Llamafluff alive to frame him, he wouldn't be the first to bring it up. b) You also don't believe that MattP would do this to a partner. Part a is one of many possibilities - it is perfectly plausible for mafia to push people they intended to frame right off the bat. Part b is an unjustified assumption. A hypothetical MattP/Llamafluff scumteam could easily have MattP opening the way he did just to kick up some chaos and fun.<br>\n<br>\nMy biggest problem here is that two of your most significant townreads (Elyse and MattP) involve you jumping through convoluted hoops of wifom to justify them.<br>\n<br>\nEdit: I got to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7540971#p7540971\">Post 137</a>.

Biggest reasons I want this lynch is that Aj The Epic started off with some really \"set-in-stone\" type stilted scumhunting (Alchemist is mafia because he derailed an RVS wagon which is anti-town and therefore worthy of a vote). I wondered if that was just playstyle or whether he's mafia trying to shoehorn reads. As the game progressed though, the way he develops reads is a lot different. He doesn't think curiouskarmadog should be attacking Elyse over a difference in what he perceives as theory. He goes through the Elyse wagon when it had three votes and does a wagon analysis without really any follow-up. I agree with Llamafluff's point on his question to Elyse regarding buddying. When I'm mafia, a lot of the time when a \"townread\" pushes or questions me, I tend to turn it around on them if I think I have smoother rhetoric because it strategically makes a lot of sense, but usually as town I'd double down on the townread, get annoyed, call them dumb or what not, and explain the read. The questioning of Elyse doesn't make sense considering that prior to her accusation, he seemed to have her as fairly town.", "time": "Sat Jan 09, 2016 5:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64784&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "64784"}

On page 2, you do have to nitpick a bit, but it made no sense to have to get a full answer from Matt on something unrelated before responding to Elyse. I think he was trying to determine whether or not he wanted a wagon on Mattp and thus waited until after he got the answer to determine he didn't. However, I still think the proper way would've been to address Elyse first or during the conversation with Matt. <br>\n<br>\nIt isn't the only way, but the quickest way. There was no reason to expose it when it could've given good information. <br>\n<br>\nI can't explain a lot with Elyse because the games I have with her are ongoing. The meta reads were done in these games to check what her scum play was like. Throwing shade is suggesting someone is guilty but doing so in an obscure manner without acting on it. <br>\n<br>\nWrong/not scum: This is from the theory post \"scum are defensive\". As stated by CKD, it isn't true. However, just because Elyse is wrong in this doesn't make her scum nor does it justify a vote. I think Elyse is transparent enough a player to read and think she's town if not solely because reason 1. The more direct she is in her statements, the more likely she is to be town. <br>\n<br>\nBecause CKD is voting solely because of difference in theory, which while Elyse is incorrect, is not going to affect the state of the game. I felt alchemist's proceedings were against the benefit of the town by asking questions that didn't accelerate drawing the game out of RVS. To me, these two situations are not similar simply due to the implications behind either one. Elyse being wrong about how scum act may influence her vote, but alchemist's proceeding affected the state of the game. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe difference between then/now is information. When I find someone else I believe is scum, it will look a lot like the case on Alchemist but probably more logic. It's fairly predictable that the more sure you are someone is scum, the more 'set in stone' your style becomes. Was a bit of it feigned? Sure. But I wanted to push it as hard as I could because I thought I had something. Right now, I don't so I'm waiting until I see something I want to pursue.

They both signed up for the game around the same time (with TKoE having to wait for account approval), they both posted in this game within minutes of each other, and they are both from Queensland, Australia.  I was trying to probe the subject as inoffensively as possible.

He annoyingly tried to use a \"logician\" tone throughout this portion, not unlike Alchemist21.  His reasoning (\"Alchemist21 was stopping game progression\" and being \"counterproductive\") for his vote was self-defeating.  Namely, Alchemist21 asking questions <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> \"progressed the game,\" just in a different direction from MattP's suggestion.<br>\n<br>\nThird, he did not until recently explain his \"shade-thrower\" and \"wrong/lack of knowledge\" comments about Elyse.

As a note, although it came after my vote, his follow-up response with LlamaFluff on the subject (i.e., arguing that LlamaFluff must also think Elyse is Town because of the term <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7545603#p7545603\" class=\"postlink\">\"buddying\" instead of \"defending\"</a>) is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> awkward and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> seems written from the wrong perspective.

And here, Aj The Epic has already stated that he thinks claiming Townie would result in him getting lynched (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7550903#p7550903\" class=\"postlink\">Post #196</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7550998#p7550998\" class=\"postlink\">Post #197</a>).  <br>\n<br>\nThe question is not one of \"danger\"; if Aj The Epic is scum, the point of claiming Doctor would both be to potentially survive but also an attempt to draw out any protective roles.  It's one way to go down swinging.  To some extent, I actually think claiming Doctor in this situation is somewhat of a scumtell.  I am not really a subscriber to <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=JEEP%27s_Tells_for_Finding_the_Doc\" class=\"postlink\">JEEPtells</a>, but I tend to agree with him on this topic.<br>\n<br>\nYou insinuate in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7551394#p7551394\" class=\"postlink\">Post #206</a> that a Doctor is \"not amazing enough to draw out\" before being lynched, and this is flatly incorrect.

Reasonless votes should be explained with solid reasons. Again, in RVS the vote for Elyse is fine, even if the reasons are... subpar. However, it stuck for so long for no reason. <br>\n<br>\nAs for 'why would scum do that' logic, pushing a lynch through on a doc would be seriously helpful to the scum team to have the opportunity to NK someone who was a threat to them during the day.

Things have been rough but I'll try to be efficient.<br>\n<br>\nAJ I don't have much to say about since last time. Still wanna lynch.<br>\nAlso, people are saying lack of CC makes AJ look better. How often do doctors CC? If it looks like the guy can be lynched anyways would a doctor cc? I've never been doctor but I think if I was I might be greedy and see if I can lynch without dying for it.

First he questions Matt on him being fine with an AJ wagon, he goes over why he thinks the AJ wagon is bad. I think his defence of AJ is a bit OTT tbh and I'll try to explain. He says he went through a full reread of AJ and found his play more awkward and hard-to-read than scummy, and also didn't like the wagon itself for speed and scummyness of votes. I didn't realize right away but he doesn't actually have reason to townread AJ. He talks a ton about how how AJ acted strange and how it's not necessarily scum based on that but really there's nothing to suggest AJ is town either so I don't understand why he reads him medium town and I think he went too far for him. If I was writing about someone like SO did AJ my conclusion would be more null than town and I wouldn't mind the wagon that much on a null either, so his read and asking everyone to go back and double-check theirs is weird to me. But 266 I just really hate. He has 4 people he wouldn't mind lynching and I want to look at his focus here. He starts with his #4, how he doesn't like his last post. Next is his #3 Elyse who he pretty much says he likes her recent posts but doesn't want to change his read: I don't like \"I'm not going to call town or even not-scum quite yet, but Unvote - I don't think we'll get an Elyse lynch today.\" because it sounds weird af, like though her recent posts are good he doesn't want to back off anyways and like he would rather lynch Elyse if it was possible today, like he's almost settling for less. I think if you have someone at #3 whose recent posts are looking better and better you shouldn't want to lynch them so much, and that having to wagon your #1 over your #3 would be a great thing, but meh. He brings up really not liking LLama's post (with his AJ vote) next. Then alc his #2 and finally me. What he actually says about me is understandable, its his focus I hate. He critiques posts from Tkoe, LLama, Alchemist and me, and I don't see him prioritizing his effort on #1/2 any more than his #4, him not liking Llama's post, or his AJ defence. Yeah it's not concrete things I can prove, it's mostly bad vibes but that's how I feel.<br>\n<br>\nAlchemist I actually don't mind. He doesn't like me for my posts being bare and low-content (and they are bare/low content since I haven't had enough time), and scumreading someone based on low-value is valid and I think it's even a decent thing to judge alignment most of the time, even if it's wrong about me in this specific case. I like him focusing on what's relevant to what he thinks is right: regardless of him being wrong about me he's going about it like he really believes in it and wants the lynch so I respect that, unlike SO who I think is trying to do literally everything and engage everyone at the same time. Same for when he was on AJ before me, and before that Matt. Overall he's alright and I don't want him lynched.<br>\n<br>\nStill really like Elyse though I don't agree with her going from AJ to alc her forthrightness is charming and I feel transparency in her thoughts and actions. I haven't had this kind of read on people so strong on who turned out to be scum yet in my limited experience and I hope not here either.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr will lynch AJ / SO. I don't think I'll have time to in-depth more people before the deadline but I'll answer questions quick if I see them.

Since the TKoE vote early he sheeped Matt on, they have just been attacking players who are voting them for what they see as the weakest reasons.  Such as the pushes on Rask and PJ.

The one thing I was uncertain about when he replaced in was because before he replaced in, he PM'd me to ask if I was cool with playing with him again after Mutant. That leads me to believe he was following this game and was possibly going to replace in. That means his initial thoughts on the game are probably coming from an uninformed perspective regardless of what his alignment is. For instance, if he genuinely thought I was playing differently from Mutant, he could have opened with suspicion on me even after drawing mafia. It's his later posts that would be more telling.<br>\n<br>\nEven then, I have a hard time seeing him arguing against all of the current wagons and suggesting several new ones when as mafia, he could have just picked whichever one he wanted.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also his suspicion of Llamafluff and Aj The Epic together which is a bit of a stretch but something I don't see much scum motive for.

I don't think he's mafia with Aj The Epic as tying his likely-to-be-lynched partner to Llamafluff so blatantly would be dangerous territory as mafia.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, there's the push to wagon me. I was obvtown in Mutant Mafia (the game Xtoxm played with me).

That type of a reaction seems far more desperate as its trying to forcibly change things with more of an OMGUS type attack instead of trying to prove that you are town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7551968#p7551968\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7551968#p7551968\" data-post-id=\"7551968\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 223</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20197\">Aj The Epic</a> wrote:</cite>No. Most scum games I try to claim as truthfully as I can to not give myself up for free.

His reads are pretty much based who is posting with not enough content instead of actual scumtells.  Since the TKoE vote early he sheeped Matt on, they have just been attacking players who are voting them for what they see as the weakest reasons.  Such as the pushes on Rask and PJ.  Even then he is not getting much past beyond \"the votes are bad\" as the reason that players are scum.  Just for fun go back and only iso AJ, then try and find the case on Rask, its pretty difficult. <br>\n<br>\nSide note when making this post I saw something that I want to put Elyse at about 100% town for.  Not wanting to say what, but seriously, she is town for that one.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n\"Called CKD scummy\"? This is bullshit. Why are you trying to twist what I've said when in that post I didn't even mention his alignment and never stated anything about CKD being scum outside \"would look back to that\"?<br>\n<br>\nYou even quoted the closest I got to saying he's scum and I stated I'm not determining his alignment off of it. So WHERE did you get that bullshit? <br>\n<br>\nYour first sentence of the next point makes no sense. Your next part makes no sense for how someone TOWN would react at L-1. That's a lot of 'playstyle choices' and you don't justify it very well. <br>\n<br>\nOn scum claims, if I'm given a scum power role, I generally claim something that is similar to that powerrole (JOAT was a recent one for me, where I changed an ability out for a pure cop). That's what I mean by claiming as truthfully as possible. This entire conversation just isn't applicable though. I claimed truthfully, and you seem oddly interested in not letting night settle it.<br>\n<br>\nThis last part is trash because \"attacking those who pushed me\" constitutes nearly half the town. What, are they off-limits? There was no need for me to believe that Rask and PJ had 'reaction test' votes, nor did either state they were. I had been posting actively and had already fallen under 'pressure' earlier. And then you just ignore more posts by me to misconstrue what I said about Rask specifically. <br>\n<br>\nAs town, why the hell do you have to go so far to lie about what I've said so far? There are a lot of lies in your post, specifically on my position with CKD and around Rask/PJ. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Llamafluff</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7567943#p7567943\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7567943#p7567943\" data-post-id=\"7567943\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 307</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1673\">petroleumjelly</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1.)</div> Aj The Epic, please respond:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7561042#p7561042\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7561042#p7561042\" data-post-id=\"7561042\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 262</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1673\">petroleumjelly</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7556226#p7556226\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7556226#p7556226\" data-post-id=\"7556226\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 242</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20197\">Aj The Epic</a> wrote:</cite>PJ, in post 182 I was stating that given the circumstances (he was inactive while the wagon ran up and not purposefully waiting), my concern for that wasn't worth it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy does the fact that Supreme Overlord was prodded indicate he was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> purposefully waiting or lurking?

I also disagree with what Llama said about AJ not giving more attention to the game.  He may not have much passion, but following his claim he did put out a more inclusive readslist, and he's continued to regularly engage rather than go into defeated silence.  These reasons are enough to put him in my scumreads, but still weaker than the reasons I want the other 2 lynched, and I would much rather lynch them instead.  I didn't really like Llama's earlier post about AJ not crumbing, but I thought that might just be because Llama thinks Docs should always crumb and I had him as null before now.  <br>\n<br>\nMy read in you isn't specifically tied to your posts on Aj or Llama (actually I think it's more from your posts on Xtoxm). I think your posts show a level of critical thinking that I don't think would come from a scum mindset.  Also, if you were scum I would think you'd be more likely to throw doubt onto Xtoxm's intro given how you had reason to believe he had thoughts on the game before joining and then maybe attack him for trying to derail the current wagons this close to deadline.

If you are already saying that its something that you are going to look back on, it usually means you think its a tell.  And I don't see you saying that it is a town tell there from your reaction.

Its not scumhunting, but trying to threaten and undermine your wagon.  Scum want to diffuse a wagon on them, town are more interested in finding the scum on a wagon.

True or false: as vanilla mafia you should always claim VT when ran up D1.  Also I think you are scum.  I don't want to let scum live another day.

You attacked them for the votes before they revealed more about if they were serious votes without reasoning at the time or not.

I do not think his posts are particularly scummy, but I also do not think his posts are good.  I am undecided.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.)</div> My thoughts on TKoE match others' in large part.  OceanWind has a nice summary in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572577#p7572577\" class=\"postlink\">Post #369</a>.  TKoE has been very \"go with the flow\" in terms of suspicions.  I did not like his push for a claim from Alchemist21.  <br>\n<br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> find it interesting that while his vote seems to be somewhat 'fast and loose' he did not vote for Aj The Epic and instead was content to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7547607#p7547607\" class=\"postlink\">throw out an FoS</a> while keeping his vote on MattP, telling Aj The Epic to \"straighten up and fly right.\"  He also throws out a comment about Aj The Epic's wagon (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7551620#p7551620\" class=\"postlink\">\"a little suspicious how quickly the wagon rose and fell\"</a>).  If Aj The Epic is scum, this is a place I would definitely want to look.<br>\n<br>\nWhile he chose to keep his vote on MattP, he later meekly <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7562266#p7562266\" class=\"postlink\">unvoted</a> when his vote was questioned by Supreme Overlord.  (And then he voted Supreme Overlord for casting his posts in a \"negative light\").  He has since apparently decided the slot is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7571807#p7571807\" class=\"postlink\">\"oozing Town\"</a> since Xtoxm's replacement.  I cannot say I follow the train of thought from TKoE on this slot.<br>\n<br>\nOn the whole, a bit scummier than Townish.  I could easily see some partners. His interactions with Supreme Overlord (the only person he has played with previously from what I can gather) seem awkward.  Despite voting for Supreme Overlord, TKoE seemed very willing to drop the argument altogether, suggesting he did not want to get that entangled in the first place.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3.)</div> Raskolnikov I have a hard time pinning down because I have hard time reading newer players.  His votes seem fairly \"go with the flow.\"  He has asked some questions that sound \"taboo\" (namely, \"isn't overdefensiveness scummy?\" and \"shouldn't Doctor claim Townie\"?) that do not make him look great, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but</div> then this is a fair place to ask these questions, being a step up from Newbie Games.<br>\n<br>\nI think Raskolnikov has to some extent been a bit of an \"easy target,\" and that makes me somewhat leery.<br>\n<br>\nHis most contentful post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7564359#p7564359\" class=\"postlink\">Post #286</a>, which is somewhat difficult to follow.  I think his analysis of Supreme Overlord is fairly 'original' and I can see the logic behind it even if I do not fully agree with it.  He seems to fairly analyze the voters on him.<br>\n<br>\nI actually have a Townlean on Raskolnikov.  His 'bad' posts just do seem very <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">scummy</div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4.)</div> Alchemist21 I have a slight scumread on.  I was trying to apply some pressure to him earlier but I did not get much out of it -- I feel like Alchemist21 is simply not understanding my point, which is more frustrating than it is scummy.<br>\n<br>\nI did not like his quick <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7529907#p7529907\" class=\"postlink\">\"conclusion\"</a> by Post 28 that MattP was Town, and I think it was overstated.  I do not like his two-post delay in asking Raskolnikov about his \"naked\" vote and me about my \"naked vote.\"  I do not like that he incorrectly thought there was \"already a wagon\" on Aj The Epic when I placed my vote.  I did not like his Aj The Epic unvote explanation (in that he flipped from \"liking\" his Aj The Epic vote to instantly \"believing\" the claim).", "time": "Sat Jan 16, 2016 11:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64784&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "64784"}

My question on your role claim (excluding the fact that it probably contradicts my own) is how this is played out. My thing is, I don't believe you forgot your role (and this isn't alignment indicative, which was what drove me nuts for a while). You stated multiple times after my wagon that you'd still be wanting to lynch me.

If you have a protective role this feels more like a soft than anything else.<br>\n<br>\nWhich today if you were going to claim such, as scum or as town, you would probably state \"I wanted to see you get lynched without revealing my role\". If we're to believe what you have stated, you've gone basically a full week and a half without remembering this? It feels like a lie due to the contradiction that exists here with 286. More importantly, calling it a 'big play' and waiting to just out it feels weird from a town perspective. I'm guessing (if your EST) you went to sleep between the times, but the four people posting here are all not geared for my lynch.<br>\n<br>\nIt makes more sense from a scum perspective: The lynch isn't going as planned and suddenly you're getting wagoned. You honestly didn't pay attention to your own soft and this was something conjured this morning instead of paying attention to the opportunity you had to tie it to 286. Therefore, the claim looks shaky in the context of what you said yesterday because you didn't want to take this step in the first place. <br>\n<br>\nThat along with a protective role contradicting my own puts us in a situation where we are almost certainly unable to coexist in the town..<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Rask</span>", "time": "Tue Jan 19, 2016 5:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64784&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "64784"}

Usually as town it acts as a selective night bulletproof action.  As a scum role though, it would have to be used to dodge something that could damage scum (investigative, other killing, etc) so by it actually being in the game, chances are we have something that has an active ability which we want to target scum.  Lets just say tracker.  If we have a tracker claim and we lynch AJ-scum, then we have Rask target the tracker, and they get a free shot clearing someone.<br>\n<br>\nIts just working off of speculation of what roles there are, but I don't think we see such a unique role as a red herring.  I think I have seen a commuter maybe five times ever at this point in playing, and it does tend to serve some sort of balance purpose.  Sure it could just be there due to Equinox having fun and throwing it in for no apparent reason, but it likely served some purpose.<br>\n<br>\nI think we are about at set breaking stage.  Or at least to the point where worst case we are going to force scum's hand for who they kill for the rest of the game.  If we get an investigative role and even only get one cleared player out of that, we suddenly are in a spot where scum have no option of who they kill the rest of the game.", "time": "Tue Jan 19, 2016 7:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64784&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "64784"}

The wagon on Llamafluff switched to TKoE only after I brought up the possibility of lynching him. It's not the position on the wagon that matters but how discussion evolved.<br>\n2. I unvoted because I was going to be there at deadline to hammer whereas other people may be asleep or not present. So, I had Supreme Overlord place his vote there so he could leave while I waited for the claim before hammering.<br>\n3. curiouskarmadog's last minute hammer was redundant. I already said I would hammer. Llamafluff also said it. There was no possibility of a no lynch.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure how you could possibly come to these conclusions if you read the thread thoroughly.

That's why I was pretty confident in Elyse being town because she publicly was talking about three scum, 12P setup night start if its power heavy is going to be deathly swingy (it still was, imagine guilty N0 from tracker).  Light power two scum makes more sense from a balance perspective.  Massclaim just needed to happen because if there was three scum, chances were we got the forced win from the massclaim.  Either there was no scum RB or scum had quite a bit of power so town would clear off quite a few.  Its why I didn't want to talk about it early either because it would make it obvious I was VT if I start calling for no power in the game.<br>\n<br>\nVery impressed that Rask made the theoretically correct N0 move and didn't protect anyone either", "time": "Wed Jan 20, 2016 5:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64784&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "64784"}

The Town Bodyguard does not really add 'power' to the game, but simply might preserve the life of a single player once in the game in exchange for the Bodyguard's life.  It's best trait is that it might be believed as a claim.  The only true 'power' was the Even-Night Tracker, which is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">pretty</div> weak, all things being said.  The Mafia Commuter does not do much (except potentially 'confirm itself' if Tracked).  The math on players also gives the Mafia the option to No-Kill on a night while still only needing four total mislynches to win, which can be used to more convincingly make a fake-claim, add confusion, etc.", "time": "Wed Jan 20, 2016 7:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64784&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "64784"}
