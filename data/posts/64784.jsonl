And our priorities must be out of sync because I really don't consider setup spec that important, and your 'silly RVS wagon' WAS based on NK spec.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Alchemist21 wrote:</cite>I felt like finishing my interaction with Matt before addressing Elyse's post.

Neither of these options in my eyes are enough to show Llama has any more chance of anyone else to be scum simply out of Wifom and the arguments aren't a real reason. I get the feeling, however, that you assume either A or B COULD suggest Llama as scum. But on the next page, you stated that anyone agreeing with the wagon would be possible scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7527949#p7527949\" class=\"postlink\">post 28</a>, Alchemist21 wrote:</cite>I think I'm done with Matt for now.

Whenever scum want to frame someone, they aren't the first to suggest why the framed person is scum because it calls attention and blame to them when the framed flips Town.  <br><br>Plus, if A and B were shown to be true, then assumption B (the lack of Doc protection) would mean the optimal play for scum would just kill Llama anyway rather than risk giving him a Day to work things out.  A and B being true would point to Llama being more likely scum, and a scumbuddy pointing this out on the first page wouldn't make sense.<br><br>In any scenario, I see reasons that would make Matt Town, and Elyse's reason for voting him is something I strongly disagree with."}

I was mainly wanted to register the expectation that Llama should be playing strong town.

Justify this in detail. What games have you played with Elyse in the past?

In a nutshell, you are saying that Elyse is town because: If Elyse were mafia, she's be on the MattP wagon as opposed to the Supreme Overlord wagon because the MattP wagon is \"easier\" and she had better reasons for scumreading MattP than Supreme Overlord.<br><br>I find this whole read rather silly. Elyse is doing something that doesn't make sense. Instead of asking Elyse why she's voting Supreme Overlord over MattP, you wifom a convoluted series of scenarios why it wouldn't make sense for her to do as mafia and call her town for it. Other issues with it:<br><br>1. Elyse had voted Supreme Overlord pages ago and simply may not have thought to actively change her vote.<br>2. I disagree that MattP would be an easier wagon than Supreme Overlord. In fact, Elyse states in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7534158#p7534158\">Post 92</a> that she believes MattP to be a strong player which in her eyes makes him a harder target to lynch.<br><br>While we're on the subject of bad townreads, correct me if I'm wrong but your townread on MattP comes down to the following: MattP is town because a) if he left Llamafluff alive to frame him, he wouldn't be the first to bring it up. b) You also don't believe that MattP would do this to a partner. Part a is one of many possibilities - it is perfectly plausible for mafia to push people they intended to frame right off the bat. Part b is an unjustified assumption. A hypothetical MattP/Llamafluff scumteam could easily have MattP opening the way he did just to kick up some chaos and fun.<br><br>My biggest problem here is that two of your most significant townreads (Elyse and MattP) involve you jumping through convoluted hoops of wifom to justify them.<br><br>Edit: I got to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7540971#p7540971\">Post 137</a>.

Biggest reasons I want this lynch is that Aj The Epic started off with some really \"set-in-stone\" type stilted scumhunting (Alchemist is mafia because he derailed an RVS wagon which is anti-town and therefore worthy of a vote). I wondered if that was just playstyle or whether he's mafia trying to shoehorn reads. As the game progressed though, the way he develops reads is a lot different. He doesn't think curiouskarmadog should be attacking Elyse over a difference in what he perceives as theory. He goes through the Elyse wagon when it had three votes and does a wagon analysis without really any follow-up. I agree with Llamafluff's point on his question to Elyse regarding buddying. When I'm mafia, a lot of the time when a \"townread\" pushes or questions me, I tend to turn it around on them if I think I have smoother rhetoric because it strategically makes a lot of sense, but usually as town I'd double down on the townread, get annoyed, call them dumb or what not, and explain the read. The questioning of Elyse doesn't make sense considering that prior to her accusation, he seemed to have her as fairly town."}

On page 2, you do have to nitpick a bit, but it made no sense to have to get a full answer from Matt on something unrelated before responding to Elyse. I think he was trying to determine whether or not he wanted a wagon on Mattp and thus waited until after he got the answer to determine he didn't. However, I still think the proper way would've been to address Elyse first or during the conversation with Matt. <br><br>It isn't the only way, but the quickest way. There was no reason to expose it when it could've given good information. <br><br>I can't explain a lot with Elyse because the games I have with her are ongoing. The meta reads were done in these games to check what her scum play was like. Throwing shade is suggesting someone is guilty but doing so in an obscure manner without acting on it. <br><br>Wrong/not scum: This is from the theory post \"scum are defensive\". As stated by CKD, it isn't true. However, just because Elyse is wrong in this doesn't make her scum nor does it justify a vote. I think Elyse is transparent enough a player to read and think she's town if not solely because reason 1. The more direct she is in her statements, the more likely she is to be town. <br><br>Because CKD is voting solely because of difference in theory, which while Elyse is incorrect, is not going to affect the state of the game. I felt alchemist's proceedings were against the benefit of the town by asking questions that didn't accelerate drawing the game out of RVS. To me, these two situations are not similar simply due to the implications behind either one. Elyse being wrong about how scum act may influence her vote, but alchemist's proceeding affected the state of the game. <br><br><br><br>The difference between then/now is information. When I find someone else I believe is scum, it will look a lot like the case on Alchemist but probably more logic. It's fairly predictable that the more sure you are someone is scum, the more 'set in stone' your style becomes. Was a bit of it feigned? Sure. But I wanted to push it as hard as I could because I thought I had something. Right now, I don't so I'm waiting until I see something I want to pursue. That's really all there is to it. <br><br>And to the last point, my last post showed two games where I did the exact thing I did with Elyse."}

This in particular is looking like saying something without actually saying anything:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7541567#p7541567\" class=\"postlink\">post 150</a>, MattP wrote:</cite>If I were to make a generalized statement right now I would say that Aj's posting this page is bad in general.</div></blockquote>So to answer what I think of Matt - well, I had him as vaguely town after the events of the first couple of pages, but if he's actively going to play towards his own claimed scum meta (in a way that is anti-town - lack of content - at that), I'm considering him vaguely scum now.  If he continues to fail to post content ... well, I think I'd prefer to get a bad-content lynch Day 1, but if we have Day/Night flips and still Matt's not saying anything he'd be a strong candidate (of course, if he posts some actual bad content, he's fair game immediately).<br><br>@Matt, same question as AJ: Why are you still voting TKoE?

I should clarify, that I intended the emphasis to be on 'newb', not 'town' - in other words, I didn't find his vote on Alchemist to be inherently scummy (it was something I could believe a newb would do, regardless of alignment).

However via content/pages in here, it certainly isn't. Remember that I had 2 votes on me last page.  Then, with a few hour separation:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7545536#p7545536\" class=\"postlink\">post 162</a>, petroleumjelly wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Elyse</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Aj The Epic</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7547551#p7547551\" class=\"postlink\">post 166</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: AJ</span> L-3</div></blockquote><br><br>Both of these votes are terrible. As I explained earlier, Rask's vote is obviously bad considering: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7538185#p7538185\" class=\"postlink\">post 130</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7538110#p7538110\" class=\"postlink\">post 128</a>, LlamaFluff wrote:</cite>You still didn't really answer why you decided to vote there instead of your previous vote (or even why you voted Alch).  Something changed and I want to know what actually changed.</div></blockquote><br>Because first vote was pure RVS whereas this was partially-serious after what AJ said, which seemed like the first thing of some substance up to that point in the game. If you look at the game before the post previous to that vote (30) there was just a pretty silly exchange between Elyse and Matt which I didn't see as that serious at the time (17,18,20).</div></blockquote><br><br>Context being his second post voted for Alchemist, where he states that the first substantive exchange of posts occurred. Essentially, this post signals he agrees with me since he also voted with me initially. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7528862#p7528862\" class=\"postlink\">post 44</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite>Maybe I'm giving AJ too much credit but I thought he exaggerated on purpose to try to bring the game out of RVS.</div></blockquote><br><br>And in his next post, votes for one of the people voting for me. <br><br>Then suddenly wants the wagon on me?

Since I did not like Elyse's first post (\"Poor Marquis\"), I decided to check up on her use of the phrase \"poor [player]\" in case it was a thing she often says when players die.  It is not, unless she varies her phrasing. I found two other instances, though:<br><br>~ a.) Mini #1584, Elyse is Werewolf, taunting protown player in endgame (\"Poor Aneninen\").<br>~ b.) Mini #1596, Elyse is Mafia, taunting protown player in midgame (\"Poor thing, sorry you got caught\").<br><br>I would guess Elyse has a habit of taunting / antagonizing players as scum (and here, it could be a \"nyah-nyah, I killed you\").  If anything, I like her first post less after looking into it.</div></blockquote><br><br>However, considering her vote on me, I'd say stretching would be a consistent pattern. At first, her vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7527761#p7527761\">13</a> seems RVS enough but this justification as opposed to looking at the six posts Elyse made inbetween isn't right. To say PJ has no case on me would be an understatement because the only thing even directed towards me was answered prior. <br><br>Both these two are exhibiting scum habits. <br><br>Now onto SO. Generally I don't like people waiting to L-1 to start defending them if they're going to do it. It's generally in the area of WK material. However, considering he was prodded there's not much to do with that. Also, his reasons are agreeable so I'd consider him as town. I disagree with both his Elyse and Matt reads."}

Your point 2 makes sense, but at the time Matt had brought up his meta thing and there were several people suspicious of him for it, so based on the events of the game around that time, I think Matt would have been the easier wagon for her. As for Matt, his unwarranted bringing up of his meta had me raising an eyebrow, but his explanation seems feasible and it wasn't enough to reverse my read on him."}

He annoyingly tried to use a \"logician\" tone throughout this portion, not unlike Alchemist21.  His reasoning (\"Alchemist21 was stopping game progression\" and being \"counterproductive\") for his vote was self-defeating.

And here, Aj The Epic has already stated that he thinks claiming Townie would result in him getting lynched (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7550903#p7550903\" class=\"postlink\">Post #196</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7550998#p7550998\" class=\"postlink\">Post #197</a>).  <br><br>The question is not one of \"danger\"; if Aj The Epic is scum, the point of claiming Doctor would both be to potentially survive but also an attempt to draw out any protective roles.  It's one way to go down swinging.  To some extent, I actually think claiming Doctor in this situation is somewhat of a scumtell.  I am not really a subscriber to <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=JEEP%27s_Tells_for_Finding_the_Doc\" class=\"postlink\">JEEPtells</a>, but I tend to agree with him on this topic.<br><br>You insinuate in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7551394#p7551394\" class=\"postlink\">Post #206</a> that a Doctor is \"not amazing enough to draw out\" before being lynched, and this is flatly incorrect.  Scum's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">first</span> concern is often to kill any protective roles.  If scum get a counterclaim from a Cop, for example, they would then immediately have to worry about protective roles.  Being rid of those protective roles first gives peace of mind in killing suspected power roles afterwards."}

It can also be easily ignored (like AJ actually did); I would argue that giving a reason makes it more likely to get a reaction.

No it wasn't? If it was, why did the vote remain in the same place for so long without you drawing anything from it?

And I explained the reason I changed my view on it: In the context of your vote on me, I see both votes from your slot are lacking any real reason. 'Reason-less votes aren't bad' isn't an excuse. Reasonless votes should be explained with solid reasons. Again, in RVS the vote for Elyse is fine, even if the reasons are... subpar. However, it stuck for so long for no reason. <br><br>As for 'why would scum do that' logic, pushing a lynch through on a doc would be seriously helpful to the scum team to have the opportunity to NK someone who was a threat to them during the day.

Things have been rough but I'll try to be efficient.<br><br>AJ I don't have much to say about since last time. Still wanna lynch.<br>Also, people are saying lack of CC makes AJ look better. How often do doctors CC? If it looks like the guy can be lynched anyways would a doctor cc? I've never been doctor but I think if I was I might be greedy and see if I can lynch without dying for it. People didn't like last time I asked about VT thing but meh, I don't have experience with this, I want to know and I think I'd probably violate the ongoinggames rules if I asked it outside this thread.<br><br>SO flipped from towny to scum from his triple post, 263 264 and especially <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7561421#p7561421\">266</a>. First he questions Matt on him being fine with an AJ wagon, he goes over why he thinks the AJ wagon is bad. I think his defence of AJ is a bit OTT tbh and I'll try to explain. He says he went through a full reread of AJ and found his play more awkward and hard-to-read than scummy, and also didn't like the wagon itself for speed and scummyness of votes. I didn't realize right away but he doesn't actually have reason to townread AJ. He talks a ton about how how AJ acted strange and how it's not necessarily scum based on that but really there's nothing to suggest AJ is town either so I don't understand why he reads him medium town and I think he went too far for him. If I was writing about someone like SO did AJ my conclusion would be more null than town and I wouldn't mind the wagon that much on a null either, so his read and asking everyone to go back and double-check theirs is weird to me. But 266 I just really hate. He has 4 people he wouldn't mind lynching and I want to look at his focus here. He starts with his #4, how he doesn't like his last post. Next is his #3 Elyse who he pretty much says he likes her recent posts but doesn't want to change his read: I don't like \"I'm not going to call town or even not-scum quite yet, but Unvote - I don't think we'll get an Elyse lynch today.\" because it sounds weird af, like though her recent posts are good he doesn't want to back off anyways and like he would rather lynch Elyse if it was possible today, like he's almost settling for less. I think if you have someone at #3 whose recent posts are looking better and better you shouldn't want to lynch them so much, and that having to wagon your #1 over your #3 would be a great thing, but meh. He brings up really not liking LLama's post (with his AJ vote) next. Then alc his #2 and finally me. What he actually says about me is understandable, its his focus I hate. He critiques posts from Tkoe, LLama, Alchemist and me, and I don't see him prioritizing his effort on #1/2 any more than his #4, him not liking Llama's post, or his AJ defence. Yeah it's not concrete things I can prove, it's mostly bad vibes but that's how I feel.<br><br>Alchemist I actually don't mind. He doesn't like me for my posts being bare and low-content (and they are bare/low content since I haven't had enough time), and scumreading someone based on low-value is valid and I think it's even a decent thing to judge alignment most of the time, even if it's wrong about me in this specific case. I like him focusing on what's relevant to what he thinks is right: regardless of him being wrong about me he's going about it like he really believes in it and wants the lynch so I respect that, unlike SO who I think is trying to do literally everything and engage everyone at the same time. Same for when he was on AJ before me, and before that Matt. Overall he's alright and I don't want him lynched.<br><br>Still really like Elyse though I don't agree with her going from AJ to alc her forthrightness is charming and I feel transparency in her thoughts and actions. I haven't had this kind of read on people so strong on who turned out to be scum yet in my limited experience and I hope not here either.<br><br>tl;dr will lynch AJ / SO. I don't think I'll have time to in-depth more people before the deadline but I'll answer questions quick if I see them. If someone who isn't me/aj/so/alc/elyse gets magically fast wagoned before deadline I'll look at them but otherwise prob not."}

That means his initial thoughts on the game are probably coming from an uninformed perspective regardless of what his alignment is.

I also disagree with what Llama said about AJ not giving more attention to the game.  He may not have much passion, but following his claim he did put out a more inclusive readslist, and he's continued to regularly engage rather than go into defeated silence.  These reasons are enough to put him in my scumreads, but still weaker than the reasons I want the other 2 lynched, and I would much rather lynch them instead.  I didn't really like Llama's earlier post about AJ not crumbing, but I thought that might just be because Llama thinks Docs should always crumb and I had him as null before now.  <br><br>My read in you isn't specifically tied to your posts on Aj or Llama (actually I think it's more from your posts on Xtoxm). I think your posts show a level of critical thinking that I don't think would come from a scum mindset.  Also, if you were scum I would think you'd be more likely to throw doubt onto Xtoxm's intro given how you had reason to believe he had thoughts on the game before joining and then maybe attack him for trying to derail the current wagons this close to deadline.  That you didn't do either of those things shows me you're Town thinking things through and not just scum looking to push suspicions on anybody they can."}

This is bullshit. Why are you trying to twist what I've said when in that post I didn't even mention his alignment and never stated anything about CKD being scum outside \"would look back to that\"?</div></blockquote><br><br>So when you say \"im going to look back on it\" is you saying that is a null or town tell?  If you are already saying that its something that you are going to look back on, it usually means you think its a tell.  And I don't see you saying that it is a town tell there from your reaction.  Are you trying to say that you didn't see that post as scummy?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Your first sentence of the next point makes no sense. Your next part makes no sense for how someone TOWN would react at L-1. That's a lot of 'playstyle choices' and you don't justify it very well.</div></blockquote><br><br>Your reaction is self-preservation again.  Its not scumhunting, but trying to threaten and undermine your wagon.  Scum want to diffuse a wagon on them, town are more interested in finding the scum on a wagon.  You just snapped right at the low content votes, so unless you are trying to claim you read everyone else who voted you as solid town, the reaction doesn't make sense.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>On scum claims, if I'm given a scum power role, I generally claim something that is similar to that powerrole (JOAT was a recent one for me, where I changed an ability out for a pure cop). That's what I mean by claiming as truthfully as possible. This entire conversation just isn't applicable though. I claimed truthfully, and you seem oddly interested in not letting night settle it.</div></blockquote><br><br>You didn't answer my question.  True or false: as vanilla mafia you should always claim VT when ran up D1.  Also I think you are scum.  I don't want to let scum live another day.  You already have stated that as mafia PR you would not claim VT, so using that logic if you are mafia you are a PR, so lynching you would be even better.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This last part is trash because \"attacking those who pushed me\" constitutes nearly half the town. What, are they off-limits? There was no need for me to believe that Rask and PJ had 'reaction test' votes, nor did either state they were. I had been posting actively and had already fallen under 'pressure' earlier. And then you just ignore more posts by me to misconstrue what I said about Rask specifically. </div></blockquote><br><br>When a player is voting for reaction tests or pressure they should say it in the post?  You attacked them for the votes before they revealed more about if they were serious votes without reasoning at the time or not.  Whether they were reaction votes or not, you just started lashing out at your wagon for people voting without reason, when you have no problem with reaction tests.  If they would have said \"its a reaction test\" later does that make their votes fine by your own logic?"}

He's used it both as town and mafia in the past.<br><br>So, when TKoE makes a big deal about how MattP is overdefensive (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7547607#p7547607\">Post 167</a>) and then flat-out calls Aj The Epic overdefensive in the same post, Llama doesn't take note at all. But he does when it applies to Aj The Epic.<br><br>I still don't like the single-minded focus on Aj The Epic. He wasn't so certain until Xtoxm replaced in and accused them both of being partners. Completely ignoring it looked like he wanted to brush it under the rug and not turn it into the big discussion of the day. That way if he led a lynch on Aj The Epic and killed Xtoxm, that would be buried. <br><br>The VT claim actually doesn't make him more likely town if he's partnered with Aj The Epic. If there are two mafia which is a good estimate and his partner already claimed a PR, his only shot would be to make a last appeal, soft VT and hope the wagon switches over. He can't claim a PR now and limit his own life expectancy. The post where he claimed did look genuine though.<br><br>Leaning towards keeping my vote here but I'm going to finish the rest of his ISO first."}

Raskolnikov was a pretty big suspect of his but now that Raskolnikov is supporting him and on his side, the suspicion disappeared entirely. Although if he was so certain that Aj The Epic is mafia, it would make sense to think that someone voting him was town and those voting in essence the counterwagon (Llamafluff) contain likely mafia.

Part of his attack is that Aj The Epic was attacking the people on his wagon instead of \"trying to prove that he is Town,\" but LlamaFluff has not really tried to \"prove he is Town either.<br><br>On the whole, I think LlamaFluff has contributed less than I would expect and I don't think his conviction matches his case.

I do not always closely read games I moderate, and I have less cause to remember them because I was not trying to figure anything out.  As for my read on LlamaFluff, I am definitely influenced by the fact that I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">want</span> him to be Town.  I do not think his posts are particularly scummy, but I also do not think his posts are good.  I am undecided.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.)</span> My thoughts on TKoE match others' in large part.  OceanWind has a nice summary in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572577#p7572577\" class=\"postlink\">Post #369</a>.  TKoE has been very \"go with the flow\" in terms of suspicions.  I did not like his push for a claim from Alchemist21.  <br><br>I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do</span> find it interesting that while his vote seems to be somewhat 'fast and loose' he did not vote for Aj The Epic and instead was content to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7547607#p7547607\" class=\"postlink\">throw out an FoS</a> while keeping his vote on MattP, telling Aj The Epic to \"straighten up and fly right.\"  He also throws out a comment about Aj The Epic's wagon (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7551620#p7551620\" class=\"postlink\">\"a little suspicious how quickly the wagon rose and fell\"</a>).  If Aj The Epic is scum, this is a place I would definitely want to look.<br><br>While he chose to keep his vote on MattP, he later meekly <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7562266#p7562266\" class=\"postlink\">unvoted</a> when his vote was questioned by Supreme Overlord.  (And then he voted Supreme Overlord for casting his posts in a \"negative light\").  He has since apparently decided the slot is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7571807#p7571807\" class=\"postlink\">\"oozing Town\"</a> since Xtoxm's replacement.  I cannot say I follow the train of thought from TKoE on this slot.<br><br>On the whole, a bit scummier than Townish.  I could easily see some partners. His interactions with Supreme Overlord (the only person he has played with previously from what I can gather) seem awkward.  Despite voting for Supreme Overlord, TKoE seemed very willing to drop the argument altogether, suggesting he did not want to get that entangled in the first place.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.)</span> Raskolnikov I have a hard time pinning down because I have hard time reading newer players.  His votes seem fairly \"go with the flow.\"  He has asked some questions that sound \"taboo\" (namely, \"isn't overdefensiveness scummy?\" and \"shouldn't Doctor claim Townie\"?) that do not make him look great, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but</span> then this is a fair place to ask these questions, being a step up from Newbie Games.<br><br>I think Raskolnikov has to some extent been a bit of an \"easy target,\" and that makes me somewhat leery.<br><br>His most contentful post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7564359#p7564359\" class=\"postlink\">Post #286</a>, which is somewhat difficult to follow.  I think his analysis of Supreme Overlord is fairly 'original' and I can see the logic behind it even if I do not fully agree with it.  He seems to fairly analyze the voters on him.<br><br>I actually have a Townlean on Raskolnikov.  His 'bad' posts just do seem very <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scummy</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4.)</span> Alchemist21 I have a slight scumread on.  I was trying to apply some pressure to him earlier but I did not get much out of it -- I feel like Alchemist21 is simply not understanding my point, which is more frustrating than it is scummy.<br><br>I did not like his quick <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7529907#p7529907\" class=\"postlink\">\"conclusion\"</a> by Post 28 that MattP was Town, and I think it was overstated.  I do not like his two-post delay in asking Raskolnikov about his \"naked\" vote and me about my \"naked vote.\"  I do not like that he incorrectly thought there was \"already a wagon\" on Aj The Epic when I placed my vote.  I did not like his Aj The Epic unvote explanation (in that he flipped from \"liking\" his Aj The Epic vote to instantly \"believing\" the claim)."}

My question on your role claim (excluding the fact that it probably contradicts my own) is how this is played out. My thing is, I don't believe you forgot your role (and this isn't alignment indicative, which was what drove me nuts for a while). You stated multiple times after my wagon that you'd still be wanting to lynch me. Asked specifically if it was weird for a doctor/protective role NOT to counterclaim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7564359#p7564359\">286</a>. If you have a protective role this feels more like a soft than anything else.<br><br>Which today if you were going to claim such, as scum or as town, you would probably state \"I wanted to see you get lynched without revealing my role\". If we're to believe what you have stated, you've gone basically a full week and a half without remembering this? It feels like a lie due to the contradiction that exists here with 286. More importantly, calling it a 'big play' and waiting to just out it feels weird from a town perspective. I'm guessing (if your EST) you went to sleep between the times, but the four people posting here are all not geared for my lynch.<br><br>It makes more sense from a scum perspective: The lynch isn't going as planned and suddenly you're getting wagoned. You honestly didn't pay attention to your own soft and this was something conjured this morning instead of paying attention to the opportunity you had to tie it to 286. Therefore, the claim looks shaky in the context of what you said yesterday because you didn't want to take this step in the first place. <br><br>That along with a protective role contradicting my own puts us in a situation where we are almost certainly unable to coexist in the town..<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Rask</span>"}

Usually as town it acts as a selective night bulletproof action.  As a scum role though, it would have to be used to dodge something that could damage scum (investigative, other killing, etc) so by it actually being in the game, chances are we have something that has an active ability which we want to target scum.  Lets just say tracker.  If we have a tracker claim and we lynch AJ-scum, then we have Rask target the tracker, and they get a free shot clearing someone.<br><br>Its just working off of speculation of what roles there are, but I don't think we see such a unique role as a red herring.  I think I have seen a commuter maybe five times ever at this point in playing, and it does tend to serve some sort of balance purpose.  Sure it could just be there due to Equinox having fun and throwing it in for no apparent reason, but it likely served some purpose.<br><br>I think we are about at set breaking stage.  Or at least to the point where worst case we are going to force scum's hand for who they kill for the rest of the game.  If we get an investigative role and even only get one cleared player out of that, we suddenly are in a spot where scum have no option of who they kill the rest of the game."}

This easily could have been an 11-player Day-start game. However, Night-start Normal games are not as common as they used to be, and, after petroleumjelly's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=60738\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1647</a>, I thought I'd run one, as well. The original setup had a full tracker, which was town-sided; the reviewers recommended a change to either an X-shot bodyguard or a limited tracker, and I opted for the latter. Based on how this game played out, it still feels somewhat town-sided, but it could just be that the dominoes in this game happened to fall in favor of town.<br><br>To answer Supreme Overlord's inquiry about bodyguards and doctors in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7580810#p7580810\" class=\"postlink\">post 480</a>: I would never have put both in the same game because I don't have an answer for it. :P<br><br>Thank you to everyone who played in the game, and special thanks to Xtoxm for replacing into the game.
