That is, before two of them were shot in the bar in town. Apparently one of them had let it slip that one of their biggest jobs was coming up, and then, from eyewitness accounts, they both were suddenly dead. The assailant flee'd the bar with a group of 3 others. At this point, it's become personal. The remaining Cowboys are now working together to find the traitor in their ranks, to avenge their friend.

Each had their hand poised over their gun, ready for a quick draw at seemingly any moment. The three cowboys, all experienced enough to know that the other wouldn't hesitate to shoot them, so they couldn't hesitate back. Their wide brimmed hats hid their expression well, but to anyone who could see it, it was one of grim determination. All it would take was a single twitch and...<br><br>\"Ahoy Gunslingers!\" called out one of the locals. <br><br>\"Cut! Cut!\" The producer ran onto the set. \"Who do you think you are, calling out ahoy in this time period! This is clearly the time of the great plains, and you're over here acting like a damn pirate! Those weren't even lines in the actual film! You think you're good enough to make your own lines? Yeah right, get your own degree in writing, and then we'll see about you making your own lines. For now, you can be the simple boy that sets this gunfight off. That's all you are, and you won't amount to anything else. Alright?\" <br><br>The actor, the supposed pirate dressed up in the native's dirty clothes, looked down at his feet. He knew that the line wasn't there, but it just didn't fit. What person in their right mind would think to themselves that \"Gunslingers\" was enough of a way to greet three hard cowboys. It simply wasn't, but this producer didn't seem to know or even care. Typical. <br><br>As everybody else was preparing for another shoot, grumbling that the scene was perfect except for his mess up, he walked to the side of the room and called his mom, who he still lived with but would refuse to tell anyone. He called her since she had called him during one of the takes, ruining that one as well. She picked it. \"Oh my god, Daniel, you're missing it! You promised you'd be here to play mafia with me and my friends!\" <br><br>He hated that game. He never told his mom, of course, but it was such a nerdy game. Only losers played it in his mind, at least. He didn't say that. \"Alright, Mom, I'll be there in a bi-\" He noticed the producer waving him back, \"Sorry, I have to go. Tell your friends to possibly hold on for me, alright? Love you, bye.\" He didn't wait for an answer before he hung up. He was determined to get his part right, even if it wasn't the most important part in the world. </span></span></span><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px inset #800000; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Votecount</legend><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\">  <span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Nobody is being voted!<br><br>  <span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>Currently not voting <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">(13/13)</span></span></span> ConvergentConclusion, MURDERCAT, zefiend, Chumba, Accountant,                            <span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>chilledtea, BlackStar, NightmareGaunt, I Am Innocent, Dunnstral, Derek12, Transcend, TehBrawlGuy<br></span></fieldset><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px inset #800000; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Time Until Deadline</legend><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\">  <span style=\"padding-left:0.2in\"></span>May 25th, 6:00 PM [UTC - 6]</span></fieldset><br><br><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Day 1 has started!

I agree with his assessment that voting more in RVS is typically a play done by Scum who intend to look active and helpful, and voting as such is a great way to break RVS. Hell, you could argue it did. I think his asking for number to lynch in the count is a null-tell and should be taken at face value. (everyone knew he was nowhere near lynch) That said, I like Accountant's push on him for helping to break RVS and get a first wagon going.<br><br>I'll lead with a <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: vote: chumba</span>. In his #36, he hops on the catwagon only saying \"wagons are fun\". He does not actually post anything related to if he thinks murdercat is scummy until his #65, leaving him the option to exit the catwagon cleanly with the excuse of simply being on it for early pressure/to break RVS. Most of his posts in general are just backing up what other players are doing, and not bringing anything new to the table. Lastly, his discouraging pointing out possible associations doesn't help us. I'd rather see any content posted right now, and we can decide if it's useful later on a scumflip."}

When I voted murder the wagon was already going. I put him to l-2 even. Just an FYI, I don't vote people unless I think they are scum so when I voted murder and put him at l-2, I thought he was probably scum. Sure I didn't give a reason at the time but I'm not really obligated to give one. I was still pressuring him the very next page when I pointed out in post 53 that murdercat' post in 52 was blatantly wrong. I'm not sure why you discount that post.

When I voted murder the wagon was already going. I put him to l-2 even.

Sure I didn't give a reason at the time but I'm not really obligated to give one.

You voted him and then weren't really involved in the argument. <br><br>I ISO'd Dunn after reading this, and I will give you that he does post more noise than I would like.

When I voted murder the wagon was already going. I put him to l-2 even.

I was still pressuring him the very next page when I pointed out in post 53 that murdercat' post in 52 was blatantly wrong. I'm not sure why you discount that post.

You can imagine BlackStar resting on a number line with 0 being confirmed mafia and 1 being confirmed town.

But when Dunnstral points out that BlackStar has sat on the MCAT wagon without really pushing it, I go \"hmm, maybe he has a point\" and it pushes back towards 0.

How do we know you're not scum white knighting your partner then claiming that scum would never white knight their partner?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not to mention the fact that right after I \"white knighted\" him he turned around and voted me.</div></blockquote><br>This <span style=\"font-style: italic\">strongly supports</span> the white knight theory. When a partner who has already been under pressure(and is not unlikely to get lynched) suddenly backs you up publicly, it's entirely natural for scum to kneejerk attempt to distance themselves from their partner, usually by bussing them. This kneejerk reaction is especially likely to come from someone like MURDERCAT, who we all agree is quite new and inexperienced. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>5.

When I voted murder the wagon was already going. I put him to l-2 even. Just an FYI, I don't vote people unless I think they are scum so when I voted murder and put him at l-2, I thought he was probably scum. Sure I didn't give a reason at the time but I'm not really obligated to give one. I was still pressuring him the very next page when I pointed out in post 53 that murdercat' post in 52 was blatantly wrong. I'm not sure why you discount that post. Oh and btw that was 1 page later, not 2 like you said above...<br><br>If you are town you have a completely realistic expectation of what kind of center a person can or should generate early in the game. Sure I didn't produce as much as others but that's because I wasn't involved in the argument. Most of the posts at the time were from murder/accountant who were going back and forth with each other. <br><br><br>Lastly. In post 277 you tried to say that Dunn had more content than I did. If anything his signal to noise ratio was way higher than mine. The first 6 of his 7 posts weren't very useful at all. He had a total of 14 posts before I went to bed and of those 14 posts only 4 of them imo are game related (and I'm being generous to one of the 4) yet you don't have an issue with him?

The general consensus is that there's been a lot of TvT, which means that there are an above average number of scum in the low-content pool. Transcend is perfect for that, because he's low content, but not low-posts, so you can analyze him. The lack of content itself is something to read.

I honestly do see a case against chilled because he hasn't done anything this game when he was super townie in the other game I played with him, he's kind of wishy washy on me, and how chilled interacted with blackstar felt a little strange to me. But he's not caught up and that stuff is really weak, so I need more. Other than that, who has really done anything? Derek has asked a few random questions and then not really gone anywhere with them. I felt like zefiend's push against me wasn't fully genuine, but he's replacing out now. Not a lot of content there either really. Transcend has barely posting anything and is being replaced. IAI is in eternal catch up. RachMarie posted a super vague readlist and a couple random catch up notes. And ConvergentConclusion has an RVS vote.<br><br>So I'm having a hard time figuring out how to be productive because the only people posting a lot are probably or lean town for me."}

Neither have backed down and try to be conciliatory when challenged by other players. There are a few players I would look at more skeptically if they did this so early in the game, like Nacho for example, who has been known to bus his partner on D1, but none of those players are in the game.

It's more of an overall pattern of posts that I dislike.

He lists Accountant as his #1 scum read at time when there's no wagon with more than a vote, and other people have indicated suspicion of him, but does actually nothing to pressure him or try to convince anyone to vote him. If he were Town, this is a perfect opportunity to get his preferred lynch candidate's wagon going. If he's Scum, I can see him being too spooked to lead a wagon he knows is a ML, since he's new and hasn't played Scum before, preferring to just drive-by vote a seemingly good candidate and wait for someone else to lead.<br><br>2) Before Accountant, his BlackStar vote is awful. His justification is \"BlackStar has been very bad and has made a few scummy votes and a few potentially forced lines.\", which is one of the most incredibly vague statements I've heard in this game. It leaves him so incredibly open to just wait and see what the Town agrees with and then parrot it back to look townie. I asked him specifically to explain this and a few others circa #250 and he still has not done so.<br><br>3) In a more general sense, I don't like how he posts a reads list with only one sentence justification on each player, says he can go into more detail, is asked to go into more detail, and doesn't. It reads as Scum trying to look helpful without being helpful.<br><br>4) The general fluffiness of his posts is pretty bad. They're mostly one-sentence filler that don't involve actual scumhunting.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl;dr I think Transcend is playing the way he would if this were his first Scum game ever. Really passive, safe play attempting to stay out of the spotlight with little content, by avoiding leading or scumhunting.</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7924674#p7924674\" class=\"postlink\">post 832</a>, TehBrawlGuy wrote:</cite>*sigh*<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Transcend</span> <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlackStar</span><br><br>we should revisit this slot later, but there's nothing to be gained from pushing it now, really</div></blockquote><br>So you post a case against Trasvend and one of the things you say against him is that he gave a weak and forced reason for why he voted me. Okay. So if you find that scummy, why you would move your vote back to me just because he replaced out? If he was opportunistically voting me, that would make me town. So why would you decide to vote for me?"}

This game is pretty bad so far. You're all death tunneling a player who clearly seems inexperienced and acting like his mistakes can only be seen as the actions of scum. I think Dunnstral is scum, so murdercat is probably town. You said that I didn't \"pursue discourse with Dunnstral\". I wasn't even here so of course I didn't. Dunnstral is trying to tie me to murdercat just because I questioned why everyone was ready to lynch him so quickly. That's ridiculously weak and it's even worse that he's trying to do this before we even get a flip. Then he said my individual actions were scummy but doesn't give any examples of things I've said that he thinks are scummy.

The general consensus is that there's been a lot of TvT, which means that there are an above average number of scum in the low-content pool. Transcend is perfect for that, because he's low content, but not low-posts, so you can analyze him. The lack of content itself is something to read. I'm not keen on lynching a random lurker/flaker either, it's much better to hunt anyone active lurking, like I think Transcend is.<br>Here's why Transcend.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7920927#p7920927\" class=\"postlink\">post 627</a>, Derek12 wrote:</cite>Transcend - I don't really get his townread on me.

He lists Accountant as his #1 scum read at time when there's no wagon with more than a vote, and other people have indicated suspicion of him, but does actually nothing to pressure him or try to convince anyone to vote him. If he were Town, this is a perfect opportunity to get his preferred lynch candidate's wagon going. If he's Scum, I can see him being too spooked to lead a wagon he knows is a ML, since he's new and hasn't played Scum before, preferring to just drive-by vote a seemingly good candidate and wait for someone else to lead.<br><br>2) Before Accountant, his BlackStar vote is awful. His justification is \"BlackStar has been very bad and has made a few scummy votes and a few potentially forced lines.\", which is one of the most incredibly vague statements I've heard in this game. It leaves him so incredibly open to just wait and see what the Town agrees with and then parrot it back to look townie. I asked him specifically to explain this and a few others circa #250 and he still has not done so.<br><br>3) In a more general sense, I don't like how he posts a reads list with only one sentence justification on each player, says he can go into more detail, is asked to go into more detail, and doesn't. It reads as Scum trying to look helpful without being helpful.<br><br>4) The general fluffiness of his posts is pretty bad. They're mostly one-sentence filler that don't involve actual scumhunting.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl;dr I think Transcend is playing the way he would if this were his first Scum game ever.

Like, I think TBG v Chumba was TvT, I think you and accountant are probably T and the way Blackstar went off and self voted makes me think he is T (partly because garmr went off in a similar way in my last game and he was T). I honestly do see a case against chilled because he hasn't done anything this game when he was super townie in the other game I played with him, he's kind of wishy washy on me, and how chilled interacted with blackstar felt a little strange to me. But he's not caught up and that stuff is really weak, so I need more. Other than that, who has really done anything? Derek has asked a few random questions and then not really gone anywhere with them. I felt like zefiend's push against me wasn't fully genuine, but he's replacing out now. Not a lot of content there either really. Transcend has barely posting anything and is being replaced. IAI is in eternal catch up. RachMarie posted a super vague readlist and a couple random catch up notes.

It's more of an overall pattern of posts that I dislike.

He lists Accountant as his #1 scum read at time when there's no wagon with more than a vote, and other people have indicated suspicion of him, but does actually nothing to pressure him or try to convince anyone to vote him. If he were Town, this is a perfect opportunity to get his preferred lynch candidate's wagon going. If he's Scum, I can see him being too spooked to lead a wagon he knows is a ML, since he's new and hasn't played Scum before, preferring to just drive-by vote a seemingly good candidate and wait for someone else to lead.<br><br>2) Before Accountant, his BlackStar vote is awful. His justification is \"BlackStar has been very bad and has made a few scummy votes and a few potentially forced lines.\", which is one of the most incredibly vague statements I've heard in this game. It leaves him so incredibly open to just wait and see what the Town agrees with and then parrot it back to look townie. I asked him specifically to explain this and a few others circa #250 and he still has not done so.<br><br>3) In a more general sense, I don't like how he posts a reads list with only one sentence justification on each player, says he can go into more detail, is asked to go into more detail, and doesn't. It reads as Scum trying to look helpful without being helpful.<br><br>4) The general fluffiness of his posts is pretty bad. They're mostly one-sentence filler that don't involve actual scumhunting.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl;dr I think Transcend is playing the way he would if this were his first Scum game ever. Really passive, safe play attempting to stay out of the spotlight with little content, by avoiding leading or scumhunting.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Since you have specifically asked for everyone's opinion :<br><br>I am not 100% sure about transcend because your points are valid but it is also the case that the server went down right about that time when transcend voted accountant, and transcend also said he had some wifi problems or something.<br><br>These can be excuses but he is getting replaced. I think we can wait and see regarding his slot, but I agree with dunn in his read of derek being strange."}

Transcend is something of a special case because he is getting replaced, so it is better to reserved judgement till the replacement. Derek is prob town, liked his re-entry. Rach I don't know, dunn makes a valid point about maybe she is whiteknighting but maybe she is more observant that's a possibility as well. I mean she is voting black, and there is a very low chance that black is town/she is bussing him. This applies to KAAG as well, unless he has changed his game a lot (which is possible), he doesn't bus his buddies this quickly and generally tries to create a counter wagon.<br><br>This is assuming that black is scum, of course.

IAI hasn't really done anything and he has had real life problems and KAAG wall is at least something. Dunn, accountant, zefiend, tbg, chumba are all prob town. Transcend is something of a special case because he is getting replaced, so it is better to reserved judgement till the replacement. Derek is prob town, liked his re-entry. Rach I don't know, dunn makes a valid point about maybe she is whiteknighting but maybe she is more observant that's a possibility as well. I mean she is voting black, and there is a very low chance that black is town/she is bussing him. This applies to KAAG as well, unless he has changed his game a lot (which is possible), he doesn't bus his buddies this quickly and generally tries to create a counter wagon.<br><br>This is assuming that black is scum, of course. Which I feel pretty confident of at the moment. I was thinking of his lynch until you came in with your \"I am waiting for chilled's catchup!\" and now I feel worse about you because what you contributed after my catchup isn't really much other than to say I was more inactive compared to our previous game, or that I have similar scum reads to others. In fact, I knew that there wasn't going to be much anyways. I felt that you were posturing taking advantage of my inactivity of acting like you have actual reads and cases, when you don't.</div></blockquote><br><br>Well I think my point (that your catch up has consisted of poking at the low hanging fruit and you haven't taken strong stances otherwise) and I wanted to see if that would continue throughout your catch up. I think it was reasonable to wait and see if that pattern would continue."}

The only time he gets defensive is when he is pushed directly by other players. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly defensive at all. I admit that, at times, some of his posts seem really off. But apparently I just don't see what you guys are picking at as strongly as you do.

You guys were the ones who took this as an opportunity to try and make me look bad and act like I was defending murdercat<br>3. I'm not white knighting anyone. And if you truly think that cum would openly back up their partner and \"white knight them\", then you must be really new at this game. Not to mention the fact that right after I \"white knighted\" him he turned around and voted me.<br>4. You seem to think that building a case means making shit up and hoping people go along with it. That's not how this works. Everyone acted like there was no way I could be town so I made that post to show how ridiculous they were acting, there's no hidden agenda, there's no sneaky bs hidden there. What I said is what I meant.<br>5. OMGUS is a normal reaction and you're being scummy for acting like it isn't <br>6. He gave a weak reason to jump on my wagon. Kind of like your \"case\" right here.<br>7. Yeah. Go big him instead of a member of the town.<br>8. Why even talk about if if you can't make up... sorry, \"think of\" any scum motivation for it?</div></blockquote><br>I just wanted to say that even though I've only played one game with Blackstar, this heavily goes against his meta. I'm not so sure he's town, now. I'm still fairly sure, but not with as much certainty.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7919216#p7919216\" class=\"postlink\">post 480</a>, Chumba wrote:</cite>No they aren't the same thing. <br><br>Thanks for admitting you are scum</div></blockquote><br>I'm sorry.

I was in a game or had just finished 1 with marquis where she srsly brought it on. he rnanlysis was incredibly and went a long way in helping me sort the game it was no wonder she was nked n1. in that game with star she was positively limp, got passive aggressive which majorly confused me and she was lynched. so I can empathize with you but I am seeing something different.<br><br>I think there be scum in teh lurk3rz. <br><br>so step away from star and tell me what else you are seeing<br><br>this is what I have so far:<br><br>kitty - I think is town, if you pple lynch him I will eat you<br>star - I think is town, it wld be helpful if pple wld back off and either give him room to breathe or to hang himself I think he just needs to breathe.<br>tea - I lean town I think<br>accountant - might be a townlean? I am squiffy on him<br>rach - unsure, she might just be a bit rusty. it has been a while and the site meta has changed a bit however we are very opposite in our understanding of the gamestate rn and there are some things that are sendi9ng GIANT RED FLAGS that I feel like she ought to know. like lynching lurkers on d1. when else are you supposed to do it, in mylo? no. you vote them and put pressure on them and force them to engage until you can get a read on him. and therte defo active lurkers in this game god, 2 of them have been beetlejuiced already.<br>chumba - town lean I think<br>dunnstral - I can't tell if he is scum buddying me or if he just naturally has good sense and sees that I am town. I mean of course I want to believe the latter but I also know that I different playstyle that is hard to grasp sometimes also scum have been buddying me a lot lately which makes me paranoid.<br>kuroi - where did he go. I mean he just popped in to say I PLAYED SCUM 2 MONTHS AGO and then disappeared I am so okay with lynching him!<br>derek - the only remarkable thing that he has done is call pple bad and not demonstrate what good play is in any way, shape or form. unsure.<br>kag - unsure. we will see how our interactions go<br>pants - do I really need to add anything else?

This isn't scum hunting. This is defending. The defense is actually quite lackluster, especially as it related to Blackstar. Why? He split hairs. \"No, of course I didn't call Blackstar scum!

It seems like he wants to test the waters and see if he has the town's approval to go after him. Obviously, with my vote, I'm in full support and my vote is there.

His posts appear to be even more superficial than Dunnstral's. Skimming, there are very small amounts of scum hunting. He doesn't get his hands dirty and he plays spectator more than as a player.<br><br>Now to read:<br><br>- His first four posts are absolutely nothing before he votes Blackstar with no reasoning. I can respect that because Blackstar is an inherently scummy player. What I can't respect, is he doesn't even attempt to say what he doesn't like out of Blackstar. This isn't to say that gut posts are scummy, but you should try to add something to it. At this point in the game, it's fine. It can be seen as an ineffable feeling, but in retrospect, it appears to be testing the waters.<br>- His next couple of posts are showing his opinion without scum hunting.<br>- He finally asks a good question. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7916123#p7916123\">227</a> Even still, it's border line to his previous questions that were simply asking people what they thought of other people.

This post is mostly expressing disapproval on things he knows aren't alignment indicative like, \"maybe it's just my personality\" or \"I don't like these arguments.\"<br>- ...then two posts later, he says, \"Well, it's probably null anyways.\" (Paraphrasing.)<br>- I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7931327#p7931327\">1089</a> but goodness from him is honestly quite scarce.<br>- By <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7939396#p7939396\">1285</a> I've begun to ask myself what you're going to do with all this amazing information you've gathered all gained... because you've done next to nothing.<br>- <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7944460#p7944460\">1522</a> No you didn't.<br><br>Speaking to Dunnstral, I've been considering moving him up to Lean Scum, but I think Derek needs to go."}

I said yesterday that I wld be looking at the pple who were so sure that pants were town and that all the scumzorz were on his wagon. like dunn you said it was the entire scumteam. I said it was unlikely. you keep pushing a number and tbh whenever some1 tries to scumhunt solely off of a flpped town's lynch I tend to scumread them. I ran into this in the newbie game that I just finished where I was in lylo and I scumread 1 of the remaining town for this reason.<br><br>I haven't reread your posts nor am I going to if you keep framing it as a demand, rather than a genuine effort to work with me. pants was the best lynch for d1 and I don't give a flying fuck what he flipped all it means is that he posted in a scummy behaviour and either does not know the first thing about playing town or he is padding his scum games with shitty town play in his town games. I loathe and detest those types of players and I am blacklisting him for what he did because that is not fair to his team. he didn't even try.<br><br>do not replace into a game and not play the game. that is hands down my number 1 pet peeve.<br><br>I didn't reread the game in the night round cos I wasn't sure if I wld be nked or not and to do so might be a waste of time. I am not in the best of moods rn to read them I will try to tomorrow if my computer is fixed. or even if it gets fixed tonight mebbe. <br><br>my issues at the mo:<br><br>I don't understand your logic so dunn you are wanting to see where you are coming from and presumably agree with it when I am not about to agree with something that I don't understand. wagon speed has nothing to do whether or not some1 is town or scum unless you are super unsure of the pple on it. I know I am town, I was pretty sure rach was town, tbg flipped town, I think kag is town (need to iso rach when I am doing my dive and reread) and see where she completely sat with kag, I know accountant was 1 of her strongest townreads of that I remember but I wanna see what else she said on every1 else. <br><br>I feel like I need to do a hard reset. <br><br>I don't get why the night round needed more time after titus replaced in, usually it is said in the mod posts that \"due to replacement the night has been extended\" but it wasn't mebbe it is a a new mod oversight. we need more frequent vc's it isn't hard there is a vote counter built in place if the mod chooses to use it. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ titus</span><br><br>did you know that I was in this game when you replaced in?<br><br>anyway, tbg was not a universal townread, at least I did not think so. I am shocked that he was shot. I was unsure about him, needed more interaction, I just know that in my experience pple who do not know him tend to misread him so I was waiting to formulate my own opinion on him. I never got the chance. wld love to hear where chumba will go now that her top scumread flipped town. <br><br>usually the first kill is either the vig or sk kill. I cld see either chumba or some1 who believed in the veracity of her read vigging him, it does not make sense for it to be a vig or sk kill otherwise (IMO). <br><br>IF WE HAVE A VIG PLZ OUT TYVM<br><br>rach makes sense to me to be the scumkill cos she was very obvtown and she dropped a cop tell but I don't think   any1 else wld pick it up except for titus mebbe. unless this game has alts. have I mentioned how very much I hate alts?<br><br>I felt like blackstar was town but titus replacing into that slot raises some very srs questions that are contigent on whether she knew that I was in this game or not. and I am not even sure then how meaningful the answers wld be or what answers that I might try to posit. so I am shelving that situ for now until titus comes back to the thread.<br><br>I think I am just gonna have to think about things."}

I've had MANY players piss me off and not vote them because I know they are town. I don't think in terms of who helps me lynch scum and who won't. I think in terms of who is scum and who isn't.

Not a problem. To me, figuring out how to read a person is figuring out how <span style=\"font-style: italic\">they</span> approach a thread. This works two fold. First, it's much easier to determine if they are town or scum in future games by having that information. Even if it's wrong, playing future games allows you to refine that process. It's ok if you trust Mollie on her read on me (but not Dunn as he's scum) but you should observe and document your own formulation for future games.<br><br>My biggest cognitive bias is that I protect those I care about and those I feel who are aligned to me.

I'm pretty sure others have different bench marks.<br><br>Now, for my reads. I form reads by looking at interactions together and trying to see a coherent chain of thought.

I'm plotting out thought processes to see if players are investigating during the game. I suppose players take what I believe to be the most optimal action for their alignment with the information they know (or believe they know).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Pirate Mollie - Town</span><br><br>When Mollie asked me to look at her ISO, I started to take a gander. I saw Mollie talking to Rach about cop actions. This is a moment I considered odd and I pressed her on it. She didn't get cagey, which I would expect from her as scum. Instead, she continued her thought process that I had interrupted her processes, and gave an alternative reason for the RachMarie kill. Pirate Mollie (the one time I've seen her as scum) doesn't really do confrontation well. She becomes much more of a wallflower. It's a small sample size, but the differences are dramatic. Meta + an emotional process I can track = Very likely town. Mollie has specifically said to not try and track her logical progression to allow her more room to operate, but her emotional train reads very very town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Accountant - Town</span><br><br>Accountant's ISO is focused on playing peacemaker, but in a very townie way. I know because I'm very familiar with the scum method of playing peacemaker. The scum version encourages people to get along while doing nothing to actually resolve the conflict. The town version says that it's getting in the way of scumhunting and attempts to force a resolution to get back to the game.<br><br>Then there's the whole claimed vig thing. I don't see how Accountant makes that claim at that point and is scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Murdercat - Lean Town (Strong)</span><br><br>I voted Murder cat as a test based on my limited VCA skim, plus I thought at the time that Murdercat was the vig target (was wrong... hadn't read). No one jumped with me. If there were people genuinely scumreading Murdercat, their reads resolved. Scum likely would have jumped here if my explanation was plausible and they didn't have town wagoned (well that says more about ChilledTea). Second, I liked his responses when pushed for allegedly not having original reads. He said that he was pushing Kuroi before it became cool to do so. It's a strong pushback against what he perceived to be bullshit. I see him going through various motions and dialogue here. Post 1828 shows absolutely why both him and Mollie are likely town. Mollie is the queen of the absurd (meant as a compliment). She approaches the game from a very different perspective and she is genuinely proud of that Star Wars lynch. 2090 is also pretty much how I feel about accountant.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Chilledtea - Lean Town (Strong)</span><br><br>Who the fuck deliberately pisses off someone who can kill them? Definitely not someone who feels like they must survive. Chilled being wagoned for that reminds me of the times when I've been wagoned for pursuing something others seemed as off the wall. I asked him, how does Accountant live as scum? If Chilled was doing a fake push (look at me, how unscared I am of the vig) he would have doubled down or ignored my post or completely decided that Accountant was town. Instead, chilledtea says that Accountant can be town for now. That resembles someone with conflicting emotions about his read, versus the behavior of his read not aligning. Most people don't want to give up their prior held beliefs. Some don't even in the face of evidence. Here, Chilledtea resembled someone struggling when basic reason didn't match his perception of your slot.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">KAAG - Lean Town (Moderate)</span><br><br>I liked the push back on the wall. He didn't outright agree or disagree with my issues with Kuroi. He wanted to know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how I got there</span>. He didn't troll around or pretend to be confused. His catchup walls are full of his own unique perspectives, even if we don't always agree.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Chumby - Weak Town (Needs to have someone in the post to sort fully)</span><br><br>This is mostly by PoE. I haven't had any interaction with him to warrant an independent solid townread in his own right. Based on his ISO, he's town. His inaccurate push on Accountant is rather townie. I've seen many people feel frustrated when a game repeats itself. I like to interact with people to determine a solid read on them, barring major tells from others. 1242 has an old fallacy that town always act optimally and never lie. Although I HATE town lies and I very frequently lynch people who lie, that does not mean that all town are straight forward with thinking. Hell, even I pull macho/bulletproof gambits to try and wifom scum nightkills if there's no vig.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The scumteam</span><br><br>I was looking through various ISOs. I don't remember what triggered that request. Yet, I came across <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7918844#p7918844\">440</a> by Dunn. It just felt weird. No townreads, but those look like three distinct piles. It was a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">hmm</span> moment. How can you have enough to form into three categories, yet have zero unique townreads? Scum do indeed like to include no more than one buddy at town generally if newer. (Not an absolute rule, just a general pattern). So I decided to push on it.<br><br>Kuroi's response to me felt highly partner indicative, after his bad push on Mollie in 2142 (pushing to find scum instead of town is not scummy like at all).I asked him what he thought of a Dunn wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960000#p7960000\">2145</a>. Two posts later, Kuroi attempts to associate Dunn with Pants. He says that there are better lynches in Chilledtea and Derek. Kuroi said that Dunn is a bad push <span style=\"font-style: italic\">because he is null</span>. He repeats that null lynches are bad mantra again in 2152. He also attempts to start a Derek wagon. Chilledtea had a wagon on him at the time, so why would Kuroi get off to support a Derek wagon, when Derek had no content? Because he could get the jist that Chilledtea wasn't happening. Most town lynches were not happening, so he wanted credit for a bus and by asking the questions, I had effectively moved him to that point.<br><br>I wanted to jump down at this point and claim that Kuroi and Dunn were partners. Yet, Dunn immediately started interacting with Kuroi. Given they both nullread each other, this was an excellent place to try the sit out and wait approach to see what happens. Posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960068#p7960068\">2157</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960093#p7960093\">2160</a> are focused more on the viability of wagons, than of sorting Dunn. Towards the end of the conversation, they haven't asked each other about <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how</span> they acquired their reads or anything that would help sort each other. At the end of the conversation, Dunn OMGUSes me, stating that the townread he had on Blackstar was gone. His read on Blackstar changing makes no sense. He had Blackstar as a vig suggestion before the RachMarie flip. Now the slot is solid town.<br><br>He's also highlighting and making a huge fuss over the Pants wagon needing to have scum on it. If he's scum, that's a red neon flag that the entire pants wagon was town. Combined with Blackstar stating that Dunn was whiteknighting the fuck out of the wagon.<br><br>Derek I've had no interaction but the things I've seen from him indicate that he's scum to me too."}

The thing is, I don't work that way and my mind often works in ways where I even lose myself. I think I've adopted a playstyle that adopts an erratic playstyle because it allows for consistency for when I'm town and for when I'm scum. Because of this, I'm often lynched as town. I didn't want to do this before because it takes a lot of time to go through my games and trying to find them on MS isn't the easiest thing in the world, but it's necessary, because I'm not your run of the mill player.

The frustration makes me doubt she is even very good scum though.<br><br>Chilledtea - gut scumread, I think it comes from a lack of in-depth analysis and lack of decisiveness (I consider lack of decisiveness a relatively strong scumtell)<br><br>Chumba - town, seems very decisive and the reluctance to claim doc didn't seem faked<br><br>Dunnstral - seems very town to me, not really seeing the case on him or the connection to kuroi. He seems to be taking stances that would be hard to fake<br><br>Mollie - pretty obvtown, her reactions and interactions seem open and genuine<br><br>Accountant - not sure about this one yet, I'll have to re-ISO. The setup is probably either 2 goons (or 1 goon + other PR) vs. SK vs. Doc + Macho cop + VTs (which seems possibly townsided) or 2 goons + RB vs. Doc + 2-shot vig + Macho cop (which also seems townsided). Both setups assume that chumba is town, the 1-shot BP doesn't really affect anything either way. Tell me if my setup spec is messed up, but I think the first one is more likely atm.<br><br>KAAG - seems pretty town to me. His questions can be irrelevant, but his feelings seem genuine.<br><br>So if accountant is a vig, that means I'm missing a scum. It might be KAAG, or I'll have to re-read and re-ISO and re-ISO with kuroi (I forget how to do that, I've been away for so long lol)<br><br>But right now we're doing this<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: chilledtea</span><br><br>Besides the chilled lynch, I want to talk setup spec with one of you guys so we can see if we can determine if accountant is in fact an SK and if not who the last mafia is.<br><br>Sidenote: don't scumread people just cause you strongly disagree with them, specifically titus and chumba. Sometimes you strongly disagree with someone, that doesn't mean they're scum. Let's try and work together as a town.<br><br>Also if you couldn't tell by this post I'm not scum."}

Not a problem. To me, figuring out how to read a person is figuring out how <span style=\"font-style: italic\">they</span> approach a thread. This works two fold. First, it's much easier to determine if they are town or scum in future games by having that information. Even if it's wrong, playing future games allows you to refine that process. It's ok if you trust Mollie on her read on me (but not Dunn as he's scum) but you should observe and document your own formulation for future games.<br><br>My biggest cognitive bias is that I protect those I care about and those I feel who are aligned to me. When I see someone as a townread, I want to protect them AND steer them towards what I feel is the right conclusion. It's easier to determine who I'm thinking is on my side, and who I don't once we hit a certain point in the game. That's how you read me IMO. I'm pretty sure others have different bench marks.<br><br>Now, for my reads. I form reads by looking at interactions together and trying to see a coherent chain of thought. I try to find moments to say either <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that couldn't come from scum</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that's really odd</span>. I'm plotting out thought processes to see if players are investigating during the game. I suppose players take what I believe to be the most optimal action for their alignment with the information they know (or believe they know).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Pirate Mollie - Town</span><br><br>When Mollie asked me to look at her ISO, I started to take a gander. I saw Mollie talking to Rach about cop actions. This is a moment I considered odd and I pressed her on it. She didn't get cagey, which I would expect from her as scum. Instead, she continued her thought process that I had interrupted her processes, and gave an alternative reason for the RachMarie kill. Pirate Mollie (the one time I've seen her as scum) doesn't really do confrontation well. She becomes much more of a wallflower. It's a small sample size, but the differences are dramatic. Meta + an emotional process I can track = Very likely town. Mollie has specifically said to not try and track her logical progression to allow her more room to operate, but her emotional train reads very very town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Accountant - Town</span><br><br>Accountant's ISO is focused on playing peacemaker, but in a very townie way. I know because I'm very familiar with the scum method of playing peacemaker. The scum version encourages people to get along while doing nothing to actually resolve the conflict. The town version says that it's getting in the way of scumhunting and attempts to force a resolution to get back to the game.<br><br>Then there's the whole claimed vig thing. I don't see how Accountant makes that claim at that point and is scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Murdercat - Lean Town (Strong)</span><br><br>I voted Murder cat as a test based on my limited VCA skim, plus I thought at the time that Murdercat was the vig target (was wrong... hadn't read). No one jumped with me. If there were people genuinely scumreading Murdercat, their reads resolved. Scum likely would have jumped here if my explanation was plausible and they didn't have town wagoned (well that says more about ChilledTea). Second, I liked his responses when pushed for allegedly not having original reads. He said that he was pushing Kuroi before it became cool to do so. It's a strong pushback against what he perceived to be bullshit. I see him going through various motions and dialogue here. Post 1828 shows absolutely why both him and Mollie are likely town. Mollie is the queen of the absurd (meant as a compliment). She approaches the game from a very different perspective and she is genuinely proud of that Star Wars lynch. 2090 is also pretty much how I feel about accountant.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Chilledtea - Lean Town (Strong)</span><br><br>Who the fuck deliberately pisses off someone who can kill them? Definitely not someone who feels like they must survive. Chilled being wagoned for that reminds me of the times when I've been wagoned for pursuing something others seemed as off the wall. I asked him, how does Accountant live as scum? If Chilled was doing a fake push (look at me, how unscared I am of the vig) he would have doubled down or ignored my post or completely decided that Accountant was town. Instead, chilledtea says that Accountant can be town for now. That resembles someone with conflicting emotions about his read, versus the behavior of his read not aligning. Most people don't want to give up their prior held beliefs. Some don't even in the face of evidence. Here, Chilledtea resembled someone struggling when basic reason didn't match his perception of your slot.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">KAAG - Lean Town (Moderate)</span><br><br>I liked the push back on the wall. He didn't outright agree or disagree with my issues with Kuroi. He wanted to know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how I got there</span>. He didn't troll around or pretend to be confused. His catchup walls are full of his own unique perspectives, even if we don't always agree.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Chumby - Weak Town (Needs to have someone in the post to sort fully)</span><br><br>This is mostly by PoE. I haven't had any interaction with him to warrant an independent solid townread in his own right. Based on his ISO, he's town. His inaccurate push on Accountant is rather townie. I've seen many people feel frustrated when a game repeats itself. I like to interact with people to determine a solid read on them, barring major tells from others. 1242 has an old fallacy that town always act optimally and never lie. Although I HATE town lies and I very frequently lynch people who lie, that does not mean that all town are straight forward with thinking. Hell, even I pull macho/bulletproof gambits to try and wifom scum nightkills if there's no vig.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The scumteam</span><br><br>I was looking through various ISOs. I don't remember what triggered that request. Yet, I came across <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7918844#p7918844\">440</a> by Dunn. It just felt weird. No townreads, but those look like three distinct piles. It was a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">hmm</span> moment. How can you have enough to form into three categories, yet have zero unique townreads? Scum do indeed like to include no more than one buddy at town generally if newer. (Not an absolute rule, just a general pattern). So I decided to push on it.<br><br>Kuroi's response to me felt highly partner indicative, after his bad push on Mollie in 2142 (pushing to find scum instead of town is not scummy like at all).I asked him what he thought of a Dunn wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960000#p7960000\">2145</a>. Two posts later, Kuroi attempts to associate Dunn with Pants. He says that there are better lynches in Chilledtea and Derek. Kuroi said that Dunn is a bad push <span style=\"font-style: italic\">because he is null</span>. He repeats that null lynches are bad mantra again in 2152. He also attempts to start a Derek wagon. Chilledtea had a wagon on him at the time, so why would Kuroi get off to support a Derek wagon, when Derek had no content? Because he could get the jist that Chilledtea wasn't happening. Most town lynches were not happening, so he wanted credit for a bus and by asking the questions, I had effectively moved him to that point.<br><br>I wanted to jump down at this point and claim that Kuroi and Dunn were partners. Yet, Dunn immediately started interacting with Kuroi. Given they both nullread each other, this was an excellent place to try the sit out and wait approach to see what happens. Posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960068#p7960068\">2157</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960093#p7960093\">2160</a> are focused more on the viability of wagons, than of sorting Dunn. Towards the end of the conversation, they haven't asked each other about <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how</span> they acquired their reads or anything that would help sort each other. At the end of the conversation, Dunn OMGUSes me, stating that the townread he had on Blackstar was gone. His read on Blackstar changing makes no sense. He had Blackstar as a vig suggestion before the RachMarie flip. Now the slot is solid town.<br><br>He's also highlighting and making a huge fuss over the Pants wagon needing to have scum on it. If he's scum, that's a red neon flag that the entire pants wagon was town. Combined with Blackstar stating that Dunn was whiteknighting the fuck out of the wagon.<br><br>Derek I've had no interaction but the things I've seen from him indicate that he's scum to me too.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>All these posts are very in-depth, complex reasoning which would be very hard for scum to fake. That's why I townread titus (but now my gut is telling me she's scum, so idk)"}

I understand that just having a reads list does not make you town, but honestly that was one of the best posts in the game of mafia I have ever seen, and you just dismissing it as bad is just weird to me if nothing else. Not only does she give reads, she gives very specific, good (imo), and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">random</span> reasons. Like, look at this for example.<br><br>[quote=titus]When Mollie asked me to look at her ISO, I started to take a gander. I saw Mollie talking to Rach about cop actions. This is a moment I considered odd and I pressed her on it. She didn't get cagey, which I would expect from her as scum. Instead, she continued her thought process that I had interrupted her processes, and gave an alternative reason for the RachMarie kill. Pirate Mollie (the one time I've seen her as scum) doesn't really do confrontation well. She becomes much more of a wallflower. It's a small sample size, but the differences are dramatic. Meta + an emotional process I can track = Very likely town. Mollie has specifically said to not try and track her logical progression to allow her more room to operate, but her emotional train reads very very town.[/quote]<br><br>You're telling me that scum can easily fake that? The reaction test, the meta, the whole thing? Like I said before, titus could be scum, but if she is, she's not doing stuff that is my any means \"easily faked\".<br><br>Murdercat, what do you think about titus and chumba's tunneling on her?"}

This isn't scum hunting. This is defending. The defense is actually quite lackluster, especially as it related to Blackstar. Why? He split hairs. \"No, of course I didn't call Blackstar scum!

Dude, it's fine if you scum read someone, even if they turn out to be town. I'm just going to say that if you're going to scum read someone, at least admit to it. Don't be facetious about it.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7915783#p7915783\">95</a> makes me simply annoyed.

It seems like he wants to test the waters and see if he has the town's approval to go after him. Obviously, with my vote, I'm in full support and my vote is there. I'd like to call Dunstrall on his bluff and get Derek lynched. Also, perhaps I'm cocky but I feel confident that I've caught at least two of the scum out there.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7916063#p7916063\">202</a> - ...overreacted?

I think you are just labelling things in such a way that frames the narrative how you like. I think Titus is town because she thought through the claim and tried to see if she believed it or not. I also think her reads are just dumb. However it is not \"opportunistic shit\" as opportunistic shit is one that is \"easy to obtain\" and taking advantage of an opportunity. An opportunity would be to RB and then shoot the doc if Titus was scum. However because of the stupid drama Chumba is still alive and Mollie was killed instead. Titus was needed for drama and so was Chumba. This slot in essence becomes a VT if it shoots. Hence Mollie dying because they RB'd accountant to try to vanillize the slot.

Not to mention there is a certain track to his thought process, and I feel relatively confident in my town read of his.<br><br>I also think that mathblade/accountant is probably town, and if they aren't, we should assume as such. This is because if they are the sk then they are easily caught, plus I don't think they are the sk anymore. Accountant's reaction on day 2, in hindsight was more townie than scummy. Him shooting at derek is definitely more townie than scummy. Him voting me when derek/infinity was alive made little sense though.<br><br>KAAG on day 2 was sketchy. Although he didn't post much his vote on me was strange. He could very well be scum although there isn't much incriminating him, other than his vote on me. Although his tone made me feel he actually believed what he said, so I don't know.<br><br>Infinity and dunn are definitely my first choice for the scum team. If math is sk then our job is easier, otherwise we lynch one these and then proceed from there.<br><br>I feel more confident on infinity being scum than dunn though. His flip-flopping on titus while calling titus as town in his first post to then calling her scum, especially when it looked like the wagon on titus was gaining traction, it looked opportunistic and survivalistic. I also didn't like his attempt to get me lynched; I can only get killed by a lynch so I find it suspicious. He has flip-flopped on that as well though."}

That is a misrepresentation. Scum must blend in. The main thing about Titus's scum play is that she rarely busses unless she has to. However many of her partners bus her.

Still confused by that comment. Let's assume for point and argument (incorrectly) that I am SK. I will not survive if that is the case. If we lynch scum today the proper play is if y'all think I could be SK is to then lynch me and then pray for GG and I leave my scum reads. I will not get to end game. If I do we probably fucked up. If we mislynch depending on numbers we have a decision to make about me being town because that could be lylo I will have to run the numbers. Therefore I am doing what I can while I live.

Even if mods replaced Mollie this doesn't usually result in an extension this close to lylo unless you have seen differently.

I think you are just labelling things in such a way that frames the narrative how you like. I think Titus is town because she thought through the claim and tried to see if she believed it or not. I also think her reads are just dumb. However it is not \"opportunistic shit\" as opportunistic shit is one that is \"easy to obtain\" and taking advantage of an opportunity. An opportunity would be to RB and then shoot the doc if Titus was scum. However because of the stupid drama Chumba is still alive and Mollie was killed instead. Titus was needed for drama and so was Chumba. This slot in essence becomes a VT if it shoots. Hence Mollie dying because they RB'd accountant to try to vanillize the slot. Mollie was the only practical kill for any scum team.<br><br>The fact you asked the question when I flipped in makes it abundantly clear this was more than just for reaction testing.

I am asking the thread to prove me wrong open to feedback from other players. You however are required to pretend like you are town so you defending yourself is self serving. Which is why I want one other player to start saying you are town and why if you are doing such a good job at it."}

No, he's just <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scummy!</span>\"<br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7915771#p7915771\">90</a> Dunnstral was scumreading and pushing Blackstar, even though he didn't claimed not to call him scum before. Dude, it's fine if you scum read someone, even if they turn out to be town. I'm just going to say that if you're going to scum read someone, at least admit to it. Don't be facetious about it.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7915783#p7915783\">95</a> makes me simply annoyed. He's playing chicken with Blackstar.<br>BTW, at this point of going through the ISO, I've realized that Dunnstral has only been active in two people - Blackstar and Murdercat.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7916056#p7916056\">199</a> reeks of bussing, or rather, the preamble to it. It seems like he wants to test the waters and see if he has the town's approval to go after him. Obviously, with my vote, I'm in full support and my vote is there. I'd like to call Dunstrall on his bluff and get Derek lynched. Also, perhaps I'm cocky but I feel confident that I've caught at least two of the scum out there.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7916063#p7916063\">202</a> - ...overreacted?

Cause it kinda seems like you threw out that word just to defend yourself.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> only scum have concrete reads.</div></blockquote><br><br>If that was true, chumba would be confirmed scum.<br><br>You say I'm buddying titus, but do you really think I buddied her, then thought she was scum and started pushing on her, then went back to buddying her?<br><br>The fact that intent to hammer was so easy kinda makes me doubt my nero read; there's not much of a reason to bus at this point at all. If dunn flips goon, I never thought I'd say this, but I would support a chumba lynch. If he is a mafia PR, I'd look at both nero and chumba (since nero is still connected to dunn per my case). If dunn flips town, I'd very much want nero dead because the slot is still quite connected to kuroi. I'd also want to lynch chilled after that.<br><br>I'm gonna ISO chumba and titus now and see what I come up with."}

Chumba says that this was an attempt to buddy mollie, but I don't see any of that in the other interactions between kuroi and mollie. She also gave an explanation for it in her reads list based on her personality, and I don't think scum usually lie about their personality to get away with their in-game behavior. (By the way, that reads list is super town imo)<br><br>I will give you that titus also moved chilled in and out of her lynch targets, but I liked the reasons she gave for chilled-town in her reads list, even though I didn't agree with them. Her later comments on chilled still kinda seem like a genuine lean town to me. She also didn't give any resistance to voting chilled today.<br><br>Even though chilled is scum, I think his read on titus in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7993676#p7993676\">2992</a> looks relatively genuine and not like a scumbuddy read.

Not much to comment on here, kuroi put titus as null and didn't really comment on her alignment (I guess this in itself may point to them being scumbuddies, but eh).

She then comes into d4 immediately willing to bus chilled, and pushes him until he gets lynched. And just for the hell of it she tries to pretend she thinks nero is scumbuddies with chilled and pretends to be subtly trying to convince him to bus. Like what the fuck? For one thing it shows no opportunism whatsoever, she takes people she thinks is scum and pushes them. Not only that, the bussing and moonlogic goes completely again her scum meta, and that means titus would be putting on an intricate meta manipulation act for the one townie in the game that knew her meta at any given time (mollie/mathblade). Titus also used a such deep level of analysis and reaction testing that I think it's too much to be fake. If you put that much effort into appearing town and are that good at it, wouldn't you think it would work? No, it didn't exactly work, so that leads me to wonder why the hell titus would put such effort into trying to look town only to be called scum for simplistic reasons.<br><br>Nero is more connected to both chilled and kuroi than titus is, and behaved scummy as fuck both when he was being pressured to hammer and after the hammer.

Like this makes a ton of sense from a scum POV. Firstly, scum bus and Titus has bussed. Like its been awhile but I remember a game where she was spouting her self meta about being anti bussing but actually bussed or had been bussing her scumbuddies in the past and then claimed that she doesn't bus or anymore...but the point is scum are more than capable of bussing so I'm not really sure why you say she couldn't have bussed Kuroi. Chumba was town so her pushing on Chumba again makes perfect sense as scum. Infact, I said this earlier but town Titus wouldn't have backed down on her Chumba read and would have tried harder to lynch him. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote:Titus </span>"}

Last night's kill is a near certainty. Scum taking 50/50 percent shot on losing the game outright to shoot murder/infinity doesn't make sense due to the downside. Namely, if either of you were healed, that's autoloss for Nero scum. Even if he got me lynched, he'd be lynched the following day.<br><br>Now, the math kill. Math is loud, obnoxious and wrong. That fuels Chumba and makes the day before near autowin for scum <span style=\"font-style: italic\">as long as Chumba keeps his vote where it is</span>. Then it's a stamina game. Can Nero wrap up the lynch with clean enough hands so that people don't see it and act on him? Look at when he avoided any discussion of proxying votes to Murder. That doesn't work for scum in mylo. Nero took the chance to win the game right there. He tried to push infinity + me hard. The only reason infinity dropped out of his reads is because infinity is clear now. I'm the lynch he has to go for, while I had a plan to confirm who the scum were yesterday.<br><br>Now the night two kill, it was Pirate Mollie.

I realize you are catching up, but in your first post you say Black is scum, you don't take a stance on me, and say Accountant and TBG are lean town. These are pretty generic reads that represent the overall game state. You then go through the whole game and only really poke at BS some more, continue to not really take stances anywhere, and defend posts directed at you. Even without meta, it looks like you are coasting. So yeah, an updated reads list would be nice and if you could explain what about KAAG's catchup didn't look good to you that would be great too, because I thought it was fine.</div></blockquote><br><br>Have you played with KAAG?<br><br>He catches up like that regardless of alignment. There was not much in there that you could say was \"wrong\" but it sure wasn't indicative of anything. Also his observations, especially on me felt a bit off.<br><br>Also black is scum. Not my fault others have said this before, that is not going with the flow. It is what I feel. His reactions to pushes from anyone didn't feel like coming from town to me.<br><br>It definitely felt like he was ok with any lynch as long as it's not him. I also do not consider self-votes as something that comes from town and frankly, such a suggestion is ridiculous. Self-votes very rarely come from town - town has no reason to self-vote. Also considering the fact that the self-vote is pretty much his only defence and it shouldn't be surprising why people might be thinking it was a gambit more than actual emotion.<br><br>As far as me not taking a stance on you, I feel you are BS's partner the way you are (hard?)defending him. I also feel that maybe you wouldn't do it as scum. So I am conflicted.<br><br>It is difficult for me to know where you stand at and this isn't the first time this has happened to me in mafia. The previous game we played with you were scummy on day 1 and actually, there were some things you did that I just didn't see coming from town. It wasn't until day 3 I town read you.<br><br>If I had to take a stance it would be that you are scum, especially given the fact that you conveniently have placed everybody who was either inactive or had little activity in your null/scum reads.<br><br>I don't have much to say regarding coasting. It is day 1, there were problems, I have caught up now. I don't see myself lagging behind now.<br><br>Suffice it to say I am scum reading you, blackstar and to some extent I feel that IAI//KAAG/Transcend could be scum. IAI hasn't really done anything and he has had real life problems and KAAG wall is at least something. Dunn, accountant, zefiend, tbg, chumba are all prob town. Transcend is something of a special case because he is getting replaced, so it is better to reserved judgement till the replacement. Derek is prob town, liked his re-entry. Rach I don't know, dunn makes a valid point about maybe she is whiteknighting but maybe she is more observant that's a possibility as well. I mean she is voting black, and there is a very low chance that black is town/she is bussing him. This applies to KAAG as well, unless he has changed his game a lot (which is possible), he doesn't bus his buddies this quickly and generally tries to create a counter wagon.<br><br>This is assuming that black is scum, of course. Which I feel pretty confident of at the moment. I was thinking of his lynch until you came in with your \"I am waiting for chilled's catchup!\" and now I feel worse about you because what you contributed after my catchup isn't really much other than to say I was more inactive compared to our previous game, or that I have similar scum reads to others. In fact, I knew that there wasn't going to be much anyways. I felt that you were posturing taking advantage of my inactivity of acting like you have actual reads and cases, when you don't.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7932383#p7932383\" class=\"postlink\">post 1110</a>, KickAssAndGiggle wrote:</cite>You're still sore about that LyLo then, chilled? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>to some extent I feel that IAI//KAAG/Transcend could be scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Is there anything to this read other than lack of activity from IAI/my predecessor?

It just felt weird. No townreads, but those look like three distinct piles. It was a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">hmm</span> moment. How can you have enough to form into three categories, yet have zero unique townreads? Scum do indeed like to include no more than one buddy at town generally if newer.

So I decided to push on it.<br><br>Kuroi's response to me felt highly partner indicative, after his bad push on Mollie in 2142 (pushing to find scum instead of town is not scummy like at all).I asked him what he thought of a Dunn wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7960000#p7960000\">2145</a>. Two posts later, Kuroi attempts to associate Dunn with Pants. He says that there are better lynches in Chilledtea and Derek. Kuroi said that Dunn is a bad push <span style=\"font-style: italic\">because he is null</span>. He repeats that null lynches are bad mantra again in 2152. He also attempts to start a Derek wagon. Chilledtea had a wagon on him at the time, so why would Kuroi get off to support a Derek wagon, when Derek had no content? Because he could get the jist that Chilledtea wasn't happening. Most town lynches were not happening, so he wanted credit for a bus and by asking the questions, I had effectively moved him to that point.<br><br>I wanted to jump down at this point and claim that Kuroi and Dunn were partners. Yet, Dunn immediately started interacting with Kuroi. Given they both nullread each other, this was an excellent place to try the sit out and wait approach to see what happens.

Towards the end of the conversation, they haven't asked each other about <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how</span> they acquired their reads or anything that would help sort each other. At the end of the conversation, Dunn OMGUSes me, stating that the townread he had on Blackstar was gone. His read on Blackstar changing makes no sense. He had Blackstar as a vig suggestion before the RachMarie flip. Now the slot is solid town.<br><br>He's also highlighting and making a huge fuss over the Pants wagon needing to have scum on it. If he's scum, that's a red neon flag that the entire pants wagon was town.

Well, not the meaning of them in particular, the meaning of his situation, the meaning of why this happened. Mafia was your life. If you think about it as you move through life, it turns into your life. It is your life, again. Everybody's a liar, a deceiver, a trickster, a fucking idiot, or someone out to get you. You can't trust anyone, and simply put, it would always be this way. Well, he could go into that philosophical bullshit all day and make it look like he was really wise, but it wasn't necessary. Nothing was necessary anymore because nothing was real. The cake is a lie. The cake. Is a fucking. Lie. At this point, the poor guy is just hoping that the darkness ends up drowning him. <br><br>Or maybe the creator just really liked mafia and really hated him, for whatever particular reason. Oh look, more words. <br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">My son, temptation is one thing I've defeated. I don't put you in this situation. You put yourself in this situation. Therefore, you must get yourself out. I still love you, and I always will. <br>-Your's truly, the mafia god.</span><br><br>Fucking bastard. What does it mean, get himself out this situation? That sounds like a bunch of bullshit that he didn't want to deal with. <br><br>MORE WORDS.<br><br>This game was great, my children. I loved each and every one of you, as each of you played to your best ability. You each brought something unique to the table, and by the gods, did you talk a lot. You talked so much I contemplated cutting my ears off for the longest time. In fact, I did freeze time at one point in the game because I couldn't handle it, but that's besides the point!<br><br>I did not appreciate some disrespectful comments. You are all my children, and I love you all equally. Do not fight among yourselves for you will have more troubles in the future. For now, I leave you. Good luck.<br><br>The black turned into scenery. It was, uh, well... He was in a boat heading for some sort of shore...<br><br>\"Oh, for fucks sakes...\"</span></span></span><br><br>fin"}
