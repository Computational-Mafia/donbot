That would be scummy if it continued, so I decided to keep an eye on it just in case. I stated this quite clearly in my original post, so I'm not sure where you're getting your ambiguity from. In any case, ICEninja's responses since have been reasonable so I no longer consider it an issue.<br>* You are correct, asking for clarification does not constitute defending. However, in #43 you not only asked for clarification but also, without prompting, offered an explanation for ICEninja's behavior.

(Give it 5-7 days, is my general estimate.) #64 is amateurish, but no more scum than town IMHO. That all of Neko's current suspects are among these opening lurkers (#85) reeks of scum searching for easy targets. Neko has been around these forums long enough that he should know better.<br><br>Implosion - His \"semi-legitimate\" vote on mongoose was a load of crap, his list of suspects without justification is a classic filler post, having a complete list of (non)suspects at all this early on seems unlikely, and changing his stance on me the moment he's challenged by ICEninja is kind of dubious.<br><br>mb53 - Read #72.

Implosion, even if you don\u2019t think it is *very* harmful, it is still *harmful* and unnecessary, and I get the distinct impression that you are experienced enough to know better. I also have no clue why mb53 played follow-the-leader in #80 (mb, why did you make that post?), but if it means that doing something harmful like posting a full scumscale is causing other players to follow Implosion\u2019s example in this instance, I\u2019m not liking it.

Those opinions don't really help the scum so early in the game, so there's essentially no harm. Also, it sounds like you're giving me the fos only because mb followed... why? How can you fos me for something someone else did?"}

He said nothing about nameless until being called out for this, and his explanation is:<br><blockquote><div><cite>mb wrote:</cite>For nameless, I don't like how he isn't really willing to answer questions.

I say that I have a bad feeling about the _over9000 wagon, then ELABORATE on that and explain that I think the people <span style=\"font-style: italic\">on</span> the wagon are likely mafia. In that paragraph, I don't think I said much about whether or not over9000 himself is scum. Please reread my views on the _over9000 wagon. I do think he is scummy; however, I've stated multiple times that I think that whether or not he is mafia, there is mafia on his wagon. No distancing or contradiction exists here. Besides, right now I'm pushing mongoose, who isn't freaking answering a question i've had for several days.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Nameless wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>implosion #152 wrote:</cite>I'd rather withhold any lasting read on him until he posts content</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion #90 wrote:</cite>As for _Over9000, His ISO 2 seems overly cautious and his ISO 3 seems overly unnecessary. mb's explained him.</div></blockquote><br>^ Here implosion ignores his previous read and backtracks his own specific analysis, for the purpose of excusing himself from taking a stance.<br></div></blockquote><br>Keyword: lasting.

I've explained multiple times why I think there is scum on his wagon, but I'll humor you and say it again.<br><br>Case one: _Over9000 is town. Mafia will jump on the wagon because he is an incredibly easy mislynch. Just because a mafia is voting a townie, it doesn't mean that their vote can't be \"justified.\" It means that they're voting a mislynch, but it can still be a justified vote. A vote being justified has a correlation with someone being mafia, but not all townies' votes are necessarily justified and not all mafia's votes are necessarily unjustified. <br><br>Case two: _Over9000 is scum. Mafia will jump on the wagon because it's likely to hit a lynch, and they need to be seen as bussing. For those that are town, imagine that you were mafia (in fact, there are likely 3 mafia who all could be doing this). Wouldn't you jump on the Over9000 wagon whether he was a townie or a scumbuddy? <br><blockquote><div><cite>Nameless wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>implosion #152 wrote:</cite>He isn't as much of an easy target, but he is to an extent.</div></blockquote><br>^ Here implosion gives his stance on a major bandwagon (WoMC) ... as a meaningless, wishy-washy statement.<br></div></blockquote><br>I'm saying I don't like it, but I dislike it less than the over9000 wagon.

If an accusation is based on a subjective interpretation, there isn't much you can do to defend against it other than more clearly state what you meant and hope the other players believe you.

This point was already made by Zdenek (#65).<br>- Your fourth post accused neil of asking for a free ride and being afraid of appearing to be posting because his name was mentioned, FoSed implosion and mb53 for posting scumlists, and called me out for answering a question. The exact points against neil were new, although over half a dozen similar points were already made between neko (#88) and I (#95). The point against implosion / mb53 was already made between neko (#85) and neil (#86).

I really don't see why, if implosion is scum and over is town, he would need to wait until tomorrow to attack the wagon if it were the prevailing one.

It sounds as though, from his perspective, that the over wagon is scummy because over himself is an easy target.  Here's what he says about the WMC wagon:<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>I don't really like this wagon either. He isn't as much of an easy target, but he is to an extent. And since he provided a game in which he sort of set a trap (assuming that he had a different name on a different forum) I'm inclined to not find the \"trap\" scummy</div></blockquote><br>So, implosion finds WMC to be less scummy and therefore less of an easy target.  So that makes his wagon less scummy?  There is a major disconnect in logic here it seems.  Implosion, can you clarify how WMC's wagon isn't just as suspect if not more so than over's?"}

We definitely don't really have much against neil, but should his replacement do anything scummy, he will have done so from a bad position already. That is my view on things.<br><br>Zdenek, so you really think silavor's first vote was that scummy? I see your logic there, and sure it is a point, but it just seems so small to me. I'm much more interested in silavor supposedly knowing how many scum are in this game. HOWEVER, I believe it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">only</span> weighs anything if we have a double scum team game going on, and he therefore only has 1 partner. If this is a standard mini, there will be 3 scum, and the point will be absolutely moot. The fact that he's previously only played newbie games (which are semi-open setups with 2 scum every time) I don't really buy being able to lynch silavor based on the information we had. In fact, if there is only 1 scum family, I'm inclined to believe silavor is town because of this. I wouldn't put him as experienced enough to come up with a fake slip indicating that he knows how many scum there are.<br><br>Again, if new information leads us to understand that there are 2 scum teams with a pair of scum each, then yes that was a huge scum slip, and I feel like it would be absolutely vote-worthy.<br><br>I don't like implosion's views right now at all. He's basically calling people out for voting the scummiest players. What do you want us to do? Pressure players who we don't believe are scummy? Of course I'm going to vote for the \"easiest\" player to wagon, because it means he's the scummiest. I felt like Weapon's original wagon built in the first couple pages was suspect, considering how many people jumped on that and with so little to add, but I don't see a single vote for over9000 right now that isn't completely justified.<br><br>This is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">especially</span> bad, because implosion himself has declared over9000 to be scummy (in his list, over9000 is the very bottom).

KingTwelveSixteen already pointed out some specifics, so I'll be looking out for explanations in WoMC's next reply to tell whether the wall was scummy or just rushed.<br><br>Re. WoMC's question: Your trap was a good page 1 post, but it makes for a weaksauce page 8 argument. The logic is flawed because there was little else for town or scum to add. Move on.<br><br>Re. KTS's question: Implosion could be setting up a mislynch NOW so that it has greater credibility later, plus nets him townie points for slowing what he can convince others is a bad wagon.<br><br>q21's last attack on KTS is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">awful</span>. Asking a hypothetical question does not mean you assume it to be the case. And accusing KTS of making relationship-based arguments right after WoMC's wall of fail screams of tunneling. KTS's reaction post is quite frankly justified, and q21's following refusal to justify the argument himself is utterly unconvincing. After this + ignoring my #185 I'm ranking q21 equal first on my scumlist.<br><br>Oh, and I just want to add that implosion's justification for attacking only _over9000's wagon is actually really good. Of course it's just as valid for a scum player as a town one - ie. if those on WoMC's wagon have more possible reasons for joining, then it's harder for scum to set them up as opportunistic - but still. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">"}

If you've mentioned suspicion of q21 before that post could you please point to it for me? <br><br>Second, my scum list is Ice, Silavor/Pie and Neko in that order. Apologies in advance for the wall.<br><br>ICEninja was the first one to ping the scumdar. In his first post, he casts suspicion on WMC for what seemed pretty obviously a joke when I read it (I'll get into the later claim that it was a trap... later) and then once it earns him two votes, he backpeddles saying he only thought it was strange and he didn\u2019t say it was scummy. This feels false since his post certainly intended to cast suspicion. Who cares if you SAID it was scummy? It was certainly implied. He also says \u201cI'm glad others are noting that this is suspicious\u201d which is clearly manipulation (and the result he wanted, obviously). <br><br>Silavor/Pie puts a 2nd vote on weapons for being jumpy and defensive. This seems off since Weapon had every reason to be jumpy and defensive after Ice\u2019s accusation. Could definitely be an attempt to draw attention away from Ice\u2019s wagon. It gets worse when Silavor/Pie says he was being sarcastic when he voted weapons \u201cfor being jumpy, defensive, using IIoA as a scumtell on page 1, and because it's still RVS.\" I don\u2019t see how he could\u2019ve intended sarcasm, since Weapons WAS being defensive. More likely he was using the RVS statement to distance himself from the accusation, possibly to avoid negative attention.<br><br>Neko then validates Silavor/Pie\u2019s statement that he was being sarcastic. This is really scummy. Even if he was being sarcastic with the RVS statement, he clearly wasn't being sarcastic when he accused Weapons of being jumpy and defensive. Makes no sense for town-Neko to back up Silavor/Pie here.<br><br>Darth then defends Ice pretty blatantly (pointed out soon after by Nameless). It's unlikely the two are scum together - I can't imagine a scum buddy being comfortable doing this.<br><br>Silavor/Pie\u2019s post 44 also seems scummy. He says \u201cI\u2019d just like to point out\u201d followed by a noncommittal post explaining someone else\u2019s reasoning (why not let them do it themself?) The whole thing feels like verbiage for \u201cI really want everyone to like me so please don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u201d.<br><br>This is where Weapons posts that the contradiction was a trap he set. This makes no sense at all - first where it seemed like a joke and second with the timing of how everything went down. Why would he say that we'd all missed something like he did (which is also more likely if it was a joke we missed) - and why draw attention to it like this if it was a trap? His timing for saying it was a trap is off, too. He's under pressure, being wagoned and this seems more like a desperate measure. I'm on the fence about this. Maybe scum for making up the story or maybe town who thought that was the best way to derail a townie wagon or maybe he really did plan it as a trap (if so, it's the worst one ever).<br><br>He then says \u201cI would also call silavor scum, but his last point was quite good about implosion/mb53.\u201d This is garbage, as it\u2019s the first time Weapons has mentioned silavor at all, he gives no reason for thinking he\u2019s scum and instead says his last point was good. Are we to assume he\u2019s agreeing with Zdenek\u2019s post 38 accusing silavor? Or is it because silavor had just voted weapons? It also is ridiculous because I see absolutely nothing in the post Weapons is referring to that gives Weapons reason to go from scum read to town read on silavor. In fact, that post of silavor\u2019s is really scummy. At this point, Weapons is either a really bad town player or a really bad scum player. Not sure which atm.<br><br>Post 57 reads like scum distancing. Neko saying Ice is going to get on his nerves and that he\u2019s making mountains out of molehills - distancing without attacking at all. Then Ice declares that Neko\u2019s response to the \u201cweak jab\u201d reads as town.<br><br>Ice then posts calling out mongoose for voting weapons without giving reason and then gives implosion a free pass for posting a scum list with no reasoning. Instead he focuses on asking why nameless was listed as scummy. If he were really scum hunting (rather than scum pretending to do so) I think he'd also have called out Implosion here. He also says he agrees with what neko is saying so he doesn't find him scummy. Since when is someone not scum because they agree with you? This free pass is very suspicious.<br><br>Nameless post 94 seems really protown, especially toward the weak weapons wagon and how he calls out neko<br><br>So then ice says \u201cI think Saint is mildly scummy due to his predecessor and partially because of his all over the place posting.\u201d This follows Zedenek having added a vote to Saint. This is subtle wagon pushing and keeping yourself open to hammer a townie. Also, what is scummy about posting several posts the way he did, and how is it \u201call over the place\u201d? Has this always bothered you, or are you just making friends with KTS? Or just looking for a reason to hammer a townie? Ironically, ice then posts again (so all over the place and scummy!) to add a little umph to his future Saint vote. Does this bring him up from mildly scummy, ice? You can probably vote him soon without looking too suspicious right? Check.<br><br>So then ice says there's a connection between implosion and saint (he doesn't say what the connection is of course \u2013 just sets up a future lynch of saint if implosion flips scum. Or vice versa. Check and check.)<br><br>After Saint defends himself, ice says he's now totally fine with a lynch of saint or implosion (surprise!). Fast jump from \u201cmildly scummy\u201d to lynchable eh ice? Nice that you can safely be on both leading wagons too! (Check.)<br><br>I hate the Saint wagon. I'm not seeing it and really don't see scum claiming vanilla the way over did. I have plenty of other suspicions/town reads of other players, but for now my vote's on Ice.<br><br>[b]vote: ICENinja[/b]<br><br>Not sure why I can't get the tags to work. Meh."}

MB is on me because I am suspicious of him, Implosion would be on me because I am trying to get him lynched, and I guess Ice is just looking for an easy lynch regardless of alignment. That is my take on it, so far. You are suspicious of Ice setting this up, but I saw it from Zdenek as well, even if he is voting for Nameless now.<br><br>Also, what do you think of Nameless, Setael? I haven't seen you mention him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Ice's 324</span>:<br>I actually have to defend him on this one. I have had a general town-read on him, and I fully expect it to be easier on him to make a case on me because he doesn't know my alignment as scum would. I expect scum to be voting me moreso like MB/Nameless are than Ice. I could be wrong, but I don't believe I am.<br><br>Why would Ice seek my lynch? I have stated he was my strongest town read, I believe scum want to keep townies who have town reads on them around, especially ones who are notoriously bad at mafia. Possibly WIFOM? Sure, but when someone is defending their attacker, you have to always take it with a grain of salt. I'm not really happy lynching Ice, although I figured voting him would help me live, as his wagon currently has momentum. However, I want to lynch scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nameless wrote:</cite>Setael: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2782242#p2782242\" class=\"postlink\">This</a> exchange (which q21 ignored in further posts) and my second last paragraph <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2786593#p2786593\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> are primarily why I'm guessing your slot is scum.</div></blockquote><br>OK?

When you first posted about Implosion's list you said nothing that indicated you thought it was scummy in the least. Instead, you just wondered about his placement of Nameless. Here is what you said:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ice wrote:</cite>Regarding implosion's list, I feel like his positioning of nameless is extremely suspect. Why did you put nameless down as one of the scummiest? I can't find anything suspicious that he's done, and I can't find anything besides a random vote against him in anything you've said. You seemed to arbitrarily put him down there. Can you explain what he has done that you find scummy? Your stance against mongoose is fully justified and I agree with it, but like nameless, you haven't said anything about over9000.</div></blockquote><br>If you thought it was scummy that Implosion posted a list at all, why didn't you say so here instead of responding to the list like you did with no mention of thinking it shouldn't have been posted? This whole analysis you provide of Implosion's list actually seems to indicate that you're taking it seriously and have no problem with it being posted.<br><br>It's not until after neko says it's bad that you chime in with a \"yeah, me too.\" Even then, you don't go after implosion at all, you just say you won't be making a list and then you give reasons why you won't. Here's what you say about it at this point (still not actually saying it's scummy to make a list- your point seems to be more that they're unnecessary at this point than scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ice wrote:</cite>I, as well, will not be putting forth a comprehensive list.

Monday at midnight you found him mildly scummy for meh reasons (like because he posted more than once upon replacing in.

Instead it's you paving the way for your place on the Saint wagon. (Because you're scum and he's a townie, see? It all makes sense.)"}

I would not oppose a lynch of either, but I am finding Empking slightly scummier atm for the following reasons:<br><br>-His entrance into the game (Setael\u2019s summary in #366 is a pretty good synopsis) was scummier than Saint\u2019s\u2014I felt Saint, in spite of his left-field-ish reads and blatant buddying, was at least more forthright and not playing in as anti-town a manner.  There was very little I liked about Empking\u2019s entrance into the game, and he continues to not be very forthright: his #369 responses to Set\u2019s questions still rely entirely on \u201cgut\u201d when we\u2019re 15 pages in.<br>-His case on KTS in #357\u2014active lurking, lurker voting, vote hopping, all sounds like stuff he is doing as well, while pretending to scumhunt on KTS.  I can\u2019t imagine both playslots are scum, just because I can\u2019t see scumbuddies interacting with each other like this, but at this point, I have to think one or the other is.<br>-And part of the reason this feels like pretend scumhunting is his vote is on Nameless, but his ISO reveals very little scumhunting happening there, which comes across at the very least as inconsistent and/or vote hopping while he pretends to act town elsewhere, and may end up being a form of distancing.<br><br>We\u2019re 4-5 days from the deadline (for me in my time zone, it is basically four days, since the deadline is in the middle of the night), and, like other players have said, a no-lynch isn\u2019t an option, so I agree that we need to come together on a wagon.

This excuse still feels contrived\u2026I\u2019m getting a bad vibe from it.<br><br>@Setael: I\u2019ve gotten a chance to go over your case on Ice\u2014there\u2019s some persuasive stuff in there, but some of that evidence will depend on how players like Saint flip.  That being said, I do agree with a couple of your other points\u2014especially him not calling out Implosion after the scumlist.  Additionally, my read on Ice has been less townish ever since his non-reaction reaction to Saint\u2019s entry into the game.  However, in looking at Ice as a lynch candidate, I realized that I think Saint and Emp are both better lynches atm\u2014Ice is leaning closer to neutral for me, Emp and Saint closer to scum, and I think with Ice, it will depend on how certain flips turn out, so I\u2019d rather lynch someone I\u2019m a little more confident is scum.<br><br>@Saint: How was I \u201ctwisting\u201d your words?

You were basically trolling him; there is no other way to put it. Even assuming you believe your game theory, you know fully well that the majority of players don't. Attempting to argue it in the middle of an ongoing game - where you have already been accused of not providing specific analysis - is never going to increase your townie standing.

It's clear you were choosing to get a rise out of King.<br><br>I can think of several possible reason for this but nothing of them are good. You could be scum, using this as a distraction to avoid answering harder questions or draw attention away from a wagon on a scumbuddy, maybe waiting to jump on the first player who snaps and makes a mistake. You could be arrogant IRL, in which case stop and think a little further ahead before you post next time. For all I know you could just be an actual troll who needs to play to their win condition or gtfo.<br><br>But you could not be both town and stupid enough to believe that you're playing optimally for your situation in <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> game.<br><br>Setael: I honestly haven't been paying THAT much attention to your posts, since I'd rather see implosion or Saint lynched D1. In general, I'm not buying your accusations but they don't jump out as scummy either. The comment about noticing you referred to the fact that you as well as implosion were keen to defend Saint. You know, despite the WALL OF EVIDENCE that Saint still refuses to EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF.<br><br>DarthYoshi: I wouldn't have been reluctant to cast an early or initial vote on Saint, it just would have been inefficient since I'd need to unvote from the larger wagon on another scum? Not really sure how to further explain this.<br><br>Empking:<br>* What I meant in regards to Saint was that I agreed (mostly) with who he stated to be scum/town, but I found his buddying, fluff, unprovoked defense of lurkers etc. scummy. These are entirely different things.<br>* Making one or two lazy posts out of ~30 regular contributions does not a lurker make. Typing a scumlist and the word \"gut\" after 250 posts and then sitting back with a smug look on your face <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span>.<br>* Imma use a quote for this one:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>People have faulty memories. Also not a scum tell.</div></blockquote><br>* What is misleading about my TOWN / SAINT post? Those are all direct quotes referring to Saint, exactly zero of which Saint had acknowledged.<br>* Given the context, I disagree; implosion's shenanigans with _over9000's wagon are well documented, and that he continues to hedge around Saint's wagon - despite his initial protests of 'not enough to read!' now being null - is significant. I could have elaborated instead of joked, but DarthYoshi already asked him the obvious question in #346."}

It's honestly very hard to pay attention to a case against ice when 1) he's obviously not going to be a lynch candidate today and 2) Emp and King are dominating the discussion.  I really don't see either one of them coming out if any better than the other.  Yes, King is engaging in pointless rhetoric (annoying playstyle is not scummy), but Emp is fueling it (to cement your read?  But it's clear your read has already been cemented, so why goad him on?).<br><br>Speaking of Emp's reads-- you pegged me as scum based on gut as soon as you replaced, and now you are fabricating a story around it to make that read make sense, it seems to me.  Also, why do you have the impression that the town is self-destructing?  This implies multiple bad wagons, and there's no way you can know if the town is self-destructing unless you know who the townies are.<br><br>Zedenek--You keep saying Ice isn't a good lynch today, but I'm not wondering about today, I'm wondering about in general, do you think he might be a good lynch?  You seem to be trying to skirt the issue.<br><br>Personally, I really don't see the case on Ice at the moment.  He has changed his reads, and somehow this is alarming.  Reads can change, and unless I'm missing something, they've been justified.  I haven't, however, had the time to look at this timing issue that Set brings up, so when I have the time later (probably tomorrow) I need to take a look at that.  <br><br>If Emp is indeed mason, btw, it would indeed be really stupid for the partner to be outed.

It needs to be their choice to verify it. If you are town, your partner has to claim before you are lynched in order to avoid scum being able to claim your mason partner later. If your partner then claims, the town will not know who to believe and it could lead to a mislynch of your mason buddy. (This would be more likely to happen if scum was under pressure from a wagon or maybe in lylo but still. You need to be alive to verify that whoever claims to be your buddy is actually your buddy.

You tell him to claim his partner but then say you will lynch him anyway. So if he is town, you completely erase any motivation for his partner to reveal. In the position he's in, there is almost no way a scum buddy would out themselves to falsely verify the claim. (Because this close to deadline as the leading wagon there's way too high a likelihood that Emp will be lynched on Tuesday and out that scum buddy. Especially where one of them would need to be lynched to verify the mason claim and give us one confirmed townie.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Emp wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>neko wrote:</cite>If Emp is indeed mason, btw, it would indeed be really stupid for the partner to be outed.

Pie votes him for having Mongoose as a predeccesor (or something). neko has said that meta-wise town-emp is missing and that town-emp would have called for a mass-claim.<br>This post is entirely a link to where Emp says town should mass-claim in these games, specifically only <span style=\"font-style: italic\">after</span> someone has called you on it. +1.5 for that, another +1 for ignoring everything else, +1 again for doing these both together.<br><br>Post 13: I post the bigger \"what.\" post and Empking responds with this post. He claims not answering questions or giving reasoning for votes is a town-tell because it has no scum motivation but plenty of town ones. +1/2 for forgetting that scum could purpousefully do town-tells in order to seem town. +1/2 for not giving those town reasons.<br><br>Post 14: Argumentation with me happening again. I give scum motivations (Stifle debate and get away with not needing arguments) and ask for town ones, he says the town ones are to \"lure scum out of their comfort zone\" (which makes no sense) and \"helps trap players who are more interested in theory than hunting scum.\" He says I'm one of the second type. Then he calls my scum reasons awful because \"it doesn't\" (+1/2) and \"Arguments are rarely scummy.\" (+?)<br><br>Post 15: I say it does stifle debate and give an example, then point out that faulty arguments could get town killed and should be considered scummy. (since scum wants town killed.) I ask how it takes scum out of their comfort zone and mention that knowing the reasoning behind votes is important for determening their alignment.<br><br>Then comes his post: He says it doesn't stifle debate because he's \"finding scum\" (me?) and because people who arn't me and him are talking about other things, which is false, the last 5 posts are only ours, +1 for that, another +1 for it being irrelevant to the debate whether other people are talking about other things, since we are talking about whether the debate on Nameless is being stifled. Then he says that unless they are made public faulty cases arn't damaging. He says the reason that it lures scum out of their comfort zone is that they can't prepare and its unusual. Then he responds to the last point (importance of arguments for alignment determinations) by saying I'm lying and giving no other reason, +1.<br><br>Post 16: I say that Nameless debate is stifled and other people talking is irrelevant to him finding scum, people voting with faulty cases in their mind will cause mis-lynches, \"theres a reason for [it being unusual]...\", nobody can prepare or even respond to it, and that he should counter the last point instead of calling me a liar.<br>He says: \"As the only player on the right track...I kinda am\" which I have already made an angry post about, +1 for not giving real reasons. He doesn't respond to the next point, instead claiming I'm changing the goal posts and am scum for it, then does that \"who would do that? Oh, yeah, scum.\" thing again, +1. Says the reason why its unusual is newbie games teaching new players badly. Says town don't need to prepare and ignores the rest of the point, +1. He says he doesn't have to debunk the point because it is clearly false because scum arn't honest, +0 because he actually gave a reason there, even if he was pretending not to.<br><br>Post 17: People other than just us two start posting again. Ice says Emp's case is weak and that he isn't scumhunting much (and that Ice doesn't like me either). Implosion asks Emp if he saw the reactions to scumscales before he posted his and if he was purpousfully giving terrible reasoning for everything, then agrees with neko about Emp-meta, and says he would have switched to Emp now if he hadn't already been voting for Mongoose. Yoshi says he can't tell if Emp is scum or just anti-town.<br>I make my counter which goes, not including the attitude thing, basically like this: I didn't change goalposts that happened automatically, Emp saying I'm doing it is him trying to do it. This part is officially going nowhere. I point out the parts of this point he ignored. I say the whole point is that scum are dishonest whilst town is honest. I also mention that Emps playing is bad enough to make me think he could be a jester, if there were jesters.<br>His reply is post 17, where he says: AtE on the attitude thing, then asks me why I am having \"this argument\"<br><br>Post 18: I ask which argument he's asking about, if its the big argument or the thing about attitudes that just popped up, and that the reason I made the whole huge thing for the second was because I dislike it so much. Emp asks if I'm not hunting scum, just distracting the town, says I'm scum for it, then says that this is the last post for me because he's still on Nameless's wagon, +3 points for that last part.<br><br>Post 19: Consecutive to previous post, answers Implosion's questions with yes I saw people talking about the scumscales before I posted them and then uses the second to attack me, instead of giving any actual answer, +1 for that, he says I'm active lurking, using rhetoric to get town to like me, lurker voting, wagon hopping, and \"not even pretening to scumhunt,\" he also acts like a jerk to Implosion, +1/4.<br><br>Post 20: I give a case against Emp right before this post that goes like so: Mentioning the +three thing then sarcasticly immitating him, he didn't answer Implosion's second question, give a counter for \"wagon hopping\" and say the Emp is doing it himself, Emp dodges way to many questions, a thing about AtE that I realised was incorrect and won't repeat, if our argument was me active lurking than Emp is as well, except worse since he started it, and then pointed out that +four thing way back in post 5.<br>He said: I argued with you to cement my read (so its not active lurking), that my entire post is just OMGUS, and that he did answer Implosion's question. +5 for ignoring the entire rest of the argument in favor of attacking the points he thought weakest.<br><br>Post 21: Pie says he wants Empking lynched. Emp's post is responding to Setael's post, nothing really scummy here that I see.<br><br>Post 22: Setael makes a post about Emp that goes approximately like so: Emp why did you claim Ice as scum at the start then not follow through? Mongoose just coasted through and played terribly, Emp didn't give reasons in his scumscale post then gave \"gut\" as a reason for being most suspicious of Nameless, Emp put neko Ice and Nameless on his scumlist and I like that because thats who I think is scum. If Emp is scum I am doing horribly. Emp listed q21 as town which I thought was wrong, q21 did terrible. I think it's wierd that Emp thinks my slot is town from q21's posts and I find myself agreeing with him because of it, except that he could know I am town because he is scum. I would prefer an Ice lynch with Empking coming in second.<br>Emp responded like so: Gut and proper analysis are two different ways of analysing posts, gut is more accurate for me. +1/2 for not at least bringing this up sooner.<br><br>Post 23: Set says Emp should say more stuff and asks the questions: Why did you think Ice was scummy at the start? What do you think of my case on Ice? What about his defense? Why do you think q21 is town? <br><br><br><br>(Other stuff noticed during read-through: Saint never stopped being scummy, and is currently lurking to avoid suspicion. Saint also somehow claimed VT out of nowhere without many people commenting on it.<br>Pie made a scum-list at one point, and in the same post said my \"bandwagon-hopping is setting off tons of alarms now.\" Then he votes Empking entirely because of his predeccesor. Afterwards he claims this is not the case and that Emp is \"not setting off town bells in my head\" but does not say he is scummy, which is contradictory. Suspicious.)"}

Those quotes are clearly not arbitrary, you took one of the few posts I said there was nothing scummy about, the ending thing that I hadn't even finished yet, and the last one is you just taking me explaining what is currently going on at the time of your post and ignoring the entire part that is actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">analysing</span> the post.<br>2. My thing has literally everything about your posts in this game and people's response to them, with little numbers for everything you've done that is scummy.<br>3. I list everything you did that I thought scummy and even give them little rankings for how scummy I think they are, how could that possibly be IIoA?<br>4. There is clearly going to be controversy about this claim. To think otherwise is foolhardy.<br>5. Typical argument would be me saying \"still hasn't explained his reads, +1,\"\"Ignores it, +1.\" I'm pretty sure you're just taking the easiest things to attack and attacking them only, whilst trying to paint the entire thing as like that. I gave that a +5 the last time you did it.<br>6. Yes, you do.<br>7. You have done so many scummy things that you've gotten away with a bunch of them just because people are to busy accusing you of the other things, and you're ability to completly ignore things you don't like is rather amazing. I wanted EVERYTHING scummy you've done to be on the table, not just the more obvious stuff or the things you actually respond to.<br>8. See point seven.<br><br>Oh, and since nobodies pointed it out yet, Empkings at L-1."}

Right there you say the reason you did so is that in-depth analysis is useless. Later you use \"not thinking about the game in depth\" as part of your accusation against me, clearly showing you did not actually believe what you said.

This is the only protown thing to do, since the deadline is so close and too many people are willing to hammer (including me) to avoid a no lynch and clearly no one is willing to really consider another wagon this late. The only way to avoid your lynch is for you both to claim and point out the breadcrumbs - this was inevitable from the moment you claimed. This is the only benefit of masons - you can confirm each other. Regardless of the scummy thing nameless said about lynching you anyway, this should not happen. If you both claim, we have 2 confirmed townies and there should be protections that at least will make it difficult for the scum to know which one to target, and there should be a cop role that can ask about either you or your buddy to eventually confirm you. If you are town, your buddy needs to claim and point out crumbs in order to stop your wagon.<br><br>Nobody hammer until this happens - there's a chance his buddy isn't active or isn't sure what to do.

Set\u2019s case in #423 seems like a paradox to me\u2014Nameless has been overly careful, but still reckless enough to drop a tell like the ill-advised coinflip post?  I would prefer a Nameless lynch to avoid a no lynch, obviously, but I think there are better lynch candidates out there.<br><br>@ Neko: I\u2019d re-vote Implosion or Saint if the town needs a different lynch candidate.  Saint may be the more likely alternate lynch candidate given the bandwagon that was once on him.  I will say that his recent behavior of promising content for the past 2-3 days and not delivering is not what I have seen previously from TownSaint, especially so close to a deadline, and I think that not having a vote out 24 hours before deadline is inexcusable.  His recent behavior does NOT look like his town game.  <br><br>Beyond that, I\u2019m not sure\u2014the only other player with a vote on them atm is Ice, which seems out of the question, with only one vote and that vote being pretty outdated from a generally inactive player.<br><br>So, here\u2019s where I\u2019m at--I would support the Nameless bandwagon if it were the only way to avoid a no-lynch, but that isn't the case atm.  If Emp's mason claim is true, tbh I'm not a big fan of a Nameless lynch, and would prefer an Implosion or Saint lynch.  I don't entirely believe Emp's claim, but on the chance that he is actually telling the truth, SOMEONE needs to take the plunge and add to an alternate bandwagon, so I'll push my former vote, as it had a bit of a bandwagon earlier in the day.

In fact, many of the arguments against him I've found very scummy: <br><blockquote><div><cite>me wrote:</cite>So then ice says \u201cI think Saint is mildly scummy due to his predecessor and partially because of his all over the place posting.\u201d This follows Zedenek having added a vote to Saint.

Has this always bothered you, or are you just making friends with KTS? Or just looking for a reason to hammer a townie? Ironically, ice then posts again (so all over the place and scummy!) to add a little umph to his future Saint vote. Does this bring him up from mildly scummy, ice? You can probably vote him soon without looking too suspicious right? Check.</div></blockquote><br>It's true that my #1 reason to think Saint is town are the opportunistic votes zedenek and ice put on him with crap reasons (as well as ice's play regarding saint in general), but I don't feel scum from over's posts or his. It's a crappy wagon. So though there's a chance you know mb is town and that makes me nervous, I don't see Saint as a better option.<br><blockquote><div><cite>me wrote:</cite>I hate the Saint wagon.

They knew we weren't going to allow a no lynch. Unless Saint is scum, in which case his buddies probably helped push the mb wagon to get it off of Saint. On Feb. 21 there were 6 people voting empking and he was at L-1.<br><br>I started the mb wagon and neko was the first to follow me onto it. Next is Saint. Then everybody starts voting saint - KingTwelveSixteen, mb53, InflatablePie, nameless, Darth Yoshi (2 of these I now know are town). So at this point it was Saint with 5 votes and mb with 3. Then empking and implosion join the mb wagon, followed by swiftstrike and then pie hammers. Of these, if Saint is town I think maybe one of neko, saint, implosion and swiftstrike could be scum, but I'll bet the rest of the scum stayed off wagon. (These are Ice, KTS, nameless, Darth, Zdenek)<br><br>If Saint is scum, there were probably more scum on the mb wagon, as it moved from saint to mb. mb and Pie moved to the saint wagon instead of mb as well as nameless and darth. Saint's wagon could very easily have gained the momentum to be the D1 lynch so I don't think it likely that any of these votes were bussing when it was so easy to vote mb instead. If Saint is scum, nameless and darth are probably town. Everyone who moved to the mb wagon when Saint's had 5 on it would look a lot worse - empking, implosion, and swiftstrike. Again, though, if this is the case I think scum could've just sat back and watched the townies mislynch mb. (I was one of those townies so it feels this way to me.)<br><br>If Saint is town, I think we're looking at a scum group of Ice, neko and nameless (with maybe Darth or KTS if there are 4). If Saint is scum, implosion and swiftstrike are much more likely to be scum. I believe empking's claim more and more so he's kind of off my radar for now.<br><br>Looking back, my reasons for not wanting to join the Saint wagon are not that strong, I know 2 townies at least believed he was scum and there'd be a lot of info from his lynch. There's a good chance scum just watched as the town mislynched mb without need of their help, but if Saint is scum, then it's more likely that scum were involved in the wagon switch.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Saint<br></span>"}

Wha? Nothing has changed from yesterday's good reasons to not be voting a claimed mason except that the wagon we switched to ended up being a townie. I don't see townies voting empking right now. At all. I also don't like the suggestion to mass claim. Scum is likely frustrated they hit vanilla last night. They don't want that to happen again tonight. Of course they want a mass claim. Scummiest idea ever. <br><br>Yesterday, everything that was pointed out about Saint as a reason to lynch him I could see a townie doing. The main argument was that the way he replaced in was scummy which I never thought was a good reason since I can definitely see a townie replacing in and addressing the negative attention on their slot. And if it was in several posts, so? I don't see town being more motivated than scum to post in an organized way. And then I got a town vibe from most of his posts and a scum vibe from his wagon. Well turns out 2 of those on his wagon were townies so either 2-3 of the others were scum, or my Saint read was probably wrong. If 4-5 townies agree on someone being scummy, likely I'm the one whose read is wrong. So basically, Saint's flip will give me a much better idea of who I can trust."}

When called on this, he handwaved that he was shifting his playstyle and acted as if being suicidal was good townie play.<br>* Saint began D2 by fishing for power roles, and pretending that all of D1 was nothing to work with.</div></blockquote><br>I don't see how I buddied anyone.

Why are you only concerned with the jump, and not paying attention to my reason for doing so? Why the refusal to see that Ice may be scum?

I had a town read on Saint and didn't want emp lynched. I had already tried Ice and got no support and I hadn't found anything further on neko or Pie either who were my other 2 scum reads.

I've explained pretty much the whole thing over and over, and yet you still say I'm \"beating around the bush.\" The rest of your case is based on some link between me and Saint. To quote the wiki, since it's the most convenient place I can remember to find this: <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Do not fool yourself into thinking you can call the scumteam, especially before anyone has flipped scum. Don't bother with trying to draw connections between players until one of them is dead. It's tempting! but futile.</div></blockquote><br>Why are you placing so much value on scumteam speculation? At this point, honestly, it seems like the majority of your case on me... if you're town, there's no reason for you to do so since it is essentially futile (besides, if you are town, then it's wrong). If you're mafia, by all means, push scumteam speculation. It's just scummy, because it's a BS way to push a person. also, the last sentence of the quoted post reads scummy to me. It feels to me like setting up a failsafe for if you manage to push the wagon on me through, i flip town, and people start to turn on you. So ICE, I'd like to ask you. Say I get lynched today and I flip town. Who would you likely suspect next? You've been tunneling me since mid-day one, and I'm curious to know what your opinion is on any player in this game whose name isn't implosion or Saint. If you're going to tunnel me for the entire game, please, explain your case... the vast majority of it is totally invalid. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>We shouldn't be looking in to implosion because Saint and implosion are scum buddies, remember? Saint was actually on the implosion wagon, pushing quite hard, but fell off that wagon once town was distracted and never looked back. Coincidence?

Next is Saint. Then everybody starts voting saint - KingTwelveSixteen, mb53, InflatablePie, nameless, Darth Yoshi (2 of these I now know are town). So at this point it was Saint with 5 votes and mb with 3. Then empking and implosion join the mb wagon, followed by swiftstrike and then pie hammers. Of these, if Saint is town I think maybe one of neko, saint, implosion and swiftstrike could be scum, but I'll bet the rest of the scum stayed off wagon. (These are Ice, KTS, nameless, Darth, Zdenek)</div></blockquote><br>The most likely permutation is either one on two off or two on one off, if we assume three scum. How many exactly there are is speculation, can be WIFOM'd by the mafia, and isn't the best way to figure out peoples' alignments this early in the game with only two flips. <br><br>Note: at this point, I am reconsidering about Saint. I still think he's town overall... but people continuing to speculate about what peoples' alignments are based on his alignment before his alignment has flipped is pointless.

Wha? Nothing has changed from yesterday's good reasons to not be voting a claimed mason except that the wagon we switched to ended up being a townie. I don't see townies voting empking right now. At all. I also don't like the suggestion to mass claim. Scum is likely frustrated they hit vanilla last night. They don't want that to happen again tonight. Of course they want a mass claim. Scummiest idea ever. </div></blockquote><br>This is somewhat similar to how I feel right now about Saint. I think this post (of saint's) is scummy (awaiting answer to my question about it). I think it's a terrible idea. I still think that on the whole, he is more likely town. <br><br>@Setael 627; I'll definitely support an ICE wagon. <br><br>Okay. Lets look at Ice's summary of himself today in 629. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Setael wrote:</cite>you jumped from finding Saint \"mildly scummy\" to being ready to lynch him within minutes.<br></div></blockquote><br>I did, hmm? How about we take a look at every single post I've made during day 2 so far:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite>Saint still looks like a fair lynch too, but I'm still favoring implosion. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If implosion flips scum, I'm probably going to barrel down on Saint until he's dead</span>, due to their day 1 interactions leading a connection that runs even deeper than Saint's scummy play.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite>We shouldn't be looking in to implosion because <span class=\"noboldsig\">Saint and implosion are scum buddies, remember?</span> Saint was actually on the implosion wagon, pushing quite hard, but fell off that wagon once town was distracted and never looked back. Coincidence? I think not.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite>Alright I reread nameless. He's pretty town. And he's probably right about <span class=\"noboldsig\">Saint (who I believe is a likely scum buddy with implosion).</span> I'm definitely not going to be voting Nameless today unless there is some significant information I missed. He was dead right about the mb wagon that sprung up. Sure mb wasn't the most town player, but he wasn't implosion.<br><br>Both Saint and implosion were on the mb wagon. He was the easiest non Saint/implosion person for scum to wagon, so this further supports my theory.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite>Alright, I like the reasons for voting Saint. I'm on board<br></div></blockquote><br>So I went from thinking he's mildly scummy to being ready to lynch him in minutes? He went from being scum I wanted to lynch tomorrow to scum I want to lynch today. Big difference.<br><br>Yes, I agree that you HAVE reasons for lynching him (information is always good to have), but considering you had a TOWN read on him yesterday, the reasons you gave to justify voting him were bad. Basically, I liked your vote, but not your reasons for it.<br><br>Now your vote for me is bad and OMGUS.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Saint/implosion is still a better lynch though.</span></div></blockquote><br>Bolded statements are <span class=\"noboldsig\">hardcore tunneling</span>. ICE, apparently, feels the need to reassert what he's said in every other post he's made this game in every new post he makes. Why is this scummy? Well, a town player will post their opinion, push on people, and maybe if people forget their opinion remind people. I mean, it's not like everyone and their mother doesn't know that ICE says he thinks Saint and I are scumbuddies. On the other hand, saying in every single post, over and over repetitively that Saint and I are scumbuddies is a way to ignore everyone else. He's picked out the targets that he wants to push on, and is now closing himself off to any new information. If he's town, he has no reason to do this. If he's mafia, it provides an easy way to push on someone who is town while not talking extensively about other people. Moreover, going back to how he's said (multiple times) that he's \"not sure where he'll go\" if Saint flips town is a way to give him something to come back to after Saint flips town (if Saint is town, which I think). <br><br>At this point, not only is ICE scummier than Saint, but his lynch will be informational as well. He's been hardcore tunneling on me and Saint, he's attacking Setael, etc. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Saint wrote:</cite>considering two townie deaths, and the fact i'm a townie, it would really benefit the town to get all our cards out on the table, to properly lynch between counterclaims/the townie pool<br><br>EVERYONE needs to claim for this to work.</div></blockquote><br>So Saint, you apparently seem to know the setup... how?<br><br>Nameless/ICE reads of Saint's post: this does actually make Saint look very scummy. And yet, I don't know. Part of it might be that I think ICE is scum, which would make Saint likely town. But part of it might be that Saint = furcolow, and I'm not sure if this is necessarily scummy in this context. It might also just be that the rest of the game makes more sense to me if Saint is town. If an ICE wagon doesn't form, I would join the Saint wagon. I honestly would be joining it mostly for the information. I'm finding him really hard to read right now, and things about him that I'm thinking are conflicting. It might also be that the link between me and Saint (when I look just at the reasoning and at Saint's play) does sort of make sense to me. And yet, since I know that I'm town, I know that no such link exists. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite>What I mean is that Emp is not a very pro-town player right now, regardless of his alignment. Regardless of him being scum, mason, or even VT, he's hurt the town and has done very little to help. If he is indeed a mason and is cleared by a mason buddy, then scum has no choice but to night kill him as he'll be a town aligned player that town won't be lynching. This would then prevent scum from night killing one of the people who are genuinely helping town.</div></blockquote><br>You also seem to have knowledge of the setup. Who's to say that there's no masons <span style=\"font-style: italic\">or</span> cop? You seem to be falling back on the \"oh, well cop can clear him and his partner\" idea. Well if they're real (as has been stated) it's somewhat likely that there is no cop; and if they're fake, there still is not necessarily a cop.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ICEninja</span>"}

I'm really unsure about it at this point. <br></div></blockquote><br>You say that you have a neutral slightly leaning town read on the Saint slot. If you can't get a wagon on me, then your second alternative is to turn around and lynch a neutral slightly leaning town player for an information lynch. What does this say about the quality of your scum hunting? Scum doesn't need to get reads on people, they already know who is town and who is scum. Town needs to really dig deep and get reads for themselves as to who is scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>Okay, first off, you saying that you think there's a cop in the game based on your own observation is both 1) completely unverifiable (since verification would mean outing someone that you apparently think is a cop)<br></div></blockquote><br>Why would I want to verify this? I don't want a cop to claim until he/she has sufficient information to make it worth being night killed.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>and 2) completely scummy (since town members will be focusing on finding mafia rather than finding town power roles or trying to figure out a closed setup).<br></div></blockquote><br>If you've never been looking for scum and found PR tells then you simply aren't reading carefully enough. It happens, during the course of examining people's play, that you find what people's motives are. Scum and town have very different motives. PRs and VTs have slightly different motives. Just because I'm not looking for them doesn't mean I don't find them.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>Second off, you've basically admitted that you're speculating about the setup and have based some of your reasoning on speculation.<br></div></blockquote><br>If by \"basing some of my reasoning on speculation\" you mean trying to figure out if Emp's mason claim checks out or not, then yes. I am doing that because town needs to know if he's a mason or if he's scum. I didn't realize this is scummy.<br>If by \"basing some of my reasoning on speculation\" you mean having you and Saint pegged as likely scum buddies, I'm assuming there is more than 1 scum in this game so there's no speculation involved there.<br>I haven't based ANY reasoning of any kind on there being a cop or not in this game.<br><br>Unfortunately for you, the wagon on me taking off isn't terribly likely. You're better off jumping on the Saint wagon now and trying to put together a good reason to do it in order to gain some shred of town cred for tomorrow."}

Because of how sure he was of the connection between implosion and saint, he probably thought if he investigated one he'd have 2 scums basically confirmed to him.

This might have been his way to get a town result on nameless out there without drawing too much attention.

He's not saying Emp is not a townie player - he's separating Emp out from the rest of the town and saying scum will be forced to NK emp rather than one of the other townies (as opposed to us lynching emp for them, in which case the scum then WOULD NK one of the other townies instead of emp). I don't think this is in any way an indication that Ice thought emp was scum.<br><br>I reread Ice's case on Implosion and it's pretty solid. I didn't give it the credit it deserved because I thought ice was scum. Here are his main points:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>I said I had no strong read on _over9000's alignment. <br></div></blockquote><br>Let me go back and quote some things (almost everything, in fact) that you've said about over9000.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>scum:<br>mongoose<br>nameless<br>over9000<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>As for _Over9000, His ISO 2 seems overly cautious and his ISO 3 seems overly unnecessary<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>He's a really easy target, and I'd bet there's at least one scum on his wagon right now. He seems like too easy of a person for scum to pressure for them to pass up, unless he is scum, in which case I still think they'd be inclined to bus him.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>I never once objected to lynching _over9000.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>Where did I say that I thought it was more likely town with scum on the wagon? IIRC, the only statement I've made about 9000's alignment is that he does appear scummy. <br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>No. In fact, I agree that he is scummy, and I'm sure that there is town on his wagon (theoretically it could be all scum, but doubtful).<br></div></blockquote><br>Something isn't adding up. You can't say all of that, then tell us you think it is equally likely for him to be scum and to be town. If you think he's scum and buddies are busing him, then help them bus and lynch scum. If you think he is town and that scum is on his wagon, then you need to specifically point out who is the most likely to be scum and why, as you said yourself you believe there to be town on his wagon.<br><br>You haven't done this. Quickly scanning your ISO shows that you are voting mongoose for silly RVS reasons initially, then pressuring him to answer questions. You seem to think he's scummy, but you've never actually stated why he's more likely to be scum than anyone else who voted over9000, unless I missed something.<br><br>So yes, implosion is absolutely scummy right now.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote implosion</span>.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>implosions wrote:</cite>I was gonna unvote and vote Emp, but then noticed that he's mongoose's replacement and I already have a vote on him.<br></div></blockquote><br>Voting someone because of his predecessor. Why? Because of apparently:<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>I voted mongoose for a contradiction or something (I think, too lazy to go back and check) and then for not answering a question.<br></div></blockquote><br>You can't even remember. Look back at your reasons, they were pretty awful. The fact that you continue to hold your vote for those original reasons means your scum hunting has come to a complete and total standstill.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>I'm also building up suspicion of ICE, partially because I honestly don't see why he's focusing so much on one thing that I said in passing.<br></div></blockquote><br>He suspects me because I'm scum hunting him. This isn't something you said in passing, this is regarding your (still current) scum reads. It is extremely valid, even now.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>Plus, although I may have been somewhat unclear, he is presenting a contradiction where none exists.<br></div></blockquote><br>You've said over9000 is scummy, repeatedly, but you don't believe he's scum? How is this not a contradiction? How can you find someone scummy but not have a read on their alignment? What does it even MEAN to find someone scummy? This is absolutely a contradiction, one of severe fence sitting. Highly scummy.<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>And he was on the _over9000 wagon.</div></blockquote><br>Right. I was voting for a scummy player. THAT sure makes me scum.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>King wrote:</cite>If we arn't lynching Emp because of his mason claim, then In the spirit of actually playing the game well I would like to say that the other people I suspect are Saint and Pie.<br></div></blockquote><br>I still think implosion is a way better lynch than Saint, but I wouldn't oppose it. Whats your reasoning for Pie?<br><br>I'd like to point out to everyone that implosion all the sudden feels like Saint is town. He also claims to never have a read on over9000, despite having called him scummy (apparently in implosion's book, scummy =/= scum aligned?) and behaved so oddly to the wagon.<br><br>Saint is scummy too, but for some reason a wagon never really built on him. That is interesting, though, and makes me further suspicious of him. I'll have to look again at how many people called him scummy without ever having their vote on the slot.<br><br>I still want an implosion lynch, though.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ice wrote:</cite>Alright, I definitely feel like Emp is a bit on the scummy side, but just look how implosion is taking advantage of the town's push against Emp. I'll take an Emp lynch over a no lynch, but I really feel like I've got such a commanding case against implosion that I just don't want to move off of it. Whats more is that a scum lynch on either Saint or implosion gives us so much information on the other, and that is just too sweet for me to pass up.<br><br>I feel like King is probably the most town right now that his slot has ever been, which is pretty much just under neutral.<br><br>The case against Emp is decent, and there are definitely points against Mongoose as well. I still just don't think he's as likely to flip scum as implosion.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Yoshi wrote:</cite>That being said, I do agree with a couple of your other points\u2014especially him not calling out Implosion after the scumlist.<br></div></blockquote><br>Come on man, I had lots of respect for you. Why is it scummy to not call someone out for something that I don't think is particularly scummy? Yeah it is anti-town, but how he oriented his scum list was just so much scummier. MB did the same thing, even worse, but I don't think he can be scum if we get an implosion scum flip, as no scum buddy would follow their partner in a connection like that. This is an even further reason to lynch implosion, in my mind.<br><br>I admit I'm not 100% fully caught up to the game at the moment, I'm still a little bit behind, but I'll be fully caught up on Saturday, before the deadline.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ice wrote:</cite>Alright I still think we need to be lynching implosion. Take a look at him, seriously. Look how much he tries to resist answering my question straight, look at how he keeps beating around the bush, and look at how he drops off the radar the instant pressure is taken off him.<br><br>All of these points are IN ADDITION to the fact that he was calling someone scummy but had \"no read on his alignment\".<br><br>I could possibly be convinced to switch back to Saint, but I genuinely think implosion needs to be today's lynch. I see the recent case again MB, and that would be my 3rd pick. I'm not a huge fan of the case against Nameless, and I'm not a huge fan of the case against King, though neither of them are town reads in my eyes.<br><br>I just feel like town really doesn't need to be lynching Empking today. Tomorrow we can talk about it when we aren't so close to the deadline, have a flip, and have a better chance of really getting down to the bottom of things. If he is indeed a mason, and gets cleared, that puts scum in a really bad spot tomorrow. If he is indeed a mason and we lynch him today, then his mason buddy has no way to really claim safely, and scum could fake claim it to force us in to lylo. If he's scum, he's going to get lynched, plain and simple. There's no rush.<br><br>More implosion votes, please.</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Implosion<br></span>"}

I can see him thinking that, being so sure of implosion as scum, investigating one of these would be more informative.  Based on his D2 posts, though, I don't think he investigated Emp.  He says he's still worried about him, but wants to leave discussion on him aside.  I think there's a slight possibility he investigated Nameless and got a town result.  He says that after a reread, he thinks nameless is town, and he goes along with his reasonings to vote Saint.<br><br>RRgh.  Gotta run, but I'll pick up from here."}

Additionally, implosion shows the same kind of aversion to the saint wagon that zdenek does, so I would not at all be surprised if they were partners.

At this point, I see me managing to fight my way out of the lynch as very improbable. I mean, what an I supposed to say? Mafia killed ICE either because they figured out/knew that he was cop or to make me look like mafia. I can say ICE didn't have a guilty on me, that doesn't mean that other people will believe me... I could respond to the case, but I don't see any way to make a refutation that would actually convince people to lynch someone else. What swift quoted can be interpreted as rolefishing... there's no way I can make people not interpret it that way, even if it wasn't the intention. <br><br>Darth's quote of me in the middle of 729, I don't think that was the main reason I voted ICE, that was just (what I thought was) faulty reasoning I was pointing out. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Setael</span>. I feel right now like this is the vote most likely to be on scum. The way he's pushing on me by saying that ICE had a guilty on me also seems like something that scum could have planned at night (of course, that doesn't bear any weight until/unless I flip town). He also <span style=\"font-style: italic\">completely</span> neglected to make any case on me, instead quoting ICE's, which I've already gone over... he's barely even justified his saying that ICE had a scum result on me. <br><br>I'm also gaining suspicion of Emp. Here's how I see the situation with Emp's mason claim:<br><br>Obviously, we have 2 choices. Either his partner claims, or his partner does not claim. There is a third choice of him claiming his partner for us, but we don't gain anything from that as far as I can tell. There are also 2 possibilities: Emp is either town or scum. And so I put together a nice table here:<br><br><table style=\"border:1px solid black; \"><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">Emp's alignment<br>----------<br>Partner claiming</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">town/real</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">scum/fake</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">claim</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">If one of them dies, we'll have a confirmed townie tomorrow. If one of them is lynched, we'll have a confirmed townie tonight, who would likely die. A connection is established between the two which will help with scumhunting (either both or neither are mafia). The mafia are able to kill a mason tonight, if they want to (assuming no protection).</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">If one of them is lynched, we'd have confirmed mafia tomorrow. If neither is, there's a connection established between the two which will help with scumhunting (either both or neither are mafia).</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">don't claim</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">The partner would claim tomorrow. If the partner is lynched today, without having claimed, people may be unlikely to believe their claim. The partner may die tonight through coincedence, confirming Emp as town for tomorrow. The mafia are able to kill a mason tonight, if they want to (assuming no protection).</td><td style=\"border:1px solid black; padding:3px;\">We lose out on the opportunity to draw a connection between Emp and a scumbuddy of his. We gain absolutely nothing. If we lead a lynch on a mafia member, ANY mafia member other than Empking, they get a free mason claim because we don't know Emp's partner if he's real. The scum get an extra night to decide who/whether to fake.</td></tr></table><br><br>Bear in mind, this is assuming someone actually does claim to be Emp's mason partner. If no one does, we ask him to state his partner, and if they don't confirm him, we instantly lynch him. Clearly, if Empking is mafia, we want someone to claim to be his partner (or force someone to). If he's town, we actually lose very little if anything. Sure, the mafia can avoid Emp's mason partner if they want to and kill them if they want to. On the other hand, we gain valuable, absolute information about two players' alignments relative to each other. We can then examine the claim to see if it looks legitimate, and go from there. <br><br>Therefore, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I'd strongly like Emp's mason partner to claim, and I'd like other peoples' (particularly Emp's) opinion on this. The best way to do it would be a popcorn-style or whoever happens to post first claiming whether or not you are Emp's mason partner.</span> Of course, opinions on the plan are important before executing the plan. Furthermore: Empking. You have stated that it isn't the protown thing to do, having your partner claim. Well why not? Did you examine the pros and cons of it? If so, what is the reason that you don't think they should claim? Zdenek already asked you to elaborate on this, and you basically just shrugged him off. <br><br>By the way, there's no guarantee that the mafia would kill Emp even if he is a mason. It's perfectly likely/possible that they would"}

He also many times responds to attacks with personal insults. Examples: in 332 he claims not explaining your votes is a town tell and in 357 he says that implosion is wrong because he is poor at the game.<br>* Empking hypocritically attacks KTS for continuing the argument, while excusing himself for cementing a read he'd claimed to be certain of before the back and forth even started. KTS fairly points this out as well as a number of other accusations Empking had been ignoring entirely. Empking replies ... by rolling his eyes.<br>* Empking finally makes a case against me, comprising of little more than empty sentiments. I defend myself or ask for further explanation for each point, but Empking only claims that his points were explained and none were refuted. 412 has this lie fully quoted.<br>* Empking lies about KTS, starting with 385.<br>* Empking lies about his role. More on this later.<br>* Empking lies about scum having no reason to claim mason, even after several are given.<br>(Honestly the rest of Empking's D1 is just more of the same insults, bad logic and general unexplained nonsense, so let's skip to D2.)<br>* Empking supports a Saint lynch despite leaning town on him.<br>(That's it. In the week that D2 lasts, that's all Empking does after the pressure is off of him. No scumhunting. No meaningful contributions. Not even \"gut\". He just lurks then votes Saint.)<br>* Empking jumps on the implosion wagon. His only explanation is taken straight from another player and in his own words \"not conclusive\".<br><br>To elaborate on Empking's fakeclaim: First of all, it was clearly prompted by the wagon on him at the time. That he didn't bother to defend himself after claiming should indicate it was an excuse to avoid addressing his case more than a serious attempt to avoid being lynched - he even argues several times that he's likely to be lynched if he isn't NKed, which directly contradicts his claimed plan of drawing the NK. That he couldn't provide breadcrumbs also indicates that he hadn't planned anything. And mason would be a poor choice from drawing the NK anyway; scum wouldn't want to NK him until they'd figured out his nonexistent partner."}

Assuming that didn't happen, Empking could be scum, in which case lynching him would be good, and if he was a mason, then, if we lynched Empking, his buddy would have been confirmed tomorrow provided that there were breadcrumbs and that he wasn't nightkilled. Considering the relationships of other players with Empking, it seemed like the chances of the other mason being nk'ed were pretty much random (at worst 1/4, which isn't too bad).

If they planned to push their third buddy, Implosion early today, I don't think that Empking would have claimed so easily. I think that the only way that plan could have benefitted them is if they managed to get Implosion lynched today, and then for one of them, Setael, to use the town-cred from that lynch to avoid being lynched. I think that Empking flipping scum looks bad for Setael, so they would have preferred to delay his lynch as long as possible. Also, there was a perfectly good case against Implosion that had already been laid out, and I think that if Setael knew that Implosion was scum, he wouldn't have felt the need to push the additional and what I think is a very poor argument against him that ICE must have investigated Implosion and received a guilty result."}

Saying they are scumslips doesn't make them scumslips--I'm wondering if I'm missing something, and the extreme brevity isn't helping.</div></blockquote><br><br>Reminds me of how I play scum, asking question of players about another player to create a tension between those players rather than asking something a little bit more direct of a player have you got any game I could read where you played as town and asked questions in this same way, because at the moment I am a little wary of you because of how much it reminds me of my own scum style.</div></blockquote><br><br>Darth is my biggest scum read right now. His play seems the most careful and deliberate. He's managed to avoid suspicion of himself for the most part and not make too big of waves. I feel like I was his pawn with the mb wagon. He posted the mb posts with a \"anyone noticed this?\" and I jumped on it like a fool.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>darth, p 26 wrote:</cite>Nameless--IIOA = Information Instead of Analysis. Simply offering observations and re-stating facts than actually giving substance and analysis. Often considered a scumtell.<br><br>And yeah--that post from WoMC did seem pretty defensive.</div></blockquote><br>This post is a good example. He answers a question meant for Weapons, trying to appear helpful. He then sheeps nameless' jab at weapons. He then defends/buddies up to ice in post 43. <br><br>The first thing Darth says about Weapons' \"trap\" is this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>darth wrote:</cite>On WoMC--I don't have a ton to add to everyone else's suspicions, except to say that contradictions so early in the game are just as apt to be jumped on by town who have little hard information to go on as they are by scum looking to frame someone, so its effectiveness as a trap seems dubious at best. So I'm not giving much credence to WoMC's defense so far.</div></blockquote><br><br>He doesn't push weapons at all though, and his next post only talks about implosion. If he were town and really didn't like weapons' defense (and wasn't afraid of drawing attention to himself) he'd have followed up with weapons about this instead of just letting it go.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>neko wrote:</cite>vote: implosion for making silly declarations and drawing inane connections on page one. This game is probably moving out of RVS rather quickly but dammit I haven't even posted yet!</div></blockquote><br>A lot of things wrong with this post. First, he tries to make it clear it's a random vote with that second sentence, and yet he gives a reason for voting that is not random. Second, as ice points out right after, the implication is that implosion made multiple declarations and connections when that's not the case. [I see 2 possibilities. 1) neko wanted to distance from his scum buddy implosion with his \"random\" vote. Because it was distancing he felt like he needed a real reason and exaggerated what implosion had actually done, while all the while hiding behind that second sentence which implied it was a random vote. 2) neko is scum trying to cast suspicion on implosion town while avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the sentence implying it's a random vote. I don't see a possibility of this post being made by town.]<br><br>So then in post 40 he gives a \"what he said\" indicating that his post had been sarcastic. Clearly he's referring to the \"but I haven't even posted!\" line, but this doesn't change the fact that he tried to imply his vote was random when he actually gave a serious reason for voting. There's nothing sarcastic about \"he's making silly declarations and drawing inane connections on page one\". That's a real reason meant to either distance or indicate real suspicion.<br><br>Scum vibes from post 47. He unvotes implosion without explaining the weirdness of his original vote and then he asks neil a fluff question about game theory and defends implosion rather than letting implosion do it himself.<br><br><br>My scum read #2 is neko.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>neko wrote:</cite>I highly suspect ICEninja of causing the storm that has shut everything down. If my power goes out, I'm coming after you. (I shouldn't have to, but I better specify that this is a joke). Congrats on getting a job--that's not easy to do right now.<br><br>Seriously now, WMC is gathering quite a few votes rather quickly. I don't like this last post by over9000 so much. I mean, I know the ideas behind a WMC wagon have already been beaten to death, but I just generally dislike a ditto vote that contributes nothing. There's no question to WMC, and there's no attempt to explore any other avenues. WMC is certainly not the only potential scum suspect right now, and there's plenty of daylight left, so this just looks like coasting. <br><br>On the topic, I really do think, as bizarre as it is, that WMC was trying to lay some sort of trap. What else could his \"you missed the point\" post mean? (not a rhetorical question--this is really bothering me). I can't tell whether this is a scummy move or a poorly conceived, town-motivated one. I'm just as interested as Implosion to see an instance of this being at all effective. <br><br>Mongoose's 64 is rather terrible, and I agree with Implosion's assessment. What is really interesting about Mongoose's post is that he was rattled enough by this distancing accusation that he bothered to make a second joke vote to rectify the situation (which really shouldn't be perceived as a \"situation\" in the first place). Nervous scum?</div></blockquote><br><br>This post is highly suspect. He's the first to say he thinks weapons really was laying a trap and the way he words this really looks like bailing out a scum buddy. The line \"What else could his \"you missed the point\" post mean?\" is also really fishy because it makes no sense to attribute that line to part of a trap. If there was a point we were supposed to get, then it wasn't a trap. neko and swiftstrike could definitely be scum buddies.<br><br>Then there's this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>zed, p 38 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Silavor</span><br>Nameless already pointed out the reason.

What is it exactly you want to know? <br><br>To your most recent question, if Yoshi and Set are both town (which I am finding increasingly likely), I would like to see a three person scumteam try and pull off a quicklynch.  In my last game, I was part of a two person scumteam with daytalk, and even then it wasn't so easy to coordinate a quicklynch.  If we're in lylo, there is a three person scumteam and most likely with no daytalk, or that would be terribly imbalanced, which means they have to coordinate somehow in-game.

I say this not only because I don't see much in it myself, but also because nobody else really seems to see much in it, and on top of that, swift doesn't seem to be too convinced of it himself.  He later admits that he didn't push the case too much, which is an understatement.  He didn't push it at all.  During this time, while the wagon on Saint built up, he made one comment on Saint:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Swiftstrike wrote:</cite>...<br>Why is it better to lynch more active scum than an inactive one, surely a more active scum is more likely to slip that an inactive one? At the moment Saint your jumping wagons to start a counter wagon on anyone has me wondering if I have read this Zdenek thing right and whether you should be today's lynch.</div></blockquote>  I don't know how I missed his aversion to the Saint wagon as well.  It's rather striking.  He also makes his post about suspecting Yoshi because of his playstyle.  Yet, he keeps his vote on zdenek until the end of the day.<br><br>It is possible, of course, that he picked out zed somewhat randomly, but based on their interactions, I'd guess a scum pairing.  Now, to test this with my earlier speculation of swift-implosion and zed-implosion, it should be noted that implosion has listed two town reads, neither of which are these two.  <br><br>I want to reiterate something: the interaction between zed and implosion is very soft.  To illustrate:<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Implosion wrote:</cite>KTS is my biggest townread, <br></div></blockquote><br>Really? Please explain this.</div></blockquote><br><br>I thought he looked like town when he was arguing with Empking. He had logic and didn't look like mafia.</div></blockquote>from today, and from yesterday:<br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>While I am not a big fan of the case on Implosion based on ICE's posts, but after skimming his ISO, I can see that there is a reasonable case that can be made on him. In particular, I would like to point out that in his more recent post, he comments that he doesn't have any scum reads. This can be a scum-tell because of the difficulty that scum can have faking scum hunting. Because of this, I am not too unhappy with the fact that he claimed. I'm pretty doubtful that there will be any other pro-town roles in a game with masons (assuming Empking is telling the truth) and a cop, and anyone could figure that out, so the VT claim was expected.</div></blockquote><br>I claimed because I'm (or was) at L-1. I don't see how having \"difficulty faking scumhunting\" would lead me to say I have no fosses if I were in reality scum; the job of mafia is to avoid looking like mafia. Doing something as blatantly scummy as saying I have no fosses isn't something scum would probably do. Now, obviously, you can respond to this by saying it's WIFOM. Then again, so is everything in mafia. <br></div></blockquote><br>Also, without having to quote the whole thing, in implosion's VCA, he mentions early on that he doesn't like zed's voting pattern because he has a \"useless vote\" for awhile before jumping on a townie wagon.  He never mentions that useless vote again, even though that's pretty much been the case the entire game.<br><br>I'm not entirely convinced of this entire combination yet, but I feel pretty confident there is a pairing here somewhere."}

Even though I'm still leaning towards scum for her, my most confident scumread may well remain to be Implosion.  But Neko's arguments about a Swift-Z connection are something I'm going to need to go re-read and look at as well.

Second, I think trying to read into potential NK motives is an inaccurate art; but if I had to venture a guess, two of my scumreads (Saint and Emp) both flipped town, so scum may not view me as much of a threat.  I'll concede that this is making me re-evaluate my ScumImp read, but I think that is getting very close to WIFOM territory.

I'm a bit irked that he (claims to have) tried to shoot me last night, which (if he's real) means that the scum would probably have won the game if they didn't roleblock him. His reasons for not shooting the first couple nights also make sense. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Darth wrote:</cite>Swift can come up with the convenient excuse of being roleblocked now that he knows, with a doc and cop having flipped, that there is almost certainly a scum roleblocker in the setup.</div></blockquote><br>This phrasing looks scummy.

Assuming 3 mafia, the town has the entire game 100% riding on today's lynch. All the mafia has riding on today's lynch is a possibility of instantly winning the game, or a possibility of having two more chances of instantly winning the game. The \"breaking the game open\" thing frankly looks like grasping at straws to counter what I'm saying, when what I'm saying is clearly right... <br><br>So, my reads are changing.

Just like you said, the statement only made sense if I thought Darth was town, which was not the case (though of course there's always a chance he's town, I just don't think so).

If Saint hadn\u2019t self-hammered and Emp hadn\u2019t fake-claimed while actually being a different PR, I doubt this would have been a perfect scum win."}

Seriously\u2014aside from the Emp/KTS noise on D1, I never got irritated or upset with anyone in this game, so pretending to be helpful to all of you was pretty easy.  Not saying y\u2019all should be jerks\u2014I like playing mafia with nice peoples when I\u2019m town too\u2014but it was nice."}

The only minor criticism I might offer is that when WoMC replaced out, I would personally have not replaced him right before D1 ended--he had one more day on his prod, at which point the game would have been in Night, and just replaced him overnight and given his replacement the three days of Night to catch up.  That may just be me, I don't know what other folks might do in that circumstance?"}

Of course scum love my play because I'm an easy mislynch!). One thing I'd actually love to have answered - in the QT a few different dead townies thought I was scum (and KTS obviously). I know why KTS did - he had good reason as that first post where I voted Darth I didn't word carefully and hadn't had time to read enough of the thread before making a case. But why did the rest of you think I was scum? I'm finding lately that a lot of people find my play scummy when I'm town so I'd love advice on how to fix that (or at least lessen that.)"}

After getting an innocent on Implosion (which I wasn't expecting, but whatever) I would have asked both masons to claim, cleared Emp thus clearing both masons beyond much doubt.
