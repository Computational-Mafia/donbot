The sun rose, the birds sang, the rooster cock-a-doodle-doo\u2019d\u2026 Oh no, wait. That was just DeasVail. Let\u2019s just move on, shall we?<br><br>Anyway, as usual, Fat_Tony rushed off to the markets to discuss the latest fashion trends, Senjai could be spotted chasing after his two young boys across town, and Slandaar remained unseen. Many in the village had never laid eyes on him, but it was assumed that he was the source of the screeching violin sound from within the most run-down house in town, hidden behind several layers of vegetation. The one thing that the villagers could always rely upon, however, was DeasVail being a complete and utter nuisance. He would throw glitter all over Fat_Tony\u2019s clothes, initiate spontaneous, village-wide hide-and-seek games with Senjai\u2019s boys and would prance around Normalville with his recorder, accompanying the overwhelmingly pleasant sound produced by Slandaar\u2019s violin. Yes, it was just another day in Normalville. <br><br>The next day, the sun rose, the birds sang, and the villagers got on with their business as usual. Well, more pleasant than usual, but no one seemed to notice until Benmage paused his rambling and cried out.<br>\u201cWhere is DeasVail?\u201d<br>No one paid him any attention at first, but eventually a low murmur seeped through Normalville as news of DeasVail\u2019s disappearance spread. The villagers started searching for him and it wasn\u2019t long before PeregrineV stumbled into the farmhouse and found his body. Well, what was left of it anyway.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DeasVail, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>, brutally murdered Night 0.</span><br><br>Each of the villagers displayed the same reaction to the sight, except for one. Choice casually strolled into the farmhouse, and with a giant grin on his face, said, \u201cWell this is just absolutely fantastic! We'll finally be able to sleep in!\u201d<br>Fat_Tony imagined how much nicer his clothes would look, Senjai thought of how much better his boys would behave and Slandaar, who watched the commotion from afar, revelled in the idea of being able to torture the village all by himself. Yes, beneath their masks of shock and horror, the villagers agreed that Normalville had just become a much nicer place to live.<br><br>Or hadn't it?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Playerlist:</span></span></span><br><br>1.

Simple stuff like vote count errors can be mentioned in-thread. <br>-Any time you want my attention in-thread, please use bold.<br>-Action will be taken on rule infractions, whether it be a warning, force replacement or modkill.<br>-I may change the rules at any point in the game, although you will be notified.<br>-Flavour is for the purpose of entertainment only and will not be any indication of role or alignment.<br><br>General:<br><br>1) Have fun! And allow others to have fun too. Excessive insults or personal attacks will result in a warning or force-replacement. <br>2) There must be no talking about the game outside this thread, unless using a method allowed by your Role PM.<br>3) No editing of posts. Ever. <br>4) No quoting of any PMs or QTs relating to the game.<br>5) <span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">This</span></span></span> is my colour. Don\u2019t use it.<br>6) Do not discuss ongoing games.<br>7) Hydras are allowed, but no more than two heads, and they must be PM\u2019d to me.<br>8) Once you are dead, there is to be no posting, except for a \u201cGah!\u201d post with no game-related content.<br><br>Gameplay:<br><br>8) Votes must be bolded or in vote tag format to count. I will not count any that are not. Example: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: DeasVail </span>Abbreviations can also be used as long as it\u2019s clear who you\u2019re voting for. Example: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: DV</span><br>9) Unvoting when changing a vote is helpful, but not required.

A lynch always requires a majority of votes.<br>12) Once a majority is reached, it becomes twilight until I can post the lynch.

Feel free to ask for them, but I will only grant one if it\u2019s deserved.<br>18) Nights will generally last 48 hours.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Vanilla Townie Role PM</span></span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome DeasVail!

You talk about town needing to be aggressive, but being open-minded is pretty helpful, too, because unless you are a power role, you're not working with facts.

I agree with PV that his 'guesswork' is most indicative that one of them is scum and the other two are town. Eliminating the one scum if it exists would provide two close to conf town members fairly early in the game. Benmage comes off scummy in the beginning after magically determining Chaos is scum in pregame without providing any real reason why. Probably what took us out of RVS and yes I missed it for reasons above. He then goes on to state he determined such via PoE after PV came off being genuine in his QT. PV Confirmed this when he came in.<br><br>If PV had not came in and said what has been said I would have FoS'd ben over chaos. Chaos crossvote is expected given that Ben claimed he was scum without any real evidence so far. It is a reactionary post and I'd have done no different. I slightly think ben is scummier than Chaos - but PV's reasoning is sound. It would be suicide for scum-ben to push on town-chaos. And given that it is FAR more likely that one of the neighbors are scum having two go after one increases the chance of finding scum. If Chaos flips town well - then ben might be in some trouble. If ben flips town then PV is in trouble. If PV flips town then we have come to the 10% scenario where we were all wrong. Still odds favor us.<br><br>For the sake of progressing town I'll <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Chaos</span> Though be sure Ben if he flips town your his biggest advocate and my vote will be on your Day 2.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4003745#p4003745\" class=\"postlink\">post 53</a>, Timeater wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote<br>vote: senjai</span><br><br>senjai sure is active in other games</div></blockquote><br><br>Several points:<br><br>1) Yes, I am active in several games on this forum and two on teamliquid.net <br>2) Talking about ongoing games and using them as excuses to vote is illmannered (and I think its a rule), don't do this again.

Lynching one will identify the other. This answers DLG's question: Even though I think ben was scummier in that discussion - Im voting Chaos to progress town. His neighbors have a separate QT and may be privy to information we dont have. Chaos says PV is town and so does Ben, so the fact that PV and Ben vote chaos leads me to trust that judgement for now. Should he flip the scum is likely Ben. Thats why lynching Ben OR Chaos will most likely result in a scum lynch D2 if not D1.<br><br>Also Time by being agressive like you are you avoid getting questioned yourself as everyone is so focused on defending your rash and unsubstantiated arguments.

If you hit a townie, then you don't have to be entirely at fault.<br><br>So, here's what I'm getting in general, correct me if I'm wrong:<br><br>You believe one of Benmage and I are scum. You believe Benmage to be scummier than me. You're voting for me over Benmage because I have more people voting for me, and also there is someone on my wagon who you believe to be pro-town.<br><br>If that's all true, then I have to think you either think so low of your scumhunting abilities that you feel you would be most helpful to the town just by following the biggest group, or you're scum getting in on a mislynch trying not to be suspicious."}

Apologies for arriving so late to the party. An <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span> is in order. <br><br>First order of business is all this neighborizer nonsense. I think the speculation is actually pretty useless. There is generally at least one scum in the group, and a group with two out of three scum is rare. But its silly to throw out any possibility in favor of another merely based on statistics. Any mod can have any setup at any time. So to be honest I don't think its worth commenting on how many scum there may be in the group. I'm just gonna scrutinize ALL of their posts. Call me an equal opportunity scum hunter. That being said, the dichotomy between Chaos and BM is not necessarily a bad one, as it should force people to take sides early. I just don't like basing our lynches off of information we don't actually have. <br><br>As an aside, I kind of hate neighbors from a theoretical standpoint. Its a damn stupid role. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">On Chaos vs BM</span> - The discussion between Chaos and BM is hard to read without knowing the exact details of how Peregrin was trying to \"break the game\". Could someone please clarify this point? As I understand it, he was trying compare role PMs. But this can't be the sole justification for holding him town, can it? As I said I don't know the exact details, but couldn't this just as easily be interpreted as role fishing? Knowing the differences between a scum-neighbor PM and a town neighbor-PM seems like it would be incredibly useful to a mafiaso. I don't think its wise to assume he's town for trying to get information about your role. <br>Also, the exaggeration in post 21 (the \"push that we were all town\" comment) doesn't read town to me. I don't see a \"push\" from Omega but an attempt to recognize all opportunities. Combined with the fact that Chaos is actually actively scum hunting, I'm inclined to say BM is the scummier of the two. In fact, BM hasn't actually been saying all that much besides \"ZOMG Chaos is scum based on PoE that only works from my standpoint, woooooo!\".<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">On Senjai wagon</span> - I really don't think this case in any good. The first point about activity is pretty wack. I lurk as town, especially if I don't think I'll be able to post something worthwhile until I have more time to think about what to say. Perhaps in my other games I'm more into the game and don't need to do a lot of thinking to post coherently and effectively, while this game contains a lot fo new information which has to be digested and processed. Just a hypothetical that often applies to my own game-to-game lurking. Its a poor argument and one that I think should be disallowed, but that's neither here nor there. I don't consider \"being defensive\" a scumtell, nor do I think that Senjai is guilty of being overly defensive. There are things I don't like in Senjai's play. He seems damn sure there's only one scum in the neighbors, and I'm not sure why. Not to mention 65, in which he implies willingness to lynch chaos because 2/3 neighbors are voting him, and at the same time implies that BM's vote on chaos was scummy. That doesn't add up. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ BB</span> - When you say \"sounds legit\" in post 31, are you being serious or sarcastic? Also, what exactly made you think BM vs Chaos was town v town when you posted as such? What do you think of the PoE argument proposed by BM?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ Timeater</span> - Are you aware that your attempts to \"know BM better as a player\" on page 2 seem a lot like you're trying to create a distraction of some sort? Why did you choose to ask your question over a series of posts, and not as an aside appended to some other post? A second point of note, what happened between post 47 and post 49 that made you change from healthy curiosity towards one aspect of the neighbor situation to \"not liking the dichotomy\"? I don't see how the chaos post in between could possibly have caused that 180. As an aside, fuck you for making me go all the way back to my room from the library to grab headphones just to listen to you preach a shitty case in an arrogant and self-assured tone. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Asher</span> - You're lying pretty damn low. Who's scum? <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Choice</span> - Why are you so sure that scum ONLY self-vote to start the game? Because I'm pretty damn sure I've self-voted as town. The fact that this is the strongest point you can find over five pages, and the fact that you have talked more about FF7 then THIS game, tells me you're reluctant to comment on the meat of the game.

His neighbors have a separate QT and may be privy to information we dont have. Chaos says PV is town and so does Ben, so the fact that PV and Ben vote chaos leads me to trust that judgement for now. Should he flip the scum is likely Ben. Thats why lynching Ben OR Chaos will most likely result in a scum lynch D2 if not D1.<br><br>Also Time by being agressive like you are you avoid getting questioned yourself as everyone is so focused on defending your rash and unsubstantiated arguments.

I don't see anything wrong with Ben going for the throat -- especially since it threw the mostly useless RVS portion of the game out the window.  Also, you're ignoring the possibility that PV is the scum and tried his best to set Ben and Chaos against each other.  It's a crazy, game breaking play, but PV would be immunized by the neighbor's inability to quote what went down in the QT.  We'd have to rely on word of mouth.  It creates confusion, and draws the town into hunting neighbors instead of hunting scum for a few days while townies get NK'd.  <br><br>Just because something does not seem to be likely does not mean it cannot be the case (how many negatives was that? three?).<br><br>To be honest I don't have a great read on any of the three though at the moment.

The simple reply should have been \"Explain why are you voting for me.\" But you jumped to the kind of play that you got mad at DLG for because it was the basis of his vote.  You also do not press DLG.  Keep in mind that one of the votes against you is from yourself.  <br><br>So what do we have here? People accuse you of saying you're fence sitting, you give a simple denial.  People turn votes to you and you throw your hands up.  Are you trying to lay low and keep from being a potential lynch candidate by not allowing yourself to be drawn an argument with your accusers? I don't like that.

It seems odd that you're concerned the neighborizer discussion might detract from healthy scumhunting (see quoted post above), and yet you think an incredibly distracting audio post with a case that you know full well is shit will help us out. This is hypocritical and decidedly anti-town.

It's not part of the game. Leaning scum now.<br><br>109 is hilarious because I heard somewhere that Choice was in fact MB trying to avoid a GD post restriction. I could be wrong about this though.<br><br>Woah. Elias reads like chaos' buddy with his big post(125). He acknowledges that the percentage of one scum is greater but does away with this by saying a mod can have any setup at any time, but that's kinda like saying somebody breaking into your house only wanted to get out of the rain. Sure it's possible but really you aren't going to just let him go because that possibility EXISTS. Damn, too many people in this game are scummy.<br><br>As of 125 I'm thinking Chaos-Elias- Senjai in that order, with Time and BB as the dark horse team.<br><br>Moving on.<br><br>Ah there we go, somebody confirms MB is in fact Choice. Also, Slandaar do I really have to lynch you again. You literally call people scum randomly. If it's not that it's whatever we got annoyed at you for in our last game.

Anyway, null on Slandaar, although my annoyed meter is slightly rising (as it does after that modkill letter in NY 142 XD)<br><br>Benmage disappeared for a bit there. Was that a V/LA?

I just don't get that feel from him.<br><br>I didn't read Code_X because I now have a headache but his vote is good so I'll let him slide by for now. Last page time.<br><br>Okay, DLG seriously needs to be reread. I've played one game with him and he was not making sense. He was scum, and the not making sense comment isn't an insult because the sensible thing to do would have been to lynch him regardless of alignment to cement town's win, so he had to be nonsensical to play to his wincon. <br><br>Looking at the logic ( A - Ben, B - chaos, C- PV):<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">A sees B - scum and C - town.</span> Yeah Ben thinks chaos is scum and PV is almost conftown for breaking the game. check.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">B sees A - scum and C - town.</span> Judging from chaos' vote on Ben and him not giving percentages to two scum this is also correct.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">C sees A or B scum.</span> PV wrote this down so I'm sure he knows what he sees.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DLG thinks C is scum.</span> Yup I believe your post said that.<br>I believe PV was right. So what did you say was wrong with it? I believe you could be chaos' buddy.<br><br>Tl;dr That leaves me with chaos-Elias-senjai/dlg. Or Timeater-BB-?. But the second is highly unlikely.

My problem with your post here is that you use \"should\" when I say \"hope\". Those don't really mean the same thing. Did you alter that on purpose to make your case sound better?

Obviously I know his opinions of Senjai being a perfect first lynch are misplaced, but he seems adamant to find an appropriate first day lynching, and contribute to town. Personally I think Senjai's constant attacking (and I can see why him and Omega were at loggerheads) made him look quite scummy, but knowing that I'm not scum, I can look back on his postings and realise he was just playing an uber dumb aggro town tactic, and took things waaay too personally.<br><br>I'm not going into too much detail about PV, because mostly it's just a hunch; calm people that don't act seedy but contribute often and try and re-direct conversation towards 'is this a rational basis for voting him/her as scum', are often always town.

Exactly why I am not voting for Omega, because while yes, he APPEARS scummy, it might be a similar situation to Senjai's."}

News to me. And it seems from your posts that you believe calm is more likely town and aggressive is more likely scum. Why is that?</div></blockquote><br><br>In reference to BK, all I meant was his actions seemed like he knew who town was, as with no need to research, quickly voted for one of the top dogs on the vote list just to get a quick town lynching. I'm not saying that IS what he did, it just seemed kind of odd to me as it's not something I would do. I never said either that I was convinced you were scum, otherwise, with the deadline and amount of votes on us both, I would definitely be chucking one on you. You are obviously one of the main people I need to consider for a first day lynching as you have people in a stir, but yeah, I have a suspicion you are town; it's pretty 50/50 atm, and I don't if it's that I am reading you wrong, or my instincts are just biased to aggro towns. <br><br>Yeah, I don't exactly EXPECT aggro players to be scum, but if players are calm, actively contribute and make sound judgements about who is town and who is not, I trust them more. I do value aggro towns because they can get a lot of shit done, and make weak players crack, but they also make dangerous mafia and sometimes make very rash decisions based on stupid logic.<br><br>Unfortunately I can't hold off on voting for too long. I want to see what more of what BK does as I would say he is my main suspect right now, but it wouldn't really be helpful if he plays his cards right. If no one else votes for him, I'm not helping out with the lynchings. So I am going to be studying you, vijay and peregrine the hardest (which is why i mentioned him, being in the top four for scum and all) much more hardly than the rest. Even if BK is scum, there's not much I can do about it at this moment in time. Vijay seems pretty shady too, so might be a good first day lynch, but even saying that as a replacement and having not read many of his postings, I am probably jumping ahead of myself. Yes, I need to be proactive and catch up, I know <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}

There is absolutely NO reason to bring percentages into the argument at this point, the argument is simply that BM pushing scum Chaos is unlikely. Yet over 59 and 61 you demand these percentages, \"if he had to \"guess\", and then in 64 pounce on him because the percentages don't really make sense. Well no shit, you asked him to guess, and the numbers are meaningless.

If he were crusading against his number one when the main wagon was on his second, he would be accused of starting a competing wagon, or being buddies with the player with the largest wagon for not supporting his lynch.

I totally disagree with his scumhunting technqiues and overzealous nature, and having to pick up also when so close to lynch date was a hard task indeed. I am still not convinced as to who is scum but obviously I need to start voting. I feel as though I have been a prime target of bandwagoning, though.<br><br>BK's arguments about picking from the 'neighbourhood' is much of a moot point, I think, but nevertheless made me suspect that he might be town. But apart from that, he screams scum to me. Admitting to his 'scumdom' would usually mean nothing to me, but in light of his ineptitude in studying the game and carefree nature to not only lynch quickly but his insistence on a dead 'neighbour argument' (I am assuming he refers to the so called Chaos/benmage association) is troubling. This goes against my better judgement; I feel I should be bandwagoning at this time to try and save myself. But ultimately I am hoping for a town victory, whether I am in the game or not, because I don't think I will be present much longer so I may as well stick to my convictions, hoping that in future rounds, people will watch his actions more closely and hopefully either prove me wrong, or give him the lynch he deserves.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: BK </span>"}

Time is not a luxury we have.  We need a lynch.

But he's right in admitting that he is a quote \"lurker\". That definitely has me worried. I'm just not feeling it though mate. We are rushing a quick lynch on someone who seems not all that scummy really, and you haven't given any reasons why you think he is scummy? I understand we need a lynch soon, but Quagmire doesn't seem that scummy to me. If you want to speed this up and you really think Quagmire is scummy, you should be putting together a bulletproof case against him.<br><br>Please tell me what you think of BK, no one seems to be addressing the points I am making about him.<br><br>Also, you say you have been on Chaos since page 1, so what are you suggesting? That he has convinced you he is not scum? What is your opinion on him?"}

Quag listed a few people as scum, primarily DLG, then never said why and popped out of existence once the bandwagons started rolling. He's been coasting all this time. Elias has been a lot more helpful, DLG seems a bit shady but at least he's been involved in voting and scumhunting, and Chaos hasn't really done anything scummy lately.

Even IF the neighbour argument has any credence to it, i feel at this point neither PV, Chaos or ben stand out any scummier than one another, though maybe I would say Chaos in the very SLIGHTEST. So basically its a stab in the dark, with a 1/3 chance of a 'supposed' 80% chance. Not good odds really. <br><br>And even with all this in mind, PV and Chaos might have little wagons at the moment, but most people are more convinced of Quag as scum than they are PV and Chaos. I think if we go down the neighbour road at this point, we are going to regret. Sure it was something potentially good to discuss eight days ago, but not now."}

To be honest your quick flip to trusting vijay worries me; either he is lying and you are potentially both scum, or he is telling the truth about you being town and this gives you incentive to trust him. I can't work out which is the case, so for me the 'let's lynch PV quick' seems like it could be a distraction tactic. Not sure also if something he said to you in the QT affected your view on his potential alignment.<br><br>I feel somewhat willing to lynch either PV or vijay, but at the same time hesitant towards both. If vijay is a cop, we lose a valuable asset to town considering we have already lost one, and I think we would be fucked from there in. However, while PV has been coming off scummy, he seems to be getting a lot of flak from potential scummies (vijay and chaos) which is worrying, and hard to determine what's really going on."}

Your question seems a silly one. Obviously you should read D1 and D2, extensively. I have no problem with requesting summaries and drawing information off these (they should, however, always endeavour to refer to sample posts indicative of the argument) but how do you honestly believe you can get an accurate reading on the game, and who is scum and who is not, if you only go by limited information?<br>1. There is obviously a large number of scum left in the game, and they will try to mislead you.<br>2. There may be more information that can be garnered from reading D1 and D2 that could be very important, and someone may forget to address it, or no one has noticed it and you might. <br>3. A replacement is mostly at a disadvantage and must work hard to try and catch up with the happenings of the game, but they have the added advantage of a lack of bias, usually caused by growing OMGUS sentiments. <br><br>To be honest even asking this question seems kind of scummy, as town will usually be eager to figure out what is going on as minutely as possible, whereas scum just want a general idea and skim so they don't trip up on anything. <br><br>My sentiments are that Day 2 was rushed, and I consider myself as partly to blame for that. Study is CRITICAL at this point if we want to flip this game in favour of a town win. As such I want to provide an in-depth analysis (not only for you, but for everyone), but for now I will only provide a small one, as I need to go back and re-evaluate my reads. Here goes: <br><br>1. My main scumread was initially on BK, as he seemed adamant to lynch the neighbourhood, and I could see that becoming a disastrous move. If the neighbourhood contains only one scummy (which is what everyone was saying is likely), or even none, then two-three mislynches plus two-three night phases would be enough to secure a victory for scum quite easily, and I was worried this was his scumplan. When he was willing to lynch Quag my opinion of him changed, and I saw that he was more flexible with his opinion on the neighbour argument. Seeing Quag flipped town rang alarm bells for me, but I was more focused on vijay and PV, who had come across very scummy late D1/early D2, and BK's posts early D2 came across as townie.<br>2. Vijay seemed somewhat scummy throughout D1 and came close to being lynched, but then claimed cop and everyone backed off. I didn't buy it, but it did make me hesitant to lynch. At this stage I am not sure how much a potential cop could serve town, and I was happy for a vijay lynch D2, but the argument against PV was more compelling, and I am eager to see who vijay 'supposedly' investigated last night. The vijay case became stronger D2 considering Code flipped cop, but discussion revealed that it was still possible vijay could be a cop.<br>3. Chaos came across as scummy through D1, but my opinion of him changed late D1/early D2, and vijay's 'investigation' of him and claim that he was town had me confused, and I didn't know what to read of it. I was fully convinced by the end of D2 that ben and chaos were right about PV, and that vijay was possibly telling the truth about chaos, but PV's flip has me wondering why ben pushed it so hard. Chaos didn't exactly push hard for a PV lynch, but was adamant that he was certain PV was scum, so unravelling all this neighbour bullshit is imperative on figuring out the potential scuminess of Chaos/ben/vijay (who I put in there for his cop claim on Chaos).<br>4. Ben came across as eager town to me most of the game, but in light of the fact that he has adamantly pushed for two town lynches now has me questioning this. Either he simply fucked up, like a lot of us have, or he is scum. I just couldn't see scum being that forward with their lynches/votes, but maybe it is just a clever WIFOM. <br><br>Obviously this is not everything, but a general overview from my angle. I will be sorting through D1 and D2 sometime tonight/tommorrow, in the meantime you need to get reading also."}

Apologies for arriving so late to the party. An <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span> is in order. <br><br>First order of business is all this neighborizer nonsense. I think the speculation is actually pretty useless. There is generally at least one scum in the group, and a group with two out of three scum is rare. But its silly to throw out any possibility in favor of another merely based on statistics. Any mod can have any setup at any time. So to be honest I don't think its worth commenting on how many scum there may be in the group. I'm just gonna scrutinize ALL of their posts. Call me an equal opportunity scum hunter. That being said, the dichotomy between Chaos and BM is not necessarily a bad one, as it should force people to take sides early. I just don't like basing our lynches off of information we don't actually have. <br><br>As an aside, I kind of hate neighbors from a theoretical standpoint. Its a damn stupid role. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">On Chaos vs BM</span> - The discussion between Chaos and BM is hard to read without knowing the exact details of how Peregrin was trying to \"break the game\". Could someone please clarify this point? As I understand it, he was trying compare role PMs. But this can't be the sole justification for holding him town, can it? As I said I don't know the exact details, but couldn't this just as easily be interpreted as role fishing? Knowing the differences between a scum-neighbor PM and a town neighbor-PM seems like it would be incredibly useful to a mafiaso. I don't think its wise to assume he's town for trying to get information about your role. <br>Also, the exaggeration in post 21 (the \"push that we were all town\" comment) doesn't read town to me. I don't see a \"push\" from Omega but an attempt to recognize all opportunities. Combined with the fact that Chaos is actually actively scum hunting, I'm inclined to say BM is the scummier of the two. In fact, BM hasn't actually been saying all that much besides \"ZOMG Chaos is scum based on PoE that only works from my standpoint, woooooo!\".<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">On Senjai wagon</span> - I really don't think this case in any good. The first point about activity is pretty wack. I lurk as town, especially if I don't think I'll be able to post something worthwhile until I have more time to think about what to say. Perhaps in my other games I'm more into the game and don't need to do a lot of thinking to post coherently and effectively, while this game contains a lot fo new information which has to be digested and processed. Just a hypothetical that often applies to my own game-to-game lurking. Its a poor argument and one that I think should be disallowed, but that's neither here nor there. I don't consider \"being defensive\" a scumtell, nor do I think that Senjai is guilty of being overly defensive. There are things I don't like in Senjai's play. He seems damn sure there's only one scum in the neighbors, and I'm not sure why. Not to mention 65, in which he implies willingness to lynch chaos because 2/3 neighbors are voting him, and at the same time implies that BM's vote on chaos was scummy. That doesn't add up. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ BB</span> - When you say \"sounds legit\" in post 31, are you being serious or sarcastic? Also, what exactly made you think BM vs Chaos was town v town when you posted as such? What do you think of the PoE argument proposed by BM?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ Timeater</span> - Are you aware that your attempts to \"know BM better as a player\" on page 2 seem a lot like you're trying to create a distraction of some sort? Why did you choose to ask your question over a series of posts, and not as an aside appended to some other post? A second point of note, what happened between post 47 and post 49 that made you change from healthy curiosity towards one aspect of the neighbor situation to \"not liking the dichotomy\"? I don't see how the chaos post in between could possibly have caused that 180. As an aside, fuck you for making me go all the way back to my room from the library to grab headphones just to listen to you preach a shitty case in an arrogant and self-assured tone. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Asher</span> - You're lying pretty damn low. Who's scum? <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Choice</span> - Why are you so sure that scum ONLY self-vote to start the game? Because I'm pretty damn sure I've self-voted as town. The fact that this is the strongest point you can find over five pages, and the fact that you have talked more about FF7 then THIS game, tells me you're reluctant to comment on the meat of the game.

Though not sure why Elias hasn't been vocally suspicious of Chaos, since he tagged them both as scum earlier, yet now he is riding only vijay.<br><br>@Om: I never said my play was crap, but that I don't know roles or mechanics in detail. I wasn't pulling a newbie card, I was being honest. If you look back through my posts and actually read D1 and D2 properly, you'll see that I have more experience with mafia than I do ONLINE mafia, hence, I can play at a semi-proficient level, but am unfamiliar with online roles and game mechanics. MSN played mafia could be considered online but it was regulated by uni students and played by uni students, that only ever used roles such as cop, doc, vig, SK. And there was no structure, formula or theory, it was just whatever the the regulator felt like doing - it was more bullshit to do when we were drunk and bored, rather than speculate on fairness and accuracy.<br><br>Check my meta and see if I am making this up, it's not hard to do."}

Trouble is neighbors of 3 almost always have 1 scum, 1-shot cop + 1 cop in a mini is improbable.<br><br> Unaware of if there is a doc or not, and whether or not the doc believes vjay, you think mafia would target the claimed cop so he doesn't confirm people upon his eventual WIFOM lynch. However, mafia's not going to kill vjay, he's one of their own.<br><br>Om, tech lynch isn't happening today.</div></blockquote><br><br>It's possible that the mafia is keeping vijay alive because they think he is lynchable though. He has nearly been lynched every day so far, and the sentiment at the end of yesterday was 'vijay is gonna get lynched tommorrow, no matter what.' Obviously mafia don't want to waste a kill on him if he is lynch target number one. <br><br>That being said, I am definitely more inclined to believe that vijay is surviving because he is lying scum, and your argument is more likely. It is possible, however slim, that vijay could be telling the truth, and if we lynch him, we are pretty much fucked. <br><br>I'm willing to take the risk, but using the time we have to scumhunt is imperative right now. Even if we don't close the case on vijay, or even find a scummier alternative, we need to use this time to draw possible conclusions on other scum, and be as persistent as possible in riding everyone."}

It's not simply that Vijay called him out as town, but he became somewhat more lurkerish on D3, posted less, and his posts had less content.

Why is that?</div></blockquote><br><br>In reference to BK, all I meant was his actions seemed like he knew who town was, as with no need to research, quickly voted for one of the top dogs on the vote list just to get a quick town lynching. I'm not saying that IS what he did, it just seemed kind of odd to me as it's not something I would do. I never said either that I was convinced you were scum, otherwise, with the deadline and amount of votes on us both, I would definitely be chucking one on you. You are obviously one of the main people I need to consider for a first day lynching as you have people in a stir, but yeah, I have a suspicion you are town; it's pretty 50/50 atm, and I don't if it's that I am reading you wrong, or my instincts are just biased to aggro towns. <br><br>Yeah, I don't exactly EXPECT aggro players to be scum, but if players are calm, actively contribute and make sound judgements about who is town and who is not, I trust them more. I do value aggro towns because they can get a lot of shit done, and make weak players crack, but they also make dangerous mafia and sometimes make very rash decisions based on stupid logic.<br><br>Unfortunately I can't hold off on voting for too long. I want to see what more of what BK does as I would say he is my main suspect right now, but it wouldn't really be helpful if he plays his cards right. If no one else votes for him, I'm not helping out with the lynchings. So I am going to be studying you, vijay and peregrine the hardest (which is why i mentioned him, being in the top four for scum and all) much more hardly than the rest. Even if BK is scum, there's not much I can do about it at this moment in time.

You failed to mention the climate of the posts; we were very close to a mislynch and someone had to be lynched, and vijay's wagon was gaining momentum.

D1 is always tricky when trying to find an appropriate lynch.<br><br>Vijay's claim as cop didn't change my opinion of him at all, I already said this. I was SOMEWHAT hesitant to lynch him after his cop claim, but it just added to the scummy vibe I was getting from him and I was inclined not to believe him. Then the Quag wagon gained momentum, and I was willing to go with that.

Anyway, any rationale as to why the existence of a neighborhood reduces the chance of a cop? I don't see the relation between the two at all. So, because you doubt there's a \"real\" cop (what do you mean by real cop? I thought sanity was always confirmed in normals now), does that mean you believe vijay is lying?<br><br>Anyways, I reread PeregrineV, I don't see much scumhunting at all in his posts, other than him trying to figure out who if any of the neighbors are scum.

When I asked him about this he said it had something to do with what PV posted in the QT, and although Benmage said he hadn't posted in the QT, he seemed to share the same tenacity to quickynch PV.<br><br>What I want to know is, <span class=\"noboldsig\"> mod can we discuss what PV wrote in the QT? </span><br><br>I also want to know if Benmage read any of it at all, because both he and Chaos, come D2, thought PV to be hugely scummy; particularly after massive antagonising between the two of them about there having to be \"one scum in the neighbourhood, 80% chance.\"<br><br>This led me to the hypothesis that Ben was not posting in the QT because he was busy discussing strategy with Chaos in their mafia QT, conspiring to kill PV, since they could say he said something scummy and no one could question it. However, I don't see why two neighbours would conspire against another if they knew he was town, considering everyone was convinced that there was at least one scum in the neighbourhood, and that would draw attention to themselves.<br><br>Which leads me to another conclusion. If ANY of them are scummy, it could probably only be one, unless it was a MASSIVE WIFOM. And Vijay knew that if a neighbour flipped town, the other neighbours could be up for another quick lynch. Claiming town on them both protected ONE of them whether we thought vijay was town or not, because:<br>1) if vijay is suspected town, we suspect both of them as town, and his scumbuddy is protected.<br>2) if vijay is suspected scum, and lynched and flips scum, we now don't know which neighbour he was protecting, and by doing so it bought one of the neighbours more time. <br><br>I know this is a very involved theory, but reading through Chaos and vijay's posts I couldn't help wonder why PV was lynched and the other two neighbours covered."}

You could pick on anyone's posts for this. Heck, if I remember correctly you voted for vijay with little reasoning, and then changed your mind and your only response was 'my reads changed, and I'm confident in them'. Does this mean you are scum? The former, not really. Any sane person can see that you didn't have to repeat the logic of others. The latter? Yeah, possibly. But it's hardly a massive tell.

I need to go back through and ISO you again because I swear I thought you kept saying D1 and D2 that there was likely to be a scum amongst the neighbourhood, even if you didn't actually say you agreed with those figures. Will do another readthrough of you and benmage; though before I do, what is your opinion now of the whole neighbourhood argument, and vijay calling Benmage town? Yes I noticed you said benmage seems town, but why so? Do you think vijay claimed two people he knew as town as town, and if so why would he do that?<br><br>I'm not voting because I don't have any strong reads; my biggest concern at the moment is getting to the bottom of who was linked to vijay and why, and what indication it gives as to who is scum. Reading people as individually scummy is fine, but I think being more productive would be trying to figure out who is scummy from not only their own scumtells, but their link to vijay. My biggest scumread individually would be Om, but I hate voting someone who is riding me because usually I am prone to being biased and giving in to OMGUS (subconsciously). Om definitely looked like he was bussing vijay earlier, by voting him and then defending him, and then trying to lynch me. It seems as though he could be potentially scum, and was confident he could save vijay. Also his nervous post (the first one today) didn't seem like a town reaction. Also, the reasons I stated D3. I still want to look into whether timeater had any link to vijay though, and from memory DLG tried to establish this but I wasn't convinced. If Om is vijay's scumpartner, I would expect some telltale sign from timeater. I'll have another look through today.<br><br>In Om's defence it does seem like he is actually attempting to genuinely scumhunt though, even if I think his scumhunting is misguided. I'm also ISOing BB and Elias at the moment but after a quick skim of their posts there is nothing I can find on them, other than they COULD have been bussing vijay, but its nothing definite. <br><br>@BK what is your reasoning for Chaos being scummy?"}

Same answer as above<br>4. TROLOL, because an informed player wins more than one who chooses to stay uninformed. Mafia isn't about risks, its about informed risks, unless you want to lose 9/10.<br>5.

It says \"I have a strong scumtell and feel we will be closer to winning if we lynch him; if I lynch you, its more likely to be a mislynch\". I said earlier that if Benmage flips scum, it will tell me more about your alignment and I will have much less hesitation to lynch you then.<br><br>So by your logic I am inferring that I know benmage is scum?

It's not a huge tell, but when someone waffles on about how they are planning to be lurkerish, tries to defend that position, and then finishes up with 'its ok to be defensive' (guilty conscience) it seems somewhat scummerish.<br></div></blockquote><br>How did I waffle on \"planning to be lurkerish\"? The entire paragraph was a hypothetical, meant to illustrate that lurking is not necessarily a scum tell. I see far too many day 1 lurker lynches that flip town. It is my consistent standpoint that lurking is not a valid tell unless combined with other factors, and I wasn't trying to defend that position, I was succeeding in defending that position. And further, being defensive is not a scumtell. I haven't changed my signature in several years and it says right there, under things that are not a scumtell: being defensive. I could show you games in which I went into hyper-defensive mode as town and pulled the win out, if you really want, because defensiveness is a key component of my town play. These are both consistent standpoints of mine, and if you want to argue about the theory we can do that someday, but calling these tells is either contrived or stupid. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4065881#p4065881\" class=\"postlink\">post 825</a>, TeChNoWC wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4023677#p4023677\" class=\"postlink\">post 325</a>, Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4022335#p4022335\" class=\"postlink\">post 300</a>, ChaosOmega wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>You shouldn't worry too much right now though, I'm more interested in a Chaos lynch.</div></blockquote><br>In your first real post, you said that Benmage came off scummier than me, so either him essentially active lurking for a week you thought was an improvement in his play, or I've recently done something to make you think I'm scum.

I hope by the time I get back someone's done some real scum hunting so I won't be the only one.</div></blockquote><br><br>1. But you are the one claiming you had a super confident scumread, not me. I eventually felt confident that vijay was definitely scum, and I made it happen, so I would say I was pretty aggressive in line with my level of confidence in my scumreads. <br>2. I'm sorry to hear, and apologise if I was insensitive to this (didn't make the connection that RL meant real life lol, I thought you were referring to some actual device that literally blew up, eg some form of router or something <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> ) but it doesn't change the fact you've gone from lurker to posting alot in defence, claiming you will give scumreads and not giving any other than your read on Chaos. But ok, that does make more sense; but if you can find time please elaborate on your other scumreads, plus any other reasons you find Chaos scummy etc.<br>3. I never accused you of not being a good player. Bussing is never obvious until someone flips, and even then a lot of silly things can be construed as bussing. It's your adamancy + hesitancy that worries me. Town can be either or, or even sometimes both; but it's just slightly more likely for scum to be both. It's still a tell, and claiming that you are a 'good scum player' doesn't mean I should overlook it.<br>4. I'm not the one who necessarily thinks you are scum, I just suspect that you could be. Nearly everyone has received flak at the moment as suspected scum, and most people have been scumhunting more than you, so I can't see why you would think you are the only one doing 'proper' scumhunting. Everyone needs to be considered and analysed, particularly in their connection to vijay, or scum are going to slip through and win. Making the right decision at this stage is crucial."}

If so, explain why you think its reliable, and why it is a move indicative of scum.</div></blockquote><br>Yes. Lurking is depriving the town of information. It makes it harder for the town to get your reads, and it makes it harder for the town to read you. Both of these are more beneficial for scum than town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>No, its not at all. Agreeing that a player has been playing poorly is not the same as agreeing with everything that a person has said about another player.</div></blockquote><br>Except the only thing I said about Benmage was his lurking, and you agreed. So what exactly did you agree to?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>I asked for a votecount because I didn't want him lynched immediately, before we could get more information out of the situation.</div></blockquote><br>Didn't want him lynched immediately? He had 1 vote on him when you posted that. It wasn't even fucking close. Are you even paying attention to this game?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>Lurking and defensiveness are both parts of my play (not that I'm proud of it) and he accused of being scummy for defensiveness and lurking.</div></blockquote><br>Accusing you of being a lurker and being defensive as his reasoning for you being scummy isn't the same thing as him disagreeing with your theoretical views on scumtells, and for you to word it like that seems like it just serves for you to discredit his argument.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>Lurking, yes. I can certainly post examples of games where I lurked heavily as town. I don't see why you can't be bothered to do the research yourself if you're town. But where the hell does waffling on reads come from? When did I \"waffle\" my reads?</div></blockquote><br>As for the first part, because I don't really give a shit how you've played in previous games. The fact that you have the balls to say that lurking is your town meta just tells me that you're not very good at being town. Now if you lurk as town and post a lot as scum, that would be really stupid but I suppose would give you a valid meta defense.<br><br>As for the second part, you went from defending Senjai with your first real post in this game to having him be in your top 3 for scum later in the day without posting anything else on him in-between. You had a discussion with Timeater D1, at the end of it, you said his answers sounded genuine and unvoted him, listed him as scummy afterwards without mentioning him in-between."}

Even if we were to suppose that scum-Chaos weren't looking for a power role, and was making a kill to ensure he wouldn't be lynched the next day, he would not have been frightened by your little lie. I've been the top suspect  since I went MIA (a little before memorial day weekend). I am the most likely lynch tomorrow and that would not have been hard to predict. Leaving me and you alive makes perfect sense for scum-Chaos. <br> <br>I thought I made it pretty clear that I thought Chaos was the final scum, but its nice how you paint me as worried. To be honest I haven't been very into this game for the past month (obviously), and I'm not up to posting pages of back and forth. I don't see how you can think I'm the final scum, seeing as I was the only one who really wanted to lynch Vijay while everybody somehow got lead into dumb mislynches. I think the most accepting of the Cop + 1- shot was Chaos, based on a single example he had found. Not to mention his weak attacks on Vijay without any votes, then his mysterious jump to Peregrin. Reread 429 and on. I will admit I've played poorly this game, but I don't think I've played scummy. I've lurked and I haven't done nearly as much scumhunting as I'd like to. That's not nearly as damning as you make it out to be.<br><br>To be honest, I think any of you could be the scum. I've found Chaos the most suspicious for some time. Slandaar has played complacently all game, and was infrequent with actual content. Your argument for his play being too blatant to be bussing is fucking stupid. Read through my posts on Vijay, especially during the lynch that followed the 1-shot flip. If you think me and Vijay are partners after that, then you deserve to lynch me and lose. So convenient that you magically used PoE to implicate me, once everyone else has declared they think I'm scum. And its interesting that you are SO confident that you don't want to make the obvious move to reduce the pool to 3. There's no good reason to not vote today? Well yeah, if you're mafia there isn't one, because any mislynch is fine."}

I've done just as much, if not more hunting then you have, and I at least admit I've played poorly, while you seem to think your lurking is fine and dandy. If I recall correctly you have come under fire for being lurky and evasive throughout much of this game.<br><br>I also never said I didn't care about the game, I said that I wasn't as into it as I would've liked to be. I've explained throughout the game that RL has been crazy lately. I got kicked out of the house, started a new job, and other nonsense that I don't want to get into. \"Not caring\" is an atrocious misrepresentation of what I meant. Meanwhile, you accuse me of lurking and not scum hunting as you need to be prompted to even respond to the posts you demanded.<br><br>Please explain why techno was town. Its not abnormal to hold someone town, but without any fucking reason, while a major case is being made against him? That is sketch as shit. And what do you have to say about dropping your 1 scum in the neighborhood argument? Or the mysterious observation that you never posted? Is this the \"scum hunting\" that supposedly makes you less of a viable lynch than I? I look forward to your responses tomorrow."}

It really is a pity he lived this long  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"> <br><br>Based on the vote analysis, I determined two things:<br><br>1) Slandaar definitely waffled the most. But it really reads as town waffling. Especially when he so suddenly completely shifts sides on PV and votes him after stating that he was town numerous times. Waffling, in my opinion, is only a scum tell when it is subtle and when the player tries to hide it. Scum would tunnel before they shift opinions so easily as Slandaar did. <br><br>2) While they both voted scum at points in the game, Chaos's reasons ring more of scum voting his buddy whereas Slandaar appears to actually be town trying to scumhunt, in my opinion. Chaos's original vote on Techno<strike>Senjai</strike> is sound reasoning that town or scum would put a vote down on. His switch to vijay is completely unwarranted by his own posts and seems more like a poor bus to me. I'll discuss that more later. Chaos's last vote on Techno was due to Om's case against him. Slandaar's persistence on Vijay throughout the entirety of the game seems genuine and it made complete sense from a town perspective to let go of Technos after he claimed VT. Though I must admit, I don't like his drastic change to a strong town read just because of the claim, but I don't find it likely that scum would \"buddy\" Technos so hard (not vote) after Om's case on him and the pressure. Again, his town read seems genuine.<br><br>I am ready to lay down a vote, but I'd like to get all the evidence out in front of everyone first."}

It'd make much more sense for you to kill Slandaar than me. And obviously you don't kill me because then Benmage would for sure switch gears back to you.

He did things his own way, and there was not anyone around to complain. That is, until others moved into the area and Normalville was created. From behind his window, Slandaar would eye the first other inhabitants with a small flutter of excitement in his chest. The prospect of change was exciting, with people to work with, converse with, play music with. However, the new villagers found his violin skill unpleasant, his odd habits off-putting, and his quietness and solitude reason for suspicion. It was not long before the villagers stopped seeing Slandaar and would have wondered if he was even managing to keep himself alive, if not for the distinctive music emanating from his house. Slandaar had come to enjoy the responses to his music and while playing, would, with something bordering on ecstasy, imagine the cringes, the frowns, the discomfort.<br><br>One day, however, a young man named DeasVail came along, making a mockery of his attempts to torture the village. From behind his curtains, Slandaar found DeasVail's naive grin and youthful gait infuriating. One day, he decided that a change was needed in Normalville, and he would be the one to initiate it.<br><br>~~<br><br>Slandaar responds with more words than anyone from Normalville had ever heard him say.<br><br>\"Didn't your eyes light up at the sight of DeasVail dead? Didn't you imagine how much more pleasant Normalville would be. I was doing you all a favour! But no! In self-righteousness you deny your feelings and decide to burn the killers who only made your lives easier.\"<br><br>His face is contorted with anger, but after a moment's silence, laughter begins. Neither ChaosOmega or CryMeARiver have long to attempt to understand. He shoots at both of them until out of bullets and after a second's admiration of his work, returns to his home.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">That was fun</span>, he thinks as he opens his house door.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I believe it's time to move.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">CryMeARiver, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>, has been lynched Day 7.</span><br><br>A win condition has been achieved.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ChaosOmega, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Neighbour</span></span>, has been endgamed Day 7.<br><br>Slandaar, <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Goon</span></span>, survives to win Day 7.
