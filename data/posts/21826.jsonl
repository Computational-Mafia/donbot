The sun rose, the birds sang, the rooster cock-a-doodle-doo&#8217;d&#8230; Oh no, wait. That was just DeasVail. Let&#8217;s just move on, shall we?<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, as usual, Fat_Tony rushed off to the markets to discuss the latest fashion trends, Senjai could be spotted chasing after his two young boys across town, and Slandaar remained unseen. Many in the village had never laid eyes on him, but it was assumed that he was the source of the screeching violin sound from within the most run-down house in town, hidden behind several layers of vegetation. The one thing that the villagers could always rely upon, however, was DeasVail being a complete and utter nuisance. He would throw glitter all over Fat_Tony&#8217;s clothes, initiate spontaneous, village-wide hide-and-seek games with Senjai&#8217;s boys and would prance around Normalville with his recorder, accompanying the overwhelmingly pleasant sound produced by Slandaar&#8217;s violin. Yes, it was just another day in Normalville. <br>\n<br>\nThe next day, the sun rose, the birds sang, and the villagers got on with their business as usual. Well, more pleasant than usual, but no one seemed to notice until Benmage paused his rambling and cried out.<br>\n&#8220;Where is DeasVail?&#8221;<br>\nNo one paid him any attention at first, but eventually a low murmur seeped through Normalville as news of DeasVail&#8217;s disappearance spread. The villagers started searching for him and it wasn&#8217;t long before PeregrineV stumbled into the farmhouse and found his body. Well, what was left of it anyway.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DeasVail, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla Townie</div>, brutally murdered Night 0.</div><br>\n<br>\nEach of the villagers displayed the same reaction to the sight, except for one. Choice casually strolled into the farmhouse, and with a giant grin on his face, said, &#8220;Well this is just absolutely fantastic! We'll finally be able to sleep in!&#8221;<br>\nFat_Tony imagined how much nicer his clothes would look, Senjai thought of how much better his boys would behave and Slandaar, who watched the commotion from afar, revelled in the idea of being able to torture the village all by himself. Yes, beneath their masks of shock and horror, the villagers agreed that Normalville had just become a much nicer place to live.<br>\n<br>\nOr hadn't it?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Playerlist:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n1.

I agree with PV that his 'guesswork' is most indicative that one of them is scum and the other two are town. Eliminating the one scum if it exists would provide two close to conf town members fairly early in the game. Benmage comes off scummy in the beginning after magically determining Chaos is scum in pregame without providing any real reason why. Probably what took us out of RVS and yes I missed it for reasons above. He then goes on to state he determined such via PoE after PV came off being genuine in his QT. PV Confirmed this when he came in.<br>\n<br>\nIf PV had not came in and said what has been said I would have FoS'd ben over chaos. Chaos crossvote is expected given that Ben claimed he was scum without any real evidence so far. It is a reactionary post and I'd have done no different. I slightly think ben is scummier than Chaos - but PV's reasoning is sound. It would be suicide for scum-ben to push on town-chaos. And given that it is FAR more likely that one of the neighbors are scum having two go after one increases the chance of finding scum. If Chaos flips town well - then ben might be in some trouble. If ben flips town then PV is in trouble. If PV flips town then we have come to the 10% scenario where we were all wrong.

When two of these people have voted the other one - I think its a good idea to find out if they were right. even though as mentioned I still think ben is the scummier one.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4002796#p4002796\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4002796#p4002796\" data-post-id=\"4002796\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 39</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9614\">Timeater</a> wrote:</cite>Benmage why do you think you have such a notorious reputation on MS?</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4002802#p4002802\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4002802#p4002802\" data-post-id=\"4002802\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 41</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9614\">Timeater</a> wrote:</cite>Well, for instance, I've heard a lot about you and I haven't even played with you.

I agree with PV that his 'guesswork' is most indicative that one of them is scum and the other two are town. Eliminating the one scum if it exists would provide two close to conf town members fairly early in the game. Benmage comes off scummy in the beginning after magically determining Chaos is scum in pregame without providing any real reason why. Probably what took us out of RVS and yes I missed it for reasons above. He then goes on to state he determined such via PoE after PV came off being genuine in his QT. PV Confirmed this when he came in.<br>\n<br>\nIf PV had not came in and said what has been said I would have FoS'd ben over chaos. Chaos crossvote is expected given that Ben claimed he was scum without any real evidence so far. It is a reactionary post and I'd have done no different. I slightly think ben is scummier than Chaos - but PV's reasoning is sound. It would be suicide for scum-ben to push on town-chaos. And given that it is FAR more likely that one of the neighbors are scum having two go after one increases the chance of finding scum. If Chaos flips town well - then ben might be in some trouble. If ben flips town then PV is in trouble. If PV flips town then we have come to the 10% scenario where we were all wrong.

An <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span> is in order. <br>\n<br>\nFirst order of business is all this neighborizer nonsense. I think the speculation is actually pretty useless. There is generally at least one scum in the group, and a group with two out of three scum is rare. But its silly to throw out any possibility in favor of another merely based on statistics. Any mod can have any setup at any time. So to be honest I don't think its worth commenting on how many scum there may be in the group. I'm just gonna scrutinize ALL of their posts. Call me an equal opportunity scum hunter. That being said, the dichotomy between Chaos and BM is not necessarily a bad one, as it should force people to take sides early. I just don't like basing our lynches off of information we don't actually have. <br>\n<br>\nAs an aside, I kind of hate neighbors from a theoretical standpoint. Its a damn stupid role. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">On Chaos vs BM</div> - The discussion between Chaos and BM is hard to read without knowing the exact details of how Peregrin was trying to \"break the game\". Could someone please clarify this point? As I understand it, he was trying compare role PMs. But this can't be the sole justification for holding him town, can it? As I said I don't know the exact details, but couldn't this just as easily be interpreted as role fishing? Knowing the differences between a scum-neighbor PM and a town neighbor-PM seems like it would be incredibly useful to a mafiaso. I don't think its wise to assume he's town for trying to get information about your role. <br>\nAlso, the exaggeration in post 21 (the \"push that we were all town\" comment) doesn't read town to me. I don't see a \"push\" from Omega but an attempt to recognize all opportunities. Combined with the fact that Chaos is actually actively scum hunting, I'm inclined to say BM is the scummier of the two. In fact, BM hasn't actually been saying all that much besides \"ZOMG Chaos is scum based on PoE that only works from my standpoint, woooooo!\".<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">On Senjai wagon</div> - I really don't think this case in any good. The first point about activity is pretty wack. I lurk as town, especially if I don't think I'll be able to post something worthwhile until I have more time to think about what to say. Perhaps in my other games I'm more into the game and don't need to do a lot of thinking to post coherently and effectively, while this game contains a lot fo new information which has to be digested and processed. Just a hypothetical that often applies to my own game-to-game lurking. Its a poor argument and one that I think should be disallowed, but that's neither here nor there. I don't consider \"being defensive\" a scumtell, nor do I think that Senjai is guilty of being overly defensive. There are things I don't like in Senjai's play. He seems damn sure there's only one scum in the neighbors, and I'm not sure why. Not to mention 65, in which he implies willingness to lynch chaos because 2/3 neighbors are voting him, and at the same time implies that BM's vote on chaos was scummy. That doesn't add up. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ BB</div> - When you say \"sounds legit\" in post 31, are you being serious or sarcastic? Also, what exactly made you think BM vs Chaos was town v town when you posted as such? What do you think of the PoE argument proposed by BM?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ Timeater</div> - Are you aware that your attempts to \"know BM better as a player\" on page 2 seem a lot like you're trying to create a distraction of some sort? Why did you choose to ask your question over a series of posts, and not as an aside appended to some other post? A second point of note, what happened between post 47 and post 49 that made you change from healthy curiosity towards one aspect of the neighbor situation to \"not liking the dichotomy\"? I don't see how the chaos post in between could possibly have caused that 180. As an aside, fuck you for making me go all the way back to my room from the library to grab headphones just to listen to you preach a shitty case in an arrogant and self-assured tone. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Asher</div> - You're lying pretty damn low. Who's scum? <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Choice</div> - Why are you so sure that scum ONLY self-vote to start the game?

Lynching one will identify the other. This answers DLG's question: Even though I think ben was scummier in that discussion - Im voting Chaos to progress town. His neighbors have a separate QT and may be privy to information we dont have. Chaos says PV is town and so does Ben, so the fact that PV and Ben vote chaos leads me to trust that judgement for now. Should he flip the scum is likely Ben. Thats why lynching Ben OR Chaos will most likely result in a scum lynch D2 if not D1.<br>\n<br>\nAlso Time by being agressive like you are you avoid getting questioned yourself as everyone is so focused on defending your rash and unsubstantiated arguments.

I don't see how the chaos post in between could possibly have caused that 180.

It's a crazy, game breaking play, but PV would be immunized by the neighbor's inability to quote what went down in the QT.  We'd have to rely on word of mouth.

The simple reply should have been \"Explain why are you voting for me.\" But you jumped to the kind of play that you got mad at DLG for because it was the basis of his vote.

Benmage looks genuinely interested in lynching ChaosOmega based on the combination of the pregame stuff and ChaosOmega's reaction.  I don't think that's a high percentage play for scum!Benmage.  <br>\n<br>\nChaosOmega looks town due to Senjai interactions - scumhunting versus survival.<br>\n<br>\nPeregrineV looks like he ended up in the catbird seat over the whole thing.  If ChaosOmega flips town, Benmage is the next logical suspect based on the nature of the argument.  Benmage would look like desperate scum if he 180'd on PeregrineV after a ChaosOmega town flip.  <br>\n<br>\nThe whole incident seems like it was manipulated by one of the three involved and PeregrineV is just sitting back letting it play out.  He's even downplaying his own place on the wagon by saying,\"yep, vote stays\", but not offering any updated reaction to ChaosOmega.  Coupled with his question to asher1611, he looks by far the scummiest of the three.<br>\n<br>\nThis is all predicated on PeregrineV gambitting in pre-game.

I could be wrong about this though.<br>\n<br>\nWoah. Elias reads like chaos' buddy with his big post(125). He acknowledges that the percentage of one scum is greater but does away with this by saying a mod can have any setup at any time, but that's kinda like saying somebody breaking into your house only wanted to get out of the rain. Sure it's possible but really you aren't going to just let him go because that possibility EXISTS. Damn, too many people in this game are scummy.<br>\n<br>\nAs of 125 I'm thinking Chaos-Elias- Senjai in that order, with Time and BB as the dark horse team.<br>\n<br>\nMoving on.<br>\n<br>\nAh there we go, somebody confirms MB is in fact Choice.

He was scum, and the not making sense comment isn't an insult because the sensible thing to do would have been to lynch him regardless of alignment to cement town's win, so he had to be nonsensical to play to his wincon. <br>\n<br>\nLooking at the logic ( A - Ben, B - chaos, C- PV):<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A sees B - scum and C - town.</div> Yeah Ben thinks chaos is scum and PV is almost conftown for breaking the game. check.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">B sees A - scum and C - town.</div> Judging from chaos' vote on Ben and him not giving percentages to two scum this is also correct.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">C sees A or B scum.</div> PV wrote this down so I'm sure he knows what he sees.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DLG thinks C is scum.</div> Yup I believe your post said that.<br>\nI believe PV was right.

Even so, this is only a small thing.<br>\n<br>\n2)  His commentary on Benmage versus ChaosOmega<br>\nIt made no sense to label their dispute that way, at that time.  And, he provided nothing to support that conclusion.  It looked to me like an attempt to appear like he's contributing, but not really take a stance, and he intentionally left himself a way to change his mind (for now).<br>\n<br>\nOn further scrutiny, he said he was being sarcastic and didn't think it was town v town, and provided an explanation for why it looked town v town.  Which is it?  <br>\n<br>\n3)  His extreme defensive posture with respect to lurking<br>\nNo one, at all, had said anything with respect to him lurking.  This betrays a guilty conscience.  He was expecting to be attacked and throwing out defenses for an attack that did not exist.<br>\n<br>\n4)  His remarkably inaccurate depiction of my attacks on him<br>\n<br>\n5)  His attempt to make it all go away by just ignoring it<br>\n<br>\nI don't object to you describing him as derpy, per se.

Whatever.<br>\n2. If you say so. I stated how the argument appears to me.<br>\n2a. I did not say that commenting that the view I held on the argument being TvT was sarcastic. Elias asked if my comment \"sounds legit\" from post 31 was a sarcastic sounds legit or a real sounds legit. THAT was sarcasm. I was serious and defended this later when I commented on the point.<br>\n3. What? I commented by paraphrase your negative representation of my posts.

Why is that?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIn reference to BK, all I meant was his actions seemed like he knew who town was, as with no need to research, quickly voted for one of the top dogs on the vote list just to get a quick town lynching. I'm not saying that IS what he did, it just seemed kind of odd to me as it's not something I would do. I never said either that I was convinced you were scum, otherwise, with the deadline and amount of votes on us both, I would definitely be chucking one on you. You are obviously one of the main people I need to consider for a first day lynching as you have people in a stir, but yeah, I have a suspicion you are town; it's pretty 50/50 atm, and I don't if it's that I am reading you wrong, or my instincts are just biased to aggro towns. <br>\n<br>\nYeah, I don't exactly EXPECT aggro players to be scum, but if players are calm, actively contribute and make sound judgements about who is town and who is not, I trust them more. I do value aggro towns because they can get a lot of shit done, and make weak players crack, but they also make dangerous mafia and sometimes make very rash decisions based on stupid logic.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately I can't hold off on voting for too long. I want to see what more of what BK does as I would say he is my main suspect right now, but it wouldn't really be helpful if he plays his cards right. If no one else votes for him, I'm not helping out with the lynchings. So I am going to be studying you, vijay and peregrine the hardest (which is why i mentioned him, being in the top four for scum and all) much more hardly than the rest. Even if BK is scum, there's not much I can do about it at this moment in time.

I totally disagree with his scumhunting technqiues and overzealous nature, and having to pick up also when so close to lynch date was a hard task indeed. I am still not convinced as to who is scum but obviously I need to start voting. I feel as though I have been a prime target of bandwagoning, though.<br>\n<br>\nBK's arguments about picking from the 'neighbourhood' is much of a moot point, I think, but nevertheless made me suspect that he might be town. But apart from that, he screams scum to me. Admitting to his 'scumdom' would usually mean nothing to me, but in light of his ineptitude in studying the game and carefree nature to not only lynch quickly but his insistence on a dead 'neighbour argument' (I am assuming he refers to the so called Chaos/benmage association) is troubling. This goes against my better judgement; I feel I should be bandwagoning at this time to try and save myself. But ultimately I am hoping for a town victory, whether I am in the game or not, because I don't think I will be present much longer so I may as well stick to my convictions, hoping that in future rounds, people will watch his actions more closely and hopefully either prove me wrong, or give him the lynch he deserves.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Vote: BK </div>", "time": "Mon May 07, 2012 2:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

My motivation came from a desire to not be considered jumping ahead of myself as an introduced player, particularly as at that stage a lot of my opinions of players were generalized due to having only skimmed through the threads. <br>\n<br>\nIn terms of your benmage comment, I was unaware that Senjai thought benmage was scummy until after I had posted those two posts. I read back through and decided that his suspicions had some basis, and benmage as a unique playstyle, but personally I am under the impression he is town.<br>\n<br>\nWith regard to Fat Tony, V/LA is a great strategy for a mafia player to avoid being scumhunted for most of Day 1 - for exactly the reason why you palm it off. Of course this is not always the case, but I am sure players use it to their advantage.  Yeah, I realize the fact that he pulled out shortly after lessens the chance of this being the case, but it is still another factor in my suspicion that BK is scum. I'm far from convinced that he, or anyone is, but he was simply at the top of my scumlist, and votes are getting heated.

Quag listed a few people as scum, primarily DLG, then never said why and popped out of existence once the bandwagons started rolling. He's been coasting all this time. Elias has been a lot more helpful, DLG seems a bit shady but at least he's been involved in voting and scumhunting, and Chaos hasn't really done anything scummy lately.

Even IF the neighbour argument has any credence to it, i feel at this point neither PV, Chaos or ben stand out any scummier than one another, though maybe I would say Chaos in the very SLIGHTEST. So basically its a stab in the dark, with a 1/3 chance of a 'supposed' 80% chance.

Hopefully.<br>\n<br>\nSo you must have been getting some scummy vibes from him over benmage.<br>\n<br>\nLook. So say you get the long awaited neighbour-Chaos lynch you want. What if he flips town? Then we decide that there is an even greater chance PV is scum, and lynch him too? And then what if he comes up town? We lynch ben? And then, if we happen to finally get our fabled scummy neighbour after 3 bullshit rounds of lynching, how much has the neighbour argument really cost us?<br>\n<br>\nI think it's much better if we focus on who appears scummy for being scummy, rather than having a few stabs in the dark and trying to get lucky. I am aware that Quag isn't 'lynch of the day', but he's very close too - much more than any of the neighbours, so let's not waste time on a wild goose chase.<br>\n<br>\nI am pretty sure PV alluded to this type of argument earlier, and no one listened to him.<br>\n<br>\nLet Quag claim, and we can deal with it then. The sooner you vote the sooner we can get a claim out of him and move on if you don't like it.

To be honest your quick flip to trusting vijay worries me; either he is lying and you are potentially both scum, or he is telling the truth about you being town and this gives you incentive to trust him. I can't work out which is the case, so for me the 'let's lynch PV quick' seems like it could be a distraction tactic. Not sure also if something he said to you in the QT affected your view on his potential alignment.<br>\n<br>\nI feel somewhat willing to lynch either PV or vijay, but at the same time hesitant towards both. If vijay is a cop, we lose a valuable asset to town considering we have already lost one, and I think we would be fucked from there in. However, while PV has been coming off scummy, he seems to be getting a lot of flak from potential scummies (vijay and chaos) which is worrying, and hard to determine what's really going on.", "time": "Sat May 12, 2012 9:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

Your question seems a silly one. Obviously you should read D1 and D2, extensively. I have no problem with requesting summaries and drawing information off these (they should, however, always endeavour to refer to sample posts indicative of the argument) but how do you honestly believe you can get an accurate reading on the game, and who is scum and who is not, if you only go by limited information?<br>\n1. There is obviously a large number of scum left in the game, and they will try to mislead you.<br>\n2. There may be more information that can be garnered from reading D1 and D2 that could be very important, and someone may forget to address it, or no one has noticed it and you might. <br>\n3. A replacement is mostly at a disadvantage and must work hard to try and catch up with the happenings of the game, but they have the added advantage of a lack of bias, usually caused by growing OMGUS sentiments. <br>\n<br>\nTo be honest even asking this question seems kind of scummy, as town will usually be eager to figure out what is going on as minutely as possible, whereas scum just want a general idea and skim so they don't trip up on anything. <br>\n<br>\nMy sentiments are that Day 2 was rushed, and I consider myself as partly to blame for that. Study is CRITICAL at this point if we want to flip this game in favour of a town win. As such I want to provide an in-depth analysis (not only for you, but for everyone), but for now I will only provide a small one, as I need to go back and re-evaluate my reads. Here goes: <br>\n<br>\n1. My main scumread was initially on BK, as he seemed adamant to lynch the neighbourhood, and I could see that becoming a disastrous move. If the neighbourhood contains only one scummy (which is what everyone was saying is likely), or even none, then two-three mislynches plus two-three night phases would be enough to secure a victory for scum quite easily, and I was worried this was his scumplan. When he was willing to lynch Quag my opinion of him changed, and I saw that he was more flexible with his opinion on the neighbour argument. Seeing Quag flipped town rang alarm bells for me, but I was more focused on vijay and PV, who had come across very scummy late D1/early D2, and BK's posts early D2 came across as townie.<br>\n2. Vijay seemed somewhat scummy throughout D1 and came close to being lynched, but then claimed cop and everyone backed off. I didn't buy it, but it did make me hesitant to lynch. At this stage I am not sure how much a potential cop could serve town, and I was happy for a vijay lynch D2, but the argument against PV was more compelling, and I am eager to see who vijay 'supposedly' investigated last night. The vijay case became stronger D2 considering Code flipped cop, but discussion revealed that it was still possible vijay could be a cop.<br>\n3. Chaos came across as scummy through D1, but my opinion of him changed late D1/early D2, and vijay's 'investigation' of him and claim that he was town had me confused, and I didn't know what to read of it. I was fully convinced by the end of D2 that ben and chaos were right about PV, and that vijay was possibly telling the truth about chaos, but PV's flip has me wondering why ben pushed it so hard. Chaos didn't exactly push hard for a PV lynch, but was adamant that he was certain PV was scum, so unravelling all this neighbour bullshit is imperative on figuring out the potential scuminess of Chaos/ben/vijay (who I put in there for his cop claim on Chaos).<br>\n4. Ben came across as eager town to me most of the game, but in light of the fact that he has adamantly pushed for two town lynches now has me questioning this. Either he simply fucked up, like a lot of us have, or he is scum. I just couldn't see scum being that forward with their lynches/votes, but maybe it is just a clever WIFOM. <br>\n<br>\nObviously this is not everything, but a general overview from my angle. I will be sorting through D1 and D2 sometime tonight/tommorrow, in the meantime you need to get reading also.", "time": "Wed May 16, 2012 9:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

Apologies for arriving so late to the party. An <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span> is in order. <br>\n<br>\nFirst order of business is all this neighborizer nonsense. I think the speculation is actually pretty useless. There is generally at least one scum in the group, and a group with two out of three scum is rare. But its silly to throw out any possibility in favor of another merely based on statistics. Any mod can have any setup at any time. So to be honest I don't think its worth commenting on how many scum there may be in the group. I'm just gonna scrutinize ALL of their posts. Call me an equal opportunity scum hunter. That being said, the dichotomy between Chaos and BM is not necessarily a bad one, as it should force people to take sides early. I just don't like basing our lynches off of information we don't actually have. <br>\n<br>\nAs an aside, I kind of hate neighbors from a theoretical standpoint. Its a damn stupid role. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">On Chaos vs BM</div> - The discussion between Chaos and BM is hard to read without knowing the exact details of how Peregrin was trying to \"break the game\". Could someone please clarify this point? As I understand it, he was trying compare role PMs. But this can't be the sole justification for holding him town, can it? As I said I don't know the exact details, but couldn't this just as easily be interpreted as role fishing? Knowing the differences between a scum-neighbor PM and a town neighbor-PM seems like it would be incredibly useful to a mafiaso. I don't think its wise to assume he's town for trying to get information about your role. <br>\nAlso, the exaggeration in post 21 (the \"push that we were all town\" comment) doesn't read town to me. I don't see a \"push\" from Omega but an attempt to recognize all opportunities. Combined with the fact that Chaos is actually actively scum hunting, I'm inclined to say BM is the scummier of the two. In fact, BM hasn't actually been saying all that much besides \"ZOMG Chaos is scum based on PoE that only works from my standpoint, woooooo!\".<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">On Senjai wagon</div> - I really don't think this case in any good. The first point about activity is pretty wack. I lurk as town, especially if I don't think I'll be able to post something worthwhile until I have more time to think about what to say. Perhaps in my other games I'm more into the game and don't need to do a lot of thinking to post coherently and effectively, while this game contains a lot fo new information which has to be digested and processed. Just a hypothetical that often applies to my own game-to-game lurking. Its a poor argument and one that I think should be disallowed, but that's neither here nor there. I don't consider \"being defensive\" a scumtell, nor do I think that Senjai is guilty of being overly defensive. There are things I don't like in Senjai's play. He seems damn sure there's only one scum in the neighbors, and I'm not sure why. Not to mention 65, in which he implies willingness to lynch chaos because 2/3 neighbors are voting him, and at the same time implies that BM's vote on chaos was scummy. That doesn't add up. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ BB</div> - When you say \"sounds legit\" in post 31, are you being serious or sarcastic? Also, what exactly made you think BM vs Chaos was town v town when you posted as such? What do you think of the PoE argument proposed by BM?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ Timeater</div> - Are you aware that your attempts to \"know BM better as a player\" on page 2 seem a lot like you're trying to create a distraction of some sort? Why did you choose to ask your question over a series of posts, and not as an aside appended to some other post? A second point of note, what happened between post 47 and post 49 that made you change from healthy curiosity towards one aspect of the neighbor situation to \"not liking the dichotomy\"? I don't see how the chaos post in between could possibly have caused that 180. As an aside, fuck you for making me go all the way back to my room from the library to grab headphones just to listen to you preach a shitty case in an arrogant and self-assured tone. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Asher</div> - You're lying pretty damn low. Who's scum? <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Choice</div> - Why are you so sure that scum ONLY self-vote to start the game? Because I'm pretty damn sure I've self-voted as town. The fact that this is the strongest point you can find over five pages, and the fact that you have talked more about FF7 then THIS game, tells me you're reluctant to comment on the meat of the game. Who's scum?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Fat_Tony </div>- You alive? Wanna post some more? Who's scum?<br>\n<br>\nNo vote for now.

I wasn't pulling a newbie card, I was being honest. If you look back through my posts and actually read D1 and D2 properly, you'll see that I have more experience with mafia than I do ONLINE mafia, hence, I can play at a semi-proficient level, but am unfamiliar with online roles and game mechanics. MSN played mafia could be considered online but it was regulated by uni students and played by uni students, that only ever used roles such as cop, doc, vig, SK. And there was no structure, formula or theory, it was just whatever the the regulator felt like doing - it was more bullshit to do when we were drunk and bored, rather than speculate on fairness and accuracy.<br>\n<br>\nCheck my meta and see if I am making this up, it's not hard to do.", "time": "Thu May 17, 2012 8:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

Obviously mafia don't want to waste a kill on him if he is lynch target number one. <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I am definitely more inclined to believe that vijay is surviving because he is lying scum, and your argument is more likely.

Yes, I am trying to stop the neighbourhood argument being a good reason to lynch people not over there scumminess, but the fact that they are a neighbour. Not only was vijay pushing focus onto it earlier by saying Chaos and PV were scum, and just before he investigated Benmage also, but now is STILL adamant that chaos might be scum because he could be a GF. Fair call, but it has constantly been \"let's lynch the neighbours\". I and PV both explained why this was mathematically a bad approach, and it has already cost us one townie lynch.<br>\n2. Not impossible, very possible<br>\n3. If anything you are OMGUSing me, I called you scummy first, on your very first post.<br>\n4. A stupid answer.<br>\n5. On second evaluation, you may not have been pushing for quick lynches, and you did take your vote off vijay when he got to L-1 (in a matter of hours), but you are determined to lynch me after some ten post interaction. Maybe this is your form of scumhunting and that is fine; but if you are ACTUALLY considering lynching someone based off that newbie card crap (I'm still not getting your logic), then that is quite worrisome. <br>\n6. Yeah, good luck with that, because so far your read on vijay has changed from 'scummy let's lynch' to 'he is town, there is no case on him' in very little time at all. So no chance your reads are once again letting you down, oh mafia champion?<br>\n7. Explain to the rest of us dim-witted folks how vijay's reactions make him town.<br>\n8.

Yes, I am trying to stop the neighbourhood argument being a good reason to lynch people not over there scumminess, but the fact that they are a neighbour. Not only was vijay pushing focus onto it earlier by saying Chaos and PV were scum, and just before he investigated Benmage also, but now is STILL adamant that chaos might be scum because he could be a GF. Fair call, but it has constantly been \"let's lynch the neighbours\". I and PV both explained why this was mathematically a bad approach, and it has already cost us one townie lynch. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I still don't see you doing much about it.</div><br>\n2. Not impossible, very possible<br>\n3. If anything you are OMGUSing me, I called you scummy first, on your very first post. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">No you didn't, you had light suspicion of me that was obviously intended to go nowhere. You knew I was lazy and just made an excuse to suspect me in case you need to jump on my wagon later in the game.</div><br>\n4. A stupid answer. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Stupid =/= Wrong</div><br>\n5. On second evaluation, you may not have been pushing for quick lynches, and you did take your vote off vijay when he got to L-1 (in a matter of hours), but you are determined to lynch me after some ten post interaction. Maybe this is your form of scumhunting and that is fine; but if you are ACTUALLY considering lynching someone based off that newbie card crap (I'm still not getting your logic), then that is quite worrisome. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lol, you don't even bother to read my posts. I expected more from you. My logic is fine, I don't need you guys to understand it as long as I do. And I'll just continue to push my reads.</div><br>\n6. Yeah, good luck with that, because so far your read on vijay has changed from 'scummy let's lynch' to 'he is town, there is no case on him' in very little time at all. So no chance your reads are once again letting you down, oh mafia champion? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So my reads aren't allowed to change? Interesting.</div><br>\n7. Explain to the rest of us dim-witted folks how vijay's reactions make him town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nope, I thought vijay was town the whole time, the reaction test was on the rest of the town.</div><br>\n8. I never called him scum, I was postulating. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I asked you who you thought was scum, and you listed him. You ain't bactracking out of this one while I'm around.</div><br>\n9. And also a scumtell that should be considered. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A scumtell which can be applied to town too.</div></div></blockquote>", "time": "Fri May 18, 2012 4:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

Here are your options:<br>\n- We're actually neighbors.<br>\n- We're playing a fucking godawful gambit as a scum team.<br>\n- Benmage posted as a blatant lie that we are neighbors, and me and PeregrineV agreed with him because we're capricious dicks.<br>\n<br>\nI don't understand at all how you can feasibly think we're not neighbors. Anyway, any rationale as to why the existence of a neighborhood reduces the chance of a cop? I don't see the relation between the two at all. So, because you doubt there's a \"real\" cop (what do you mean by real cop? I thought sanity was always confirmed in normals now), does that mean you believe vijay is lying?<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I reread PeregrineV, I don't see much scumhunting at all in his posts, other than him trying to figure out who if any of the neighbors are scum.

We're at a real risk of no-lynching here.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAll of a sudden he switches from vijay being a good lynch, and PV being a towntell, to PV being absolutely scummy. When I asked him about this he said it had something to do with what PV posted in the QT, and although Benmage said he hadn't posted in the QT, he seemed to share the same tenacity to quickynch PV.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I want to know is, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> mod can we discuss what PV wrote in the QT? </div><br>\n<br>\nI also want to know if Benmage read any of it at all, because both he and Chaos, come D2, thought PV to be hugely scummy; particularly after massive antagonising between the two of them about there having to be \"one scum in the neighbourhood, 80% chance.\"<br>\n<br>\nThis led me to the hypothesis that Ben was not posting in the QT because he was busy discussing strategy with Chaos in their mafia QT, conspiring to kill PV, since they could say he said something scummy and no one could question it. However, I don't see why two neighbours would conspire against another if they knew he was town, considering everyone was convinced that there was at least one scum in the neighbourhood, and that would draw attention to themselves.<br>\n<br>\nWhich leads me to another conclusion. If ANY of them are scummy, it could probably only be one, unless it was a MASSIVE WIFOM. And Vijay knew that if a neighbour flipped town, the other neighbours could be up for another quick lynch. Claiming town on them both protected ONE of them whether we thought vijay was town or not, because:<br>\n1) if vijay is suspected town, we suspect both of them as town, and his scumbuddy is protected.<br>\n2) if vijay is suspected scum, and lynched and flips scum, we now don't know which neighbour he was protecting, and by doing so it bought one of the neighbours more time. <br>\n<br>\nI know this is a very involved theory, but reading through Chaos and vijay's posts I couldn't help wonder why PV was lynched and the other two neighbours covered.", "time": "Tue May 22, 2012 12:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

You could pick on anyone's posts for this. Heck, if I remember correctly you voted for vijay with little reasoning, and then changed your mind and your only response was 'my reads changed, and I'm confident in them'. Does this mean you are scum? The former, not really. Any sane person can see that you didn't have to repeat the logic of others. The latter? Yeah, possibly. But it's hardly a massive tell.

No, I actually said that I thought ONE was scum, and vijay claimed them both so it would be harder to tell which was his buddy, reasoning for which I laid out clearly and am not repeating myself because you are too lazy (or maybe scummy?) to read my posts properly.", "time": "Tue May 22, 2012 12:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

I need to go back through and ISO you again because I swear I thought you kept saying D1 and D2 that there was likely to be a scum amongst the neighbourhood, even if you didn't actually say you agreed with those figures. Will do another readthrough of you and benmage; though before I do, what is your opinion now of the whole neighbourhood argument, and vijay calling Benmage town? Yes I noticed you said benmage seems town, but why so? Do you think vijay claimed two people he knew as town as town, and if so why would he do that?<br>\n<br>\nI'm not voting because I don't have any strong reads; my biggest concern at the moment is getting to the bottom of who was linked to vijay and why, and what indication it gives as to who is scum. Reading people as individually scummy is fine, but I think being more productive would be trying to figure out who is scummy from not only their own scumtells, but their link to vijay. My biggest scumread individually would be Om, but I hate voting someone who is riding me because usually I am prone to being biased and giving in to OMGUS (subconsciously). Om definitely looked like he was bussing vijay earlier, by voting him and then defending him, and then trying to lynch me. It seems as though he could be potentially scum, and was confident he could save vijay. Also his nervous post (the first one today) didn't seem like a town reaction. Also, the reasons I stated D3. I still want to look into whether timeater had any link to vijay though, and from memory DLG tried to establish this but I wasn't convinced. If Om is vijay's scumpartner, I would expect some telltale sign from timeater. I'll have another look through today.<br>\n<br>\nIn Om's defence it does seem like he is actually attempting to genuinely scumhunt though, even if I think his scumhunting is misguided. I'm also ISOing BB and Elias at the moment but after a quick skim of their posts there is nothing I can find on them, other than they COULD have been bussing vijay, but its nothing definite. <br>\n<br>\n@BK what is your reasoning for Chaos being scummy?", "time": "Tue May 22, 2012 6:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

The entire paragraph was a hypothetical, meant to illustrate that lurking is not necessarily a scum tell. I see far too many day 1 lurker lynches that flip town. It is my consistent standpoint that lurking is not a valid tell unless combined with other factors, and I wasn't trying to defend that position, I was succeeding in defending that position. And further, being defensive is not a scumtell. I haven't changed my signature in several years and it says right there, under things that are not a scumtell: being defensive. I could show you games in which I went into hyper-defensive mode as town and pulled the win out, if you really want, because defensiveness is a key component of my town play. These are both consistent standpoints of mine, and if you want to argue about the theory we can do that someday, but calling these tells is either contrived or stupid. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4065881#p4065881\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4065881#p4065881\" data-post-id=\"4065881\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 825</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18888\">TeChNoWC</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4023677#p4023677\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4023677#p4023677\" data-post-id=\"4023677\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 325</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3614\">Elias_the_thief</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4022335#p4022335\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4022335#p4022335\" data-post-id=\"4022335\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 300</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7127\">ChaosOmega</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite>You shouldn't worry too much right now though, I'm more interested in a Chaos lynch.</div></blockquote><br>\nIn your first real post, you said that Benmage came off scummier than me, so either him essentially active lurking for a week you thought was an improvement in his play, or I've recently done something to make you think I'm scum.

But you are the one claiming you had a super confident scumread, not me. I eventually felt confident that vijay was definitely scum, and I made it happen, so I would say I was pretty aggressive in line with my level of confidence in my scumreads. <br>\n2. I'm sorry to hear, and apologise if I was insensitive to this (didn't make the connection that RL meant real life lol, I thought you were referring to some actual device that literally blew up, eg some form of router or something <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> ) but it doesn't change the fact you've gone from lurker to posting alot in defence, claiming you will give scumreads and not giving any other than your read on Chaos. But ok, that does make more sense; but if you can find time please elaborate on your other scumreads, plus any other reasons you find Chaos scummy etc.<br>\n3. I never accused you of not being a good player. Bussing is never obvious until someone flips, and even then a lot of silly things can be construed as bussing. It's your adamancy + hesitancy that worries me. Town can be either or, or even sometimes both; but it's just slightly more likely for scum to be both. It's still a tell, and claiming that you are a 'good scum player' doesn't mean I should overlook it.<br>\n4. I'm not the one who necessarily thinks you are scum, I just suspect that you could be. Nearly everyone has received flak at the moment as suspected scum, and most people have been scumhunting more than you, so I can't see why you would think you are the only one doing 'proper' scumhunting. Everyone needs to be considered and analysed, particularly in their connection to vijay, or scum are going to slip through and win.

Even if we were to suppose that scum-Chaos weren't looking for a power role, and was making a kill to ensure he wouldn't be lynched the next day, he would not have been frightened by your little lie.

To be honest I haven't been very into this game for the past month (obviously), and I'm not up to posting pages of back and forth. I don't see how you can think I'm the final scum, seeing as I was the only one who really wanted to lynch Vijay while everybody somehow got lead into dumb mislynches. I think the most accepting of the Cop + 1- shot was Chaos, based on a single example he had found. Not to mention his weak attacks on Vijay without any votes, then his mysterious jump to Peregrin. Reread 429 and on. I will admit I've played poorly this game, but I don't think I've played scummy. I've lurked and I haven't done nearly as much scumhunting as I'd like to. That's not nearly as damning as you make it out to be.<br>\n<br>\nTo be honest, I think any of you could be the scum. I've found Chaos the most suspicious for some time. Slandaar has played complacently all game, and was infrequent with actual content. Your argument for his play being too blatant to be bussing is fucking stupid. Read through my posts on Vijay, especially during the lynch that followed the 1-shot flip. If you think me and Vijay are partners after that, then you deserve to lynch me and lose. So convenient that you magically used PoE to implicate me, once everyone else has declared they think I'm scum.

I've done just as much, if not more hunting then you have, and I at least admit I've played poorly, while you seem to think your lurking is fine and dandy. If I recall correctly you have come under fire for being lurky and evasive throughout much of this game.<br>\n<br>\nI also never said I didn't care about the game, I said that I wasn't as into it as I would've liked to be. I've explained throughout the game that RL has been crazy lately.

PeregerineV would often peer over the fence they shared and see Benmage sitting cross-legged in his backyard, inhumanly still, intensely focusing on a small rock on the grass in front of him.<br>\n<br>\nThis was because Benmage thought he had inner magic. In fact, he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">knew</div> it. He would try to discuss his attempts at using it with anyone who did not make effort to avoid him. However, even those that he caught by surprise would suddenly acquire the urge to \"do the grocery shopping\", \"meet a friend\" or \"give the cat a bath\".<br>\n<br>\nOnly DeasVail, despite his conspicuous lack of understanding of the arcane arts, would listen to him, talk to him. He remembers summer afternoons of the two of them sitting side by side, gazing intently at rocks. However, with DeasVail's murder, those days were gone. In the process of packing after DeasVail's death, eager at the opportunity to finally escape Normalville, Benmage paused, and realised how sweet it would be to avenge his one friend's death. He came up with a plan.<br>\n<br>\nEach night, apart from skyping with his neighbours of course, he would work even harder on releasing his magic and when he did manage to levitate that pebble, he would use his newfound magic to destroy the mafia. The plan was flawless!<br>\n<br>\nEach night he would try and fail, and he began to give up hope, started to think it possible that perhaps he was not magical after all, until the sixth night.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nBenmage sits at his desk, head sagging against his right palm, struggling to keep his eyes open.

Actually lol, Maybe not this is hardcore wifom, im not completely sure Chaos would think this... its possible he just gutkills him without the thought but based on what ben posted a couple days ago I doubt this.

But it really reads as town waffling. Especially when he so suddenly completely shifts sides on PV and votes him after stating that he was town numerous times. Waffling, in my opinion, is only a scum tell when it is subtle and when the player tries to hide it. Scum would tunnel before they shift opinions so easily as Slandaar did. <br>\n<br>\n2) While they both voted scum at points in the game, Chaos's reasons ring more of scum voting his buddy whereas Slandaar appears to actually be town trying to scumhunt, in my opinion. Chaos's original vote on Techno<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Senjai</div> is sound reasoning that town or scum would put a vote down on. His switch to vijay is completely unwarranted by his own posts and seems more like a poor bus to me. I'll discuss that more later. Chaos's last vote on Techno was due to Om's case against him. Slandaar's persistence on Vijay throughout the entirety of the game seems genuine and it made complete sense from a town perspective to let go of Technos after he claimed VT. Though I must admit, I don't like his drastic change to a strong town read just because of the claim, but I don't find it likely that scum would \"buddy\" Technos so hard (not vote) after Om's case on him and the pressure. Again, his town read seems genuine.<br>\n<br>\nI am ready to lay down a vote, but I'd like to get all the evidence out in front of everyone first.", "time": "Wed Jun 13, 2012 7:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21826&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "21826"}

{"number": 950, "id": "4127290", "user": "DeasVail", "user_id": "17118", "content": "As the seventh day since DeasVail's death begins, ChaosOmega reflects on how much Normalville had changed in those seven days. Once a slightly crowded place with children seen running from house to house, hearty voices announcing goods for sale and at least <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> pleasant music, the village was now eery in its silence. Indeed, the the sound of ChaosOmega's steps as he makes his way to the square feels unnatural, the clear blue sky and numerous warm-coloured houses at odds with the lack of activity. <br>\n<br>\nThe three remaining villagers are quiet that day, reserved, each knowing that by evening, their fate will be revealed. Eventually, ChaosOmega becomes convinced of CryMeARiver's guilt and suggests his lynch.<br>\n<br>\nImmediately afterward, Slandaar announces his agreement and whips out his pistol, shooting CryMeARiver in the chest.<br>\n<br>\nChaosOmega's knees collapse and he slumps to the ground, face suddenly hot, mouth slightly open and yet to respond to the sudden turn of events, knowing that his death will surely come next. Only one question presses on his mind.<br>\n\"Why?\" CryMeARiver, not yet dead, asks.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nOnce upon a time, Slandaar had lived alone in what was to become Normalville, in a house he himself had built, behind a garden he carefully maintained. He did things his own way, and there was not anyone around to complain. That is, until others moved into the area and Normalville was created. From behind his window, Slandaar would eye the first other inhabitants with a small flutter of excitement in his chest. The prospect of change was exciting, with people to work with, converse with, play music with. However, the new villagers found his violin skill unpleasant, his odd habits off-putting, and his quietness and solitude reason for suspicion. It was not long before the villagers stopped seeing Slandaar and would have wondered if he was even managing to keep himself alive, if not for the distinctive music emanating from his house. Slandaar had come to enjoy the responses to his music and while playing, would, with something bordering on ecstasy, imagine the cringes, the frowns, the discomfort.<br>\n<br>\nOne day, however, a young man named DeasVail came along, making a mockery of his attempts to torture the village. From behind his curtains, Slandaar found DeasVail's naive grin and youthful gait infuriating. One day, he decided that a change was needed in Normalville, and he would be the one to initiate it.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar responds with more words than anyone from Normalville had ever heard him say.<br>\n<br>\n\"Didn't your eyes light up at the sight of DeasVail dead? Didn't you imagine how much more pleasant Normalville would be. I was doing you all a favour! But no! In self-righteousness you deny your feelings and decide to burn the killers who only made your lives easier.\"<br>\n<br>\nHis face is contorted with anger, but after a moment's silence, laughter begins. Neither ChaosOmega or CryMeARiver have long to attempt to understand. He shoots at both of them until out of bullets and after a second's admiration of his work, returns to his home.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">That was fun</div>, he thinks as he opens his house door.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I believe it's time to move.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">CryMeARiver, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla Townie</div>, has been lynched Day 7.</div><br>\n<br>\nA win condition has been achieved.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ChaosOmega, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Town Neighbour</div>, has been endgamed Day 7.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Mafia Goon</div>, survives to win Day 7.
