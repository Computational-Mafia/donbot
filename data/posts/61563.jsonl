I'm also an SE in this game, which means I am \"Semi-Experience Challenged\". It just means that I've played a few games on site. As an SE, I do my best to be helpful and answer questions from newer players. When I'm talking about theory and such, that's simply me discussing a game which I've enjoyed for decades. You shouldn't read my alignment either way based upon any theory posts I make. <br><br>Also, as a PSA: The general rule of behavior on site is attack the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">play</span>, not the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">player</span>. This means that if you get irritated at someone in the game, it's okay to criticize their play or posts, but when you cross the line and attack the actual player, you are breaking the rules. Most folks on site are okay with some level of back and forth and breaking of this rule. There tends to be a \"grow thicker skin\" sort of attitude about it. I tend to believe that civil play benefits everyone. I won't start any fights, but if someone starts getting out of line, I will go hard at them. If you come at me personally, be prepared to pull back a stump. If you go after a newbie, be prepared to lose more than one limb. You've been warned. <br><br>{Serious bizness mode off}"}

Are you trying to say that you have actual solid reads on everyone on that wagon and on Monkey and you understand exactly what and why that happened? Yeah ... I didn't think so. You don't have a problem with implying that I'm scummy for taking no stance when there's not enough info to make an informed opinion, but you didn't even bother to give your own opinion.

I have also been told, for decades, that I come across like the nicest guy you'll ever meet in person or on voice comms (skype, mumble, etc...), but I can say the exact same thing in text and without the tone to give cues, I come across as, and I am quoting a long time friend here: \"A total asshat\". <br><br>I doubt you'll find meta useful for me since there's only one real thread of consistency in my game.

Logical and methodical, no matter alignment. The thing is, I have made a very conscious effort in every game here on MS to try new things stylistically. I used to say something at the start of games about it, but people would use it as an excuse to say that I was just trying to give myself a smokescreen because I had a scum role in my inbox.

Logical and methodical, no matter alignment. The thing is, I have made a very conscious effort in every game here on MS to try new things stylistically.

I might as well say it, since this line of questioning is obviously bearing no fruit. I was trying to feel out if you had some potentially illogical worries about establishing town credibility, again, based on the tone of #38. You claim this was a jokepost, but mixing content with jokes leaves a bad taste in my mouth unless the jokes are very over-the-top or literally tagged as jokes.<br><br>And I'm pretty sure that I have no means to demand anything of anyone. You can always tell me to bugger off, shut the computer, or what have you. keyblade said that those games were too old for him to look up, and I dropped it after that. With all this, wouldn't it have been painlessly easy to, instead of literally telling me you aren't going to address my questions, then telling me you just did, just agreeing with the option that I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">literally laid out for you</span>, that there were too many/too spread out for you to characterize?<br><br>---<br><br>As something that's not really content-related, the assumption that I'm not willing to play ball is more than a tad irritating. If you don't want to ask a question for reasons of time consumption, that's fine, but at the same time, actively avoiding the question, then putting more effort into answering questions I didn't ask than ones I did, does not cultivate an impression of good faith.<br><br>---<br><br>A few notes about the jabs tossed at me: sometimes you have to be circumspect when talking to a scumspect. You claim I'm lying about you being hesitant to engage the question when you instead go on a tirade about the role of meta and your own meta--which amounts to very, very shallow content, by the way--after <span style=\"font-style: italic\">literally saying you aren't going to answer the question</span>. And, again, claiming I demand X or Y while spending more energy defending your decision to not provide any significant meta than you would expend telling me you don't have the time or energy to do so from the get-go seems silly at best. Finally, for what it's worth, anyone can claim to be logical--but I've yet to see someone feel the need to claim it about theirself and be right about that. Useless thing to say, honestly.<br><br>All of this said, you've been defensive straight off the bat--and if you're as experienced as you say you are, this is an odd tack to take, and certainly not one that has me reading you town. That said, surprisingly enough, I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> going in for a tunnel in the first 16 hours? Less? Of Day 1. And I'm satisfied that this line of questioning won't produce any new information for now.

A meaningless post that serves no purpose whatsoever that I can tell.<br><br>2. A vote that you could have come up with without reading the thread at all.

The quoted post above in which you were maybe trying to defend yourself, but also just asking a question.<br><br>Have you read the thread? If so, in all that has gone on in the thread so far, is this really your best/strongest read? If now, why bother posting at all?<br><br>For the record, I disagree with your assertion that lurking is scummy. Lurking is null, unless you can point to lurking in said players history as being a scum tell (and there are a few players on this site that that applies to). So, if you have evidence of lurking being a scumtell for Lapsa, please share, otherwise, stop accusing people of scummy behavior for things that can also apply to yourself."}

That bit at the start of your post where you zeroed in on me using the word \"make\" was a really bad way to try and catch scum. Focusing in minutiae can get you into trouble because you simply cannot account for whether or not the things you're seeing are alignment indicative. For example, I teach <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek\" class=\"postlink\">Koine Greek</a> currently, as part of my work load. As a result of working with linguistic syntax frequently as a function of my work, I will frequently think/speak/write using word choices that may not be the norm. For example, the words \"make\" and \"form\" are linguistically very similar and have close etymological backgrounds. If you try and read alignment into my word choices, you're going to spend the entire game on a wild goose chase. <br><br>@Terrador - I'm careful and deliberate and try to be logical. Your question looked like a no win proposition to me. On this site I have so far been hard to read for most people, and in completed games that I can talk about there have been a few town tunnels, but usually if I'm being scumread as town, it's scum manipulating my particular oddities to try and get me lynched off. In that completed game Dragonspawn was referring to where he was scum, the observers in the dead thread were able to perfectly read me as town, but the living players in game got super confused. They managed to have 3 townies in the top 4 scum suspects, having me in there mostly for the aforementioned derphammer. <br><br>Also, since Dragonspawn doesn't want to answer the question and it's not really fair of him to make people go digging for the answer: House deliberately goes out of his way to be impossible to read. The more people can't figure out what he's doing, the better. In that same game we were in together, he was the Town Tracker, while I was a BP who breadcrumbed my role by starting every sentence from the end of my post going backwards with the letters to spell out Bulletproof {Yes, really}. When push came to shove and I had to quote that post and highlight those letters {to the townie who was eventually mislynched for the scum win ... sigh}, House counterclaimed me for some reason. Amusingly, scum thought I was actually a bomb or something. In short, Dragonspawn is attempting to be enigmatic and unreadable. I sincerely hope he does <span class=\"noboldsig\">not</span> take it to House level shenanigans ... we really don't need another one of those floating around. <br><br>That was a nice sleep.

Let me know what you think about this wagon gaining speed on me. <br><br>I've lost count over the years of how many obviously badly motivated wagons like this that I've seen result in mislynches. I can only remember a very few times when the townie caught up in them was able to talk his way out of it. There's a severe confirmation bias feedback that happens sometimes where nothing can be said that won't be added to the fire as more \"proof\" of someone being guilty. I'm being read as scummy because I didn't want to answer an obviously loaded question directly and chose to give answers to what seemed like the underlying motives of such an obvious trap question. Then I mocked people for really bad logic and did a little trolling, and voila, here we are in a no win situation. If I defend myself, I'm scummy. If I don't defend myself, I'm scummy.

There was a time when I had a pretty high level of chemistry knowledge and understanding, but I haven't used any of that in a few decades and I probably couldn't explain high school level chemistry to you at this point. Does that make me stupid? I could spend hours talking about the Genitive case usages of the Koine Greek infinitive. Does that make me smart? It's relative.

I stopped reading his post. I'm not familiar with his argument. Also, this is pointless. <br><br><br>At the present moment, we had two interesting things happen coming out of RVS. The flashwagon and then the back and forth between Torrador and I that has led to the wagon on me presently. A third interesting thing (The Lynch all Liars invocation) happened in the last little bit. As I think I said, I am tinkering with my style from game to game, and largely the \"read\" on me is down to things that are largely not reliable as alignment indicators. <br><br>The best move for the long term game is to set aside the wagon for poor reasons coming out of RVS. There's still a lot of time left on day one, and this back and forth around me is stifling the game from moving out of RVS and opening up. I only look like a good target because there has been almost nothing else noteworthy, aside from the early flashwagon that happened. Set aside focusing on me for a hot second and talk about some other stuff. You can always come back to me if nothing legitimately scummy happens during this day phase, but right now there's probably nothing I can say that will make anyone suddenly decide I'm Townie McTownerson. If you lynch me now, you'll just have a day 1 mislynch (generally the day 1 outcome) but not much else out of day one to go on. <br><br>The best thing is to let the game breathe a bit. You can always come and mislynch me later in the day phase if nothing changes. The difference will be that a lot more conversation that isn't focused in on me because I decided to troll and have some fun being dismissive of what I view as a terrible case. Anyone who actually thinks me being standoffish and trolling in response to the standard early day one oversensitivity case is an actual scum tell probably hasn't been playing mafia for long enough. The early day one cases and responses are generally not super useful for discerning alignment. <br><br>That said, even if I were scum, it would <span class=\"noboldsig\">still</span> be better for the town to spend some of day one so that there is content later on to come back to in light of later events and flips and things that help with PoE later on. <br><br>I need to go back to work on fixing dinner now.

I was put off by the exchange I mentioned earlier, but it is probably just banter. It has kind of faded in with so many pages now. I am not sure why he thought I was saying that people shouldn't defend themselves when accused of being scummy. That isn't what I was saying at all, the tone of the exchange felt inorganic. Of course people will defend themselves, town and scum alike. Weird. <br>null<br><br>The Soldier: I like the way he thinks so far, I don't see anything out of line. It feels town motivated, questioning and reassessing. Looking forward to hearing more.<br>lean town<br><br>Keyblade: Not a whole lot of content yet. I like being playful, I think it is a good way to get the game going in a positive direction, as long as not everyone is doing it, and some actual game play appears from him.  So far too early to tell.<br>null<br><br>RandomActs: I like the activity so far. I really appreciate the stance on \"town looking scummy\" on purpose thing. I think there are too many reasons not to act scummy on purpose, except particular situations, like the IC thing that was mentioned. As a rule, there are so many styles of playing that people have adopted, and people find scumminess in different styles. For me it is about motivation and protown vs. antitown play. <br><br>Drixx: I just finished a game with Drixx. I am not quite sure what to think here. He can be condescending and he pissed me off more than once. He explained here he is trying to stop this. I have not seen him get so touchy and defensive though, usually he just has an arrogance about him. So this is a side of Drixx I haven't seen. Usually he is logical and methodical, but sadly, I am not seeing that as much, so far, in this game. He seems much more emotional. I really don't care for the defensiveness, the snarkiness I am used to. I don't see town motivation here.<br>lean scum<br><br>Riabi: So far good effort and content, game theory, questions. I can easily understand his posts and reasoning. I am not seeing anything that makes me pause. I can't say one way or the other though strongly.<br>null<br><br>Terrador:I feel like he has a lot of experience and can weed stuff out quickly. He is quick to say what he sees as a misunderstanding/misrep? #82/#111. Very eager to get into game play, and plenty of activity. I am totally behind the Drixx assessment. Terrador held himself to logic and passed on the emotion, aggressive, but I don't think it is overt. Just means business and getting to it.<br>lean town<br><br>Victor: Hmm. Not getting a warm fuzzy feeling, not that I am looking for it, just not seeing as much real effort put in as much as other players. I know it is early, so I give it time and see what develops.<br>null<br><br>Dragonspawn: Ehhhh... just eww. Question- Do you still think this is Drixx's town game? I am not seeing a whole lot of town motivation here. Just a lot of criticizing. Not much in the way of content. <br>lean scum<br><br>Slandaar:See.. here. He makes 2 posts, one of them I am like \"wtf?\" that's it, then comes in with a spot on post. Something with effort and value. You don't have to post a lot, just make it real. That said, the one post is not enough for me to lean town. Looking forward to more posts, one good one isn't enough to get a read, no matter how much I like it. It's kind of weird, but this is the kind of post I am used to seeing Drixx make.<br><br>Zerediah: So, nothing here. Really. What do you think of the game so far?<br>null<br><br>Lapsa: Why are you accusing people of lying, wtf? Post stye reminds me of Oka. Not enough to lean scum, but hopefully will see something of substance. Could be just weird. <br>null<br><br>Can I get a current vote count? <br><br>Drixx sorry I know we know each other, but really your behavior and tone are off from last game. I intend to vote you.<br><br>So there have been a bunch of posts, but this list is as of my last post."}

You just jumped up my scumspect list.</div></blockquote><br>First off, I agree, lapsa being a town read is weird. Care to explain that Slandaar?<br><br>But, as for why he would want drixx to have a better opinion of him, have you not read their exchange? I guess not, so I'll sum it up for you... Slandaar makes a strong case for why Drixx is scum. Drixx then says basically \"The first part of your case is weak, and your logic is so bad that I refuse to read the rest\". It's at this point that slandaar says what he says. Slandaar is trying to get Drixx to engage him, he's trying to get Drixx to answer some accusations. This is what town is supposed to be doing. Not making up bullshit reasons for scumreads like you are."}

I think it paints a very scummy picture of Drixx, and I would absolutely love to see Drixx actually respond to it instead of blowing it off. I don't necessarily think it's a absolute argument. IOW, I don't think that based on that post alone, anyone can be positive that Drixx is scum, but the fact that Drixx has obviously read at least part of it (and thereby it's likely he's read all of it) and is refusing to tackle it head on seems to strengthen the post in my mind.<br><br>I've played with Slandaar before, he's good, he's tough, but he's fair.

I don't think anyone here wants to put you on a rope inside a week--I know I don't.

I understand its value as a metastrategy to make cops and doctors stronger, but I don't see how it's really relevant here.

Furthermore, do you  believe that a Day 1 policy lynch would be appropriate? Or was the implied timetable something else?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Zerediah</span>, I would've gladly given you the benefit of the doubt re: potentially OMGUSing Victor, but you literally copped to voting him for a petty reason. Don't you have anything better to do with your vote? Do you have any other scumreads?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">WRT: dragonspawn vs. VictorDeAngelo</span>: I think this stems from a misunderstanding of Victor's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6797355#p6797355\" class=\"postlink\">#27</a>, to begin with. When Victor says \"Why are we discussing this?\", it's not re: lynching MonkeyMan, as I originally thought; the antecedent is MonkeyMan's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">line of discussion</span>. That said, Victor's points on dragonspawn aren't addressed by dragonspawn very well at all.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@dragonspawn</span>: Now that Victor's vote on MonkeyMan is cleared up:<br>-How would you read Victor now, and why?<br>-What do you think of Keybladewielder's reads post? Does it impact your read of him at all?<br>In addition, I have a couple of questions for you as well.<br>-How is it \"opportunistic\" to be vote #2 on a wagon? Yes, TheSoldier voted Drixx before I did, but he was off the wagon by the time Drixx boarded it.<br>-You say there's on opposition to the Drixx wagon, and that he, ergo, must be town... but that really isn't the case. In my experience, I've been much more willing to defend an actual townie than my scumbuddy in the games I've rolled scum, and I imagine that a similar idea is held by other scum. Further, there is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> opposing the lynch, so that's at least one. Finally, given that Drixx is scum (which is not guaranteed, but I'm using this hypothetical for the sake of argument), his buddies may believe that defending him is fruitless; that he'll either defend himself before it gets late enough in the day for a hammer to be considered, or that he'll dig himself deeper and there will be no saving him.<br><br>---<br><br>Reads list below; scum are on top, townies are below. Note that this list is a rather rough one, and very, very subject to change. These are just my current impressions; Drixx and dragonspawn are firmly on the bottom, Zerediah and MonkeyMan are well above them, but not really townier than anyone else, Lapsa is Lapsa, but the pile from RandomActs to Slandaar is varying degrees of nulltown. In particular, the activity pattern from Kitty, Random, and to a lesser degree Slandaar isn't suspicious in vacuum, but reminds me of activity I've seen more than once from scum. (And if anyone wants to claim that's a weak reason to suspect people, you're right--that's why they're so relatively far away from the scum end of the list.)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">SCUM</span><br>Drixx<br>dragonspawn<br>Zerediah<br>MonkeyMan576<br>Lapsa<br>RandomActs<br>Kitty Galore<br>VictorDeAngelo<br>TheSoldier<br>Slandaar<br>Riabi<br>Keybladewielder<br>Terrador<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TOWN</span><br><br>Given Keybladewielder's vote on Drixx and my hesitance to risk an early Day 1 end, I'm shifting my vote to my second-place scumspect.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: dragonspawn</span>"}

This makes no sense when Townie X is clearly not trying to bait a Townie into anything. The only situation it might apply is where Townie X is actually Scum X. Thus Townie Y ie Drixx should have played completely differently if he were indeed town and believed the question was baited instead of trying to discredit he should have tried to scumhunt, but, Townie Y is not Townie Y, he is scum Y.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6798990#p6798990\" class=\"postlink\">post 101</a>, Terrador wrote:</cite>if you believe I'll spin it, you're right here to combat that?</div></blockquote><br>This is right.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Drixx</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Then to make the case stronger, after it was clear that you at least saw the above post (since you commented on the first part of it), you proceeded to attack Slandaar, Terrador, and myself. When we asked you on several occasions to actually answer the case against you, you continued to dodge and obfuscate. Being trolly isn't scum behavior in and of itself, but, when it's done in the face of pressure, it's hard to see that as anything other than an attempt to side step said pressure."}

Do I need to like use tags to make obvious humor actually obvious to young people or something?), and that if I were town I wouldn't have been hesitant about an obviously loaded question or worried that answering from memory might result in something someone could quote and then point out some other place that contradicts it and invoke LAL on me. <br><br>In a game where Lynch all Liars has already been opportunistically invoked against someone who was obviously trying to joke with a friend. <br><br>Really? <br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"><br><br>What am I supposed to defend myself from exactly? It looked like an obvious loaded question with no possible right answer. I tried to answer what seemed like the underlying motives. T-dog (can I call you T-dog man?) actually posted, presumably with a straight face, that the question was serious and had no hidden motives. How on earth could me saying \"yes I sometimes get misread\" been at all helpful. Is there anyone ever in the history of mafia who doesn't sometimes get misread? Does anyone actually think that question was legit? <br><br>You got my juices flowing and got me all worked up and ready to defend myself against this supposedly \"really solid\" case, and it amounts to \"A townie shouldn't have to worry about looking bad or having something he says manipulated to look like a lie.\" which is so obviously not true as to be painful. <br><br>Total let down. You just lost 10 Drixx points for making me read that on the premise that it was actually something that I could even defend myself from, even if I thought it had enough merit. How do I defend myself from someone's subjective opinion on what a townie should or shouldn't feel about an early question that looks like an obvious trap? I mean ... the \"townies don't need to worry about being misrepresented as liars\" {Paraphrased} premise alone is completely absurd. How do you think townies get mislynched all the time? Because other town are perfectly rational and logical and somehow still build a false case against them? (the majority of mislynches are town driven). <br><br>If you guys really want to lynch me because I'm older and felt like there was zero upside to a specific answer to that question (and already explained such a very long time ago), then erm... more power to you? I'll flip town and maybe a few of you will learn that town really does have a reason to worry about moonlogic cases and badly invoked LAL and all that. <br><br>I'm trying to defend myself with a straight face here but I can't remember anyone ever giving such an on the face absurd \"case\" before that was praised by so many others as a \"good\" or \"solid\" case. At pretty much every point it fails logically. On top of that, Slandaar was either being intentionally ironic or is completely oblivious to humour. I'm not yet certain which. He's got that thug picture that makes me want to take him all serious (Is that \"Omar\" from The Wire?) but then he comes in with really really really bad logic. Let's break it down quote by quote:<br><br>1.) Focuses in on a word. If I had used the near synonym \"form\", which carries almost the same exact meaning as \"make\", would he have noticed? Am I obligated to poll everyone in the thread so I can try and use the correct colloquial speech for where everyone lives? The inevitable consequence of amassing a familiarity with language and the necessary vocabulary is word choice that doesn't seem natural ... because it isn't. Check out the completed newbie game that I played with kitty and see where I unintentionally upset her and talked about what I do for a living and how it sometimes causes problems in mafia. This isn't some on the spot AtE defense on my part. It's just a part of who I am. I can't really help it, much as I would like to. This isn't the first nor will it be the last time that my vocation's impact on my thinking and speaking patterns causes a problem in mafia. <br><br>2.) Says that I should be willing to give subjective answers and just call someone out for nitpicking afterward. In point of fact, that approach simply doesn't work. Third party observers generally either ignore the whole mess or they assume the victim of the nitpicking is scum because all they can say in defense is that the attacker is nitpicking. I've been down that road before, plenty of times. Why do you think I intentionally decided not to go down it this game even though I knew that said decision would call attention to me? <br><br>3.) Calls me terrible again (there's a pattern of him calling me terrible ... and to this point I hadn't directed any sarcasm at Slandaar, so note that he opened up on me first calling me terrible and bad over and over. I didn't know this until now, but if I had read that post before my trolling would have been 10x as harsh). Then says townies should have no reason to worry about someone misrepresenting them for giving an answer to a subjective question which could be twisted to make them look like a liar. This is patently false for reasons I already covered. <br><br>4.) He criticizes me for pointing out that the question was obviously bait, but not using it to scumhunt. When I said that the question was baited, Terrador backed off and acted like he had no ulterior motive and just actually wanted to know what my personal mafia story was like, specifically when it comes to being misread. That's an obvious falsehood on Terrador's part, but that's his response to me calling it out as an obvious bait question. That was me pinging him for a response, and he responded, with a response that seems nearly impossible to believe is true. Bonus points for apparently missing the point that the 2nd part of #104 was completely a joke where I poked a little fun at Terrador. Shouldn't the \"the terrible tunneler\" moniker and the gambling odds have been clear indicators that I wasn't being serious? I get that it was a little dry as far as humour goes ... but really?<br><br>5.) I then get mocked for making a post where I quote myself giving fairly lengthy and semi-serious responses trying to give Terrador the benefit of the doubt and provide him with information that seemed relevant to the probable town motives that would result in the question Terrador asked. {If he is town and the question was sincere, then Terrador wanted some context to help him read me accurately.}<br><br>6.) See #2. Trying to defend against a misrep is ridiculously hard. A site rule prevents me from elaborating upon this in the way that I would like. Instead I'll elaborate in this way: On my first game on site I was able to misrepresent a really good town player as scum so successfully that it resulted in an easy scum win and the people who played that game with me being unable to trust me afterward. There was a discernible ripple effect from my use of the strategy. Having employed it to fantastic effect, I'm obviously quite aware of how impossible it is to defend against. Lots of people on site have identified this particular avenue of attack as quite effective. I even noted that it was sort of in play against me right now when I made the 3rd person post with me \"singing\" the \"Everything you do is scummy...\" line. Some people call it the \"regardless card\". It's basically a manipulation of the confirmation bias effect by scum. <br><br>So there you go ... some exasperation with a point by point serious evaluation of said case."}

But, for me, it's less about the case Slandaar made against you and more about how you reacted to it. Anytime a player starts lashing out at other players when the pressure is on them, it's immediately suspicious. Had you come out with that point by point that you made right after Slandaar's post, I would have moved on to my next in line, no question. For me, the reason to put pressure on people D1 is to see how they react to it because, as stated above, we don't often have a lot to go on. Typically, a townie is not going to get defensive when face with pressure, desperate maybe, but not defensive. So, at this point, if you want me to change my vote, you need to make a strong case that someone else is scummier than you, or someone needs to behave scummier than you.<br><br><br>P-edit x 2<br><blockquote><div><cite>MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>I didn't say it was a \"scumtell\" per se, but it makes me suspicious if I know you're holding back things that you are thinking.</div></blockquote><br>I don't like this at all.

Didn't ping me much at the time. Looking back over Zerediah's posts now, I'm feeling a tad suspicious, but prodding a lurker early into Day 1 isn't exactly an antitown use of one's vote.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Lapsa</span>: I think it's obvious that you're trying to demonstrate that you are active lurking and paying attention to the game; further, I suspect your lies to Monkeyman and Riabi were reaction tests; I fail to see reasonable scum reward vs. risk for that at the surface level. I would still love to see content from you eventually, but I've yet to pull a scumread from your play. That said, I would love to see an explanation for your Zerediah vote.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Monkeyman</span>: Why do you feel that Lynch All Liars is something that should be relevant here? I understand its value as a metastrategy to make cops and doctors stronger, but I don't see how it's really relevant here. If Lapsa's been playing like this successfully for a long time, we're not going to pressure him into playing seriously this way. Furthermore, do you  believe that a Day 1 policy lynch would be appropriate? Or was the implied timetable something else?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Zerediah</span>, I would've gladly given you the benefit of the doubt re: potentially OMGUSing Victor, but you literally copped to voting him for a petty reason. Don't you have anything better to do with your vote? Do you have any other scumreads?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">WRT: dragonspawn vs. VictorDeAngelo</span>: I think this stems from a misunderstanding of Victor's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6797355#p6797355\" class=\"postlink\">#27</a>, to begin with. When Victor says \"Why are we discussing this?\", it's not re: lynching MonkeyMan, as I originally thought; the antecedent is MonkeyMan's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">line of discussion</span>. That said, Victor's points on dragonspawn aren't addressed by dragonspawn very well at all.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@dragonspawn</span>: Now that Victor's vote on MonkeyMan is cleared up:<br>-How would you read Victor now, and why?<br>-What do you think of Keybladewielder's reads post? Does it impact your read of him at all?<br>In addition, I have a couple of questions for you as well.<br>-How is it \"opportunistic\" to be vote #2 on a wagon? Yes, TheSoldier voted Drixx before I did, but he was off the wagon by the time Drixx boarded it.<br>-You say there's on opposition to the Drixx wagon, and that he, ergo, must be town... but that really isn't the case. In my experience, I've been much more willing to defend an actual townie than my scumbuddy in the games I've rolled scum, and I imagine that a similar idea is held by other scum. Further, there is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> opposing the lynch, so that's at least one. Finally, given that Drixx is scum (which is not guaranteed, but I'm using this hypothetical for the sake of argument), his buddies may believe that defending him is fruitless; that he'll either defend himself before it gets late enough in the day for a hammer to be considered, or that he'll dig himself deeper and there will be no saving him.<br><br>---<br><br>Reads list below; scum are on top, townies are below. Note that this list is a rather rough one, and very, very subject to change. These are just my current impressions; Drixx and dragonspawn are firmly on the bottom, Zerediah and MonkeyMan are well above them, but not really townier than anyone else, Lapsa is Lapsa, but the pile from RandomActs to Slandaar is varying degrees of nulltown. In particular, the activity pattern from Kitty, Random, and to a lesser degree Slandaar isn't suspicious in vacuum, but reminds me of activity I've seen more than once from scum. (And if anyone wants to claim that's a weak reason to suspect people, you're right--that's why they're so relatively far away from the scum end of the list.)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">SCUM</span><br>Drixx<br>dragonspawn<br>Zerediah<br>MonkeyMan576<br>Lapsa<br>RandomActs<br>Kitty Galore<br>VictorDeAngelo<br>TheSoldier<br>Slandaar<br>Riabi<br>Keybladewielder<br>Terrador<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TOWN</span><br><br>Given Keybladewielder's vote on Drixx and my hesitance to risk an early Day 1 end, I'm shifting my vote to my second-place scumspect.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: dragonspawn</span></div></blockquote></span><br><br>This is a solid post with solid reasoning.

Do I need to like use tags to make obvious humor actually obvious to young people or something?), and that if I were town I wouldn't have been hesitant about an obviously loaded question or worried that answering from memory might result in something someone could quote and then point out some other place that contradicts it and invoke LAL on me. <br><br>In a game where Lynch all Liars has already been opportunistically invoked against someone who was obviously trying to joke with a friend. <br><br>Really? <br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"><br><br>What am I supposed to defend myself from exactly? It looked like an obvious loaded question with no possible right answer. I tried to answer what seemed like the underlying motives. T-dog (can I call you T-dog man?) actually posted, presumably with a straight face, that the question was serious and had no hidden motives. How on earth could me saying \"yes I sometimes get misread\" been at all helpful. Is there anyone ever in the history of mafia who doesn't sometimes get misread? Does anyone actually think that question was legit? <br><br>You got my juices flowing and got me all worked up and ready to defend myself against this supposedly \"really solid\" case, and it amounts to \"A townie shouldn't have to worry about looking bad or having something he says manipulated to look like a lie.\" which is so obviously not true as to be painful. <br><br>Total let down. You just lost 10 Drixx points for making me read that on the premise that it was actually something that I could even defend myself from, even if I thought it had enough merit. How do I defend myself from someone's subjective opinion on what a townie should or shouldn't feel about an early question that looks like an obvious trap? I mean ... the \"townies don't need to worry about being misrepresented as liars\" {Paraphrased} premise alone is completely absurd. How do you think townies get mislynched all the time? Because other town are perfectly rational and logical and somehow still build a false case against them? (the majority of mislynches are town driven). <br><br>If you guys really want to lynch me because I'm older and felt like there was zero upside to a specific answer to that question (and already explained such a very long time ago), then erm... more power to you? I'll flip town and maybe a few of you will learn that town really does have a reason to worry about moonlogic cases and badly invoked LAL and all that. <br><br>I'm trying to defend myself with a straight face here but I can't remember anyone ever giving such an on the face absurd \"case\" before that was praised by so many others as a \"good\" or \"solid\" case. At pretty much every point it fails logically. On top of that, Slandaar was either being intentionally ironic or is completely oblivious to humour. I'm not yet certain which. He's got that thug picture that makes me want to take him all serious (Is that \"Omar\" from The Wire?) but then he comes in with really really really bad logic. Let's break it down quote by quote:<br><br>1.) Focuses in on a word. If I had used the near synonym \"form\", which carries almost the same exact meaning as \"make\", would he have noticed? Am I obligated to poll everyone in the thread so I can try and use the correct colloquial speech for where everyone lives? The inevitable consequence of amassing a familiarity with language and the necessary vocabulary is word choice that doesn't seem natural ... because it isn't. Check out the completed newbie game that I played with kitty and see where I unintentionally upset her and talked about what I do for a living and how it sometimes causes problems in mafia. This isn't some on the spot AtE defense on my part. It's just a part of who I am. I can't really help it, much as I would like to. This isn't the first nor will it be the last time that my vocation's impact on my thinking and speaking patterns causes a problem in mafia. <br><br>2.) Says that I should be willing to give subjective answers and just call someone out for nitpicking afterward. In point of fact, that approach simply doesn't work. Third party observers generally either ignore the whole mess or they assume the victim of the nitpicking is scum because all they can say in defense is that the attacker is nitpicking. I've been down that road before, plenty of times. Why do you think I intentionally decided not to go down it this game even though I knew that said decision would call attention to me? <br><br>3.) Calls me terrible again (there's a pattern of him calling me terrible ... and to this point I hadn't directed any sarcasm at Slandaar, so note that he opened up on me first calling me terrible and bad over and over. I didn't know this until now, but if I had read that post before my trolling would have been 10x as harsh). Then says townies should have no reason to worry about someone misrepresenting them for giving an answer to a subjective question which could be twisted to make them look like a liar. This is patently false for reasons I already covered. <br><br>4.) He criticizes me for pointing out that the question was obviously bait, but not using it to scumhunt. When I said that the question was baited, Terrador backed off and acted like he had no ulterior motive and just actually wanted to know what my personal mafia story was like, specifically when it comes to being misread. That's an obvious falsehood on Terrador's part, but that's his response to me calling it out as an obvious bait question. That was me pinging him for a response, and he responded, with a response that seems nearly impossible to believe is true. Bonus points for apparently missing the point that the 2nd part of #104 was completely a joke where I poked a little fun at Terrador. Shouldn't the \"the terrible tunneler\" moniker and the gambling odds have been clear indicators that I wasn't being serious? I get that it was a little dry as far as humour goes ... but really?<br><br>5.) I then get mocked for making a post where I quote myself giving fairly lengthy and semi-serious responses trying to give Terrador the benefit of the doubt and provide him with information that seemed relevant to the probable town motives that would result in the question Terrador asked. {If he is town and the question was sincere, then Terrador wanted some context to help him read me accurately.}<br><br>6.) See #2. Trying to defend against a misrep is ridiculously hard. A site rule prevents me from elaborating upon this in the way that I would like. Instead I'll elaborate in this way: On my first game on site I was able to misrepresent a really good town player as scum so successfully that it resulted in an easy scum win and the people who played that game with me being unable to trust me afterward. There was a discernible ripple effect from my use of the strategy. Having employed it to fantastic effect, I'm obviously quite aware of how impossible it is to defend against. Lots of people on site have identified this particular avenue of attack as quite effective. I even noted that it was sort of in play against me right now when I made the 3rd person post with me \"singing\" the \"Everything you do is scummy...\" line. Some people call it the \"regardless card\". It's basically a manipulation of the confirmation bias effect by scum. <br><br>So there you go ... some exasperation with a point by point serious evaluation of said case.</div></blockquote></span><br><br>OK, my eyes kind of glazed over while reading this one. I will give you one small point, yes, we need to be aware of how things sound and can be twisted by scum, but that isn't part of the case against you. As town, you should be willing to answer questions, even if they are ridiculous to you. Your dismissiveness is not town motivated. If you are town using this game to try out different methods and styles, then I am pissed that you are putting us at such a disadvantage for your own experiment. From what I know of you, you wouldn't do this as town, which solidifies my read on you even more.<br><br>As an aside, I am learning to use quote tags still, I hope I hid the wall posts correctly, if not, my apologies. And a little quote tag 101 may be in order."}

You need to show me WHY it's a bad wagon. You keep saying it's a bad wagon, but the only real reason I've seen from you for why is that there don't seem to be many other wagons. I've already explained to you how this is possible AND Drixx still be scum. I realize you said there's no evidence for those scenarios, and I agree, that said, without any evidence that they can't be possible, they are still plausible and they pretty much nullify your argument.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6804933#p6804933\" class=\"postlink\">post 307</a>, dragonspawn wrote:</cite>Maybe if he wasn't being put on the defensive so much he could actually provide you with some more pro town posts since you don't seem to think their are any</div></blockquote><br>Being on the defensive doesn't mean you can't also scumhunt. In the course of this game, I've pointed out a lot of strange things I've seen from a lot of players. While my primary focus and primary read right now are Drixx, anyone who's been reading my (admittedly numerous) posts can see that he's not the only one I'm suspicious of. Likewise, there's nothing from stopping him from defending himself along side of scumhunting. And no, I've not seen very many pro-town posts from him, but feel free to link any you think are pro-town. I'm willing to change my vote in light of a better case, but right now, I don't see any."}

If he were scum, he could have easily just not posted that and pretended to be convinced by kitty or something; closing off that option for fleeting towncred just feels like a weak play. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Riabi</span>: His tone feels correct (read: gutread), and I like that he's focusing on more that just the Drixx wagon. I'd be surprised if he flipped scum atm, but he's my weakest townread.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar</span>: His first post was meh, but everything since then has been solid throughout. I also find myself agreeing with his reads. His posts have mostly been about Drixx though, so I'd love to hear about his opinions of others. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NULL/MIXED</span>:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Riabi</span>: I really don't know what it is, since I like most of his posts, but there's something I can't place that makes me unsure about his towniness. Need to examine closer when I'm not tired.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">RandomActs</span>: Hasn't left much of a presence on the game thus far. Need more material.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zerediah</span>: Similar to Random, although worse first impression for voting a 'lurker' within the first 24 hours of the game.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">VictorDeAngelo</span>: More material needed.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Keybladewielder</span>: Ehh, lots of fluff, but that's normal for them it seems. I'll be looking closer D2. Reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6801840#p6801840\">183</a> aren't awesome but seem natural.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">SCUM</span></span></span>:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MonkeyMan</span>: I didn't have any bad feelings about him early on, but now he worries me a bit. He's been around enough to make short posts about himself, but only weighs in on the Drixx wagon very recently, despite this being the issue 90% of the thread has been about. Opportunistic scum is a real possibility.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Drixx</span>: Read the earlier part of the post... or really, most of the thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: yellow\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">FROM OUTER SPACE</span></span></span>:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lapsa</span>: From what I gather, nothing we do is going to change the way he does D1s. He apparently does start doing comprehensible things from D2 onwards though, so I propose that we give him a chance to get there. I just don't have it in my heart to policy lynch someone D1; if he doesn't shape up D2 though, he's definitely at the lynch table.<br><br>Watched waaaay too much soccer today, and now it's 1:00 AM.

That's all fine and dandy, but I have a couple of sub-questions here:<br>-You say Drixx is an asset to town in #325--what has he done to assist the town in any way thus far?<br>-Can you actually deconstruct the case on Drixx in any meaningful way, or is the meta of having a large wagon early all that you can cite to suggest he's town? As TheSoldier points out in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6805577#p6805577\" class=\"postlink\">#330</a>, there are plenty of other reasonable meta examples. Personally, as scum, I would gladly sheep this wagon on my buddy to establish towncred while focusing my posting energies on other \"scumreads\". If he defended himself adequately, I'd bounce off.<br>-I have a fundamental disagreement with the sentiment expressed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6807656#p6807656\" class=\"postlink\">#337</a>; scumhunting is not about detail-hunting. It's about reading intent. Scum can establish all the towncred in the world, but that's worthless if they're so town that they're causing unnecessary scum lynches, or conspicuous for not being NK'd as \"obvtown\" late into the game. Are you still sure it's about hunting details?<br>-Your suspicion of TheSoldier still feels strange to me. I get that you don't believe Keyblade's explanation of \"I just have an erratic earlygame, it takes the stress off when there's little work to be done anyway\", but why would you say it's so unbelievable that TheSoldier is suspicious for buying it? What of TheSoldier's other posts; where do you see his intent going?<br>-I don't like your Keyblade read, but at very least it looks cogent upon inspection; Keyblade's still got a fair few fluffy posts, has an honestly weak sheep on the Drixx wagon, and has yet to make any really substantial casing happen.<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@TheSoldier</span>'s reads post looks really, really good. Excellent TL;DR on Drixx, his reads feel well-thought-out and natural.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kitty Galore</span> has been generating fantastic content, even if she hasn't had the time to put in particularly much work yet. Eager to see her post more. <br>-@Kitty, how experienced would you say you are in mafia (the game, not playing specifically as the alignment)? How often do you make particularly bold plays (far-out reads, next-level mindgaming the town as scum, etc.)?<br><br>---<br><br>With regards to Drixx, I figure I might as well out what purpose, specifically, those questions for him had. They were meant to serve as a \"clear trap\", as it were; if, not knowing why I wanted the answers, Drixx said \"yeah, I've got a history of early mislynches\", or anything remotely to that effect, I would understand his defensiveness in calling one vote + one FoS a wagon. I know the fear of a mislynch all too well, but his responses have just been next-level defensive. It's too late to get into it again, it's well-trodden ground.<br><br>---<br><br>Christ, this took too long. Expect at least a cursory post within twelve hours. Night, all."}

I don't believe anyone is that bad. <br><br>After work today I'll give a re-read and try to satisfy the \"Scum hunt on command\" thing that's going on. I'm generally a little reserved and I generally need some actual info to work with. Coming up on 400 posts, there should be something to see on a re-read. I unfortunately dominated a lot of the talk, so hopefully that wasn't too much of an easy smokescreen for the scum. I'm operating on the assumption that I'm going to end up being the lynch today no matter what, so I ought to at least provide the town with my best thoughts, even though day one is way more valuable later on with flips and other info. Once my flip confirms me as honest, then at least my thoughts will be trusted as well meaning, if not necessarily spot on. Day one is always the hardest. Read my favorite moment in my GTKAS post and you'll understand lol."}

Somebody didn't have enough evidence? One person gives good argument on how other person voting for him didn't have enough evidence. Others agree, in return, two mislynches in a row. Since I've only played one game, I gain my information solely from that, and I only think thats how a game works. But you say otherwise. Maybe it is because it is a newbie game, and people are inexperienced, and things happen differently once you're outside the Road of Rome. That's why I want to kind of coast and see how a game plays out, because I've never lived to see a mid-game and late game. Now I understand it is kind of scummy, and I'll try to put in some vital tells on D1 to the best of my abilities."}

That way I feel like I'm not missing something that might not jump out at me. Basically an occasional read list. This way I can keep track of what I'm getting off of people and try to reassess. I have been known to hold a read and then start confirmation bias, so I really want to improve that part of my game and look with fresh eyes at everyone. As the days progress and there are lynches/nk's of course there is a lot more to go on. But day one activity is so important IMO.<br><br>@Terrador:\"-@Kitty, how experienced would you say you are in mafia (the game, not playing specifically as the alignment)? How often do you make particularly bold plays (far-out reads, next-level mindgaming the town as scum, etc.)?\"<br><br>My first experiences with mafia are on a social forum I belong to, I started playing last December. I am a big fan of Survivor and that's how it was explained to me. The games are written by forum members, usually themed, ungagged, with 12 hour phases. Very, very bastard games. I enjoyed them enough that I wanted to take it more seriously and found this site. I adore this site, although a two week day one was very hard to adjust to. I have played as both alignments on that site, and with a lot of newbs, characters, and luck I have been able to pull out more scum sided victories. They don't play day 1. Not much talking and rarely lynch. I am trying to change that though.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> It isn't a very serious game over there, just fun.<br><br>My experience here at mafiascum is 2 games in the newbie queue that I linked to earlier. My very first game I had no idea what to do, how to actually play on this site. I asked an etiquette question. Nachomamma8 replaced in as scum and ran with it, I fought hard and emotionally and when pieguyn replaced in saw that nacho was out of line... it was quite messy there, actually. It is a long story but a really good game. I was the doctor, although scum got their night action in late, I chose their target correctly by noodling it out. I am proud of that for my first game here. I ended up making it to the end as a power role, and town won. In that game I put my vote on scum and never looked back, it didn't work out for me so well in my next game. My second game was the one I just finished, day one was 39 pages! I hung onto my reads, way too hard though (as I mentioned above). They were terrible. I never had scum pegged. Scum was lynched back to back in spite of me. <br><br>I haven't made any far out reads in my opinion. I could not figure out last game why no one saw what I saw, I realize now, if I am the odd one out, I need to look for what I am missing. I am not exactly sure what you mean by \"next level mindgaming the town as scum\". <br><br>Here are the links if you want to take a look: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=60450\">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=60450</a><!-- l --><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=61189\">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=61189</a><!-- l -->"}

He seems like the enjoyable type. Also, he I ISO\u2019d him and he had already voted four different people. He seems to be joking around every time, and makes an excuse, then votes someone if they oppose him. I think he is trying to find reactions in everybody to see how they will reply. This can be seen as town, but with tons of fluff and constant vote-hopping, he deserves his rank.<br><br>I could make nearly the same argument against you.

Drixx\u2019s wagon play could be seen as forced, as nobody wants to get lynched on D1, while I have plenty of space to give different types of thoughts and not forced to play on the defensive side, even though I generally do.<br><br>But, has he done anything scummy? Not posting a lot is not necessarily scummy behavior. Why put him on your \"SLIGHT SCUM\" list if you haven't seen anything scummy from him?<br><br>TheSoldier didn\u2019t elaborate on his good read. I think he is just a one-shot wonder and expects to be unnoticeable because of one thing he did. But I\u2019ve read through his other posts and they weren\u2019t really helpful.

You really can't point a single finger?<br><br>I only voted for Victor because nobody else is as scum as him. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be keeping my vote. My vote varies based on reads I\u2019ll have in the future. <br><br>If you can't make a determination, why is he your vote? You've said similar things about at least two other players on this list, yet, he's your vote. Why? And why wouldn't he be on your \"SCUM\" list if you think he's the most likely of us to be scum?<br><br>Victor opposes everybody. I think misdirects the game more than what keybladewielder. Opposition is one\u2019s own choice, and keybladewielder\u2019s fluff seems more friendly (literally) than opposition. Basically, keybladewielder is like bunny, and Victor is a steroid rabbit."}

It seems like he is thinking critically and sharing his thoughts in a natural way. It feels like he is working and my feeling is that it is coming from a town mindset. He is invested in the game and is genuinely trying to understand if something is bewildering, asking for clarity is a good sign IMO."}

Eh. I haven't posted as much as I'd have liked to, but I wouldn't say I'm coasting. A few questions for you:<br><br>-You say Slandaar has made some very good posts and very bad posts. Could you give some examples of each?<br>-If Keyblade is \"slight scum\" for misdirecting the game, why isn't Lapsa there too?<br>-You said I didn't elaborate on my reads. I'm a little confused about this, since I thought I gave pretty detailed explanations. Anything you want clarified?<br>-Not a question but content is good, keep posting it so we can read you.<br><br>@Terrador: Regarding RandomActs, I think his response was townie. I don't think hypothetical scum Random would stick his neck out to post that at risk of an accusation of rolefishing. It is normally indicative for scum mindsets to be actively looking for crumbs during the day, but this wouldn't have been a crumb so much as an entire loaf and actually pointing it out in the thread would be stupid.<br><br>You can't see any possibility of antitown intent in outing a possible mason, though? Wanna run that by me again?<br><br>Regarding Dragonspawn, we have some clashing reads on him. I actually think he's town (reasoning is in my readspost). Talk to me on this. Same goes to everyone else currently voting him, I want to understand the arguments here.<br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br>Deadline is approximately halfway through. We should really start coming together before time runs short, so we have a decent amount of time to react to L-1 claims and/or possibly switch wagons. <br><br>Everyone should say who they're willing to lynch at this point and explain their vote, especially if they haven't before. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">People we definitely shouldn't lynch today:</span><br>-Terrador, Kitty: Obvtown, and I don't think I'm alone in thinking that.<br>-Lapsa, Victor, Random, Keyblade: They haven't posted much real material, and have no associative tells to go along with them. They'd be a crapshoot today, and even if they are scum their flip would be less useful than any other potential scumteam member.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">People I don't want us to lynch today:</span><br>-Me: Duh.<br>-Slandaar, Riabi: I think their posts are really sound and I haven't seen anything suspicious from them today.<br>-Dragonspawn: Drixx flipping scum may incriminate him, but Dragon flipping scum wouldn't necessarily incriminate Drixx. I'd rather people go for Drixx today for that reason, not to mention that I'm not to clear on the reasons for his wagon existing.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">People I wouldn't cry about if we lynched them:</span> (aka who I'd compromise on)<br>-Zerediah: He's starting to do things, but some of his logic is a bit odd; also, he's given stances on everyone in the game at this point, so his lynch would have more info than other low-material players.<br>-MonkeyMan: My read on him is still in turmoil; my gut doesn't like the way he jumped on the Drixx wagon, but he's been fine other than that. Not too proactive, but he's consistent. If nobody wants to vote Drixx or Zerediah, I'd vote him to avoid a nolynch but otherwise no.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">People I want to lynch:</span><br>-Drixx: His emotional responses feel more like caught scum than frustrated town, and he's made no effort to find scum himself. He has plenty of posts, but most of them are saying his wagon sucks while not wanting to address the points, and the rest are seemingly resigning himself to being lynched. Regardless of his flip, we'll get tons of info from it - more than any other player I think, since everyone in the thread has taken a stance on Drixx at this point. Also, if we don't lynch him, he'll be a huge question mark for the entire game and I think it's best to get rid of those sooner than later."}

Could you give some examples please?<br><br>Me:While you and Monkeyman started convos during the RVS, keybladewielder intended to keep the RVS going since it was \u201cfun\u201d. He seems like the enjoyable type. Also, he I ISO\u2019d him and he had already voted four different people. He seems to be joking around every time, and makes an excuse, then votes someone if they oppose him. I think he is trying to find reactions in everybody to see how they will reply.

Does this mean you'd put yourself in the \"SLIGHT SCUM\" category?<br><br>Me: Drixx is playing defensively while on a wagon, which can be seen as not his style of play, while my style of play could be generally what I play like. Drixx\u2019s wagon play could be seen as forced, as nobody wants to get lynched on D1, while I have plenty of space to give different types of thoughts and not forced to play on the defensive side, even though I generally do.<br><br>Riabi:But, has he done anything scummy? Not posting a lot is not necessarily scummy behavior. Why put him on your \"SLIGHT SCUM\" list if you haven't seen anything scummy from him?<br><br>Me:TheSoldier didn\u2019t elaborate on his good read. I think he is just a one-shot wonder and expects to be unnoticeable because of one thing he did. But I\u2019ve read through his other posts and they weren\u2019t really helpful. If he elaborated on his post, scum people specifically, he has the potential to be NEUTRAL or SLIGHT TOWN.<br><br>Riabi:You can't put a single person as your most likely scum target in this list? You really can't point a single finger?<br><br>Me: I only voted for Victor because nobody else is as scum as him. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be keeping my vote. My vote varies based on reads I\u2019ll have in the future.<br><br>Riabi:If you can't make a determination, why is he your vote? You've said similar things about at least two other players on this list, yet, he's your vote. Why? And why wouldn't he be on your \"SCUM\" list if you think he's the most likely of us to be scum?<br><br>Me: Victor opposes everybody. I think misdirects the game more than what keybladewielder. Opposition is one\u2019s own choice, and keybladewielder\u2019s fluff seems more friendly (literally) than opposition. Basically, keybladewielder is like bunny, and Victor is a steroid rabbit."}

If I could scrub the thread of all the posts I made pointing out scummy things, I would ... because it's day one and anyone who has any reads that are stronger than \"light town/light scum\" doesn't know what they're doing. {Obvious exception being when there's an actual scum slip}. <br><br>Want a reads list?

I don't see Victor vs. dragonspawn as a scumfight, so that could give some associative reads; further, Victor's tone is vitriolic to the point of illogical. Who gets that mad if they don't have a guilty conscience? Finally, Zerediah doesn't sit right with me, but sadly I don't have the time to dig in on him yet.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Best Lynch: Drixx</span></span><br><br>I don't feel the need to elaborate anymore.

Not me anyway. He's weird, very weird, but, in my limited experience, he gets less weird on D2, so, I'm kinda giving him a pass for D1 since I have NO CLUE what to make of him (and I suspect that's how he wants it).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Drixx wrote:</cite>It's just plain false to suggest that I haven't actually paid attention and called attention to things though. There are plenty of interesting things that have gone on beside me today.</div></blockquote><br>Ok, lets do it this way then. Do you have people you suspect? You've sort of implied that you suspect I might be scum based on my pressure on you, and that's fair. But, do you have other people you suspect would be scum? If so, could you please spell it out for us? This is a serious question. If the wagon is pointed in the wrong direction, point to where you think it should go.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kitty Galore wrote:</cite>This Drixx is a little like the Drixx from my last game. At least it isn't AS snarky and dismissive. Mostly, so far what I have seen amounts to \"you guys are dumb and not worth my intellect\" to \"how rude!  I'm taking my ball and going home!\" I'm not saying he said this, the tone and intent is what I'm hearing. I'm torn. I think the fast wagon is bad and something to consider, but Drixx, your reaction to it was worse. That is why people aren't letting go. The thing that bothers me is that you KNOW how to properly respond. Is your bruised ego at the bottom of this? You want us to grovel and beg you to put in some fucking effort? Then when people don't think they should have to do the work you keep giving us a hard time? Ugh.</div></blockquote><br>I agree his tone has changed a bit recently, though like I said, I really doubt there's anything he can do to change my mind, But, yeah, I'd really like to hear more of his thoughts about this game in case we're wrong. And to be honest, I am also a bit concerned that it was a fast wagon that doesn't have a lot of resistance. But, like you said, the way he handled it was bad bad bad. And it's hard to say that any other player is more scummy right now. So, while discussion is good, I'm not sure how this wagon gets moved.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Drixx wrote:</cite>I just don't see why I should do a bunch of work just to get lynched anyway when I can't even get people to set aside the tunnel and re-evaluate is all Kitty. There's a lesson for everyone in this, including me. Quite a lot of players on this site are very successful with the whole dismissive sarcasm thing. Obviously it doesn't work for me.</div></blockquote><br>To me, this comes down to the win condition again. If you're town, why wouldn't you want to help out town? But, when you say things like this, it seems like you're saying \"well, I'm obviously getting lynched, and once I flip scum, nothing I say will be taken seriously anyway, so why bother?\"<br><br>But, if you really are town, suddenly every accusation you have, every FOS carries a lot more weight (to me anyway, probably others) when you flip town.<br><br>P-Edit @Terrador, That's a pretty good list there. I think I pretty much agree with you."}

Meanwhile, I reread some of Drixx's posts while trying not to have any bias, and I can see him being town resigned to his fate.

I will say I am not sure where I am on the OMGUS conversation. I think I understand where he was coming from, and it wasn't nefarious IMO. He called Drixx out for being OMGUS-y earlier in the game too. Post 277. This may not be a popular opinion, but I am not seeing outright scumminess here. I like that he is being questioned, and it seems he has gone quiet, but that could be RL. So not indicative. I am pretty on the fence with him still. Null. <br><br>TheSoldier-Love, love, love his posts. I like how he is open, investigating and giving his opinions on topics in the thread, very pro town IMO. I like how he looks at things his own way, and not afraid to share an unpopular opinion. Has me rethinking my Monkeyman read. Lean Town<br><br>KeyBlade-I don't know, I would think I would have a feel one way or the other by now. I am not seeing a lot of work. Looking forward to more participation from him. lean slightly scum<br><br>Random- Feels sincere and town motivated. I am nodding my head in agreement reading his posts, I don't see anything that pings me, or makes me question him. I would like to hear what his thoughts are on Monkeyman's play as a whole. Lean Town<br><br>Drixx-Skimmed over the posts so far.. my eyes glaze over with the crap posted here. I see where he was coming from early, but when pushed to answer a question the reaction was terrible. For way too long. I still don't see town motivation here. I see a lot of selfish play. I don't remember Drixx being this way under pressure in the other game we played. He has said he is trying different methods, this is unsuccessful. I still Lean scum.<br><br>Riabi- A ton of effort, pushing, scum hunting, looking in many directions and questioning and following up. Voting. lean town<br><br>Terrador- I feel the same as before, not pushing quite as hard and voting as much as Riabi, but still working and scumhunting. Giving good information for town to consider re:WIFOM and association. lean town<br><br>Victor- I don't like a lot of his posts. Or his activity, though I guess the latter is not alignment indicative. Not on it's own, but together? I think some of his responses are way over reactions . I don't know if this is how he usually is. I need to do some research here. lean slightly scum<br><br>dragonspawn- I like his posting style, I don't agree with most of his assessments though. I don't see how he can be town reading an uncooperative Drixx who isn't acting in the best interest of town. Well, I guess, I can. Just from playing with Drixx before myself, I see how out of character it is. I have to ask though, is this going against the grain indicative of town here? I like it that he has conviction. I would like others opinions on this. His last post bothers me though, I don't believe he is correct. lean scum<br><br>Slandaar-I like Slandaars no nonsense and probing tactics, he doesn't feed us his thoughts, his posts are thoughtful and make us think. I see play as town motivated. lean town<br><br>Zerediah- is playing now, finally getting some content here. I kind of feel like I need some more to go on, kind of late in the game. He said he is stronger day 2. Hopefully from here out. I get the shy noob feel. null<br><br>Lapsa- I just don't know. null<br><br>p-edit-Need to look more closely at Monkeyman, I see some points made. Nice to see Victor not so angry and upset."}

Interesting, given that he doesn't talk about him. This doesn't really conform to what I would expect of a scumfight, nor a townie's treatment of a scummy person. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">On the off chance that my read on this is right, not such hopeful PoE (re: that interaction) for MonkeyMan here, eh?</span><br><br>Of Lapsa, he says that he generally wouldn't like to lynch him Day 1 without a better target--yet, as early as <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6800999#p6800999\" class=\"postlink\">#171</a>, he says he would be down with a Lapsa lynch. I don't know about y'all, but I'm generally of the belief that being inconsistent with how they approach game theory (this holds more for established/experienced players; I don't consider it nearly as telling for folks getting into game/site meta) hints at scum intent. His <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6803893#p6803893\" class=\"postlink\">#244</a> corroborates the idea that he would be cool with a Day 1 Lapsa lynch, what with my lack of response to me asking if there's a different implied timetable.

Further, his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6826942#p6826942\" class=\"postlink\">#596</a> is jumping the gun a bit. After saying the scumteam is trying to lynch you, immediately after his vote on you, I'd say it's an entirely reasonable interpretation to consider that a scumread.

Drixx himself said he <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6819591#p6819591\" class=\"postlink\">expected to be lynched Day 1 from roughly the 36 hour mark</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6804240#p6804240\" class=\"postlink\">MonkeyMan's limp onto the wagon is not exactly a pro post</a>. Certainly under the (already not exceptionally town) bar he's been setting. Looking at this interaction doesn't at all make me flinch when considering the prospect of a MonkeyMan x Drixx scum component; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I wouldn't put it past Drixx to mad-dog MonkeyMan on the hope that Monkey will be read as more town after such a violent attack by the first scumflip.</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">In summary: MonkeyMan, in addition to generally not having strong content, backhandedly implies a player is scummy without even the slightest sort of case on him, is inconsistent with how he approaches the game's meta, undermines the credibility of his attackers more than he addresses their arguments, and has interactions with my/our top scumread that I hold to be consistent with scum distancing.</span> I still think Drixx is our best lynch today, but after this look, I would gladly consider MonkeyMan to the firm runner-up.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@MonkeyMan</span>, please address the following.<br>1) Please concretely submit a read on VictorDeAngelo for us.<br>2) Did you know that Zerediah was a second-time player (first-time outside Newbieville, USA) upon entering this game?<br>3) You've been engaging with very few players. Does anyone seem solidly town to you? Why?<br><br>---<br><br>I read Zerediah's ISO, and I don't really have the energy to comment on it. It actually looked... a fair bit more town than I suspected? In no small part because I'm not sure a MonkeyMan-Zerediah scumteam is in this game. More on that come morning.<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@dragonspawn</span>: I remain adamant on the (to date, implicit) point I've made that content before Drixx flips will do much more for town and for your credibility than content after the flip. If you don't have the energy for a full wall, I understand; however, a paragraph or two of pressure and/or case on Keyblade, as well as potentially on secondary scumreads, would be grand. Plus, if you can see any posts Drixx made that you really, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> can't see scum making, kindly point those bad boys out. Additionally, if Drixx is town, how would you determine the alignment on folks on his wagon?<br><br>PEDIT: On dragonspawn, to boot: I'm not feeling half so strong on scum!dragonspawn at this point, in no small part to Victor's cut giving me a reason to look at that call-out on Random again. His play isn't fantastically strong, but I think I'm starting to smell town intent. In light of #608 (the only link in Victor's post above), I'm starting to see a pattern (if a small one, it is Day 1) of \"voice of reason with weak play\"--reminds me of town!myself, frankly. Again, I really, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> want him to get better and give us some content, or at least some more conversation, to work with.<br><br>---<br><br>Night all. Apologies for the lack of posting recently; if anyone wants more content, I am always glad to receive questions, requests for reads, etc. Specific work to do in-game makes it more interesting for me to post and generates interactions for us all!"}

Like ... there's no chance that I'm not getting lynched today, no matter what I post. I'm only doing it to try and leave something good in the game. Day one reads are super difficult to get correct because there's literally no context for anything. Nobody has died, nobody is confirmed, nothing is more than speculation. I'm doing my best to make a post that you guys will actually read and that might actually prove helpful. <br><br>If you'd rather just kill me and see me flip and figure out the ramifications for yourselves, go ahead. I'm a Vanilla Townie and there's no way I'm going to ever draw a night kill after this day. My only possible utility would be somehow changing people's minds and successfully finding scum (MonkeyMan, Kitty and Lapsa are the three likeliest scum at the moment, in my opinion). The downside to me staying alive is gigantic. I'm easy lynchbait and I'll never be killed by scum. The worst possible scenario would be me doing too good a job and somehow staying alive today but remaining suspected all game and ending up in LYLO. <br><br>The best move for the town, for a ton of good reasons, is for me to be lynched today. Since we have time, I'm using it to try and leave what good I can. I'll give you cliff notes on what the conclusion will be ... although I've got thoughts about everyone in the game. I'm debating what to say about some people just because I know I'm town and I don't want to hurt the town by calling attention to strong town players or possible PRs or anything like that by mistake. I'm sure you can understand why I don't want to make the post lightly and without making sure I don't do more damage than good. I'm far more likely to accidentally out a PR on day one than I am to successfully find more than maybe one scum. <br><br>MonkeyMay - Super obvious scum. He's obviously watching the game way more than he's posting. He doesn't really engage much with the game. There's almost nothing from him that's original. He super overreacted to the post where I gave some basic thoughts and said I'd make a more thorough post. Before that, I just had a bad feeling about him. His reaction to that and the reactions since have made him my top scum read. Look at how quickly he shows up to address what threatens him, and then he just disappears again. He appears to be very actively lurking. <br><br>Kitty - She has a tendency to start with reads and then find reasons to justify them. She doesn't change reads pretty much at all. She white knighted MonkeyMan to some extent. This is an associative read partially, but also a critique of her reads process which appears to be starting with gut reads and then trying to make the evidence fit. That's simply not a town approach to reads. <br><br>Lapsa - Repeated lies. Trying to appear like some kind of mad prophet or something. Seems to be trying the \"too obviously weird to be scum\" approach. <br><br><br>You guys can decide if you want to wait for me to refine my post, not. It is, after all, day 1 and no matter how much work I put into it, the reality is that I'm not very likely to give much more useful than a much more thorough version of the above reads, and my thoughts about the rest of the players could be more useful to scum than town, if I picked up on something that to them ends up being a clue that X person is a PR. Even if I were the best mafia player ever, and I'm not, I would have a hard time successfully finding scum on this particular day one. <br><br>The basic distillation of my three main scum reads is above, so if you don't care to read a bunch of spoiler tagged evaluation of everyone's posts that will be scrubbed of anything I'm worried could hurt town, then feel free to lynch me and move on. As I said earlier, the best town move, by a mile, is to lynch me and settle my alignment so that toMorrow can be used much more productively."}

Could you give us a case for why you believe Drixx is scum?<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Dragonspawn</span>, I've got a few bones to pick with you.<br>-Do you have any intention of answering my queries directed at you in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6803659#p6803659\" class=\"postlink\">#234</a>?<br>-Several times, most recently in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6805496#p6805496\" class=\"postlink\">#325</a>, you've supported Drixx--here, saying he's town and going to be a mislynch. That's all fine and dandy, but I have a couple of sub-questions here:<br>-You say Drixx is an asset to town in #325--what has he done to assist the town in any way thus far?<br>-Can you actually deconstruct the case on Drixx in any meaningful way, or is the meta of having a large wagon early all that you can cite to suggest he's town? As TheSoldier points out in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6805577#p6805577\" class=\"postlink\">#330</a>, there are plenty of other reasonable meta examples. Personally, as scum, I would gladly sheep this wagon on my buddy to establish towncred while focusing my posting energies on other \"scumreads\". If he defended himself adequately, I'd bounce off.<br>-I have a fundamental disagreement with the sentiment expressed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6807656#p6807656\" class=\"postlink\">#337</a>; scumhunting is not about detail-hunting. It's about reading intent. Scum can establish all the towncred in the world, but that's worthless if they're so town that they're causing unnecessary scum lynches, or conspicuous for not being NK'd as \"obvtown\" late into the game. Are you still sure it's about hunting details?<br>-Your suspicion of TheSoldier still feels strange to me. I get that you don't believe Keyblade's explanation of \"I just have an erratic earlygame, it takes the stress off when there's little work to be done anyway\", but why would you say it's so unbelievable that TheSoldier is suspicious for buying it? What of TheSoldier's other posts; where do you see his intent going?<br>-I don't like your Keyblade read, but at very least it looks cogent upon inspection; Keyblade's still got a fair few fluffy posts, has an honestly weak sheep on the Drixx wagon, and has yet to make any really substantial casing happen.<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@TheSoldier</span>'s reads post looks really, really good. Excellent TL;DR on Drixx, his reads feel well-thought-out and natural.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kitty Galore</span> has been generating fantastic content, even if she hasn't had the time to put in particularly much work yet. Eager to see her post more. <br>-@Kitty, how experienced would you say you are in mafia (the game, not playing specifically as the alignment)? How often do you make particularly bold plays (far-out reads, next-level mindgaming the town as scum, etc.)?<br><br>---<br><br>With regards to Drixx, I figure I might as well out what purpose, specifically, those questions for him had. They were meant to serve as a \"clear trap\", as it were; if, not knowing why I wanted the answers, Drixx said \"yeah, I've got a history of early mislynches\", or anything remotely to that effect, I would understand his defensiveness in calling one vote + one FoS a wagon. I know the fear of a mislynch all too well, but his responses have just been next-level defensive. It's too late to get into it again, it's well-trodden ground.<br><br>---<br><br>Christ, this took too long. Expect at least a cursory post within twelve hours. Night, all.</div></blockquote><br><br>sorry about quoting the entire thing. I was hoping to trim things down to the relevant parts but naturally my internet isn't working so I am using my phone since I don't want to keep this going any longer. You've been very patient while I've been sick and I appreciate this so I'll answer your questions .<br><br>1) I wasn't aware I didn't answer earlier. I may have been before I got sick but I don't remember how I missed it. I will take a look over the earlier post.<br><br>2) I wasn't referencing anything that drixx has done already as being an asset. I was pointing out that he will be an asset in future points in the game from personal experiences I've had with hi..<br><br>3)I'm not looking at the argument against drixx at all. I've been making my determinations based on the overall support for the wagon. Now I suppose if he is scum his partners could be bussing like crazy. Like I've said earlier if the scum and town agree on who to lynch it probably isn't to towns benefit.<br><br>4) I see absolutely wrong with looking at details. Its how I find scum frequently. You find intent in the details5) my suspicion of the soldier was based on the fact that he backed down from good reasoning based on nothing. It had me wondering if he and key were working together and the initial response was just to show suspicion and when key started getting little more pressure. I'm still unsure about him but he has added alot more posts that feel town. I. Not scum reading him more at the moment. But I'll keep my eye on him.<br><br>keys posts still haven't changed my opinion of him. Still seeing alot of fluff. I'm not expecting a key lynch today so my vote won't be returning at this time. But he is someone we should look at tomorrow."}

My vote would have put Drixx at L-2 way to early in the game, as I had explained. I don't tend to move my vote around everyone I'm looking at, or suspecting.  <br><br>That being said, Drixx was very scummy to me early in the day, that has changed some. I said I would look at Monkeyman, and I see the points many have made. There is a lot of scummy play here, it is sneaky. Not just blatant anti town play as I saw Drixx play as being early on. Actually, early on I think Drixx would have voted Drixx, if he saw that play in another. Especially if he was the one who had asked the question. I always said I was concerned that the wagon on Drixx was unopposed, like Dragon said. Although Drixx's play was very different early on, I suspected him of experimenting with his play to our detriment. Which, if there was no other candidate would get my vote. I also mentioned glimmers of the Drixx I know. I have seen them again. <br><br>Which is funny, I wonder if he is trying to tell me something. In our last game, he promised this epic case...worked on it for days. Kept coming up with excuses it wasn't done. He was still working on it. Then he thanks me for making a scum slip and builds weak case on me. Finally admits later, there was no epic case. He was full of shit. And...he was town."}

I said I had an epic case on the IC as a way to draw fire. I actually had a case built up against someone else but our cop investigated him and cleared him in the chaos of the next morning, while the doc correctly reasoned that I would draw fire, and in a super town-sided series of events, that led to a perfect win; there was thus no reason to post the case. There's a difference between using something you're doing to try and test, and just not doing anything at all. If Choof had investigated someone else, I'd have posted my case and probably pursued the guy as he looked totally scummy day one. He was first place on the scum list before he got cleared, making the 2nd place guy the pretty obvious last scum. It took about I dunno ... 5 seconds or so, after thinking about the implications, to conclude who the final scum was. I think the IC knew right away too. You should look at that game again and see how He and I got out of the way and let the newer players find their way to the right answer and earn the win. I suspect it was much more useful to them that way, and considerably more satisfying than if I or the IC had just said \"X is the final scum, grats on the perfect game guys... don't expect another one for awhile.\" or something like that. <br><br>Having a big case in the works against someone but using that fact to draw fire by saying it was against the IC was just a tactic. I wouldn't actually lie (as town) about working on a draft; as a general rule, town should never lie about anything vital, and should only very carefully lie or imply things which are not true otherwise. After the claims, I simply saw no reason to dump a bunch of reasons on the game why a cop cleared player looked scummy. That would not have been helpful or useful and may have actually sidetracked the game if it was too convincing. Remember that not everyone believed the cop and doctor claims. I even pointed out the edge cases where one or the other could be false as a gambit so that people would think about things. I'm still a little sad that that game wasn't actually a heads up scum gambit by Cyrus, as <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> would have been a legendary play. I may still have that draft if you care to see it. I keep my mafia notes in a folder in my documents folder, going back years and years now heh. <br><br>Also; apples to oranges. I have been compiling thoughts on everyone's ISO into a notepad draft with formatting and such. All that's left really is to do a last pass and decide whether it's more useful to post it or not post it. When I flip, I'll be confirmed town. The questions are how sure am I that I've read things correctly and how sure am I that I haven't called attention to people we can't afford to lose? {The biggest concern, for me, is that I'll say something that doesn't seem important to me but will be a big clue to scum}. I already highlighted the most likely scum, from an inductive rational viewpoint, from day one. By day three, all three of those people may be super townie looking. Day one is always spotty and generally becomes a much better resource later when there's context.<br><br><br>In either case, I'm off to the humane society. The wife and I have been wanting to adopt a puppy for awhile and they're doing $5 adoptions in honor of the day {Not sure how they knew it was my lived instead of died anniversary, but whateves <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> } and we're going to see if they have any puppies young enough to crate train who aren't deathly scared of the wheelchair and who reach out and grab us. <br><br>You guys should absolutely not lynch anyone else today. Monkeyman is almost certainly scum, and he'll almost certainly <span class=\"noboldsig\">still be scum</span> tomorrow. I am a long term problem if left alive. Better to kill me now and ensure that nobody can use me as a smokescreen in later days. The last thing the game needs is another day(s) where 80% of the posts are discussions about me. You all can decide whether to hammer or not. You've got my biggest scum reads and the rest of what I have to say, as I outlined above, is a two edged sword. I am perhaps too paranoid, but I've seen good townies accidentally get crucial town PRs killed time and time again and I'd much rather I didn't do that."}

Sometimes the truth is just the truth. I didn't sign up for this game with the intent of being the day one lynch. In case you aren't experienced enough to know this yet: people who get early suspicion (for whatever reason) can never really shake that suspicion, even if a confirmed cop clears them {People just then theorize godfather}. Since I'm just a VT, it's not worth the risk to my wincon for me to try and dig out of the hole I dug for myself. Me dead means that scum will have no smokescreen going forward from ongoing debate about me. Me dead means everyone will know I was honest about my claim, and simply got off on the wrong foot and rubbed a few folks the wrong way early on. Me dead will allow people to use posts from today later to help me get a win out of the game. <br><br>I would much rather make a graceful exit today and remove all negative utility. I am extremely unlikely to be good enough to outplay the inevitable suspicion and distraction it would be if I lived beyond today, and I almost certainly cannot expect to be good enough to bring home a win if I find myself in MYLO/LYLO in a couple months. In every possible way, the absolute best move for the town today is to lynch me. I'm not scum, but nobody but me will be sure of that until I'm dead. I don't want any cop wasting an investigate just to clear me. If the folks I read as scum aren't scum, they will be well advised to approach tomorrow a lot differently than today (<span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Especially MonkeyMan</span></span> who, as far as I can see from his ISO has never put any original thoughts into the game except for the fallacious assertion that I've posted reads and voted out of OMGUS motives. I can't tell if he's really dense and actually doesn't understand that OMGUS is an immediate visceral emotional response to a case/vote and not just someone suspecting or voting for someone who first made a case/voted for him. I don't think he actually misunderstands. I think He is scum who is hoping he can skate by on just active lurking and popping in any time someone says something bad about him. I mean ... if suspecting or voting for someone who first suspected/voted for me was OMGUS, I couldn't possibly suspect or vote for anyone ... and that's just idiocy.)<br><br>There is nothing but genuine intent here. I'm not trying to avoid being lynched. I think that it should be pretty clear that MonkeyMan is almost certainly scum, but he'll still be here tomorrow. I cannot imagine a situation with more downside than another 2 weeks of debate about me. Seriously. That's not at all useful to town. Please just lynch me and be done with it. <br><br>If you want a full reads list or something, say so. I've decided not to post a gigantic wall of text. I'll post expanded thoughts in the dead thread for anyone who might be interested in how I was reading things here at the end of day one and wants to see what I noted in the time I spent working on a draft. I'm fairly certain that there's way more chance my thoughts would harm town than find scum. Anyone who can't separate the scummy folks on my wagon from the townie need the practice anyway. {Hint, look for people who are actively engaging and trying to actually investigate things instead of people just sticking to a narrative}. <br><br>Unless I come back after dinner and a movie to find myself miraculously alive, I'll see you all in the dead thread. Sorry that my attempts to mess with my play style and early acerbity and snark were a huge distraction. I'm glad the day ended up having a lot of interesting discussion after all. Good luck town. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Terrador and all other townies:</span> Seriously, there's no WiFoM here. I do not want you guys keeping me around. Just think about it and ask yourself how much possible town utility I could bring the game and honestly ask yourself if you think there's any way I'll ever stop being a topic of constant discussion as long as I stay in the game. The rational conclusion is that I should be the lynch and everyone can move on knowing for sure and use today's interactions to read people. I think once you know for sure that I am indeed just a VT, then you'll be able to read how people interacted with me and see the folks that stand out as unlikely to be town. Don't give anyone a free pass, as there was a lot of cover for scum to look pretty townie in reasoning against me. The problem for them will be staying consistent and showing that same kind of reasoning throughout the game. In the end, you get the most out of lynching me today. Anyone getting cold feet now should be watched going forward."}

I'll simply tell you my philosophy of integrity, which I've always applied to online interactions because they are no less \"real\" than ones out in the meatworld. It takes you your entire life to build your integrity. It takes only a single instance to lose it. Lying in mafia as scum is a given. Lying as a townie is only acceptable for very specific reasons and should only be done by people skilled enough to do it properly. If you aren't sure, you shouldn't. Lying about putting together an evaluation of people is just never worthwhile or ethically acceptable. <br><br>If someone cannot be trusted to be honest and keep his integrity in such little things as a forum mafia game, then how can he possibly be trusted when it comes to truly important things like his marriage, his job, and other important things? The only answer is that he cannot. You will not always be able to trust that I'm being honest about game specific things, because this is a game that has lying as a basic element of the game. You can always trust me to be honest about what I'm doing out in meatworld. <br><br>It is generally considered poor form to question what someone says about what they have going on in real life or what they're doing out in real life. It's also exceptionally poor form for scum to make up things about real life to try and gain sympathy. Any player who will give up being trusted long term for a chance at maybe surviving and maybe winning a mafia game ... well, I think you can all figure out what I would say about such a player."}

Monkey is almost certainly scum so you can confirm my status, take the night phase to do some thread diving and figure out your reads in light of actual confirmed info, and you can go into tomorrow intending to lynch MonkeyMan unless he has a dramatic improvement in play. Today all he's really guilty of is what looks like really shady active lurking (could be co-incidence still) and his ridiculous mangling of what OMGUS means and his refusal to admit he misunderstood what it means and move on, despite half the game telling him he doesn't understand the definition. {For someone with a join date back in 2008, he looks like a dyed in the wool first time player}. <br><br>If you don't go through with lynching me, you can't know for sure I have been honest. Inevitably someone (town or scum or both) will bring me back up tomorrow and we'll go through the same mess we went through today, and instead of me being dismissive and sarcastic as a strategy, I'm likely to just be legitimately irritated that town aligned people would see me tell them exactly what would happen if they left me alive and then went and did it. I don't want to spend two more weeks locked in a conversation that began on the first real life day of the game. All it will do is give scum cover. Just do the right thing and lynch me.

The summary is a distillation of what I read about each person, just without links to a bunch of posts with a sentence or three for each. Certainly you've been scum and killed someone who was an obvious strong town player before because of the threat that posed, right? Surely you've been scum and realized someone was a town PR because you knew they were a townie so their behavior made sense to you while a VT might highlight certain things and read someone scummy when they are really a PR.

One would think that if he cared about being concise, he would spoiler it.\" -- Long posts don't take me much time. I type quickly and I work with a lot of text all the time in my research. The \"walls\" come from me because it's super easy for me to throw up a long post in 5-6 minutes. I have to actively work at trimming things down so people don't just glaze at the eyes and skip over my posts. I made a decision to cut out the spoilered commentary on specific posts. If you're interested in what I do, you'll see in the dead thread for as long as I keep up with the game, as I'll comment there on what I'm seeing as I continue to try and figure out the game from beyond the grave. <br><br>@Both of you - It's down to me what I believe is the best thing I can do for town. I believe that being lynched today is a net positive for town. I believe that the reads summaries I gave before I went out along with your own analysis of the day with later context and interactions should be sufficiently helpful. I do not believe there is very much chance that I've successfully figured out the game here in day one; no one could. I do believe that it's possible that the scum team, who after all know for sure who isn't among them, could glean way more immediate benefit from things I wouldn't even realize would help them. I know this because when I have been scum, townies have often called things to my attention that I had missed and many times town players have helped me tremendously as scum. At the end of the day, it's down to my judgment to decide what I think is best. I'm not prescient, and therefore I could only possibly know in hindsight whether I've made the right decision or not. You have my reads with concise summaries of my thoughts. Certainly once I'm dead and you know I had no intent to deceive you, they should be useful, yes?<br><br>@Riabi - \"It seems to me that there's no good reason to keep your thoughts/reads to yourself if you aren't scum. It increases the chances that town loses in the end.\" -- You are incorrect in the first part. I gave the reads, and it is never wise for a townie to reveal all of his thoughts. I have ideas on who might have power roles ... do you think it would be wise for me to point that out to scum? Of course not. The fact that you actually are trying to put blame on me for a potential town loss at the end of a day one, when I'm doing my very best to be a town asset in every possible way ... I really don't know what to say to that. <br><br><br>@Everyone, especially townies - Would you guys just go ahead and kill me already? No townie can possibly argue that keeping me alive and having the inevitable smokescreen of ongoing discussion concerning my alignment could possibly result in a more positive utility than having that question settled and removing that convenient place for scum to hide. It borders on the absurd that at this point in the day anyone is actually trying to stop my lynch wagon. I would suggest it actually approaches playing against your win condition for a townie to vote for anyone but me at this point. You don't want any more cover being provided to the scum team by questions surrounding me. You won't gain more from any other lynch. Even if you lynched MonkeyMan and he flips scum, you gain less because he has only posted to overreact and defend himself any time anyone dared to scum read him or vote for him or even make a passing comment at him so there's basically nothing to go on to figure out who his buddies would be. Further, you won't even be able to feel sure that I am town in that case, as the whole \"bus\" thing will come into play, etc... <br><br>You lynch me, you have a ton of interactions that will be useful for PoE as you gain more info as the game progresses. You have interactions between me and almost everyone in the game. You have my concise reads. You remove me as a distraction for scum to exploit. This is like mafia 101 level decision making here. I'm glad to know after how disastrously bad my approach at the start of the game went that I am capable of putting enough doubt (or even reversing reads) into things to avoid a lynch ... but in this particular instance, as a VT, it's just not good play for me to want to stay alive and keep playing and deprive the town of knowing for sure they can trust my motives and subjecting them to more distraction related to me. As much as I think this game would be fun to continue playing, I can keep trying to figure it out in the dead thread and I can talk to myself (and future dead people!) in there. <br><br>Make the correct maximal utility play. Please. I'd like to go out a lot more gracefully than I started. Consider it an inevitably dying townie's last wish."}

In 307 you listed Key and Victor as more suspicious than Soldier.  I don't see where you voted for Soldier or questioned him in any serious way.  If you suspected him there's very little evidence of it in your ISO. For much of Day 1 your vote was on Key. And at the end of the day your vote was on Monkeyman.  So why not track Monkeyman instead and perhaps prove or disprove his claim?  Wouldn't that have served the town much better?  <br><br>Or did your \"gut\" also tell you that Monkeyman would not be around by morning?"}

MonkeyMan was as good as mislynched today--you could just let it happen and fish for PRs.

I've literally never been vigilante before, here or anywhere else.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Terrador: You and I have spoken about this: we discussed vigilante theory while I was playing my last game, and you mentioned that you considered the strong vigilante play would be to either kill the town's firmest or second-firmest wagon, to avoid bad gutreads taking a dump in your cereal. After Drixx, MonkeyMan was just about the scummiest person around--maybe more so after Drixx flips, depending on how much you trust his brain.

These reads help us look at interactions, and being compelled (or at least strongly encouraged) to continue providing reads helps us see your thought process develop, which should help clear you. This is a meta that does less work for town and which could be used as a smokescreen by scum--why is it okay for you to adhere to it?"}

If he's the best we've got in a week and a half from now, maybe. But right now, it seems like our time is best spent figuring that out.<br><br>If you want to sell me on your theory that soldier is definitely scum, then answer this... why would scum kill monkeyman, who would have been a SUPER easy mis-lynch? They knew that Drixx was town, and that there were going to probably be a lot of interactions to sort through from that (which is what we should be talking about right now, not just Soldier). They knew that there were already several people who had suspected Monkey, especially in light of his bad play at the end of D1. Why wouldn't they kill someone that is being seen as really townie, and basically guarantee another mis-lynch? That doesn't make any sense to me. But, I've been the vig, killing someone who is highly suspected makes a LOT of sense from the perspective of the vig. Now that Monkey is dead, we can move on to other things. His death actually benefits town in a lot of ways."}

I might be wrong about that, but that\u2019s my working assumption. That being said, here are some of the possible scenarios:<br><br>1.\t Mankeyman died from a vigilante kill. Soldier is the vigilante who was caught by dragonspawn, a tracker, in the act.   Meanwhile the scum kill was preempted by a doctor or some other role blocker.  (For the record, I am NOT calling for anyone to claim here.)<br><br>2.\tMankeyman was killed by scum, and dragonspawn caught Solkier in the act. <br><br>3.\tMoneyman was killed by scum. Dragonspawn, as scum, falsely claiming Tracker, points out Soldier (also scum, who could then claim vig) in order to give both of them town credibility.<br><br>4.\tMonkeyman was NK\u2019ed by Soldier the SK. Scum NK was thwarted.<br><br>5.\tDragonspawn is a scum tracker who caught Soldier (either SK or vig) in his night action.  Scum NK was thwarted.<br><br>If anyone can come up with other scenarios, I\u2019m all ears.<br><br>Each theory has problems:<br><br>For #1 to be true, we have to believe that dragonspawn, against the odds selected with his very first post in the game the one person who would have a successful night action, while at the same time, some other town person, again against the odds, chose the one person the scum had targeted for the night kill.  Despite the long odds, this might be the most plausible explanation.<br><br>#2 Makes no sense for a mafia NK.  Monkeyman was likely to be mislynched.  He also claimed vanilla which means the scum would bypass him for an NK in hopes of finding a PR instead.<br><br>The problem with #3 is that it\u2019s an awfully ballsy gambit to make.  But it explains why there was only one night kill, and why dragonspawn crumbed Soldier on the first post.  Dragonspawn voted Soldier I know, but Soldier could easily claim vigilante, so the vote was no threat.  But the vote was needed as the means of getting the false claims out there.  I can\u2019t believe dragonspawn  would automatically assume scum and not consider vigilante.  And his proposal that a Monkeyman  NK makes sense for the scum to throw the town into chaos is not at all plausable.<br><br>#4  How this would make sense depends on the thought process of the SK in selecting Monkeyman.  And of course I don\u2019t know what that would be.  Again we would have to assume the scum NK was thwarted, and dragon got lucky on his tracker selection.<br><br>$5  The problem with this theory is that the scum might want to keep their tracker\u2019s  find secret and take the vig out with a NK.  For once a vig is forced to claim, town is unlikely to lynch and the vig might be protected by night.<br><br>Going forward: I\u2019m not sure how to test dragonspawn\u2019s tracker claim.  But if Soldier is indeed town he should be willing to listen to suggestions from the town about whom to vig."}

I might be wrong about that, but that\u2019s my working assumption. That being said, here are some of the possible scenarios:<br><br>1.\t Mankeyman died from a vigilante kill. Soldier is the vigilante who was caught by dragonspawn, a tracker, in the act.   Meanwhile the scum kill was preempted by a doctor or some other role blocker.  (For the record, I am NOT calling for anyone to claim here.)<br><br>2.\tMankeyman was killed by scum, and dragonspawn caught Solkier in the act. <br><br>3.\tMoneyman was killed by scum. Dragonspawn, as scum, falsely claiming Tracker, points out Soldier (also scum, who could then claim vig) in order to give both of them town credibility.<br><br>4.\tMonkeyman was NK\u2019ed by Soldier the SK. Scum NK was thwarted.<br><br>5.\tDragonspawn is a scum tracker who caught Soldier (either SK or vig) in his night action.  Scum NK was thwarted.<br><br>If anyone can come up with other scenarios, I\u2019m all ears.<br><br>Each theory has problems:<br><br>For #1 to be true, we have to believe that dragonspawn, against the odds selected with his very first post in the game the one person who would have a successful night action, while at the same time, some other town person, again against the odds, chose the one person the scum had targeted for the night kill.  Despite the long odds, this might be the most plausible explanation.<br><br>#2 Makes no sense for a mafia NK.  Monkeyman was likely to be mislynched.  He also claimed vanilla which means the scum would bypass him for an NK in hopes of finding a PR instead.<br><br>The problem with #3 is that it\u2019s an awfully ballsy gambit to make.  But it explains why there was only one night kill, and why dragonspawn crumbed Soldier on the first post.  Dragonspawn voted Soldier I know, but Soldier could easily claim vigilante, so the vote was no threat.  But the vote was needed as the means of getting the false claims out there.  I can\u2019t believe dragonspawn  would automatically assume scum and not consider vigilante.  And his proposal that a Monkeyman  NK makes sense for the scum to throw the town into chaos is not at all plausable.<br><br>#4  How this would make sense depends on the thought process of the SK in selecting Monkeyman.  And of course I don\u2019t know what that would be.  Again we would have to assume the scum NK was thwarted, and dragon got lucky on his tracker selection.<br><br>$5  The problem with this theory is that the scum might want to keep their tracker\u2019s  find secret and take the vig out with a NK.  For once a vig is forced to claim, town is unlikely to lynch and the vig might be protected by night.<br><br>Going forward: I\u2019m not sure how to test dragonspawn\u2019s tracker claim.  But if Soldier is indeed town he should be willing to listen to suggestions from the town about whom to vig.</div></blockquote><br><br>good list of possibilities. I'm not scum and this isn't a gambit though. It be a bad one if it was imho."}

I think killing N1 and having a lynch chance during D2 is better because if Vig didn't kill Monkeyman, who was going to die D2, I don't think TheSoldier generally has other scumreads on people and he might make a PR townkill. he did that smart thing and made the crowd happy by killing off Monkeyman first, so the lynch wouldn't be wasted D2. Now we can talk about scumhunting with an amazing two weeks ahead of us. In that time, I'm sure we're going to smell out another scum and have him/her as our top suspect."}

Why is Monkey the worst scum kill possible?</div></blockquote><br>I don't like Keyblade in this exchange at all. Slandaar asks Keyblade for clarifications on his reads, and instead of doing the work of going back and finding the posts that originally pinged keyblade, he seems to go out of his way and find some tiny string he can try to pull on in Slandaar's most recent post. I don't know about everyone, but, if I'm town, and I'm actually trying to figure things out, if I post something like \"their arguments don't make sense\" I typically have some posts or arguments from them in mind. And if questioned on that read, I would go back and find the posts I didn't like.<br><br>To me, Keyblade's response feels like he's just making shit up as he goes along. This is especially true considering what he pointed out about Slandaar's argument wasn't really, in my mind, at all controversial. We had already discussed in game why the NK looked bad for scum. You can possibly make the argument that slandaar's bit about it being \"the worst possible\" was a bit of an exaggeration (though I don't think it was). But certainly even if Slandaar was simply using hyperbole, that doesn't reach the realm of \"doesn't make sense,\" does it?"}

The question is:<br><br>Are scum able to privately talk during the day on this site?<br><br>As I said earlier, it's been 4 years since I played, and I recall scum being able to day chat at one site I played on, but I don't recall if it was here or not.  The reason I ask is because I want to know if scum might be crumbing or otherwise signaling each other during the day.  Of course, if there's day chat, that would be unnecessary.

I've already said my bit on his crumb, and I seriously don't get why so many people are completely setting aside the idea that I'm scum. If I was in a game and someone was tracked to the NK, I'd strongly be considering voting them. The fact that most of the thread has been going for the conclusion that I'm a PR has been wigging me out all day. Basically, I don't see why Dragon wanting to vote me is scummy. He has accepted that I may be a vig, as shown by him being willing to lynch elsewhere today. We are not lynching a claimed PR today. <br><br>There's also not a lot of original thought in her post, nor many details. The only \"new\" thing she brings to the Dragon wagon (rhymes) is possible buddying of Drixx, which is... mm. He hasn't really tried to 'cash in' on not being on Drixx that I recall. If she could show what about his defense of Drixx was more likely to come from scum than town, that would be great. Everything else she said has been gone over a lot in the thread. Basically, it feels like a post that was made while mining Dragon's ISO for anything he's done and skimming the rest of the thread."}

I've played with Dragon before, including being scum with him (we coulda won that game, btw Dragon). My impression of him is that he's a guy that likes to take gambits.

Following = tracker?  No I don't believe this is a crumb because it's too obscure, and following does not equal tracker. Here are the two posts where dragon describes his supposed crumb:<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6840879#p6840879\" class=\"postlink\">post 778</a>, dragonspawn wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6797468#p6797468\" class=\"postlink\">post 39</a>, dragonspawn wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Going to follow the soldier.</span> Keys vote seems very opportunistic.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: key</span><br><br>btw hi everyone.

He includes Soldiers name.  Why include Soldier's name if it was not integral to the crumb? Furthermore, his comment \"I wasn't exactly being subtle\" would not hold true if he intended the word \"following\" to indicate tracker.<br><br>Besides, this post shows that the choice of Soldier was not at all incidental.

In 797, he says \"because I said I would.\" So his first post was, apparently, meaningful. Then he says that the first post was not him saying he would track me. I've gone over this.<br><br>This next part is the CRITICAL PART. \"lol im gonna choose who to track immediately\" is dumb as either alignment. HOWEVER, town!tracker has no reason to say \"no I didn't actually pick him early on even though I said earlier I did!\" The only reason that someone would do this is to hide their real reasons for picking someone. Which in scum!tracker's case, is looking for PRs. OK, epiphany moment, I'm gonna boil this down to the essence here: <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Him listing his early crumb in his reasons for tracking me was a way to pad his \"reasons\" and make himself look more like a town tracker.</span><br><br>He tracked me, in reality, because he thought I fit the profile of a town PR.

I know for a fact that you're not stupid. I've seen your other games. You're observant. You get what people are saying. See, I think you're trying the scum strategy of just going over the same stuff over and over so that no one wants to read the thread, which funnily enough, I think we talked about before you signed up for this game. Also, Dragon is \"really dirty\" and you're not voting him because why? Is Keyblade really truly the better lynch when we'll get a replacement who might actually read the thread and be readable?"}

We also found out he does not have access to certain websites because of government restrictions.

So I'm guessing (and it's only a guess) that the language and his relative inexperience gave him problems playing the game effectively.

With Zerediah coming from a restrictive Communist country, that particular flavor might not go over well should anyone in authority be looking over his shoulder.<br><br>\"Being too paranoid\" is pretty much a joke.  It's a reference to the paranoia that comes from playing Mafia.  Has someone indeed been looking over Zerediah's shoulder?  Or is that just paranoia?"}

Basically, my (obviously wrong) case against Dragonspawn amounted to the fact that he seemed HELLBENT on the idea that Soldier had to be scum just because he made a kill. There were several possible scenarios laid out that explained how it would be possible that only the vig would make the kill, and he never really addressed those, just blew them off. He never once explained why he thought that scum making what appeared to be a mis-play (NKing Monkey) made more sense than any of the other reasonable explanations.

Pre-flip associatives are almost always terrible, and he should know that since the aforementioned \"Blitz\" incident was him tunneling hard on a townie based on these.<br><br>I really don't get the purpose of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6871659#p6871659\">1155</a>. If you wanted Kitty to give you her read on Zerediah, why not just ask that instead of one that's pointless? Really, what kind of answer is he hoping for?<br><br>Basically, I think he was testing the waters of the Dragon wagon, only jumping on when it was clear that it was going through and he had an excuse for lynching a pr. I don't understand his reluctance to put people he thinks are scum at L-1 with the deadline halfway gone if he was town; I can easily see him doing it as cautious scum. His callout of Victor for trying to wrap things up shows that prematurely ending the day is in the front of his mind as a scummy action, and he doesn't want to do so himself because he's afraid of his image. Considering that he listed himself as a common townread, him being concerned about such things suggests a scum mindset.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Victor case</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I hate his D2 entrance.

Killing the guy that everyone's set on lynching throws everyone out of whack and can leave town floundering; I have seen scum do this before, and I don't know why people find it so unbelievable. Killing obvtown is almost certainly better, yes, but this is a game played by human beings. Nobody is perfectly optimal all the time; people might want to try new strategies or just confuse everyone.<br><br>Furthermore, voting Dragon because he said he followed me rather than tracking me is bad. I personally forgot that follower was even a role, and have seen people say that they followed someone as a tracker. Trying to portray Dragon as scummy for his word choice is awful, since him saying he followed someone when claiming tracker is in no way scummy.<br><br>Then we have <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6841939#p6841939\">828</a>. Zerediah has been encouraging people to vote Drixx. He has been supporting the Drixx wagon, while conspicuously avoiding actually voting there, for most of the day. Drixx had \"given up\" for most of the day, but towards the end of D1 Zerediah now thinks he's town because he gave up! This is scummy as hell, and indeed, Victor agreed that Zerediah was scummy D1. But now, when Slandaar asks him why he liked Zerediah's explanation D1, he says that it's because Zerediah was right about Drixx. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Major problem: Zerediah and Victor couldn't have known he was right about Drixx until D2! Victor also doesn't say why he liked the post when it was posted, instead using knowledge he can't have had. This is damning. Victor gave an answer to a D1 question using D2 knowledge purposefully. Furthermore, it's D2 knowledge that only scum could have had D1.</span></div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Zerediah case</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Zerediah is an utter goldmine.

Soldier said that he expected that monkey would be the lynch on day 2, but said we will see, as he did in thread. I don't understand why he would scum!kill monkey either. But now that I know that it's possible he is scum I have to consider it. His motivations have all been pretty clear to me though, and he is so helpful. He seems open, I'm not seeing scum play here. Although admittedly it would be hard to wrap my head around it after all of this time.<br> Titus, your slot was never looking good to me from early day one, but you are not Victor. Do you think Victor was playing kind of scummy to stay under the radar as PR? I remember Random having that conversation with someone on day one. I *think* it was Random. Town looking scummy. The problem is, if you go back and read the thread, you could see WHY the lynchees were lynched. I started to doubt Drixx, because he was starting to sound like himself, I had played with him before. Dragon just got more scummy as he went, he crumbed following soldier in his first post...then pushed hard for the Soldier lynch. He wouldn't even listen to anyone that there was any other possibility. Then hammered himself, I still haven't gotten an answer why that was a good play.  When he is going after *my* confirmed town vig, that is all I needed. I have never been in a neighborhood before and we didn't talk hardly at all, I thought it was secret handshake shit LOL I wouldn't vote Soldier, and I supported him. As we were quiet in the neighborhood day one, and I had asked for some advice on reads, I figured it was all very hush hush. Soldier did share more in the second day, he went into detailed analysis that was very helpful, he was suspicious of Terrador/Victor/zer/PB then added Riabi. Soldier said he fully expected to be NK'd and left us with as much information as he could of his analysis. Slandaar didn't talk much at night, but read Soldier, Lapsa, Riabi and I as town. He did have a VCA himself that pointed to zer/PB and Victor/Titus. He points out that out of the 4 wagons keyblade and dragon had the most votes, while Victor/Titus and zer/PB had the least and it all fit together pretty well. I thouht he had a point. It made sense to me and I respected his play very much, he didn't say a lot, but when he did it was insightful, to me anyway. This is my 3rd game onsite. First out of the newbie queue, I am not used to this many players. Early in the days I felt like I could confidently read people, now, I really feel out of my league. And it sucks. Sorry I am rambling. I just want to share what I can. I am trying to gain some insight from the thread but I am torn. I used confirmation bias a lot in my last game and I am trying really hard not to do it here."}

Claim of one-shot and lack of subsequent shots isn't consistent with him hiding a second or third shot. Monkey would have been a shit shot for scum, getting him mislynched would have been incredibly, hilariously easy. I can't think of a single person I wouldn't shoot before Monkey as scumteam, and his play generally checks out as protown.<br><br><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">KittyGalore</span></span>: This is a pretty enormous townslip, and seeing two scum in a neighborhood covering for each other would literally break my brain. Her play seemed pretty town to me, and the backpedaling on the Drixx lynch would usually seem scummy, but I'm feeling it as organic? I'm seriously salty that we're not getting more out of her, though.<br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Lapsa</span></span>: First, @Lapsa, I haven't dug up any more crumbs yet. Perhaps a dip into Victor's ISO for cop crumbs will come later.<br>But as far as he goes, his push is good and his reads feel organic. Some of the points he makes are wrong, and in particular I disagree with how he views TheSoldier, but he feels very town--nothing I can be absolutely certain of, though.<br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Shinobi</span></span>: Content looks good since the sub, and PoE with Titus and Prolapsed Brain just doesn't make any sense. A gut read, but one I think I trust right now.<br><br><span style=\"color: yellow\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">RandomActs</span></span>: Not sure I have a read on him. In particular, he's not really contributing when he posts rarely. If you don't have time or energy to invest into a game, the posts you make need to be clear and forward and kick ass. This, in absence of the all-but-confirming townslip and the gutread from D1 that Kitty has over him? Puts him firmly down into the null category.<br><br><span style=\"color: yellow\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Riabi</span></span>: See, at first I was townreading him, but... I'm not sure. His defense of Victor early, in addition with Titus' one claimed clear being on him, just doesn't feel natural. Thought he was town at first, but the PoE here just doesn't make him look too good. In particular, I should be damned aware of whom he's scumreading, and honestly, I have to dig a bit to see he's pushing Lapsa &gt; Prolapsed Brain &gt; ???.<br><br><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Titus</span></span>: Doctor claim is the only thing in the world giving me pause. VDA slot is bad, and completely forgets Zerediah out of the blue Day 2 because no reason. On top of associative reads casting shade, dude has W A Y too many scumreads and just about the shadiest cop claim I've seen.

Prolapsed Brain has done literally no work besides two barely substantiated scumreads since joining. Nobody in the world burns out on games <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> fast. Scumslot.<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@TheSoldier</span>: I think being so blatant about crumbs when you don't have a guilty is a bad, bad idea for town--bad enough to suggest scum, honestly.<br><br>Massclaim is probs. a Bad Idea from here. I doubt we have more than one town PR who isn't outed, so that's one clear to let scum see our kill block. I'm hesitant to see townies even claim VT at this point--we don't need to make scum PoE on our jailkeep/doc, if extant, better. We really have nothing to gain and something substantial to lose.<br><br>Neighborhood doesn't really make town stronger. Either there's scum, in which case it's essentially another, smaller thread (which isn't really strong, frankly--it's a modifier, not a role in and of itself, for a reason), or there's town, in which case the WIFOM takes about as much value as it gives. Either way, I'd think it reduces swinginess from target-picking and puts the game more in the hands of the players' skill.<br><br>We can agree to disagree on Titus.

Most of the town finds his claim not only possible, but considering the NK, plausible.  Yes it was the only claim he could make, but that doesn't make it untrue. Why impossible?<br><br>---<br><br>Like most others here I'm trying to figure out game balance. I'm dubious of an all-town neighborhood. Soldier is not at all confirmed. I'm looking askance at Titus' claim, but without a counter claim we're stuck with it for now. Unless the scum know something we do not? Could dragon have been the only investigative townie, and might the scum have figured that out, making a cop claim safe? None of this seems likely, but considering how well we've done so far, I think it's clear something unusual has occurred  to throw us off our game.</div></blockquote><br><br>For Soldier's claim to be true, we have to overlook the fact that people told Soldier what to claim and he claimed that anyway.<br><br>Second, Soldier's claim is predicated on a healing role (doc/bp/jailkeep) existing. His claim can be proven possible by someone claiming to be one of those roles and who they healed. The healing role would then be killed while I am blocked. Yet, the people saying massclaim is bad are the very people supporting Soldier's claim. Provided three scum, we have one mislynch left. The proper thing to do here is to investigate.<br><br>Second, this all depends on Monkey being a town motivated shot. Why? Monkey is an active off the wall player. Look at Monkey's townreads in 661. FMPOV, all but Kitty are proven town. Kitty is likely town given Soldier scum. R did move back into his scumreads later, but that's because R was working well with Terrador. His townreads on both Kitty and Slandaar would be problematic if the identity of the hood was known for a scum Soldier. Sometimes people are shot, not for being protown, but for the fact they make mislynches impossible.<br><br>Monkey also wanted to hold Laspa accountable for lurking. Look who lurked through Day 2 (at least according to VCA).<br><br>Right after Soldier's claim Laspa (who cannot figure out how the vote tag works day 2), asks Soldier how many shots he has. Rather than get upset, he merely dismisses Lapsa saying he would prefer not to reveal. Lapsa does not follow-up. Not does anyone else follow about why such a question had to be asked.<br><br>Investigative gets Soldier fried, so he could not claim that. Doc is out because Monkey died (if Soldier was blocked he would not have visited). So that leaves vig. Big with multiple shots means a whole lot of missing kills. So from the outset, Soldier had to claim one shot vig."}

My PoE is gone so Terrador is back at nulltown, leaning town. I'm considering Riabi town, not because of Titus' claim but because I ended up reading a game he was in; my hood suspicions of him were largely about how some of the questions he asked seemed useless or a dead-end to me, but he asked similar questions as town in another game so I chalk it up to playstyle, and his thought processes have been pretty transparent and easy to grasp. Kitty is town but I'm completely leaning on the townslip, because she really hasn't done anything this game. Random's not done a whole lot either, but I liked what he has done in the present tense. Prolapsed is scum. Lapsa is going to take actual reading to decide. I'm reading Titus as town, but there's a lot of hope there... if it turns out there is no protective role, then Titus is probably (or at least quite possibly) real, but if there is one, then her claim is dubious for balance reasons. I wish Victor was still here, because I had some important questions for him. N1 with no doc/bp means scum killed monkey at the same time I did; seeing as several people suspected him, he would have been an easy enough mislynch, so that seems unlikely, blah blah this has been said before.<br><br>PSA: Just under 6 days left until deadline.

There are a lot of claims out there already, along with a possible unclaimed doc/role blocker. If the scum have a role cop, they may already be aware of what they can safe claim.  So I've been counting:<br><br>a. the number of folks alive (9),<br>b. minus the number of scum (a consensus of 3 which I accept for now) <br>c. minus 2 (the possible number of role cop results if they have one) <br>d. minus the various number of claims depending on each scenario (only the scum know which claims are correct.)<br><br>The resulting number is the possible roles the scum can't account for. If that number reaches 0, the scum know what they can safe claim.  <br><br>I specifically wanted to compare the timing of Lapsa's claim with Titus' claim because that would affect the calculations on (d) above.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">All of this course depends on a scum role cop which I don't even know exists. </span> But that's what I reduced to at the moment.  <br><br>As I count we have 5 claims out there, plus a possible doc/roleblocker.  If all those claims are true (a big if) that makes the figure in (d) a 6.  That brings the final calculation at this time to -2.  At the time of Titus' crumb the final figure was 2, which gives her claim more credibility because if it was a false claim it could have been possibly countered, even if the scum have a role cop.  The calculation at the time of Lapsa's claim doesn't really matter since VT is almost always a safe claim. (I do note however we do have 2 dead VT's already.  Lapsa, if true, would make the 3rd VT.  I'm not sure how many VT's we can reasonably expect in a game this size.)<br><br>Of course you can ignore all this unless someone happens to flip as a scum role cop."}

As I tried to explain earlier in the game, I generally don't share my reads beyond my top suspect unless there's a compelling reason to do so.  I can only vote for one person at a time.  We can only lynch one person at a time.  That's why I focus mainly on one prime suspect.  Going further than that only increases the possibility of promoting a false narrative.  I don't want to be responsible for misleading the town. Am I considering relationships and possible scum teams?  Yes, of course.  That all plays into my reads.  But until a suspect flips and until a NK can be analyzed, we don't have enough information to make an informed decision about future lynches.  And I don't want to lock myself into any particular narrative when it's nearly certain to be altered by future events.  Furthermore, if my reads are correct and my narrative is accurate, the scum will strategize against it.  Why give them that opportunity?<br><br>I understand not everyone plays this way.  I know it's frustrating to some who want to gauge my thinking.  But when I know more information is forthcoming, I feel more comfortable waiting for it to come before considering my next step."}

Surely, as town, you want your primary lynch more, no? And as town, don't you want a longer Day for more discussion?<br>-Let's say you want Prolapsed Brain dead just as bad, and that you're as certain about him as you are about Lapsa. How does that mesh with your primary scumteam idea having another two people on it?<br>-One last note on Prolapsed Brain: nobody is going to defend him. Lapsa has other reads to attend to, and nobody else things he's TownieMcTownerson--hell, it'd be dangerous to defend his play, since being wrong about defending him could get the defender lynched after the former's flip.<br>-What about Shinobi in VCA bugs you?<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Shinobi</span>, re: #1628 (re: #1611), Kitty and her husband are out of town, but TheSoldier has been lethargic and not confident--which I understand, but which is of exactly zero help to us.

He makes perfect sense as a N1 scumkill, being active and inquisitive; not to mention when dragonspawn had a hard time believing that the scenario where the kill was prevented was blocked, he brought up the possibility of bulletproof - because he is one. There's also the fact that he pressured Zerediah quite a bit D1; Slandaar did that D2 and was killed N2. Seems like a likely NK choice to me.<br><br>I reread the thread from page one, starting by paying extra attention to Zerediah. In particular, his readslist from page 15. Take a look.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6815287#p6815287\" class=\"postlink\">post 396</a>, Zerediah wrote:</cite>@Riabi: My interpretations of the game are better in D2, but if you insist, here goes.<br><br>TOWN<br>Terrador: His plays are very good, right on the townie marker.

In the early game right after RVS, you managed to get the important convos starting with Monkeyman, which is \u201cpro town in and of itself\u201d. The reason you aren\u2019t 100% confirmed is because you are too willing to rush the game, almost as if you want different wagons happening one after another. This could result in a wagon to your liking, and you can take the kill with reasonable argument.<br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Monkeyman</span></span>: SLIGHT TOWN because you make good reads, but I\u2019m seeing some unproductive reads (which is hypocritical of me xD).

Can\u2019t determine whether its scum or town play.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Colors and bold are from me.<br><br>So I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that Zerediah was not particularly good at hiding his intentions. See: him posting that he doesn't think Drixx is scummy, then asking Victor to vote Drixx.<br><br>Now, go and read what he says about RandomActs. He says he wants to put him as town... but can't because he has no posts... and then goes on to say that he's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">definitely</span> not scum guys, don't look over here! Now this is pretty obvious in and of itself, but don't worry, I have stuff that Random has done that makes him scum all by himself.<br><br>And now look at his read on Lapsa. Oh wait, he doesn't have one. Even when he puts Keyblade as slight scum for being non constructive. When later asked, he says he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">can't</span> scumread Lapsa because that would make him a hypocrite. Hmm. <br><br>And then there's something more ISO-wide from him. He never really engaged Random or Lapsa throughout the course of the game. Furthermore, when Lapsa and Random start to suspect him, he doesn't comment, but when Riabi and Slandaar do, he definitely reacts. Cut and dry. That's everything I want to say about Zerediah's play; Prolapsed didn't do much other than awkwardly not want to vote Lapsa, so I'm moving on to the living scum.<br><br>[b]Lapsa<br><br>Alright, so something Lapsa has been doing for 80% of the game is going after Victor's slot. What is the initial cause of this suspicion? He first votes Victor in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6822060#p6822060\">509</a>. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6825899#p6825899\">561</a> he finally says why, saying that this is not what town Victor looks like. So... his murderboner was born of meta. That he couldn't or wouldn't elaborate on, as seen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6825946#p6825946\">566</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6826028#p6826028\">570</a>. In other words, probably fabricated. There's also the fact that he townread Zerediah D1 with no explanation at all (also 509).<br><br>And then we have his 'case' on me beginning at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6900347#p6900347\">1322</a>. Hoo boy. Every point is either wrong or meaningless.<br><br>First, he gave his personal scumlist as me, Victor/Titus, and Riabi. He uses this to argue against the idea that Monkey was the obvious D2 lynch, which yes he really was. The people he notes (here and later) that voted/were willing to vote the Monkey wagon are: his \"scumlist,\" himself, drixx, dragon, slandaar, terrador, and kitty... that's eight people right there. When 11 people are going to be alive, I'd say 8 people suspecting you makes you a pretty likely lynch. Not to mention that from my POV, that would make HIM the one scum on the town wagon, so lol.<br><br>Then he mentions a \"synchronized hammer.\" Oh man, Victor voted him and then I hammered him! With 2 days left! What is this even an accusation of? He also puts me saying that it should be Monkey tomorrow in red as if that's incriminating. One, why would scum say that and then kill the dude. Secondly, I said that so that it wouldn't be blindingly obvious I was vig. So he's trying to make me look scummy for saying that Monkey was the obvious next lynch, which he was. Oh, and who's the one other guy besides Prolapsed to quickly buy into this? RandomActs. Which brings me to him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">RandomActs</span><br><br>First of all I'm actually laughing in real life from the PEdit. Prolapsed was confirmed fucking scum because he self hammered to cut the day short. You don't honestly believe this argument.<br><br>Let's all look back to early day two. I'm sure you all remember the gist - Dragon claimed tracker, and that I had killed Monkey. I said yes, I did. Day ended with Dragon being mislynched. Now, one of the arguments used on his lynch was that he had decided who to track on his first post. Now where did this idea come from?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6841353#p6841353\" class=\"postlink\">post 809</a>, RandomActs wrote:</cite>I think it's very odd that Dragon would decide whom to track on his very first post.  Wouldn't he wait to follow someone suspicious?  This is either really bad play, or the scum are trying some kind of gambit.<br>@ dragon - why didn't you wait until nightfall to decide your target?</div></blockquote><br><br>Ah, from RandomActs himself. This is the first mention of this idea. Dragon explained that his noting that he said he would in his first post was a funny twist of fate, and that he HADN'T planned to track me from the beginning. But Random pushes this throughout the day, as if it were an established fact. This is setting the narrative. I actually have to give props to Random for this play, I definitely wouldn't have caught it without a reread, and I'll have to keep it in mind for when I roll scum.<br><br>Then we go back to the 'slip' I brought up D2. He brought on the bluster when I brought it up to get me off of him, much like he's doing now.<br><br>PPEdit: Yeah, terrador brings up good points too.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RandomActs</span><br><br>For great justice."}

(And since I'm the only one on dragonspawn's vote list at the moment, it isn't really such a big deal, I guess.)<br><br>I also appreciate Drixx's offer to give himself up for the good of the town but at this point I'm not entirely sure that's the best move.  He makes good arguments about why he should be lynched, but it's hard for me to give up the obvious objective - that we should be lynching scum, not town.  Yes, we could gain some good information on a Drixx lynch, but I can't help but think it would be even better to lynch scum today.  I have a moderate scum read on Monkey.

My support for a Monkey lynch was lukewarm at best.  For you to characterize it otherwise is to manufacture evidence, not find it.  You accuse me of tunneling on Dragon, but as I recall you voted him too.  In fact, you are on recorded of mislynching 2 townies in this game.  And you missed the vote on the only scum we found when he suddenly hung himself, and you tried to cover by calling him confirmed scum.  Where is your apology for your poor play in this game Terrador??  I at least give Soldier some credit for feeling bad about mislynching, whether he's genuine or not.

Further, you haven't explicitly stated that TheSoldier is scum, so yeah, there's still room to doubt that.<br><br>You wanna call it BS? Sure, give me substantive and satisfactory responses to the issues I'm bringing forward. Hint: you won't, and you aren't even trying. What you're trying to do is throw shade on me, for the most part. Let's take a look at what you've done today, shall we?<br>#1661 critically misses multiple points--both that claiming you're town accomplishes nothing and that I knew PB was scum because he self-hammered.<br>#1667 says my wallpost is based on nothing when we have two new flips and a prompt for a reread, then attacks me.<br>#1670 claims that counterattacking is alright, which isn't scummy in and of itself (although your counterattacking, as I've demonstrated, screams scum), then tries calling my lynch record into question because that's easier than defending your own clearly scummy behavior.<br>#1672 calls me on an observation several other players have had.<br>#1673 entirely misrepresents why TheSoldier sees an associative tell between you and Zerediah.<br>#1679 tries to defend you watching a townie get lynched with little effort to stop it when you declare Drixx to be town and further tries passing off lynch record as an alignment tell.<br>#1685 throws shade at TheSoldier instead of explicitly calling him scum, because you're afraid to commit to that.<br>#1691 claims I'm trying to cover myself for a theoretical mislynch<br>#1693 says I'm choosing to <span class=\"noboldsig\">believe</span> a scum-only neighborhood, in a nutshell. Slipping that I believe I'm town, maybe~?<br>And finally, #1694 says you're trying to answer my BS as quickly as you can. When you have answered... one point? And one auxilliary/early one? In nine posts? Tryin' real hard to address those concerns, man.<br><br>In the scope of those posts, I alone have brought up the following:<br>#1659 calls him on a useless post.<br>#1662 calls him evading, points out a pattern of him attacking people who scumread him, calls having few scumreads a way to hedge, calls him for supporting the Drixx wagon and ultimately bailing, and suggests that an awful D2 post had scum intent.<br>#1669 refutes his theory about me drawing out Riabi's role, and calls him on not mentioning a scum partner.<br>#1676 says his defenses are scummy, points out his pattern of OMGUS again, calls out lynch record as not an alignment tell, points out why his vote behavior has been scummy, calls him on continuing to not post a real case on me or submit a scum partner, and calls #1673 as a scumpost.<br>#1682 elaborates on why his D1 behavior is scum, defends my own record, combats the narrative he's trying to make of TheSoldier capriciously plucking him as a scumread, defends my own play, points out the difference between bad and scum, and calls him on not outing a potential scum #2 once more. Trying to keep the pressure up there.<br>#1687 reiterates that I have a cohesive scumteam, which he's trying to cast doubt on. It points out that his scumread of TheSoldier appeared out of thin air once Kitty expressed faith in scum!Random, and that it's patently ridiculous that he thinks TheSoldier is scum over Kitty, and further says that he doesn't counterattack TheSoldier at first, which makes 0 sense for somebody he's scumreading. I keep applying pressure for his failure to address the issues, then note that townies can, in fact, be wrong! Gasp!<br>#1692 calls him on his crap about me \"covering my butt\", calls him on a lie about me always being on the wrong side of the lynch, and keeps the pressure about his dodging on.<br><br>Does anyone notice the near-complete lack of overlap between what I bring forward and what he's stating? Yeah, I made this listpost partly to summarize the case on him, but still--the fact remains that he's clearly not actually trying to defend himself.<br><br>Further, his scumteam is not cohesive to the point of impossibility. He considers me to be scum. Cool. But he also considers TheSoldier to be scum. Alright, that's a scumteam. <span class=\"noboldsig\">But how did Riabi's bulletproof get broken? He can't be scum if there are no slots left, and it's patently obvious there's no potential vig but TheSoldier.</span> And don't say he didn't think of it, because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6917711#p6917711\" class=\"postlink\">he took bulletproof!Riabi as given literally an hour and a half ago!</a> Now that I think of it, he says Riabi is the scum target... <span class=\"noboldsig\">which means that MonkeyMan was not.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Random, in addition to your other problems, your scumteam is transparently artificial.

If you want to see the case on it, look at my ISO. On top of everything wrong with him in prior days, one of his scumreads is painfully shallow and the other is hilariously artificial.

Are we talking \"confirmed\" as in \"as sure as any townie can be before a flip?\"  If that's the case, that's not scummy. However I rarely use the word in this way because it's inaccurate.  To me \"confirmed\" means 100 percent accuracy, as in mod-like assurance, or perhaps scum-like assurance.  And that level of assurance is rare in this game.  So, when you thought \"confirmed\" and meant it in the former sense, then no, that would not be scummy.  But using it in the latter sense would indicate a level of knowledge that's usually beyond the town."}

Literally everyone in this game has posted (unless I missed something) since he's been L-1. Meaning we've all had a chance to hammer him if so desired. Despite what lapsa says, I think it's in scum's best interest to hammer him now if he were scum. I've made it clear that I'm still confused by things, and shutting down discussion would keep me that way. So, to me, this seems to suggest that maybe he's not scum. I realize that the counter argument for this leads to WIFOM, and there's little actual solid evidence here, I'm just mostly expressing my current feeling."}

He's also definitely not scum guys, don't look over here ~<br>-Zerediah's readslist also stole my 'from outer space' gimmick thing to describe Lapsa, conveniently not giving a read. When later called on why Lapsa isn't a scumread for disrupting the game like Keyblade, Zer says that he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">can't</span> scumread him without being a hypocrite.

I'm sure I've had other minor issues with his play that I'm forgetting, but these are supplementary, and I don't stand by them as scumtells.

Because when it comes to the Drixx wagon, I look infinitely better than you do.  I'm not sure what you mean by \u201ctoxic\u201d but if you mean I disagreed with a mislynching wagon then I proudly plead guilty.  Could I have worked harder to save Drixx if I thought he was innocent?  Yes, perhaps so.  But I did what I thought I could with the limited information available to me.  But my ambivalence is nowhere near as damning as your position on that wagon \u2013 firmly and comfortably seated on a mislynch wagon.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>3.His push for dragonspawn's lynch predicates on a narrative he invented: that dragonspawn chose to track TheSoldier at the start of Day 1, and therefore is scum tracker.

I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s an indication you yourself  how shallow your arguments are, that you'd resort to this tactic.  But others can make up their own minds about that.  <br><br>I agree that decisions about night actions should be made at the end of the day.  But I was not accusing dragon of being a smart player;  I was accusing him of being a scummy one. I was also taking his relative inexperience into account.  In trying to figure out why dragon might early be calling for a night action on Soldier (which he carried though with, don\u2019t forget) I tried to determine if this was scumtalk. You will also recall we had some discourse about whether there was a daytime channel for the scum, which, if there was, would have greatly cleared dragon in my mind.  It was ME who brought up that issue.  So I was not quite as tunneled on dragon as you portray.  I was also looking for evidence to clear him.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>4. He has a pattern of attacking and trying to intimidate people who consider him scum. This attitude is pretty hilariously antitown, and it's been extant the entire game.</div></blockquote><br><br>When I was first learning this game, my more experienced mentors told me to fight like hell if I\u2019m a townie falsely accused.  It\u2019s not about preserving yourself, they said, it\u2019s about preserving the town.  So yes, I\u2019ve been taught to defend myself vigorously.  Would you prefer I just roll over and let myself be mislynched?  No, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> would be anti-town. It\u2019s not my intent to intimidate.  But when I\u2019m town and I\u2019m unfairly attacked, I will naturally assume that scum are behind it.  Anyone would.  Anyone should.  So a vigorous defense is not an indication of scum.  You don\u2019t have to look far for an example:  Drixx fought tooth and nail until he gave up.  And in case you\u2019ve forgotten, he was TOWN!<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>5. He didn't have a complete set of scumreads until very forcefully pressured into doing so. Antitown hedging, anyone?</div></blockquote><br><br>No, not anti-town hedging.  It\u2019s careful play.  It\u2019s about not making mistakes. It\u2019s about not prematurely making choices that don\u2019t yet need to be made.  (A lesson I humbly suggest you consider.) I\u2019ve explained this twice already in the thread.  You didn\u2019t call it anti-town then.  It\u2019s my play style.  Get over it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>6. his scumread on TheSoldier Day 4 is entirely artificial.

Full of all sorts of half-truths and strawmen. I'll break it down for our townies (and by that, I really mean Riabi) piece by piece.<br><br>Response 1: Evading the point. The point is not that Zerediah had a null read on Random--it's that Zerediah treated Random as \"definitely not scum\" and gave off a vibe that he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">wanted</span> to be able to read Random as more town, but couldn't justify it. It's not the column, it's the reasoning, as I've noted before.<br><br>Response 2: The problem isn't not being on a mislynch wagon--of course that's not scummy. Don't act dense. It's because you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">say</span> you don't want Drixx lynched, but you fail to provide any substantive support to another lynch, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">which means you don't care</span>.<br><br>Response 3: You misinterpret me. I'm not saying you don't know--I'm saying you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do</span> have a brain stem, so you know what's up. And if you're speaking to his inexperience--he's got several games under his belt, and recent ones, too. He's not a complete moron, and would understand that there is absolutely <span style=\"font-style: italic\">zero</span> reason to try to select a night target publicly without information when you can do so privately with information. And as far as \"looking for evidence to clear him\" goes--point me to one person who voiced agreement with your thoughts of dragonspawn telegraphing his TheSoldier track.<br><br>Response 4: The problem is not that you're defending yourself, it's that you're trying to intimidate people. You threatened people with scumreads repeatedly, all while doing nothing of substance to demonstrate protown intent. And assuming every misdirected wagon is coming from scum is: 1) an argument from authority of your mentors, and 2) hilariously, patently, immediately wrong. Just this game, remind me, who was one of the main drivers of the wagon on dragonspawn, who's town? By your own \"logic\", we should have every reason to believe that you're scum.<br><br>Response 5: Not making mistakes my ass. Committing to reads makes you more easy to read, helps other townies evaluate your reads so you have a better picture of the game, and generally is much, much better for town. It also helps ensure that your thought process is internally consistent. Not providing reads is scummy. Don't pretend it isn't. And guess what? Being wrong about your secondary reads when your primary one is right <span style=\"font-style: italic\">literally does nothing bad</span> if it's a good-faith case. You just don't need to post your secondary reads because you don't need reads at all--just the appearance of not knowing the scumteam with total certainty.<br><br>Response 6: You just said that you assume those accusing you are scum, and respond vigorously. And yet you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did not do so for someone you claim to be scumreading</span>. You aren't scumreading him. You just saw what you thought was a chance to convince the town that TheSoldier and I are acting in concert, and jumped on it. Not happening.<br><br>Response 7a: If you would play ball, I wouldn't have to point out that you're not doing anything.<br>Response 7b: Two parts here. One: you refuse to address that I've called you on representing voting record as alignment-indicative. With Riabi noting that it isn't, suddenly you want to drop that piece of bullshit and hope we don't pick it up, but you're not getting away with that. Secondly, for the millionth time, it was a very, very short leap to (with my knowledge/assumptions), think that Riabi was claiming a shot vest.<br>-One person, someone who was going to be lynched Day 2, got killed Night 1.<br>-TheSoldier, someone generally very townie, claimed the kill.<br>-Players with bulletproof vests know that they got shot (this being the faulty bit)<br>-Riabi, an active and confirmed-town player, claimed a bulletproof vest.<br>Anybody can see how this amounts to me thinking \"oh, Riabi's claim implied he got shot Night 1\". And even once you remove the third bit, assuming Riabi got shot and TheSoldier is a vigilante makes much, much more sense than scum!Soldier and MonkeyMan being a threat to the scum team.<br><br>Response 8: You've responded now, yes--but you've twisted or evaded every point except the ones that, though compelling, are honestly open to interpretation. That post is a steaming pile of crap, and I'm not sure why I'm bothering with you--good practice, I suppose. You've already got what, three people on the wagon, one more with intent to hammer, and two others that believe me over you? Eh.<br><br>---<br><br>Honestly, I'm feeling pretty comfortable with a hammer right about now. Everyone has taken a stand on Random, and though Lapsa v. Shinobi isn't exactly settled yet, I wouldn't be chuffed if this draining rigmarole ended. Let's get the flip. Here's hoping I keep my ringside seat to Lapsa v. Shinobi tomorrow."}

There is no reason for me to lie.  It's clear you did not perceive where I was coming from.  I tried to be as clear as I could.  Titus understood me.  Kitty did too, though she pretended not to.  Why couldn't you?  To quote Cool Hand Luke, \"What we have here is a failure to communicate!\"  I will take my share of the responsibility for that failure.  I have a habit of not readings posts as carefully as I should.
