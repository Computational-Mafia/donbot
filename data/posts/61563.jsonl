It just means that I've played a few games on site. As an SE, I do my best to be helpful and answer questions from newer players. When I'm talking about theory and such, that's simply me discussing a game which I've enjoyed for decades. You shouldn't read my alignment either way based upon any theory posts I make. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, as a PSA: The general rule of behavior on site is attack the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">play</div>, not the <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">player</div>. This means that if you get irritated at someone in the game, it's okay to criticize their play or posts, but when you cross the line and attack the actual player, you are breaking the rules. Most folks on site are okay with some level of back and forth and breaking of this rule. There tends to be a \"grow thicker skin\" sort of attitude about it. I tend to believe that civil play benefits everyone. I won't start any fights, but if someone starts getting out of line, I will go hard at them. If you come at me personally, be prepared to pull back a stump. If you go after a newbie, be prepared to lose more than one limb.

With all this, wouldn't it have been painlessly easy to, instead of literally telling me you aren't going to address my questions, then telling me you just did, just agreeing with the option that I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">literally laid out for you</div>, that there were too many/too spread out for you to characterize?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nAs something that's not really content-related, the assumption that I'm not willing to play ball is more than a tad irritating. If you don't want to ask a question for reasons of time consumption, that's fine, but at the same time, actively avoiding the question, then putting more effort into answering questions I didn't ask than ones I did, does not cultivate an impression of good faith.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nA few notes about the jabs tossed at me: sometimes you have to be circumspect when talking to a scumspect. You claim I'm lying about you being hesitant to engage the question when you instead go on a tirade about the role of meta and your own meta--which amounts to very, very shallow content, by the way--after <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">literally saying you aren't going to answer the question</div>. And, again, claiming I demand X or Y while spending more energy defending your decision to not provide any significant meta than you would expend telling me you don't have the time or energy to do so from the get-go seems silly at best. Finally, for what it's worth, anyone can claim to be logical--but I've yet to see someone feel the need to claim it about theirself and be right about that. Useless thing to say, honestly.<br>\n<br>\nAll of this said, you've been defensive straight off the bat--and if you're as experienced as you say you are, this is an odd tack to take, and certainly not one that has me reading you town. That said, surprisingly enough, I'm <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> going in for a tunnel in the first 16 hours? Less? Of Day 1. And I'm satisfied that this line of questioning won't produce any new information for now. Might as well put my vote somewhere that it might create some pressure.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: UNVOTE</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Slandaar</span><br>\n<br>\nWhy a vote with no context 50 posts into Day 1 as your only post?

I don't think there's a lot of conclusions to draw from it just this moment ... but it may be quite useful later.

If I had to guess why, I think that people just couldn't believe scum would make the plays that we saw being made. And yet ... they did. Of course, I may be a little sensitive to flashwagons atm because I sadly derphammered the cop in that game on a wagon that started with a scum claiming to have a guilty result on the cop and the wagon went from zero to hammer in like 8 posts or something. <br>\n<br>\nIn general though, prior games are best used as a way to acclimate to someone's particular style if you have trouble reading them.

In this game for example: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=60599\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=60599</a> .<br>\n<br>\nIn that one, House was an IC. If he had come in showing town cred from the beginning, it would have made him an NK target, thus making his role as IC useless if he'd been NK'd.

That bit at the start of your post where you zeroed in on me using the word \"make\" was a really bad way to try and catch scum. Focusing in minutiae can get you into trouble because you simply cannot account for whether or not the things you're seeing are alignment indicative. For example, I teach <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek\" class=\"postlink\">Koine Greek</a> currently, as part of my work load. As a result of working with linguistic syntax frequently as a function of my work, I will frequently think/speak/write using word choices that may not be the norm. For example, the words \"make\" and \"form\" are linguistically very similar and have close etymological backgrounds. If you try and read alignment into my word choices, you're going to spend the entire game on a wild goose chase. <br>\n<br>\n@Terrador - I'm careful and deliberate and try to be logical. Your question looked like a no win proposition to me. On this site I have so far been hard to read for most people, and in completed games that I can talk about there have been a few town tunnels, but usually if I'm being scumread as town, it's scum manipulating my particular oddities to try and get me lynched off. In that completed game Dragonspawn was referring to where he was scum, the observers in the dead thread were able to perfectly read me as town, but the living players in game got super confused. They managed to have 3 townies in the top 4 scum suspects, having me in there mostly for the aforementioned derphammer. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, since Dragonspawn doesn't want to answer the question and it's not really fair of him to make people go digging for the answer: House deliberately goes out of his way to be impossible to read. The more people can't figure out what he's doing, the better. In that same game we were in together, he was the Town Tracker, while I was a BP who breadcrumbed my role by starting every sentence from the end of my post going backwards with the letters to spell out Bulletproof {Yes, really}. When push came to shove and I had to quote that post and highlight those letters {to the townie who was eventually mislynched for the scum win ... sigh}, House counterclaimed me for some reason. Amusingly, scum thought I was actually a bomb or something. In short, Dragonspawn is attempting to be enigmatic and unreadable. I sincerely hope he does <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> take it to House level shenanigans ... we really don't need another one of those floating around. <br>\n<br>\nThat was a nice sleep.

Let me know what you think about this wagon gaining speed on me. <br>\n<br>\nI've lost count over the years of how many obviously badly motivated wagons like this that I've seen result in mislynches. I can only remember a very few times when the townie caught up in them was able to talk his way out of it.

I'm being read as scummy because I didn't want to answer an obviously loaded question directly and chose to give answers to what seemed like the underlying motives of such an obvious trap question. Then I mocked people for really bad logic and did a little trolling, and voila, here we are in a no win situation. If I defend myself, I'm scummy. If I don't defend myself, I'm scummy. If I swap to the third person to joke and lighten the mood, I'm scummy. Etc... etc... <br>\n<br>\nPeople will either come to their senses or not. At least the day already has something that will be useful later. There's no way that early flashwagon ends up being useless for PoE later on. Even this really bad wagon on me will be useful, given how awful some of the reasons people are using to hop on are. <br>\n<br>\nAnd here I was looking forward to a game with a couple friends in it.

I stopped reading his post. I'm not familiar with his argument. Also, this is pointless. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the present moment, we had two interesting things happen coming out of RVS. The flashwagon and then the back and forth between Torrador and I that has led to the wagon on me presently. A third interesting thing (The Lynch all Liars invocation) happened in the last little bit. As I think I said, I am tinkering with my style from game to game, and largely the \"read\" on me is down to things that are largely not reliable as alignment indicators. <br>\n<br>\nThe best move for the long term game is to set aside the wagon for poor reasons coming out of RVS. There's still a lot of time left on day one, and this back and forth around me is stifling the game from moving out of RVS and opening up. I only look like a good target because there has been almost nothing else noteworthy, aside from the early flashwagon that happened. Set aside focusing on me for a hot second and talk about some other stuff. You can always come back to me if nothing legitimately scummy happens during this day phase, but right now there's probably nothing I can say that will make anyone suddenly decide I'm Townie McTownerson. If you lynch me now, you'll just have a day 1 mislynch (generally the day 1 outcome) but not much else out of day one to go on. <br>\n<br>\nThe best thing is to let the game breathe a bit. You can always come and mislynch me later in the day phase if nothing changes. The difference will be that a lot more conversation that isn't focused in on me because I decided to troll and have some fun being dismissive of what I view as a terrible case. Anyone who actually thinks me being standoffish and trolling in response to the standard early day one oversensitivity case is an actual scum tell probably hasn't been playing mafia for long enough. The early day one cases and responses are generally not super useful for discerning alignment. <br>\n<br>\nThat said, even if I were scum, it would <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">still</div> be better for the town to spend some of day one so that there is content later on to come back to in light of later events and flips and things that help with PoE later on. <br>\n<br>\nI need to go back to work on fixing dinner now. Think about what I'm saying with the confirmation bias turned off please. It would be a terrible start to give up the amount of conversation that usually takes place on day 1 just because I chose to screw around with my response to a bad early day 1 case.", "time": "Fri Apr 24, 2015 11:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

I was put off by the exchange I mentioned earlier, but it is probably just banter. It has kind of faded in with so many pages now. I am not sure why he thought I was saying that people shouldn't defend themselves when accused of being scummy. That isn't what I was saying at all, the tone of the exchange felt inorganic. Of course people will defend themselves, town and scum alike. Weird. <br>\nnull<br>\n<br>\nThe Soldier: I like the way he thinks so far, I don't see anything out of line. It feels town motivated, questioning and reassessing. Looking forward to hearing more.<br>\nlean town<br>\n<br>\nKeyblade: Not a whole lot of content yet.

So far too early to tell.<br>\nnull<br>\n<br>\nRandomActs: I like the activity so far. I really appreciate the stance on \"town looking scummy\" on purpose thing. I think there are too many reasons not to act scummy on purpose, except particular situations, like the IC thing that was mentioned. As a rule, there are so many styles of playing that people have adopted, and people find scumminess in different styles. For me it is about motivation and protown vs. antitown play. <br>\n<br>\nDrixx: I just finished a game with Drixx. I am not quite sure what to think here. He can be condescending and he pissed me off more than once. He explained here he is trying to stop this. I have not seen him get so touchy and defensive though, usually he just has an arrogance about him. So this is a side of Drixx I haven't seen. Usually he is logical and methodical, but sadly, I am not seeing that as much, so far, in this game. He seems much more emotional. I really don't care for the defensiveness, the snarkiness I am used to. I don't see town motivation here.<br>\nlean scum<br>\n<br>\nRiabi: So far good effort and content, game theory, questions. I can easily understand his posts and reasoning. I am not seeing anything that makes me pause. I can't say one way or the other though strongly.<br>\nnull<br>\n<br>\nTerrador:I feel like he has a lot of experience and can weed stuff out quickly. He is quick to say what he sees as a misunderstanding/misrep? #82/#111. Very eager to get into game play, and plenty of activity. I am totally behind the Drixx assessment. Terrador held himself to logic and passed on the emotion, aggressive, but I don't think it is overt. Just means business and getting to it.<br>\nlean town<br>\n<br>\nVictor: Hmm. Not getting a warm fuzzy feeling, not that I am looking for it, just not seeing as much real effort put in as much as other players. I know it is early, so I give it time and see what develops.<br>\nnull<br>\n<br>\nDragonspawn: Ehhhh... just eww. Question- Do you still think this is Drixx's town game? I am not seeing a whole lot of town motivation here. Just a lot of criticizing. Not much in the way of content. <br>\nlean scum<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar:See.. here. He makes 2 posts, one of them I am like \"wtf?\" that's it, then comes in with a spot on post. Something with effort and value. You don't have to post a lot, just make it real. That said, the one post is not enough for me to lean town. Looking forward to more posts, one good one isn't enough to get a read, no matter how much I like it. It's kind of weird, but this is the kind of post I am used to seeing Drixx make.<br>\n<br>\nZerediah: So, nothing here. Really. What do you think of the game so far?<br>\nnull<br>\n<br>\nLapsa: Why are you accusing people of lying, wtf? Post stye reminds me of Oka. Not enough to lean scum, but hopefully will see something of substance. Could be just weird. <br>\nnull<br>\n<br>\nCan I get a current vote count? <br>\n<br>\nDrixx sorry I know we know each other, but really your behavior and tone are off from last game.

If you want to call somebody scum, case them. If you want to defend yourself directly, deconstruct cases against you, or construct a case that your play has been protown. If you don't bother doing this, expect to be lynched, and soon, with nobody but yourself to blame.</div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nINCIDENTALLY, while this isn't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">wholly</div> relevant to the Drixx case, there's a lovely fanmade Dinosaur Comic (courtesy of a fellow who goes by Refa) that I feel the need to share.<br>\n<img src=\"http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb147/achagam/AMPM%202%20Mafia-%20Night%201%20Announcement_zpsevoh0smj.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nHOKAY, now that we're done with that, let's get on to the rest of the game!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@VictorDeAngelo's</div> <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6802856#p6802856\" class=\"postlink\">#191</a>, failing to produce content 12 hours into a what, 336-hour phase? Didn't ping me much at the time. Looking back over Zerediah's posts now, I'm feeling a tad suspicious, but prodding a lurker early into Day 1 isn't exactly an antitown use of one's vote.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Lapsa</div>: I think it's obvious that you're trying to demonstrate that you are active lurking and paying attention to the game; further, I suspect your lies to Monkeyman and Riabi were reaction tests; I fail to see reasonable scum reward vs. risk for that at the surface level. I would still love to see content from you eventually, but I've yet to pull a scumread from your play. That said, I would love to see an explanation for your Zerediah vote.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Monkeyman</div>: Why do you feel that Lynch All Liars is something that should be relevant here? I understand its value as a metastrategy to make cops and doctors stronger, but I don't see how it's really relevant here. If Lapsa's been playing like this successfully for a long time, we're not going to pressure him into playing seriously this way. Furthermore, do you  believe that a Day 1 policy lynch would be appropriate? Or was the implied timetable something else?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Zerediah</div>, I would've gladly given you the benefit of the doubt re: potentially OMGUSing Victor, but you literally copped to voting him for a petty reason. Don't you have anything better to do with your vote? Do you have any other scumreads?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WRT: dragonspawn vs. VictorDeAngelo</div>: I think this stems from a misunderstanding of Victor's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6797355#p6797355\" class=\"postlink\">#27</a>, to begin with. When Victor says \"Why are we discussing this?\", it's not re: lynching MonkeyMan, as I originally thought; the antecedent is MonkeyMan's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">line of discussion</div>. That said, Victor's points on dragonspawn aren't addressed by dragonspawn very well at all.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@dragonspawn</div>: Now that Victor's vote on MonkeyMan is cleared up:<br>\n-How would you read Victor now, and why?<br>\n-What do you think of Keybladewielder's reads post? Does it impact your read of him at all?<br>\nIn addition, I have a couple of questions for you as well.<br>\n-How is it \"opportunistic\" to be vote #2 on a wagon? Yes, TheSoldier voted Drixx before I did, but he was off the wagon by the time Drixx boarded it.<br>\n-You say there's on opposition to the Drixx wagon, and that he, ergo, must be town... but that really isn't the case. In my experience, I've been much more willing to defend an actual townie than my scumbuddy in the games I've rolled scum, and I imagine that a similar idea is held by other scum. Further, there is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> opposing the lynch, so that's at least one. Finally, given that Drixx is scum (which is not guaranteed, but I'm using this hypothetical for the sake of argument), his buddies may believe that defending him is fruitless; that he'll either defend himself before it gets late enough in the day for a hammer to be considered, or that he'll dig himself deeper and there will be no saving him.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nReads list below; scum are on top, townies are below. Note that this list is a rather rough one, and very, very subject to change. These are just my current impressions; Drixx and dragonspawn are firmly on the bottom, Zerediah and MonkeyMan are well above them, but not really townier than anyone else, Lapsa is Lapsa, but the pile from RandomActs to Slandaar is varying degrees of nulltown. In particular, the activity pattern from Kitty, Random, and to a lesser degree Slandaar isn't suspicious in vacuum, but reminds me of activity I've seen more than once from scum. (And if anyone wants to claim that's a weak reason to suspect people, you're right--that's why they're so relatively far away from the scum end of the list.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SCUM</div><br>\nDrixx<br>\ndragonspawn<br>\nZerediah<br>\nMonkeyMan576<br>\nLapsa<br>\nRandomActs<br>\nKitty Galore<br>\nVictorDeAngelo<br>\nTheSoldier<br>\nSlandaar<br>\nRiabi<br>\nKeybladewielder<br>\nTerrador<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TOWN</div><br>\n<br>\nGiven Keybladewielder's vote on Drixx and my hesitance to risk an early Day 1 end, I'm shifting my vote to my second-place scumspect.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: dragonspawn</span>", "time": "Sat Apr 25, 2015 6:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

Really? <br>\n<br>\nBecause no townie ever has to a PR to try and protect or any other reason to be wary, right? <br>\n<br>\nWow ... after all that build up, you finally got me to read that post and it consists of saying that I'm a horrible person for poking fun a Torrador with an obvious joke (Did anyone really take the T the terrible tunneler with gambling odds sentence seriously? Do I need to like use tags to make obvious humor actually obvious to young people or something?), and that if I were town I wouldn't have been hesitant about an obviously loaded question or worried that answering from memory might result in something someone could quote and then point out some other place that contradicts it and invoke LAL on me. <br>\n<br>\nIn a game where Lynch all Liars has already been opportunistically invoked against someone who was obviously trying to joke with a friend. <br>\n<br>\nReally? <br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"><br>\n<br>\nWhat am I supposed to defend myself from exactly? It looked like an obvious loaded question with no possible right answer. I tried to answer what seemed like the underlying motives. T-dog (can I call you T-dog man?) actually posted, presumably with a straight face, that the question was serious and had no hidden motives. How on earth could me saying \"yes I sometimes get misread\" been at all helpful. Is there anyone ever in the history of mafia who doesn't sometimes get misread? Does anyone actually think that question was legit? <br>\n<br>\nYou got my juices flowing and got me all worked up and ready to defend myself against this supposedly \"really solid\" case, and it amounts to \"A townie shouldn't have to worry about looking bad or having something he says manipulated to look like a lie.\" which is so obviously not true as to be painful. <br>\n<br>\nTotal let down. You just lost 10 Drixx points for making me read that on the premise that it was actually something that I could even defend myself from, even if I thought it had enough merit. How do I defend myself from someone's subjective opinion on what a townie should or shouldn't feel about an early question that looks like an obvious trap? I mean ... the \"townies don't need to worry about being misrepresented as liars\" {Paraphrased} premise alone is completely absurd. How do you think townies get mislynched all the time? Because other town are perfectly rational and logical and somehow still build a false case against them? (the majority of mislynches are town driven). <br>\n<br>\nIf you guys really want to lynch me because I'm older and felt like there was zero upside to a specific answer to that question (and already explained such a very long time ago), then erm... more power to you? I'll flip town and maybe a few of you will learn that town really does have a reason to worry about moonlogic cases and badly invoked LAL and all that. <br>\n<br>\nI'm trying to defend myself with a straight face here but I can't remember anyone ever giving such an on the face absurd \"case\" before that was praised by so many others as a \"good\" or \"solid\" case. At pretty much every point it fails logically. On top of that, Slandaar was either being intentionally ironic or is completely oblivious to humour. I'm not yet certain which. He's got that thug picture that makes me want to take him all serious (Is that \"Omar\" from The Wire?) but then he comes in with really really really bad logic. Let's break it down quote by quote:<br>\n<br>\n1.) Focuses in on a word. If I had used the near synonym \"form\", which carries almost the same exact meaning as \"make\", would he have noticed? Am I obligated to poll everyone in the thread so I can try and use the correct colloquial speech for where everyone lives? The inevitable consequence of amassing a familiarity with language and the necessary vocabulary is word choice that doesn't seem natural ... because it isn't. Check out the completed newbie game that I played with kitty and see where I unintentionally upset her and talked about what I do for a living and how it sometimes causes problems in mafia. This isn't some on the spot AtE defense on my part. It's just a part of who I am. I can't really help it, much as I would like to. This isn't the first nor will it be the last time that my vocation's impact on my thinking and speaking patterns causes a problem in mafia. <br>\n<br>\n2.) Says that I should be willing to give subjective answers and just call someone out for nitpicking afterward. In point of fact, that approach simply doesn't work. Third party observers generally either ignore the whole mess or they assume the victim of the nitpicking is scum because all they can say in defense is that the attacker is nitpicking. I've been down that road before, plenty of times. Why do you think I intentionally decided not to go down it this game even though I knew that said decision would call attention to me? <br>\n<br>\n3.) Calls me terrible again (there's a pattern of him calling me terrible ... and to this point I hadn't directed any sarcasm at Slandaar, so note that he opened up on me first calling me terrible and bad over and over. I didn't know this until now, but if I had read that post before my trolling would have been 10x as harsh). Then says townies should have no reason to worry about someone misrepresenting them for giving an answer to a subjective question which could be twisted to make them look like a liar. This is patently false for reasons I already covered. <br>\n<br>\n4.) He criticizes me for pointing out that the question was obviously bait, but not using it to scumhunt. When I said that the question was baited, Terrador backed off and acted like he had no ulterior motive and just actually wanted to know what my personal mafia story was like, specifically when it comes to being misread. That's an obvious falsehood on Terrador's part, but that's his response to me calling it out as an obvious bait question. That was me pinging him for a response, and he responded, with a response that seems nearly impossible to believe is true. Bonus points for apparently missing the point that the 2nd part of #104 was completely a joke where I poked a little fun at Terrador. Shouldn't the \"the terrible tunneler\" moniker and the gambling odds have been clear indicators that I wasn't being serious? I get that it was a little dry as far as humour goes ... but really?<br>\n<br>\n5.) I then get mocked for making a post where I quote myself giving fairly lengthy and semi-serious responses trying to give Terrador the benefit of the doubt and provide him with information that seemed relevant to the probable town motives that would result in the question Terrador asked. {If he is town and the question was sincere, then Terrador wanted some context to help him read me accurately.}<br>\n<br>\n6.) See #2. Trying to defend against a misrep is ridiculously hard. A site rule prevents me from elaborating upon this in the way that I would like. Instead I'll elaborate in this way: On my first game on site I was able to misrepresent a really good town player as scum so successfully that it resulted in an easy scum win and the people who played that game with me being unable to trust me afterward. There was a discernible ripple effect from my use of the strategy. Having employed it to fantastic effect, I'm obviously quite aware of how impossible it is to defend against. Lots of people on site have identified this particular avenue of attack as quite effective. I even noted that it was sort of in play against me right now when I made the 3rd person post with me \"singing\" the \"Everything you do is scummy...\" line. Some people call it the \"regardless card\". It's basically a manipulation of the confirmation bias effect by scum. <br>\n<br>\nSo there you go ... some exasperation with a point by point serious evaluation of said case.", "time": "Sat Apr 25, 2015 10:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

Typically, at least in my experience, the best we have is circumstantial cases with some logic thrown in for good measure. So, yeah, MonkeyMan pointed out more circumstantial evidence against you, I don't see a problem with that.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my own confirmation bias, yeah, I admit, it would be pretty damn hard for you to convince me that you're town at this point. But, for me, it's less about the case Slandaar made against you and more about how you reacted to it. Anytime a player starts lashing out at other players when the pressure is on them, it's immediately suspicious. Had you come out with that point by point that you made right after Slandaar's post, I would have moved on to my next in line, no question. For me, the reason to put pressure on people D1 is to see how they react to it because, as stated above, we don't often have a lot to go on. Typically, a townie is not going to get defensive when face with pressure, desperate maybe, but not defensive.

Do you have any other scumreads?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WRT: dragonspawn vs. VictorDeAngelo</div>: I think this stems from a misunderstanding of Victor's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6797355#p6797355\" class=\"postlink\">#27</a>, to begin with. When Victor says \"Why are we discussing this?\", it's not re: lynching MonkeyMan, as I originally thought; the antecedent is MonkeyMan's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">line of discussion</div>. That said, Victor's points on dragonspawn aren't addressed by dragonspawn very well at all.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@dragonspawn</div>: Now that Victor's vote on MonkeyMan is cleared up:<br>\n-How would you read Victor now, and why?<br>\n-What do you think of Keybladewielder's reads post?

Yes, TheSoldier voted Drixx before I did, but he was off the wagon by the time Drixx boarded it.<br>\n-You say there's on opposition to the Drixx wagon, and that he, ergo, must be town... but that really isn't the case. In my experience, I've been much more willing to defend an actual townie than my scumbuddy in the games I've rolled scum, and I imagine that a similar idea is held by other scum. Further, there is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> opposing the lynch, so that's at least one. Finally, given that Drixx is scum (which is not guaranteed, but I'm using this hypothetical for the sake of argument), his buddies may believe that defending him is fruitless; that he'll either defend himself before it gets late enough in the day for a hammer to be considered, or that he'll dig himself deeper and there will be no saving him.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nReads list below; scum are on top, townies are below. Note that this list is a rather rough one, and very, very subject to change. These are just my current impressions; Drixx and dragonspawn are firmly on the bottom, Zerediah and MonkeyMan are well above them, but not really townier than anyone else, Lapsa is Lapsa, but the pile from RandomActs to Slandaar is varying degrees of nulltown. In particular, the activity pattern from Kitty, Random, and to a lesser degree Slandaar isn't suspicious in vacuum, but reminds me of activity I've seen more than once from scum. (And if anyone wants to claim that's a weak reason to suspect people, you're right--that's why they're so relatively far away from the scum end of the list.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SCUM</div><br>\nDrixx<br>\ndragonspawn<br>\nZerediah<br>\nMonkeyMan576<br>\nLapsa<br>\nRandomActs<br>\nKitty Galore<br>\nVictorDeAngelo<br>\nTheSoldier<br>\nSlandaar<br>\nRiabi<br>\nKeybladewielder<br>\nTerrador<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TOWN</div><br>\n<br>\nGiven Keybladewielder's vote on Drixx and my hesitance to risk an early Day 1 end, I'm shifting my vote to my second-place scumspect.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: dragonspawn</span></div></blockquote></div><br>\n<br>\nThis is a solid post with solid reasoning.

It looked like an obvious loaded question with no possible right answer. I tried to answer what seemed like the underlying motives. T-dog (can I call you T-dog man?) actually posted, presumably with a straight face, that the question was serious and had no hidden motives. How on earth could me saying \"yes I sometimes get misread\" been at all helpful. Is there anyone ever in the history of mafia who doesn't sometimes get misread? Does anyone actually think that question was legit? <br>\n<br>\nYou got my juices flowing and got me all worked up and ready to defend myself against this supposedly \"really solid\" case, and it amounts to \"A townie shouldn't have to worry about looking bad or having something he says manipulated to look like a lie.\" which is so obviously not true as to be painful. <br>\n<br>\nTotal let down. You just lost 10 Drixx points for making me read that on the premise that it was actually something that I could even defend myself from, even if I thought it had enough merit. How do I defend myself from someone's subjective opinion on what a townie should or shouldn't feel about an early question that looks like an obvious trap? I mean ... the \"townies don't need to worry about being misrepresented as liars\" {Paraphrased} premise alone is completely absurd. How do you think townies get mislynched all the time? Because other town are perfectly rational and logical and somehow still build a false case against them? (the majority of mislynches are town driven). <br>\n<br>\nIf you guys really want to lynch me because I'm older and felt like there was zero upside to a specific answer to that question (and already explained such a very long time ago), then erm... more power to you? I'll flip town and maybe a few of you will learn that town really does have a reason to worry about moonlogic cases and badly invoked LAL and all that. <br>\n<br>\nI'm trying to defend myself with a straight face here but I can't remember anyone ever giving such an on the face absurd \"case\" before that was praised by so many others as a \"good\" or \"solid\" case. At pretty much every point it fails logically. On top of that, Slandaar was either being intentionally ironic or is completely oblivious to humour. I'm not yet certain which. He's got that thug picture that makes me want to take him all serious (Is that \"Omar\" from The Wire?) but then he comes in with really really really bad logic. Let's break it down quote by quote:<br>\n<br>\n1.) Focuses in on a word. If I had used the near synonym \"form\", which carries almost the same exact meaning as \"make\", would he have noticed? Am I obligated to poll everyone in the thread so I can try and use the correct colloquial speech for where everyone lives? The inevitable consequence of amassing a familiarity with language and the necessary vocabulary is word choice that doesn't seem natural ... because it isn't. Check out the completed newbie game that I played with kitty and see where I unintentionally upset her and talked about what I do for a living and how it sometimes causes problems in mafia. This isn't some on the spot AtE defense on my part. It's just a part of who I am. I can't really help it, much as I would like to. This isn't the first nor will it be the last time that my vocation's impact on my thinking and speaking patterns causes a problem in mafia. <br>\n<br>\n2.) Says that I should be willing to give subjective answers and just call someone out for nitpicking afterward. In point of fact, that approach simply doesn't work. Third party observers generally either ignore the whole mess or they assume the victim of the nitpicking is scum because all they can say in defense is that the attacker is nitpicking. I've been down that road before, plenty of times. Why do you think I intentionally decided not to go down it this game even though I knew that said decision would call attention to me? <br>\n<br>\n3.) Calls me terrible again (there's a pattern of him calling me terrible ... and to this point I hadn't directed any sarcasm at Slandaar, so note that he opened up on me first calling me terrible and bad over and over. I didn't know this until now, but if I had read that post before my trolling would have been 10x as harsh). Then says townies should have no reason to worry about someone misrepresenting them for giving an answer to a subjective question which could be twisted to make them look like a liar. This is patently false for reasons I already covered. <br>\n<br>\n4.) He criticizes me for pointing out that the question was obviously bait, but not using it to scumhunt. When I said that the question was baited, Terrador backed off and acted like he had no ulterior motive and just actually wanted to know what my personal mafia story was like, specifically when it comes to being misread. That's an obvious falsehood on Terrador's part, but that's his response to me calling it out as an obvious bait question. That was me pinging him for a response, and he responded, with a response that seems nearly impossible to believe is true. Bonus points for apparently missing the point that the 2nd part of #104 was completely a joke where I poked a little fun at Terrador. Shouldn't the \"the terrible tunneler\" moniker and the gambling odds have been clear indicators that I wasn't being serious? I get that it was a little dry as far as humour goes ... but really?<br>\n<br>\n5.) I then get mocked for making a post where I quote myself giving fairly lengthy and semi-serious responses trying to give Terrador the benefit of the doubt and provide him with information that seemed relevant to the probable town motives that would result in the question Terrador asked. {If he is town and the question was sincere, then Terrador wanted some context to help him read me accurately.}<br>\n<br>\n6.) See #2. Trying to defend against a misrep is ridiculously hard. A site rule prevents me from elaborating upon this in the way that I would like. Instead I'll elaborate in this way: On my first game on site I was able to misrepresent a really good town player as scum so successfully that it resulted in an easy scum win and the people who played that game with me being unable to trust me afterward. There was a discernible ripple effect from my use of the strategy. Having employed it to fantastic effect, I'm obviously quite aware of how impossible it is to defend against. Lots of people on site have identified this particular avenue of attack as quite effective. I even noted that it was sort of in play against me right now when I made the 3rd person post with me \"singing\" the \"Everything you do is scummy...\" line.

We disagree on a lot of things (whether Drixx is a good lynch, my alignment, whether my keyblade vote was reasonable, etc) but I can see his posts coming from a town mindset - not wanting to rush things, trying to get people to double-check their reads... and the crown jewel really is the last bit of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6802942#p6802942\">195</a>. He was first person to note that a steamroller wagon isn't a good sign, which is an entirely protown thing to do imo. If he were scum, he could have easily just not posted that and pretended to be convinced by kitty or something; closing off that option for fleeting towncred just feels like a weak play. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riabi</div>: His tone feels correct (read: gutread), and I like that he's focusing on more that just the Drixx wagon. I'd be surprised if he flipped scum atm, but he's my weakest townread.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar</div>: His first post was meh, but everything since then has been solid throughout. I also find myself agreeing with his reads. His posts have mostly been about Drixx though, so I'd love to hear about his opinions of others. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NULL/MIXED</div>:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riabi</div>: I really don't know what it is, since I like most of his posts, but there's something I can't place that makes me unsure about his towniness.

Reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6801840#p6801840\">183</a> aren't awesome but seem natural.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">SCUM</div></div>:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MonkeyMan</div>: I didn't have any bad feelings about him early on, but now he worries me a bit. He's been around enough to make short posts about himself, but only weighs in on the Drixx wagon very recently, despite this being the issue 90% of the thread has been about. Opportunistic scum is a real possibility.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Drixx</div>: Read the earlier part of the post... or really, most of the thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:yellow\">FROM OUTER SPACE</div></div>:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lapsa</div>: From what I gather, nothing we do is going to change the way he does D1s. He apparently does start doing comprehensible things from D2 onwards though, so I propose that we give him a chance to get there.

Could you give us a case for why you believe Drixx is scum?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Dragonspawn</div>, I've got a few bones to pick with you.<br>\n-Do you have any intention of answering my queries directed at you in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6803659#p6803659\" class=\"postlink\">#234</a>?<br>\n-Several times, most recently in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6805496#p6805496\" class=\"postlink\">#325</a>, you've supported Drixx--here, saying he's town and going to be a mislynch. That's all fine and dandy, but I have a couple of sub-questions here:<br>\n-You say Drixx is an asset to town in #325--what has he done to assist the town in any way thus far?<br>\n-Can you actually deconstruct the case on Drixx in any meaningful way, or is the meta of having a large wagon early all that you can cite to suggest he's town? As TheSoldier points out in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6805577#p6805577\" class=\"postlink\">#330</a>, there are plenty of other reasonable meta examples. Personally, as scum, I would gladly sheep this wagon on my buddy to establish towncred while focusing my posting energies on other \"scumreads\". If he defended himself adequately, I'd bounce off.<br>\n-I have a fundamental disagreement with the sentiment expressed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6807656#p6807656\" class=\"postlink\">#337</a>; scumhunting is not about detail-hunting. It's about reading intent. Scum can establish all the towncred in the world, but that's worthless if they're so town that they're causing unnecessary scum lynches, or conspicuous for not being NK'd as \"obvtown\" late into the game. Are you still sure it's about hunting details?<br>\n-Your suspicion of TheSoldier still feels strange to me. I get that you don't believe Keyblade's explanation of \"I just have an erratic earlygame, it takes the stress off when there's little work to be done anyway\", but why would you say it's so unbelievable that TheSoldier is suspicious for buying it? What of TheSoldier's other posts; where do you see his intent going?<br>\n-I don't like your Keyblade read, but at very least it looks cogent upon inspection; Keyblade's still got a fair few fluffy posts, has an honestly weak sheep on the Drixx wagon, and has yet to make any really substantial casing happen.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@TheSoldier</div>'s reads post looks really, really good.

Eager to see her post more. <br>\n-@Kitty, how experienced would you say you are in mafia (the game, not playing specifically as the alignment)? How often do you make particularly bold plays (far-out reads, next-level mindgaming the town as scum, etc.)?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to Drixx, I figure I might as well out what purpose, specifically, those questions for him had. They were meant to serve as a \"clear trap\", as it were; if, not knowing why I wanted the answers, Drixx said \"yeah, I've got a history of early mislynches\", or anything remotely to that effect, I would understand his defensiveness in calling one vote + one FoS a wagon. I know the fear of a mislynch all too well, but his responses have just been next-level defensive.

That way I feel like I'm not missing something that might not jump out at me. Basically an occasional read list. This way I can keep track of what I'm getting off of people and try to reassess. I have been known to hold a read and then start confirmation bias, so I really want to improve that part of my game and look with fresh eyes at everyone. As the days progress and there are lynches/nk's of course there is a lot more to go on. But day one activity is so important IMO.<br>\n<br>\n@Terrador:\"-@Kitty, how experienced would you say you are in mafia (the game, not playing specifically as the alignment)? How often do you make particularly bold plays (far-out reads, next-level mindgaming the town as scum, etc.)?\"<br>\n<br>\nMy first experiences with mafia are on a social forum I belong to, I started playing last December. I am a big fan of Survivor and that's how it was explained to me. The games are written by forum members, usually themed, ungagged, with 12 hour phases. Very, very bastard games. I enjoyed them enough that I wanted to take it more seriously and found this site. I adore this site, although a two week day one was very hard to adjust to. I have played as both alignments on that site, and with a lot of newbs, characters, and luck I have been able to pull out more scum sided victories. They don't play day 1. Not much talking and rarely lynch. I am trying to change that though.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> It isn't a very serious game over there, just fun.<br>\n<br>\nMy experience here at mafiascum is 2 games in the newbie queue that I linked to earlier. My very first game I had no idea what to do, how to actually play on this site. I asked an etiquette question. Nachomamma8 replaced in as scum and ran with it, I fought hard and emotionally and when pieguyn replaced in saw that nacho was out of line... it was quite messy there, actually. It is a long story but a really good game. I was the doctor, although scum got their night action in late, I chose their target correctly by noodling it out. I am proud of that for my first game here. I ended up making it to the end as a power role, and town won. In that game I put my vote on scum and never looked back, it didn't work out for me so well in my next game. My second game was the one I just finished, day one was 39 pages! I hung onto my reads, way too hard though (as I mentioned above). They were terrible. I never had scum pegged. Scum was lynched back to back in spite of me. <br>\n<br>\nI haven't made any far out reads in my opinion. I could not figure out last game why no one saw what I saw, I realize now, if I am the odd one out, I need to look for what I am missing.

Personally, I'm not a fan of read lists, but, I know they are pretty popular around these parts, so I'll deal.<br>\n<br>\nI only preference this because it gives an opportunity for everybody to hear my thoughts on them.<br>\n<br>\nI'm confused here, why is he neutral as opposed to \"Slight town\" if he is, as you say \"Definitely not scum&#8221;?<br>\n<br>\nSimply not enough reads to be placed there. But based on current reads, he hasn&#8217;t made any bad ones so he can only rise up if he makes good reads and not bad ones.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure what you mean here. Could you give some examples please?<br>\n<br>\nWhile you and Monkeyman started convos during the RVS, keybladewielder intended to keep the RVS going since it was &#8220;fun&#8221;. He seems like the enjoyable type. Also, he I ISO&#8217;d him and he had already voted four different people. He seems to be joking around every time, and makes an excuse, then votes someone if they oppose him. I think he is trying to find reactions in everybody to see how they will reply. This can be seen as town, but with tons of fluff and constant vote-hopping, he deserves his rank.<br>\n<br>\nI could make nearly the same argument against you. Does this mean you'd put yourself in the \"SLIGHT SCUM\" category?<br>\n<br>\nDrixx is playing defensively while on a wagon, which can be seen as not his style of play, while my style of play could be generally what I play like. Drixx&#8217;s wagon play could be seen as forced, as nobody wants to get lynched on D1, while I have plenty of space to give different types of thoughts and not forced to play on the defensive side, even though I generally do.<br>\n<br>\nBut, has he done anything scummy? Not posting a lot is not necessarily scummy behavior. Why put him on your \"SLIGHT SCUM\" list if you haven't seen anything scummy from him?<br>\n<br>\nTheSoldier didn&#8217;t elaborate on his good read. I think he is just a one-shot wonder and expects to be unnoticeable because of one thing he did. But I&#8217;ve read through his other posts and they weren&#8217;t really helpful. If he elaborated on his post, scum people specifically, he has the potential to be NEUTRAL or SLIGHT TOWN.<br>\n<br>\nYou can't put a single person as your most likely scum target in this list? You really can't point a single finger?<br>\n<br>\nI only voted for Victor because nobody else is as scum as him. Doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll be keeping my vote. My vote varies based on reads I&#8217;ll have in the future. <br>\n<br>\nIf you can't make a determination, why is he your vote? You've said similar things about at least two other players on this list, yet, he's your vote. Why? And why wouldn't he be on your \"SCUM\" list if you think he's the most likely of us to be scum?<br>\n<br>\nVictor opposes everybody. I think misdirects the game more than what keybladewielder. Opposition is one&#8217;s own choice, and keybladewielder&#8217;s fluff seems more friendly (literally) than opposition.

Eh. I haven't posted as much as I'd have liked to, but I wouldn't say I'm coasting. A few questions for you:<br>\n<br>\n-You say Slandaar has made some very good posts and very bad posts. Could you give some examples of each?<br>\n-If Keyblade is \"slight scum\" for misdirecting the game, why isn't Lapsa there too?<br>\n-You said I didn't elaborate on my reads. I'm a little confused about this, since I thought I gave pretty detailed explanations. Anything you want clarified?<br>\n-Not a question but content is good, keep posting it so we can read you.<br>\n<br>\n@Terrador: Regarding RandomActs, I think his response was townie. I don't think hypothetical scum Random would stick his neck out to post that at risk of an accusation of rolefishing. It is normally indicative for scum mindsets to be actively looking for crumbs during the day, but this wouldn't have been a crumb so much as an entire loaf and actually pointing it out in the thread would be stupid.<br>\n<br>\nYou can't see any possibility of antitown intent in outing a possible mason, though? Wanna run that by me again?<br>\n<br>\nRegarding Dragonspawn, we have some clashing reads on him. I actually think he's town (reasoning is in my readspost). Talk to me on this.

We should really start coming together before time runs short, so we have a decent amount of time to react to L-1 claims and/or possibly switch wagons. <br>\n<br>\nEveryone should say who they're willing to lynch at this point and explain their vote, especially if they haven't before. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">People we definitely shouldn't lynch today:</div><br>\n-Terrador, Kitty: Obvtown, and I don't think I'm alone in thinking that.<br>\n-Lapsa, Victor, Random, Keyblade: They haven't posted much real material, and have no associative tells to go along with them.

I'd rather people go for Drixx today for that reason, not to mention that I'm not to clear on the reasons for his wagon existing.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">People I wouldn't cry about if we lynched them:</div> (aka who I'd compromise on)<br>\n-Zerediah: He's starting to do things, but some of his logic is a bit odd; also, he's given stances on everyone in the game at this point, so his lynch would have more info than other low-material players.<br>\n-MonkeyMan: My read on him is still in turmoil; my gut doesn't like the way he jumped on the Drixx wagon, but he's been fine other than that. Not too proactive, but he's consistent. If nobody wants to vote Drixx or Zerediah, I'd vote him to avoid a nolynch but otherwise no.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">People I want to lynch:</div><br>\n-Drixx: His emotional responses feel more like caught scum than frustrated town, and he's made no effort to find scum himself. He has plenty of posts, but most of them are saying his wagon sucks while not wanting to address the points, and the rest are seemingly resigning himself to being lynched. Regardless of his flip, we'll get tons of info from it - more than any other player I think, since everyone in the thread has taken a stance on Drixx at this point. Also, if we don't lynch him, he'll be a huge question mark for the entire game and I think it's best to get rid of those sooner than later.", "time": "Wed Apr 29, 2015 8:26 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

Personally, I'm not a fan of read lists, but, I know they are pretty popular around these parts, so I'll deal.<br>\n<br>\nMe: I only preference this because it gives an opportunity for everybody to hear my thoughts on them.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi:I'm confused here, why is he neutral as opposed to \"Slight town\" if he is, as you say \"Definitely not scum&#8221;?<br>\n<br>\nSimply not enough reads to be placed there. But based on current reads, he hasn&#8217;t made any bad ones so he can only rise up if he makes good reads and not bad ones.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi:I'm not sure what you mean here. Could you give some examples please?<br>\n<br>\nMe:While you and Monkeyman started convos during the RVS, keybladewielder intended to keep the RVS going since it was &#8220;fun&#8221;. He seems like the enjoyable type. Also, he I ISO&#8217;d him and he had already voted four different people. He seems to be joking around every time, and makes an excuse, then votes someone if they oppose him. I think he is trying to find reactions in everybody to see how they will reply. This can be seen as town, but with tons of fluff and constant vote-hopping, he deserves his rank.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi:I could make nearly the same argument against you. Does this mean you'd put yourself in the \"SLIGHT SCUM\" category?<br>\n<br>\nMe: Drixx is playing defensively while on a wagon, which can be seen as not his style of play, while my style of play could be generally what I play like. Drixx&#8217;s wagon play could be seen as forced, as nobody wants to get lynched on D1, while I have plenty of space to give different types of thoughts and not forced to play on the defensive side, even though I generally do.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi:But, has he done anything scummy? Not posting a lot is not necessarily scummy behavior. Why put him on your \"SLIGHT SCUM\" list if you haven't seen anything scummy from him?<br>\n<br>\nMe:TheSoldier didn&#8217;t elaborate on his good read. I think he is just a one-shot wonder and expects to be unnoticeable because of one thing he did. But I&#8217;ve read through his other posts and they weren&#8217;t really helpful. If he elaborated on his post, scum people specifically, he has the potential to be NEUTRAL or SLIGHT TOWN.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi:You can't put a single person as your most likely scum target in this list? You really can't point a single finger?<br>\n<br>\nMe: I only voted for Victor because nobody else is as scum as him. Doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll be keeping my vote. My vote varies based on reads I&#8217;ll have in the future.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi:If you can't make a determination, why is he your vote? You've said similar things about at least two other players on this list, yet, he's your vote. Why? And why wouldn't he be on your \"SCUM\" list if you think he's the most likely of us to be scum?<br>\n<br>\nMe: Victor opposes everybody. I think misdirects the game more than what keybladewielder. Opposition is one&#8217;s own choice, and keybladewielder&#8217;s fluff seems more friendly (literally) than opposition.

Meanwhile, I reread some of Drixx's posts while trying not to have any bias, and I can see him being town resigned to his fate. Full honesty here, one of the reasons I was scumreading him so heavily was because I was annoyed by his posting style and his seeming to give up. Those are stupid reasons, obviously. I'm looking forward to reading his effortpost. Time to change the wagons.

I will say I am not sure where I am on the OMGUS conversation. I think I understand where he was coming from, and it wasn't nefarious IMO. He called Drixx out for being OMGUS-y earlier in the game too. Post 277. This may not be a popular opinion, but I am not seeing outright scumminess here. I like that he is being questioned, and it seems he has gone quiet, but that could be RL. So not indicative. I am pretty on the fence with him still. Null. <br>\n<br>\nTheSoldier-Love, love, love his posts. I like how he is open, investigating and giving his opinions on topics in the thread, very pro town IMO. I like how he looks at things his own way, and not afraid to share an unpopular opinion. Has me rethinking my Monkeyman read. Lean Town<br>\n<br>\nKeyBlade-I don't know, I would think I would have a feel one way or the other by now. I am not seeing a lot of work. Looking forward to more participation from him. lean slightly scum<br>\n<br>\nRandom- Feels sincere and town motivated. I am nodding my head in agreement reading his posts, I don't see anything that pings me, or makes me question him. I would like to hear what his thoughts are on Monkeyman's play as a whole. Lean Town<br>\n<br>\nDrixx-Skimmed over the posts so far.. my eyes glaze over with the crap posted here. I see where he was coming from early, but when pushed to answer a question the reaction was terrible. For way too long. I still don't see town motivation here. I see a lot of selfish play. I don't remember Drixx being this way under pressure in the other game we played. He has said he is trying different methods, this is unsuccessful. I still Lean scum.<br>\n<br>\nRiabi- A ton of effort, pushing, scum hunting, looking in many directions and questioning and following up. Voting. lean town<br>\n<br>\nTerrador- I feel the same as before, not pushing quite as hard and voting as much as Riabi, but still working and scumhunting. Giving good information for town to consider re:WIFOM and association. lean town<br>\n<br>\nVictor- I don't like a lot of his posts. Or his activity, though I guess the latter is not alignment indicative. Not on it's own, but together? I think some of his responses are way over reactions . I don't know if this is how he usually is. I need to do some research here. lean slightly scum<br>\n<br>\ndragonspawn- I like his posting style, I don't agree with most of his assessments though. I don't see how he can be town reading an uncooperative Drixx who isn't acting in the best interest of town. Well, I guess, I can. Just from playing with Drixx before myself, I see how out of character it is. I have to ask though, is this going against the grain indicative of town here? I like it that he has conviction. I would like others opinions on this. His last post bothers me though, I don't believe he is correct. lean scum<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar-I like Slandaars no nonsense and probing tactics, he doesn't feed us his thoughts, his posts are thoughtful and make us think. I see play as town motivated. lean town<br>\n<br>\nZerediah- is playing now, finally getting some content here. I kind of feel like I need some more to go on, kind of late in the game. He said he is stronger day 2. Hopefully from here out. I get the shy noob feel. null<br>\n<br>\nLapsa- I just don't know. null<br>\n<br>\np-edit-Need to look more closely at Monkeyman, I see some points made.

If I were scum and thought I saw a crumb, I'd Keep it to myself and look for other crumbs, then off both masons in the night.   What you don't get from the text is my astonishment and confusion over the post.  It was too blatant to be a crumb.  If it was a mason claim, then it wasn't me who spilled it.  It would have been Terrador who just blurted this out of the blue.  The other option was it was some kind of joke, which Terrador thankfully clarified.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, some masons use a strategy of early disclosure of at least one of the masons.  And although I'm not fond of that strategy, I didn't know if this is what Terrador was trying to do.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing you should read from that post is a call for clarification, plain and simple.

I think that one of the reasons that scum coasts is that it's typically hard to do actual scum hunting and to do it well and not give something up if you're scum. Even if they don't make an obvious scum slip, there is typically good information to be found in the way they interact with other players. \"Non genuine\" scumhunting typically involves more interactions, and therefore is a source of more info.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat's possibly true, but it doesn't make him any more town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTown shouldn't have to be reminded to act like town.", "time": "Sun May 03, 2015 3:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

There is some chance of this changing if his upcoming novella really is spectacularly protown, but given that he's at L-3 and we're what, three or four days from deadline? I'm comfortable having my vote here:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Drixx</span><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nAlright, I want to look at MonkeyMan and <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Zerediah</div> nobody else because wow this part of the post took forty-five minutes?

I AM GOING TO HAVE A FUN DAY TOMORROW, THANK YOU CAFFEINE.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MonkeyMan</div>: I can wholeheartedly sheep TheSoldier's sentiments about Monkey having easy scumreads. The easiest wagon in the game, the astronaut (AKA Lapsa), and an inexperienced semi-lurker? Seems a bit much. He has a brief fight with VictorDeAngelo, but fails to mention him later, except for a <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6826888#p6826888\" class=\"postlink\">backhanded implication that he's scum</a>. Interesting, given that he doesn't talk about him. This doesn't really conform to what I would expect of a scumfight, nor a townie's treatment of a scummy person. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">On the off chance that my read on this is right, not such hopeful PoE (re: that interaction) for MonkeyMan here, eh?</div><br>\n<br>\nOf Lapsa, he says that he generally wouldn't like to lynch him Day 1 without a better target--yet, as early as <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6800999#p6800999\" class=\"postlink\">#171</a>, he says he would be down with a Lapsa lynch. I don't know about y'all, but I'm generally of the belief that being inconsistent with how they approach game theory (this holds more for established/experienced players; I don't consider it nearly as telling for folks getting into game/site meta) hints at scum intent. His <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6803893#p6803893\" class=\"postlink\">#244</a> corroborates the idea that he would be cool with a Day 1 Lapsa lynch, what with my lack of response to me asking if there's a different implied timetable. If I was being asked if I supported a Day 1 policy wagon and I didn't, I would get out from under that shit <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">immediately</div>, especially given <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6797470#p6797470\" class=\"postlink\">that MonkeyMan may have a history of being mislynched</a>. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I think his treatment of Lapsa suggests scum intent.</div><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6824464#p6824464\" class=\"postlink\">This post is downright awful</a>; he's attacking the credibility of TheSoldier (who looks pretty damn credible to me; in interests of full disclosure, I'm personally aware that he's a very competent fellow) immediately, and only later piecing together a response... and not a strong one, either (see the first quote of this post). Further, his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6826942#p6826942\" class=\"postlink\">#596</a> is jumping the gun a bit. After saying the scumteam is trying to lynch you, immediately after his vote on you, I'd say it's an entirely reasonable interpretation to consider that a scumread. And instead of ever really defending yourself, you just dismiss it as a scumwagon. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Pretty classic scum move to discredit the player, not the play, honestly.</div><br>\n<br>\nFinally, I could read a Drixx and MonkeyMan scumteam as being wholly consistent. Drixx himself said he <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6819591#p6819591\" class=\"postlink\">expected to be lynched Day 1 from roughly the 36 hour mark</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6804240#p6804240\" class=\"postlink\">MonkeyMan's limp onto the wagon is not exactly a pro post</a>. Certainly under the (already not exceptionally town) bar he's been setting. Looking at this interaction doesn't at all make me flinch when considering the prospect of a MonkeyMan x Drixx scum component; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I wouldn't put it past Drixx to mad-dog MonkeyMan on the hope that Monkey will be read as more town after such a violent attack by the first scumflip.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">In summary: MonkeyMan, in addition to generally not having strong content, backhandedly implies a player is scummy without even the slightest sort of case on him, is inconsistent with how he approaches the game's meta, undermines the credibility of his attackers more than he addresses their arguments, and has interactions with my/our top scumread that I hold to be consistent with scum distancing.</div> I still think Drixx is our best lynch today, but after this look, I would gladly consider MonkeyMan to the firm runner-up.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MonkeyMan</div>, please address the following.<br>\n1) Please concretely submit a read on VictorDeAngelo for us.<br>\n2) Did you know that Zerediah was a second-time player (first-time outside Newbieville, USA) upon entering this game?<br>\n3) You've been engaging with very few players. Does anyone seem solidly town to you? Why?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI read Zerediah's ISO, and I don't really have the energy to comment on it. It actually looked... a fair bit more town than I suspected? In no small part because I'm not sure a MonkeyMan-Zerediah scumteam is in this game. More on that come morning.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@dragonspawn</div>: I remain adamant on the (to date, implicit) point I've made that content before Drixx flips will do much more for town and for your credibility than content after the flip. If you don't have the energy for a full wall, I understand; however, a paragraph or two of pressure and/or case on Keyblade, as well as potentially on secondary scumreads, would be grand. Plus, if you can see any posts Drixx made that you really, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> can't see scum making, kindly point those bad boys out. Additionally, if Drixx is town, how would you determine the alignment on folks on his wagon?<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT: On dragonspawn, to boot: I'm not feeling half so strong on scum!dragonspawn at this point, in no small part to Victor's cut giving me a reason to look at that call-out on Random again. His play isn't fantastically strong, but I think I'm starting to smell town intent. In light of #608 (the only link in Victor's post above), I'm starting to see a pattern (if a small one, it is Day 1) of \"voice of reason with weak play\"--reminds me of town!myself, frankly.

{"number": 647, "id": "6830143", "user": "Drixx", "user_id": "25073", "content": "It's slightly more amusing than annoying to have people trying to look like they're contributing by asking me for my post before I've finished working on it. Like ... there's no chance that I'm not getting lynched today, no matter what I post. I'm only doing it to try and leave something good in the game. Day one reads are super difficult to get correct because there's literally no context for anything. Nobody has died, nobody is confirmed, nothing is more than speculation. I'm doing my best to make a post that you guys will actually read and that might actually prove helpful. <br>\n<br>\nIf you'd rather just kill me and see me flip and figure out the ramifications for yourselves, go ahead. I'm a Vanilla Townie and there's no way I'm going to ever draw a night kill after this day. My only possible utility would be somehow changing people's minds and successfully finding scum (MonkeyMan, Kitty and Lapsa are the three likeliest scum at the moment, in my opinion). The downside to me staying alive is gigantic. I'm easy lynchbait and I'll never be killed by scum. The worst possible scenario would be me doing too good a job and somehow staying alive today but remaining suspected all game and ending up in LYLO. <br>\n<br>\nThe best move for the town, for a ton of good reasons, is for me to be lynched today. Since we have time, I'm using it to try and leave what good I can. I'll give you cliff notes on what the conclusion will be ... although I've got thoughts about everyone in the game. I'm debating what to say about some people just because I know I'm town and I don't want to hurt the town by calling attention to strong town players or possible PRs or anything like that by mistake. I'm sure you can understand why I don't want to make the post lightly and without making sure I don't do more damage than good. I'm far more likely to accidentally out a PR on day one than I am to successfully find more than maybe one scum. <br>\n<br>\nMonkeyMay - Super obvious scum. He's obviously watching the game way more than he's posting. He doesn't really engage much with the game. There's almost nothing from him that's original. He super overreacted to the post where I gave some basic thoughts and said I'd make a more thorough post. Before that, I just had a bad feeling about him. His reaction to that and the reactions since have made him my top scum read. Look at how quickly he shows up to address what threatens him, and then he just disappears again. He appears to be very actively lurking. <br>\n<br>\nKitty - She has a tendency to start with reads and then find reasons to justify them. She doesn't change reads pretty much at all. She white knighted MonkeyMan to some extent. This is an associative read partially, but also a critique of her reads process which appears to be starting with gut reads and then trying to make the evidence fit. That's simply not a town approach to reads. <br>\n<br>\nLapsa - Repeated lies. Trying to appear like some kind of mad prophet or something. Seems to be trying the \"too obviously weird to be scum\" approach. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou guys can decide if you want to wait for me to refine my post, not. It is, after all, day 1 and no matter how much work I put into it, the reality is that I'm not very likely to give much more useful than a much more thorough version of the above reads, and my thoughts about the rest of the players could be more useful to scum than town, if I picked up on something that to them ends up being a clue that X person is a PR. Even if I were the best mafia player ever, and I'm not, I would have a hard time successfully finding scum on this particular day one. <br>\n<br>\nThe basic distillation of my three main scum reads is above, so if you don't care to read a bunch of spoiler tagged evaluation of everyone's posts that will be scrubbed of anything I'm worried could hurt town, then feel free to lynch me and move on. As I said earlier, the best town move, by a mile, is to lynch me and settle my alignment so that toMorrow can be used much more productively.", "time": "Mon May 04, 2015 11:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

That's all fine and dandy, but I have a couple of sub-questions here:<br>\n-You say Drixx is an asset to town in #325--what has he done to assist the town in any way thus far?<br>\n-Can you actually deconstruct the case on Drixx in any meaningful way, or is the meta of having a large wagon early all that you can cite to suggest he's town? As TheSoldier points out in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6805577#p6805577\" class=\"postlink\">#330</a>, there are plenty of other reasonable meta examples. Personally, as scum, I would gladly sheep this wagon on my buddy to establish towncred while focusing my posting energies on other \"scumreads\". If he defended himself adequately, I'd bounce off.<br>\n-I have a fundamental disagreement with the sentiment expressed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6807656#p6807656\" class=\"postlink\">#337</a>; scumhunting is not about detail-hunting. It's about reading intent. Scum can establish all the towncred in the world, but that's worthless if they're so town that they're causing unnecessary scum lynches, or conspicuous for not being NK'd as \"obvtown\" late into the game. Are you still sure it's about hunting details?<br>\n-Your suspicion of TheSoldier still feels strange to me. I get that you don't believe Keyblade's explanation of \"I just have an erratic earlygame, it takes the stress off when there's little work to be done anyway\", but why would you say it's so unbelievable that TheSoldier is suspicious for buying it? What of TheSoldier's other posts; where do you see his intent going?<br>\n-I don't like your Keyblade read, but at very least it looks cogent upon inspection; Keyblade's still got a fair few fluffy posts, has an honestly weak sheep on the Drixx wagon, and has yet to make any really substantial casing happen.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@TheSoldier</div>'s reads post looks really, really good. Excellent TL;DR on Drixx, his reads feel well-thought-out and natural.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kitty Galore</div> has been generating fantastic content, even if she hasn't had the time to put in particularly much work yet. Eager to see her post more. <br>\n-@Kitty, how experienced would you say you are in mafia (the game, not playing specifically as the alignment)? How often do you make particularly bold plays (far-out reads, next-level mindgaming the town as scum, etc.)?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to Drixx, I figure I might as well out what purpose, specifically, those questions for him had. They were meant to serve as a \"clear trap\", as it were; if, not knowing why I wanted the answers, Drixx said \"yeah, I've got a history of early mislynches\", or anything remotely to that effect, I would understand his defensiveness in calling one vote + one FoS a wagon. I know the fear of a mislynch all too well, but his responses have just been next-level defensive.

You've been very patient while I've been sick and I appreciate this so I'll answer your questions .<br>\n<br>\n1) I wasn't aware I didn't answer earlier. I may have been before I got sick but I don't remember how I missed it. I will take a look over the earlier post.<br>\n<br>\n2) I wasn't referencing anything that drixx has done already as being an asset. I was pointing out that he will be an asset in future points in the game from personal experiences I've had with hi..<br>\n<br>\n3)I'm not looking at the argument against drixx at all. I've been making my determinations based on the overall support for the wagon. Now I suppose if he is scum his partners could be bussing like crazy. Like I've said earlier if the scum and town agree on who to lynch it probably isn't to towns benefit.<br>\n<br>\n4) I see absolutely wrong with looking at details. Its how I find scum frequently. You find intent in the details5) my suspicion of the soldier was based on the fact that he backed down from good reasoning based on nothing. It had me wondering if he and key were working together and the initial response was just to show suspicion and when key started getting little more pressure. I'm still unsure about him but he has added alot more posts that feel town. I. Not scum reading him more at the moment. But I'll keep my eye on him.<br>\n<br>\nkeys posts still haven't changed my opinion of him. Still seeing alot of fluff. I'm not expecting a key lynch today so my vote won't be returning at this time.

I don't tend to move my vote around everyone I'm looking at, or suspecting.  <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, Drixx was very scummy to me early in the day, that has changed some. I said I would look at Monkeyman, and I see the points many have made. There is a lot of scummy play here, it is sneaky. Not just blatant anti town play as I saw Drixx play as being early on. Actually, early on I think Drixx would have voted Drixx, if he saw that play in another. Especially if he was the one who had asked the question. I always said I was concerned that the wagon on Drixx was unopposed, like Dragon said. Although Drixx's play was very different early on, I suspected him of experimenting with his play to our detriment. Which, if there was no other candidate would get my vote. I also mentioned glimmers of the Drixx I know. I have seen them again. <br>\n<br>\nWhich is funny, I wonder if he is trying to tell me something. In our last game, he promised this epic case...worked on it for days. Kept coming up with excuses it wasn't done. He was still working on it. Then he thanks me for making a scum slip and builds weak case on me. Finally admits later, there was no epic case. He was full of shit.

{"number": 691, "id": "6831984", "user": "Drixx", "user_id": "25073", "content": "No Kitty, please don't misrepresent me. I said I had an epic case on the IC as a way to draw fire. I actually had a case built up against someone else but our cop investigated him and cleared him in the chaos of the next morning, while the doc correctly reasoned that I would draw fire, and in a super town-sided series of events, that led to a perfect win; there was thus no reason to post the case. There's a difference between using something you're doing to try and test, and just not doing anything at all. If Choof had investigated someone else, I'd have posted my case and probably pursued the guy as he looked totally scummy day one. He was first place on the scum list before he got cleared, making the 2nd place guy the pretty obvious last scum. It took about I dunno ... 5 seconds or so, after thinking about the implications, to conclude who the final scum was. I think the IC knew right away too. You should look at that game again and see how He and I got out of the way and let the newer players find their way to the right answer and earn the win. I suspect it was much more useful to them that way, and considerably more satisfying than if I or the IC had just said \"X is the final scum, grats on the perfect game guys... don't expect another one for awhile.\" or something like that. <br>\n<br>\nHaving a big case in the works against someone but using that fact to draw fire by saying it was against the IC was just a tactic. I wouldn't actually lie (as town) about working on a draft; as a general rule, town should never lie about anything vital, and should only very carefully lie or imply things which are not true otherwise. After the claims, I simply saw no reason to dump a bunch of reasons on the game why a cop cleared player looked scummy. That would not have been helpful or useful and may have actually sidetracked the game if it was too convincing. Remember that not everyone believed the cop and doctor claims. I even pointed out the edge cases where one or the other could be false as a gambit so that people would think about things. I'm still a little sad that that game wasn't actually a heads up scum gambit by Cyrus, as <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> would have been a legendary play. I may still have that draft if you care to see it. I keep my mafia notes in a folder in my documents folder, going back years and years now heh. <br>\n<br>\nAlso; apples to oranges. I have been compiling thoughts on everyone's ISO into a notepad draft with formatting and such. All that's left really is to do a last pass and decide whether it's more useful to post it or not post it. When I flip, I'll be confirmed town. The questions are how sure am I that I've read things correctly and how sure am I that I haven't called attention to people we can't afford to lose? {The biggest concern, for me, is that I'll say something that doesn't seem important to me but will be a big clue to scum}. I already highlighted the most likely scum, from an inductive rational viewpoint, from day one. By day three, all three of those people may be super townie looking. Day one is always spotty and generally becomes a much better resource later when there's context.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn either case, I'm off to the humane society. The wife and I have been wanting to adopt a puppy for awhile and they're doing $5 adoptions in honor of the day {Not sure how they knew it was my lived instead of died anniversary, but whateves <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> } and we're going to see if they have any puppies young enough to crate train who aren't deathly scared of the wheelchair and who reach out and grab us. <br>\n<br>\nYou guys should absolutely not lynch anyone else today. Monkeyman is almost certainly scum, and he'll almost certainly <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">still be scum</div> tomorrow. I am a long term problem if left alive. Better to kill me now and ensure that nobody can use me as a smokescreen in later days. The last thing the game needs is another day(s) where 80% of the posts are discussions about me. You all can decide whether to hammer or not. You've got my biggest scum reads and the rest of what I have to say, as I outlined above, is a two edged sword. I am perhaps too paranoid, but I've seen good townies accidentally get crucial town PRs killed time and time again and I'd much rather I didn't do that.", "time": "Tue May 05, 2015 8:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

I didn't sign up for this game with the intent of being the day one lynch. In case you aren't experienced enough to know this yet: people who get early suspicion (for whatever reason) can never really shake that suspicion, even if a confirmed cop clears them {People just then theorize godfather}. Since I'm just a VT, it's not worth the risk to my wincon for me to try and dig out of the hole I dug for myself. Me dead means that scum will have no smokescreen going forward from ongoing debate about me. Me dead means everyone will know I was honest about my claim, and simply got off on the wrong foot and rubbed a few folks the wrong way early on. Me dead will allow people to use posts from today later to help me get a win out of the game. <br>\n<br>\nI would much rather make a graceful exit today and remove all negative utility. I am extremely unlikely to be good enough to outplay the inevitable suspicion and distraction it would be if I lived beyond today, and I almost certainly cannot expect to be good enough to bring home a win if I find myself in MYLO/LYLO in a couple months. In every possible way, the absolute best move for the town today is to lynch me. I'm not scum, but nobody but me will be sure of that until I'm dead. I don't want any cop wasting an investigate just to clear me. If the folks I read as scum aren't scum, they will be well advised to approach tomorrow a lot differently than today (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Especially MonkeyMan</div></div> who, as far as I can see from his ISO has never put any original thoughts into the game except for the fallacious assertion that I've posted reads and voted out of OMGUS motives. I can't tell if he's really dense and actually doesn't understand that OMGUS is an immediate visceral emotional response to a case/vote and not just someone suspecting or voting for someone who first made a case/voted for him. I don't think he actually misunderstands. I think He is scum who is hoping he can skate by on just active lurking and popping in any time someone says something bad about him. I mean ... if suspecting or voting for someone who first suspected/voted for me was OMGUS, I couldn't possibly suspect or vote for anyone ... and that's just idiocy.)<br>\n<br>\nThere is nothing but genuine intent here. I'm not trying to avoid being lynched. I think that it should be pretty clear that MonkeyMan is almost certainly scum, but he'll still be here tomorrow. I cannot imagine a situation with more downside than another 2 weeks of debate about me. Seriously. That's not at all useful to town. Please just lynch me and be done with it. <br>\n<br>\nIf you want a full reads list or something, say so. I've decided not to post a gigantic wall of text. I'll post expanded thoughts in the dead thread for anyone who might be interested in how I was reading things here at the end of day one and wants to see what I noted in the time I spent working on a draft. I'm fairly certain that there's way more chance my thoughts would harm town than find scum. Anyone who can't separate the scummy folks on my wagon from the townie need the practice anyway. {Hint, look for people who are actively engaging and trying to actually investigate things instead of people just sticking to a narrative}. <br>\n<br>\nUnless I come back after dinner and a movie to find myself miraculously alive, I'll see you all in the dead thread. Sorry that my attempts to mess with my play style and early acerbity and snark were a huge distraction. I'm glad the day ended up having a lot of interesting discussion after all. Good luck town. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Terrador and all other townies:</div> Seriously, there's no WiFoM here. I do not want you guys keeping me around. Just think about it and ask yourself how much possible town utility I could bring the game and honestly ask yourself if you think there's any way I'll ever stop being a topic of constant discussion as long as I stay in the game. The rational conclusion is that I should be the lynch and everyone can move on knowing for sure and use today's interactions to read people. I think once you know for sure that I am indeed just a VT, then you'll be able to read how people interacted with me and see the folks that stand out as unlikely to be town. Don't give anyone a free pass, as there was a lot of cover for scum to look pretty townie in reasoning against me. The problem for them will be staying consistent and showing that same kind of reasoning throughout the game. In the end, you get the most out of lynching me today.

I'll simply tell you my philosophy of integrity, which I've always applied to online interactions because they are no less \"real\" than ones out in the meatworld. It takes you your entire life to build your integrity. It takes only a single instance to lose it. Lying in mafia as scum is a given. Lying as a townie is only acceptable for very specific reasons and should only be done by people skilled enough to do it properly. If you aren't sure, you shouldn't. Lying about putting together an evaluation of people is just never worthwhile or ethically acceptable. <br>\n<br>\nIf someone cannot be trusted to be honest and keep his integrity in such little things as a forum mafia game, then how can he possibly be trusted when it comes to truly important things like his marriage, his job, and other important things? The only answer is that he cannot. You will not always be able to trust that I'm being honest about game specific things, because this is a game that has lying as a basic element of the game. You can always trust me to be honest about what I'm doing out in meatworld. <br>\n<br>\nIt is generally considered poor form to question what someone says about what they have going on in real life or what they're doing out in real life. It's also exceptionally poor form for scum to make up things about real life to try and gain sympathy. Any player who will give up being trusted long term for a chance at maybe surviving and maybe winning a mafia game ... well, I think you can all figure out what I would say about such a player.", "time": "Tue May 05, 2015 1:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

I'm begging you guys to just go ahead and finish lynching me though. Monkey is almost certainly scum so you can confirm my status, take the night phase to do some thread diving and figure out your reads in light of actual confirmed info, and you can go into tomorrow intending to lynch MonkeyMan unless he has a dramatic improvement in play. Today all he's really guilty of is what looks like really shady active lurking (could be co-incidence still) and his ridiculous mangling of what OMGUS means and his refusal to admit he misunderstood what it means and move on, despite half the game telling him he doesn't understand the definition. {For someone with a join date back in 2008, he looks like a dyed in the wool first time player}. <br>\n<br>\nIf you don't go through with lynching me, you can't know for sure I have been honest. Inevitably someone (town or scum or both) will bring me back up tomorrow and we'll go through the same mess we went through today, and instead of me being dismissive and sarcastic as a strategy, I'm likely to just be legitimately irritated that town aligned people would see me tell them exactly what would happen if they left me alive and then went and did it. I don't want to spend two more weeks locked in a conversation that began on the first real life day of the game. All it will do is give scum cover. Just do the right thing and lynch me. Scum aren't going to win tonight because you let MonkeyMan live an extra day. Town will have a much better chance of living with me confirmed town and out of the game as a possible distraction.<br>\n<br>\n@Riabi - When I first began working on the draft, and up until I realized that I was commenting on a very large % of the posts in the game and overdoing it and posting that level of analysis could be detrimental to town, I had every intent to post the final product instead of the trimmed down summary I posted before I went out tonight/last night. The summary is a distillation of what I read about each person, just without links to a bunch of posts with a sentence or three for each. Certainly you've been scum and killed someone who was an obvious strong town player before because of the threat that posed, right? Surely you've been scum and realized someone was a town PR because you knew they were a townie so their behavior made sense to you while a VT might highlight certain things and read someone scummy when they are really a PR. What are the chances a day 1 commentary on a bunch of posts will solve the game as compared to that same commentary helping scum who have way more info to work with?<br>\n<br>\n@Terrador - \"After all these walls, he actively strips the hard content? One would think that if he cared about being concise, he would spoiler it.\" -- Long posts don't take me much time. I type quickly and I work with a lot of text all the time in my research. The \"walls\" come from me because it's super easy for me to throw up a long post in 5-6 minutes. I have to actively work at trimming things down so people don't just glaze at the eyes and skip over my posts. I made a decision to cut out the spoilered commentary on specific posts. If you're interested in what I do, you'll see in the dead thread for as long as I keep up with the game, as I'll comment there on what I'm seeing as I continue to try and figure out the game from beyond the grave. <br>\n<br>\n@Both of you - It's down to me what I believe is the best thing I can do for town. I believe that being lynched today is a net positive for town. I believe that the reads summaries I gave before I went out along with your own analysis of the day with later context and interactions should be sufficiently helpful. I do not believe there is very much chance that I've successfully figured out the game here in day one; no one could. I do believe that it's possible that the scum team, who after all know for sure who isn't among them, could glean way more immediate benefit from things I wouldn't even realize would help them. I know this because when I have been scum, townies have often called things to my attention that I had missed and many times town players have helped me tremendously as scum. At the end of the day, it's down to my judgment to decide what I think is best. I'm not prescient, and therefore I could only possibly know in hindsight whether I've made the right decision or not. You have my reads with concise summaries of my thoughts. Certainly once I'm dead and you know I had no intent to deceive you, they should be useful, yes?<br>\n<br>\n@Riabi - \"It seems to me that there's no good reason to keep your thoughts/reads to yourself if you aren't scum. It increases the chances that town loses in the end.\" -- You are incorrect in the first part. I gave the reads, and it is never wise for a townie to reveal all of his thoughts. I have ideas on who might have power roles ... do you think it would be wise for me to point that out to scum? Of course not. The fact that you actually are trying to put blame on me for a potential town loss at the end of a day one, when I'm doing my very best to be a town asset in every possible way ... I really don't know what to say to that. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Everyone, especially townies - Would you guys just go ahead and kill me already? No townie can possibly argue that keeping me alive and having the inevitable smokescreen of ongoing discussion concerning my alignment could possibly result in a more positive utility than having that question settled and removing that convenient place for scum to hide. It borders on the absurd that at this point in the day anyone is actually trying to stop my lynch wagon. I would suggest it actually approaches playing against your win condition for a townie to vote for anyone but me at this point. You don't want any more cover being provided to the scum team by questions surrounding me. You won't gain more from any other lynch. Even if you lynched MonkeyMan and he flips scum, you gain less because he has only posted to overreact and defend himself any time anyone dared to scum read him or vote for him or even make a passing comment at him so there's basically nothing to go on to figure out who his buddies would be. Further, you won't even be able to feel sure that I am town in that case, as the whole \"bus\" thing will come into play, etc... <br>\n<br>\nYou lynch me, you have a ton of interactions that will be useful for PoE as you gain more info as the game progresses. You have interactions between me and almost everyone in the game. You have my concise reads. You remove me as a distraction for scum to exploit. This is like mafia 101 level decision making here. I'm glad to know after how disastrously bad my approach at the start of the game went that I am capable of putting enough doubt (or even reversing reads) into things to avoid a lynch ... but in this particular instance, as a VT, it's just not good play for me to want to stay alive and keep playing and deprive the town of knowing for sure they can trust my motives and subjecting them to more distraction related to me. As much as I think this game would be fun to continue playing, I can keep trying to figure it out in the dead thread and I can talk to myself (and future dead people!) in there. <br>\n<br>\nMake the correct maximal utility play.

Even if you lynched MonkeyMan and he flips scum, you gain less because he has only posted to overreact and defend himself any time anyone dared to scum read him or vote for him or even make a passing comment at him so there's basically nothing to go on to figure out who his buddies would be. Further, you won't even be able to feel sure that I am town in that case, as the whole \"bus\" thing will come into play, etc...<br>\n<br>\nYou lynch me, you have a ton of interactions that will be useful for PoE as you gain more info as the game progresses. You have interactions between me and almost everyone in the game. You have my concise reads. You remove me as a distraction for scum to exploit. This is like mafia 101 level decision making here. I'm glad to know after how disastrously bad my approach at the start of the game went that I am capable of putting enough doubt (or even reversing reads) into things to avoid a lynch ... but in this particular instance, as a VT, it's just not good play for me to want to stay alive and keep playing and deprive the town of knowing for sure they can trust my motives and subjecting them to more distraction related to me. As much as I think this game would be fun to continue playing, I can keep trying to figure it out in the dead thread and I can talk to myself (and future dead people!) in there.<br>\n<br>\nMake the correct maximal utility play. Please. I'd like to go out a lot more gracefully than I started. Consider it an inevitably dying townie's last wish.", "time": "Tue May 05, 2015 7:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

Alright, here we go.<br>\n<br>\nTheSoldier's kill: if there's only one mafia family, he's not in it. I would believe Vigilante, Serial Killer, or Mafia II: Electric Boogaloo. Not really alignment-indicative yet, sadly. Like everyone else, he'll have to be read the hard way. Still think his tone is town, though, so I'll buy vigilante for now--especially since I know his meta for vigilante, which he's slightly more likely to obey as vigilante than as SK/Mafia II posing as such.<br>\n<br>\ndragonspawn's claim: Wholly believable. Again, not alignment-indicative. I could see him failing to consider the possibility of vigilante just as easily as I could see him framing TheSoldier as scum for his vigilante kill; the failure to kill by mafia tonight does lend credence to that, though I would never believe it to be a deliberate kill idle.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nA couple of public service announcements for everybody.<br>\n<br>\nThe first: henceforth, when I refer to Mafia A, I mean a mafia that is guaranteed to exist, and which I would bet my bottom dollar TheSoldier is not a part of.

In 307 you listed Key and Victor as more suspicious than Soldier.  I don't see where you voted for Soldier or questioned him in any serious way.  If you suspected him there's very little evidence of it in your ISO. For much of Day 1 your vote was on Key. And at the end of the day your vote was on Monkeyman.

They knew that Drixx was town, and that there were going to probably be a lot of interactions to sort through from that (which is what we should be talking about right now, not just Soldier). They knew that there were already several people who had suspected Monkey, especially in light of his bad play at the end of D1. Why wouldn't they kill someone that is being seen as really townie, and basically guarantee another mis-lynch? That doesn't make any sense to me. But, I've been the vig, killing someone who is highly suspected makes a LOT of sense from the perspective of the vig. Now that Monkey is dead, we can move on to other things. His death actually benefits town in a lot of ways.", "time": "Fri May 08, 2015 9:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

This is based on the wiki.<br>\n<br>\nSoldier is scum: I'm thinking he isn't scum because nobody would waste a kill on Monkeyman if he would a easy mislynch the next day.<br>\n<br>\nSoldier is a vigilante: \"A Vigilante is a Townie who can kill a player at Night.\" We have to take precautions. If Soldier were vigilante, he would of has a low chance of winning a kill that day, because there are more town and mafia and it is theoretically bad to use this role if Vigilante is town. It would be benefiting the mafia more if Vigilante was used.

I might be wrong about that, but that&#8217;s my working assumption. That being said, here are some of the possible scenarios:<br>\n<br>\n1.\t Mankeyman died from a vigilante kill. Soldier is the vigilante who was caught by dragonspawn, a tracker, in the act.   Meanwhile the scum kill was preempted by a doctor or some other role blocker.  (For the record, I am NOT calling for anyone to claim here.)<br>\n<br>\n2.\tMankeyman was killed by scum, and dragonspawn caught Solkier in the act. <br>\n<br>\n3.\tMoneyman was killed by scum. Dragonspawn, as scum, falsely claiming Tracker, points out Soldier (also scum, who could then claim vig) in order to give both of them town credibility.<br>\n<br>\n4.\tMonkeyman was NK&#8217;ed by Soldier the SK. Scum NK was thwarted.<br>\n<br>\n5.\tDragonspawn is a scum tracker who caught Soldier (either SK or vig) in his night action.  Scum NK was thwarted.<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone can come up with other scenarios, I&#8217;m all ears.<br>\n<br>\nEach theory has problems:<br>\n<br>\nFor #1 to be true, we have to believe that dragonspawn, against the odds selected with his very first post in the game the one person who would have a successful night action, while at the same time, some other town person, again against the odds, chose the one person the scum had targeted for the night kill.  Despite the long odds, this might be the most plausible explanation.<br>\n<br>\n#2 Makes no sense for a mafia NK.  Monkeyman was likely to be mislynched.  He also claimed vanilla which means the scum would bypass him for an NK in hopes of finding a PR instead.<br>\n<br>\nThe problem with #3 is that it&#8217;s an awfully ballsy gambit to make.  But it explains why there was only one night kill, and why dragonspawn crumbed Soldier on the first post.  Dragonspawn voted Soldier I know, but Soldier could easily claim vigilante, so the vote was no threat.  But the vote was needed as the means of getting the false claims out there.  I can&#8217;t believe dragonspawn  would automatically assume scum and not consider vigilante.  And his proposal that a Monkeyman  NK makes sense for the scum to throw the town into chaos is not at all plausable.<br>\n<br>\n#4  How this would make sense depends on the thought process of the SK in selecting Monkeyman.  And of course I don&#8217;t know what that would be.  Again we would have to assume the scum NK was thwarted, and dragon got lucky on his tracker selection.<br>\n<br>\n$5  The problem with this theory is that the scum might want to keep their tracker&#8217;s  find secret and take the vig out with a NK.  For once a vig is forced to claim, town is unlikely to lynch and the vig might be protected by night.<br>\n<br>\nGoing forward: I&#8217;m not sure how to test dragonspawn&#8217;s tracker claim.

I might be wrong about that, but that&#8217;s my working assumption. That being said, here are some of the possible scenarios:<br>\n<br>\n1.\t Mankeyman died from a vigilante kill. Soldier is the vigilante who was caught by dragonspawn, a tracker, in the act.   Meanwhile the scum kill was preempted by a doctor or some other role blocker.  (For the record, I am NOT calling for anyone to claim here.)<br>\n<br>\n2.\tMankeyman was killed by scum, and dragonspawn caught Solkier in the act. <br>\n<br>\n3.\tMoneyman was killed by scum. Dragonspawn, as scum, falsely claiming Tracker, points out Soldier (also scum, who could then claim vig) in order to give both of them town credibility.<br>\n<br>\n4.\tMonkeyman was NK&#8217;ed by Soldier the SK. Scum NK was thwarted.<br>\n<br>\n5.\tDragonspawn is a scum tracker who caught Soldier (either SK or vig) in his night action.  Scum NK was thwarted.<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone can come up with other scenarios, I&#8217;m all ears.<br>\n<br>\nEach theory has problems:<br>\n<br>\nFor #1 to be true, we have to believe that dragonspawn, against the odds selected with his very first post in the game the one person who would have a successful night action, while at the same time, some other town person, again against the odds, chose the one person the scum had targeted for the night kill.  Despite the long odds, this might be the most plausible explanation.<br>\n<br>\n#2 Makes no sense for a mafia NK.  Monkeyman was likely to be mislynched.  He also claimed vanilla which means the scum would bypass him for an NK in hopes of finding a PR instead.<br>\n<br>\nThe problem with #3 is that it&#8217;s an awfully ballsy gambit to make.  But it explains why there was only one night kill, and why dragonspawn crumbed Soldier on the first post.  Dragonspawn voted Soldier I know, but Soldier could easily claim vigilante, so the vote was no threat.  But the vote was needed as the means of getting the false claims out there.  I can&#8217;t believe dragonspawn  would automatically assume scum and not consider vigilante.  And his proposal that a Monkeyman  NK makes sense for the scum to throw the town into chaos is not at all plausable.<br>\n<br>\n#4  How this would make sense depends on the thought process of the SK in selecting Monkeyman.  And of course I don&#8217;t know what that would be.  Again we would have to assume the scum NK was thwarted, and dragon got lucky on his tracker selection.<br>\n<br>\n$5  The problem with this theory is that the scum might want to keep their tracker&#8217;s  find secret and take the vig out with a NK.  For once a vig is forced to claim, town is unlikely to lynch and the vig might be protected by night.<br>\n<br>\nGoing forward: I&#8217;m not sure how to test dragonspawn&#8217;s tracker claim.  But if Soldier is indeed town he should be willing to listen to suggestions from the town about whom to vig.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\ngood list of possibilities.

Slandaar asks Keyblade for clarifications on his reads, and instead of doing the work of going back and finding the posts that originally pinged keyblade, he seems to go out of his way and find some tiny string he can try to pull on in Slandaar's most recent post. I don't know about everyone, but, if I'm town, and I'm actually trying to figure things out, if I post something like \"their arguments don't make sense\" I typically have some posts or arguments from them in mind. And if questioned on that read, I would go back and find the posts I didn't like.<br>\n<br>\nTo me, Keyblade's response feels like he's just making shit up as he goes along. This is especially true considering what he pointed out about Slandaar's argument wasn't really, in my mind, at all controversial. We had already discussed in game why the NK looked bad for scum. You can possibly make the argument that slandaar's bit about it being \"the worst possible\" was a bit of an exaggeration (though I don't think it was). But certainly even if Slandaar was simply using hyperbole, that doesn't reach the realm of \"doesn't make sense,\" does it?", "time": "Tue May 12, 2015 6:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

We also found out he does not have access to certain websites because of government restrictions.  His English seemed to be pretty good, but I have no doubt some the subtleties and idioms escaped him.  So I'm guessing (and it's only a guess) that the language and his relative inexperience gave him problems playing the game effectively.

With Zerediah coming from a restrictive Communist country, that particular flavor might not go over well should anyone in authority be looking over his shoulder.<br>\n<br>\n\"Being too paranoid\" is pretty much a joke.  It's a reference to the paranoia that comes from playing Mafia.  Has someone indeed been looking over Zerediah's shoulder?

In other words, Victor and/or Terrador are scum based on this FMPOV.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, the scumteam is almost certainly more than two players, so there's probably at least one scum off the main wagons. Zerediah/Prolapsed is the most likely candidate here. <br>\n<br>\nThis is all well and good, but VCA can be manipulated, right? Does Soldier have any non-VCA reasons to suspect these three? Why yes, as a matter of fact I do.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Terrador case</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Most of my reasons here come from D2.<br>\nTo begin with, I really really dislike how tentative he was about the dragon wagon <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6865813#p6865813\">1105</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6865865#p6865865\">1108</a>, etc.<br>\n<br>\nIn fact, 1108 has a somewhat interesting statement. He says that Dragonspawn is 'dirty as hell,' but on checking his ISO, I realized that he'd never explained <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> he was dirty other than the inconsistency, which he wasn't buying at that point.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6866036#p6866036\">1111</a> is also weird in that he's calling out Victor for wanting to consolidate with time left in the day, when D1 I felt he'd agreed with me that the halfway point of the deadline was when we should consolidate.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6866127#p6866127\">1119</a> was his piece of analysis that had him decide on the Dragon wagon, which was... pre-flip associatives with Keyblade? He doesn't want to put Dragon at L-1, not really sure why that is, but he later does anyway, citing low time (2 days). Pre-flip associatives are almost always terrible, and he should know that since the aforementioned \"Blitz\" incident was him tunneling hard on a townie based on these.<br>\n<br>\nI really don't get the purpose of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6871659#p6871659\">1155</a>. If you wanted Kitty to give you her read on Zerediah, why not just ask that instead of one that's pointless? Really, what kind of answer is he hoping for?<br>\n<br>\nBasically, I think he was testing the waters of the Dragon wagon, only jumping on when it was clear that it was going through and he had an excuse for lynching a pr. I don't understand his reluctance to put people he thinks are scum at L-1 with the deadline halfway gone if he was town; I can easily see him doing it as cautious scum. His callout of Victor for trying to wrap things up shows that prematurely ending the day is in the front of his mind as a scummy action, and he doesn't want to do so himself because he's afraid of his image. Considering that he listed himself as a common townread, him being concerned about such things suggests a scum mindset.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Victor case</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I hate his D2 entrance. He's far from the only person to conclude that I was a vig and not scum based on me killing Monkey, but the way he shoots down the idea of scum killing Monkey is just weird. Killing the guy that everyone's set on lynching throws everyone out of whack and can leave town floundering; I have seen scum do this before, and I don't know why people find it so unbelievable. Killing obvtown is almost certainly better, yes, but this is a game played by human beings. Nobody is perfectly optimal all the time; people might want to try new strategies or just confuse everyone.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, voting Dragon because he said he followed me rather than tracking me is bad. I personally forgot that follower was even a role, and have seen people say that they followed someone as a tracker. Trying to portray Dragon as scummy for his word choice is awful, since him saying he followed someone when claiming tracker is in no way scummy.<br>\n<br>\nThen we have <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6841939#p6841939\">828</a>. Zerediah has been encouraging people to vote Drixx. He has been supporting the Drixx wagon, while conspicuously avoiding actually voting there, for most of the day. Drixx had \"given up\" for most of the day, but towards the end of D1 Zerediah now thinks he's town because he gave up! This is scummy as hell, and indeed, Victor agreed that Zerediah was scummy D1. But now, when Slandaar asks him why he liked Zerediah's explanation D1, he says that it's because Zerediah was right about Drixx. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Major problem: Zerediah and Victor couldn't have known he was right about Drixx until D2! Victor also doesn't say why he liked the post when it was posted, instead using knowledge he can't have had. This is damning. Victor gave an answer to a D1 question using D2 knowledge purposefully. Furthermore, it's D2 knowledge that only scum could have had D1.</div></div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Zerediah case</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Zerediah is an utter goldmine. Everything Slandaar said about him still stands, for one thing. <br>\n<br>\nGoing all the way back to his first few posts, voting someone for \"lurking\" in the first real-life day of the game is horrible and when it took him a fair while to make his first post just seems highly unlikely to come from town.<br>\n<br>\nHim saying that he wouldn't be hunting without Riabi's permission/request is also terrible, even taking into account language barrier.<br>\n<br>\nI could see him saying that he gets better D2 as a ploy to not get lynched D1; I don't know what other games he's been in, so I can't say if his claim has any truth to it at all.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar's point about his lack of read continuity is best put in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6858905#p6858905\">1042</a>.

Suddenly deciding that Drixx is town after saying he's scum most of the day is one thing. Saying he thinks Victor is scum and then, after two flips that have nothing to do with Victor, he completely drops him is not something that happens with townies.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\ntl;dr is that Victor and Zerediah/Prolapsed are both individually scummy, and if one flips scum the other is almost certainly scum too.

Soldier said that he expected that monkey would be the lynch on day 2, but said we will see, as he did in thread. I don't understand why he would scum!kill monkey either. But now that I know that it's possible he is scum I have to consider it. His motivations have all been pretty clear to me though, and he is so helpful. He seems open, I'm not seeing scum play here. Although admittedly it would be hard to wrap my head around it after all of this time.<br>\n Titus, your slot was never looking good to me from early day one, but you are not Victor. Do you think Victor was playing kind of scummy to stay under the radar as PR? I remember Random having that conversation with someone on day one. I *think* it was Random. Town looking scummy. The problem is, if you go back and read the thread, you could see WHY the lynchees were lynched. I started to doubt Drixx, because he was starting to sound like himself, I had played with him before. Dragon just got more scummy as he went, he crumbed following soldier in his first post...then pushed hard for the Soldier lynch. He wouldn't even listen to anyone that there was any other possibility. Then hammered himself, I still haven't gotten an answer why that was a good play.  When he is going after *my* confirmed town vig, that is all I needed. I have never been in a neighborhood before and we didn't talk hardly at all, I thought it was secret handshake shit LOL I wouldn't vote Soldier, and I supported him. As we were quiet in the neighborhood day one, and I had asked for some advice on reads, I figured it was all very hush hush. Soldier did share more in the second day, he went into detailed analysis that was very helpful, he was suspicious of Terrador/Victor/zer/PB then added Riabi. Soldier said he fully expected to be NK'd and left us with as much information as he could of his analysis. Slandaar didn't talk much at night, but read Soldier, Lapsa, Riabi and I as town. He did have a VCA himself that pointed to zer/PB and Victor/Titus. He points out that out of the 4 wagons keyblade and dragon had the most votes, while Victor/Titus and zer/PB had the least and it all fit together pretty well. I thouht he had a point. It made sense to me and I respected his play very much, he didn't say a lot, but when he did it was insightful, to me anyway. This is my 3rd game onsite. First out of the newbie queue, I am not used to this many players. Early in the days I felt like I could confidently read people, now, I really feel out of my league. And it sucks. Sorry I am rambling. I just want to share what I can. I am trying to gain some insight from the thread but I am torn.

Possible that some folks might <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">TheSoldier</div>: I believe vig claim, frankly. Claim of one-shot and lack of subsequent shots isn't consistent with him hiding a second or third shot. Monkey would have been a shit shot for scum, getting him mislynched would have been incredibly, hilariously easy. I can't think of a single person I wouldn't shoot before Monkey as scumteam, and his play generally checks out as protown.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">KittyGalore</div>: This is a pretty enormous townslip, and seeing two scum in a neighborhood covering for each other would literally break my brain. Her play seemed pretty town to me, and the backpedaling on the Drixx lynch would usually seem scummy, but I'm feeling it as organic? I'm seriously salty that we're not getting more out of her, though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Lapsa</div>: First, @Lapsa, I haven't dug up any more crumbs yet. Perhaps a dip into Victor's ISO for cop crumbs will come later.<br>\nBut as far as he goes, his push is good and his reads feel organic. Some of the points he makes are wrong, and in particular I disagree with how he views TheSoldier, but he feels very town--nothing I can be absolutely certain of, though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Shinobi</div>: Content looks good since the sub, and PoE with Titus and Prolapsed Brain just doesn't make any sense. A gut read, but one I think I trust right now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:yellow\">RandomActs</div>: Not sure I have a read on him. In particular, he's not really contributing when he posts rarely. If you don't have time or energy to invest into a game, the posts you make need to be clear and forward and kick ass. This, in absence of the all-but-confirming townslip and the gutread from D1 that Kitty has over him? Puts him firmly down into the null category.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:yellow\">Riabi</div>: See, at first I was townreading him, but... I'm not sure. His defense of Victor early, in addition with Titus' one claimed clear being on him, just doesn't feel natural. Thought he was town at first, but the PoE here just doesn't make him look too good. In particular, I should be damned aware of whom he's scumreading, and honestly, I have to dig a bit to see he's pushing Lapsa &gt; Prolapsed Brain &gt; ???.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Titus</div>: Doctor claim is the only thing in the world giving me pause. VDA slot is bad, and completely forgets Zerediah out of the blue Day 2 because no reason. On top of associative reads casting shade, dude has W A Y too many scumreads and just about the shadiest cop claim I've seen. Seriously--<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6904509#p6904509\" class=\"postlink\">five</a> <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6904511#p6904511\" class=\"postlink\">scumreads</a> in a game with, in all likelihood, three scum?! How is this <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> hedging. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Prolapsed Brain</div>: Zerediah's slot was just bad, and Slandaar and TheSoldier have made excellent cases to that effect. Prolapsed Brain has done literally no work besides two barely substantiated scumreads since joining. Nobody in the world burns out on games <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> fast. Scumslot.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@TheSoldier</div>: I think being so blatant about crumbs when you don't have a guilty is a bad, bad idea for town--bad enough to suggest scum, honestly.<br>\n<br>\nMassclaim is probs. a Bad Idea from here. I doubt we have more than one town PR who isn't outed, so that's one clear to let scum see our kill block. I'm hesitant to see townies even claim VT at this point--we don't need to make scum PoE on our jailkeep/doc, if extant, better. We really have nothing to gain and something substantial to lose.<br>\n<br>\nNeighborhood doesn't really make town stronger. Either there's scum, in which case it's essentially another, smaller thread (which isn't really strong, frankly--it's a modifier, not a role in and of itself, for a reason), or there's town, in which case the WIFOM takes about as much value as it gives. Either way, I'd think it reduces swinginess from target-picking and puts the game more in the hands of the players' skill.<br>\n<br>\nWe can agree to disagree on Titus. Doesn't matter when Prolapsed Brain gets lynched today.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nWagon on Lapsa is a scum wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@EVERYONE:</div> I'd like to see a list of primary lynch/consolidation candidates from all of you by this point.

Most of the town finds his claim not only possible, but considering the NK, plausible.  Yes it was the only claim he could make, but that doesn't make it untrue. Why impossible?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nLike most others here I'm trying to figure out game balance. I'm dubious of an all-town neighborhood. Soldier is not at all confirmed. I'm looking askance at Titus' claim, but without a counter claim we're stuck with it for now. Unless the scum know something we do not? Could dragon have been the only investigative townie, and might the scum have figured that out, making a cop claim safe? None of this seems likely, but considering how well we've done so far, I think it's clear something unusual has occurred  to throw us off our game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFor Soldier's claim to be true, we have to overlook the fact that people told Soldier what to claim and he claimed that anyway.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, Soldier's claim is predicated on a healing role (doc/bp/jailkeep) existing. His claim can be proven possible by someone claiming to be one of those roles and who they healed. The healing role would then be killed while I am blocked. Yet, the people saying massclaim is bad are the very people supporting Soldier's claim. Provided three scum, we have one mislynch left. The proper thing to do here is to investigate.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, this all depends on Monkey being a town motivated shot. Why? Monkey is an active off the wall player. Look at Monkey's townreads in 661. FMPOV, all but Kitty are proven town. Kitty is likely town given Soldier scum. R did move back into his scumreads later, but that's because R was working well with Terrador. His townreads on both Kitty and Slandaar would be problematic if the identity of the hood was known for a scum Soldier. Sometimes people are shot, not for being protown, but for the fact they make mislynches impossible.<br>\n<br>\nMonkey also wanted to hold Laspa accountable for lurking. Look who lurked through Day 2 (at least according to VCA).<br>\n<br>\nRight after Soldier's claim Laspa (who cannot figure out how the vote tag works day 2), asks Soldier how many shots he has. Rather than get upset, he merely dismisses Lapsa saying he would prefer not to reveal. Lapsa does not follow-up. Not does anyone else follow about why such a question had to be asked.<br>\n<br>\nInvestigative gets Soldier fried, so he could not claim that. Doc is out because Monkey died (if Soldier was blocked he would not have visited). So that leaves vig. Big with multiple shots means a whole lot of missing kills.

If all those claims are true (a big if) that makes the figure in (d) a 6.  That brings the final calculation at this time to -2.  At the time of Titus' crumb the final figure was 2, which gives her claim more credibility because if it was a false claim it could have been possibly countered, even if the scum have a role cop.  The calculation at the time of Lapsa's claim doesn't really matter since VT is almost always a safe claim. (I do note however we do have 2 dead VT's already.  Lapsa, if true, would make the 3rd VT.

And we've often agreed, but that was when I was wrong. His bulletproof claim is unsettling since I view that more scumish than not. I also think the claim was unpressured and premature. Titus pretty much clears him, however, unless he's a godfather.  It depends on how much I trust Titus.<br>\n<br>\nBut here's the thing: since PB is my choice for today, I really don't have to decide on Riabi or Titus right now. As I tried to explain earlier in the game, I generally don't share my reads beyond my top suspect unless there's a compelling reason to do so.  I can only vote for one person at a time.  We can only lynch one person at a time.  That's why I focus mainly on one prime suspect.  Going further than that only increases the possibility of promoting a false narrative.  I don't want to be responsible for misleading the town. Am I considering relationships and possible scum teams?  Yes, of course.  That all plays into my reads.  But until a suspect flips and until a NK can be analyzed, we don't have enough information to make an informed decision about future lynches.  And I don't want to lock myself into any particular narrative when it's nearly certain to be altered by future events.  Furthermore, if my reads are correct and my narrative is accurate, the scum will strategize against it.  Why give them that opportunity?<br>\n<br>\nI understand not everyone plays this way.  I know it's frustrating to some who want to gauge my thinking.

It would make sense for him to be the N1 scumkill, because he's very active and inquisitive. As for what this does to Titus' claim, {1-shot vig, Tracker, Bulletproof} vs {1-shot vig, Tracker, Bulletproof, Cop}... I'm no balance expert, but the first seems more realistic at the moment. If we lynch a strong scum PR or two, then the cop claim is more likely to be real. Regardless, Titus isn't today's lynch - Prolapsed is. <br>\n<br>\nHis case we've been waiting on is weak. His point about her proposing a 4-man scumteam? He says that's scum not paying attention... but I somehow doubt that scum would think they have an extra partner. Not a townslip, but I see no advantage at all for scum to do this, and no way it can be a scumslip. And that's assuming she even meant a four-man scumteam at all, which was later clarified to not be the case. Speaking of paying attention...<br>\n<br>\nAs far as her manner of play, I haven't played with her before but I've read several games she's been in and she's like this (VCA, lots of posts) in all of them.

He makes perfect sense as a N1 scumkill, being active and inquisitive; not to mention when dragonspawn had a hard time believing that the scenario where the kill was prevented was blocked, he brought up the possibility of bulletproof - because he is one. There's also the fact that he pressured Zerediah quite a bit D1; Slandaar did that D2 and was killed N2. Seems like a likely NK choice to me.<br>\n<br>\nI reread the thread from page one, starting by paying extra attention to Zerediah. In particular, his readslist from page 15.

The reason you aren&#8217;t 100% confirmed is because you are too willing to rush the game, almost as if you want different wagons happening one after another. This could result in a wagon to your liking, and you can take the kill with reasonable argument.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Monkeyman</div>: SLIGHT TOWN because you make good reads, but I&#8217;m seeing some unproductive reads (which is hypocritical of me xD).

See: him posting that he doesn't think Drixx is scummy, then asking Victor to vote Drixx.<br>\n<br>\nNow, go and read what he says about RandomActs. He says he wants to put him as town... but can't because he has no posts... and then goes on to say that he's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">definitely</div> not scum guys, don't look over here! Now this is pretty obvious in and of itself, but don't worry, I have stuff that Random has done that makes him scum all by himself.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now look at his read on Lapsa. Oh wait, he doesn't have one. Even when he puts Keyblade as slight scum for being non constructive. When later asked, he says he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can't</div> scumread Lapsa because that would make him a hypocrite. Hmm. <br>\n<br>\nAnd then there's something more ISO-wide from him. He never really engaged Random or Lapsa throughout the course of the game. Furthermore, when Lapsa and Random start to suspect him, he doesn't comment, but when Riabi and Slandaar do, he definitely reacts. Cut and dry. That's everything I want to say about Zerediah's play; Prolapsed didn't do much other than awkwardly not want to vote Lapsa, so I'm moving on to the living scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lapsa</div><br>\n<br>\nAlright, so something Lapsa has been doing for 80% of the game is going after Victor's slot. What is the initial cause of this suspicion? He first votes Victor in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6822060#p6822060\">509</a>. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6825899#p6825899\">561</a> he finally says why, saying that this is not what town Victor looks like. So... his murderboner was born of meta. That he couldn't or wouldn't elaborate on, as seen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6825946#p6825946\">566</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6826028#p6826028\">570</a>. In other words, probably fabricated. There's also the fact that he townread Zerediah D1 with no explanation at all (also 509).<br>\n<br>\nAnd then we have his 'case' on me beginning at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6900347#p6900347\">1322</a>. Hoo boy. Every point is either wrong or meaningless.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, he gave his personal scumlist as me, Victor/Titus, and Riabi. He uses this to argue against the idea that Monkey was the obvious D2 lynch, which yes he really was. The people he notes (here and later) that voted/were willing to vote the Monkey wagon are: his \"scumlist,\" himself, drixx, dragon, slandaar, terrador, and kitty... that's eight people right there. When 11 people are going to be alive, I'd say 8 people suspecting you makes you a pretty likely lynch. Not to mention that from my POV, that would make HIM the one scum on the town wagon, so lol.<br>\n<br>\nThen he mentions a \"synchronized hammer.\" Oh man, Victor voted him and then I hammered him! With 2 days left! What is this even an accusation of? He also puts me saying that it should be Monkey tomorrow in red as if that's incriminating. One, why would scum say that and then kill the dude. Secondly, I said that so that it wouldn't be blindingly obvious I was vig. So he's trying to make me look scummy for saying that Monkey was the obvious next lynch, which he was. Oh, and who's the one other guy besides Prolapsed to quickly buy into this? RandomActs. Which brings me to him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RandomActs</div><br>\n<br>\nFirst of all I'm actually laughing in real life from the PEdit. Prolapsed was confirmed fucking scum because he self hammered to cut the day short. You don't honestly believe this argument.<br>\n<br>\nLet's all look back to early day two. I'm sure you all remember the gist - Dragon claimed tracker, and that I had killed Monkey. I said yes, I did. Day ended with Dragon being mislynched. Now, one of the arguments used on his lynch was that he had decided who to track on his first post. Now where did this idea come from?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6841353#p6841353\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6841353#p6841353\" data-post-id=\"6841353\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 809</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1778\">RandomActs</a> wrote:</cite>I think it's very odd that Dragon would decide whom to track on his very first post.  Wouldn't he wait to follow someone suspicious?  This is either really bad play, or the scum are trying some kind of gambit.<br>\n@ dragon - why didn't you wait until nightfall to decide your target?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAh, from RandomActs himself. This is the first mention of this idea. Dragon explained that his noting that he said he would in his first post was a funny twist of fate, and that he HADN'T planned to track me from the beginning. But Random pushes this throughout the day, as if it were an established fact. This is setting the narrative. I actually have to give props to Random for this play, I definitely wouldn't have caught it without a reread, and I'll have to keep it in mind for when I roll scum.<br>\n<br>\nThen we go back to the 'slip' I brought up D2. He brought on the bluster when I brought it up to get me off of him, much like he's doing now.<br>\n<br>\nPPEdit: Yeah, terrador brings up good points too.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RandomActs</span><br>\n<br>\nFor great justice.", "time": "Tue Jun 02, 2015 1:06 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

I had good-faith cases on Drixx and dragonspawn.

Further, you haven't explicitly stated that TheSoldier is scum, so yeah, there's still room to doubt that.<br>\n<br>\nYou wanna call it BS? Sure, give me substantive and satisfactory responses to the issues I'm bringing forward. Hint: you won't, and you aren't even trying. What you're trying to do is throw shade on me, for the most part. Let's take a look at what you've done today, shall we?<br>\n#1661 critically misses multiple points--both that claiming you're town accomplishes nothing and that I knew PB was scum because he self-hammered.<br>\n#1667 says my wallpost is based on nothing when we have two new flips and a prompt for a reread, then attacks me.<br>\n#1670 claims that counterattacking is alright, which isn't scummy in and of itself (although your counterattacking, as I've demonstrated, screams scum), then tries calling my lynch record into question because that's easier than defending your own clearly scummy behavior.<br>\n#1672 calls me on an observation several other players have had.<br>\n#1673 entirely misrepresents why TheSoldier sees an associative tell between you and Zerediah.<br>\n#1679 tries to defend you watching a townie get lynched with little effort to stop it when you declare Drixx to be town and further tries passing off lynch record as an alignment tell.<br>\n#1685 throws shade at TheSoldier instead of explicitly calling him scum, because you're afraid to commit to that.<br>\n#1691 claims I'm trying to cover myself for a theoretical mislynch<br>\n#1693 says I'm choosing to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">believe</div> a scum-only neighborhood, in a nutshell. Slipping that I believe I'm town, maybe~?<br>\nAnd finally, #1694 says you're trying to answer my BS as quickly as you can. When you have answered... one point? And one auxilliary/early one? In nine posts? Tryin' real hard to address those concerns, man.<br>\n<br>\nIn the scope of those posts, I alone have brought up the following:<br>\n#1659 calls him on a useless post.<br>\n#1662 calls him evading, points out a pattern of him attacking people who scumread him, calls having few scumreads a way to hedge, calls him for supporting the Drixx wagon and ultimately bailing, and suggests that an awful D2 post had scum intent.<br>\n#1669 refutes his theory about me drawing out Riabi's role, and calls him on not mentioning a scum partner.<br>\n#1676 says his defenses are scummy, points out his pattern of OMGUS again, calls out lynch record as not an alignment tell, points out why his vote behavior has been scummy, calls him on continuing to not post a real case on me or submit a scum partner, and calls #1673 as a scumpost.<br>\n#1682 elaborates on why his D1 behavior is scum, defends my own record, combats the narrative he's trying to make of TheSoldier capriciously plucking him as a scumread, defends my own play, points out the difference between bad and scum, and calls him on not outing a potential scum #2 once more. Trying to keep the pressure up there.<br>\n#1687 reiterates that I have a cohesive scumteam, which he's trying to cast doubt on. It points out that his scumread of TheSoldier appeared out of thin air once Kitty expressed faith in scum!Random, and that it's patently ridiculous that he thinks TheSoldier is scum over Kitty, and further says that he doesn't counterattack TheSoldier at first, which makes 0 sense for somebody he's scumreading. I keep applying pressure for his failure to address the issues, then note that townies can, in fact, be wrong! Gasp!<br>\n#1692 calls him on his crap about me \"covering my butt\", calls him on a lie about me always being on the wrong side of the lynch, and keeps the pressure about his dodging on.<br>\n<br>\nDoes anyone notice the near-complete lack of overlap between what I bring forward and what he's stating? Yeah, I made this listpost partly to summarize the case on him, but still--the fact remains that he's clearly not actually trying to defend himself.<br>\n<br>\nFurther, his scumteam is not cohesive to the point of impossibility. He considers me to be scum. Cool. But he also considers TheSoldier to be scum. Alright, that's a scumteam. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">But how did Riabi's bulletproof get broken? He can't be scum if there are no slots left, and it's patently obvious there's no potential vig but TheSoldier.</div> And don't say he didn't think of it, because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6917711#p6917711\" class=\"postlink\">he took bulletproof!Riabi as given literally an hour and a half ago!</a> Now that I think of it, he says Riabi is the scum target... <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">which means that MonkeyMan was not.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Random, in addition to your other problems, your scumteam is transparently artificial.

Are we talking \"confirmed\" as in \"as sure as any townie can be before a flip?\"  If that's the case, that's not scummy. However I rarely use the word in this way because it's inaccurate.  To me \"confirmed\" means 100 percent accuracy, as in mod-like assurance, or perhaps scum-like assurance.  And that level of assurance is rare in this game.  So, when you thought \"confirmed\" and meant it in the former sense, then no, that would not be scummy.  But using it in the latter sense would indicate a level of knowledge that's usually beyond the town.", "time": "Wed Jun 03, 2015 6:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=1725", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

Yet, the people saying massclaim is bad are the very people supporting Soldier's claim. Provided three scum, we have one mislynch left.

Look at Monkey's townreads in 661. FMPOV, all but Kitty are proven town. Kitty is likely town given Soldier scum. R did move back into his scumreads later, but that's because R was working well with Terrador. His townreads on both Kitty and Slandaar would be problematic if the identity of the hood was known for a scum Soldier. Sometimes people are shot, not for being protown, but for the fact they make mislynches impossible.<br>\n<br>\nRight after Soldier's claim Laspa (who cannot figure out how the vote tag works day 2), asks Soldier how many shots he has. Rather than get upset, he merely dismisses Lapsa saying he would prefer not to reveal. Lapsa does not follow-up. Not does anyone else follow about why such a question had to be asked.<br>\n<br>\nInvestigative gets Soldier fried, so he could not claim that. Doc is out because Monkey died (if Soldier was blocked he would not have visited). So that leaves vig. Big with multiple shots means a whole lot of missing kills.

Anyone with a brain stem would know that even the scum team has no clue whom the PRs are until end of day, and would hold off on their tracking decisions similarly.<br>\n-He has a pattern of attacking and trying to intimidate people who consider him scum. This attitude is pretty hilariously antitown, and it's been extant the entire game.<br>\n-He didn't have a complete set of scumreads until very forcefully pressured into doing so. Antitown hedging, anyone?<br>\n-His scumread on TheSoldier Day 4 is entirely artificial. We know this because he has this pattern of attacking people who scumread him--if someone gets preferential treatment and doesn't get attacked for scumreading him, then surely there must be a reason, yes? Certainly a pattern like that wouldn't be broken for a scumread. Yet the scumread materializes once he realizes TheSoldier's case is threatening.<br>\n-He's evidently terrified of truth and good logic. He's been trying to stitch me up all day, he repeatedly tries to represent things that are in no way alignment-indicative as scumtells (namely: pretending voting record is an alignment tell. He gets points for persisting on the \"he knows Riabi's jacket is broken he's scum!!11!1!\" bit even after TheSoldier and I explained it and Riabi himself sided with me re: that \"scumtell\"). Further, he's been making blatant AtE all Day long.<br>\n-He is pointedly evading every accusation levied against him, instead preferring to stitch me up.<br>\n<br>\nThis is scum play. No bad townie is this bad--the stitching-up is just too common and too focused. There are other minor points--him noting that his case on dragon \"square's nicely with Lapsa's\", completely non-productive role speculation, does a lot of ignoring Keybladewielder before the sub in, and that is presence on the Prolapsed Brain lynch is weak and late enough that it really doesn't give a hint of towncred. I'm sure I've had other minor issues with his play that I'm forgetting, but these are supplementary, and I don't stand by them as scumtells. I do stand by the dashed points above--I believe each and every one is, though not necessarily grounds for a lynch in vacuum, very telling and very damning.<br>\n<br>\nFor what it's worth, I read him trying to set up a 1v1 (which I don't think holds with me making such a strong, organic case, but I don't care because he's flipping FILTHY COMMIE ALIGNMENT) as trying to spook me into dropping the read or hesitating; he knows I've got a poor record in-game, and may have paid attention to me mentioning my sordid history of sucking as town, so he's trying to scare me off him for fear of betting the game on this lynch.", "time": "Thu Jun 04, 2015 12:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61563&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "61563"}

If they label every town person as a scum read, they&#8217;ll be found out quickly.  I haven&#8217;t looked but I would not be surprised if other townies are in Zerediah's clear list as well. The fact that Zerediah put me in his &#8220;not scum&#8221; column means next to nothing.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>2. His interaction with the Drixx wagon is toxic; he disavows the lynch, and offers nothing but an offhand mention to support a preferable wagon.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI found this one actually amusing.  Because when it comes to the Drixx wagon, I look infinitely better than you do.  I'm not sure what you mean by &#8220;toxic&#8221; but if you mean I disagreed with a mislynching wagon then I proudly plead guilty.  Could I have worked harder to save Drixx if I thought he was innocent?  Yes, perhaps so.  But I did what I thought I could with the limited information available to me.  But my ambivalence is nowhere near as damning as your position on that wagon &#8211; firmly and comfortably seated on a mislynch wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>3.His push for dragonspawn's lynch predicates on a narrative he invented: that dragonspawn chose to track TheSoldier at the start of Day 1, and therefore is scum tracker. Anyone with a brain stem would know that even the scum team has no clue whom the PRs are until end of day, and would hold off on their tracking decisions similarly.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, the comment &#8220;anyone with a brain stem&#8221; is ad hominem.  I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s an indication you yourself  how shallow your arguments are, that you'd resort to this tactic.  But others can make up their own minds about that.  <br>\n<br>\nI agree that decisions about night actions should be made at the end of the day.  But I was not accusing dragon of being a smart player;  I was accusing him of being a scummy one. I was also taking his relative inexperience into account.  In trying to figure out why dragon might early be calling for a night action on Soldier (which he carried though with, don&#8217;t forget) I tried to determine if this was scumtalk. You will also recall we had some discourse about whether there was a daytime channel for the scum, which, if there was, would have greatly cleared dragon in my mind.  It was ME who brought up that issue.  So I was not quite as tunneled on dragon as you portray.  I was also looking for evidence to clear him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>4. He has a pattern of attacking and trying to intimidate people who consider him scum. This attitude is pretty hilariously antitown, and it's been extant the entire game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhen I was first learning this game, my more experienced mentors told me to fight like hell if I&#8217;m a townie falsely accused.  It&#8217;s not about preserving yourself, they said, it&#8217;s about preserving the town.  So yes, I&#8217;ve been taught to defend myself vigorously.  Would you prefer I just roll over and let myself be mislynched?  No, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> would be anti-town. It&#8217;s not my intent to intimidate.  But when I&#8217;m town and I&#8217;m unfairly attacked, I will naturally assume that scum are behind it.  Anyone would.  Anyone should.  So a vigorous defense is not an indication of scum.  You don&#8217;t have to look far for an example:  Drixx fought tooth and nail until he gave up.  And in case you&#8217;ve forgotten, he was TOWN!<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>5. He didn't have a complete set of scumreads until very forcefully pressured into doing so. Antitown hedging, anyone?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, not anti-town hedging.  It&#8217;s careful play.  It&#8217;s about not making mistakes. It&#8217;s about not prematurely making choices that don&#8217;t yet need to be made.  (A lesson I humbly suggest you consider.) I&#8217;ve explained this twice already in the thread.  You didn&#8217;t call it anti-town then.  It&#8217;s my play style.  Get over it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>6. his scumread on TheSoldier Day 4 is entirely artificial. We know this because he has this pattern of attacking people who scumread him--if someone gets preferential treatment and doesn't get attacked for scumreading him, then surely there must be a reason, yes? Certainly a pattern like that wouldn't be broken for a scumread. Yet the scumread materializes once he realizes TheSoldier's case is threatening.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes, there is a pattern.  But it&#8217;s not what you think it is.  The level of my response is proportional to how serious I perceive the attack to be.  Surely you can understand that, yes?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 7a. He's evidently terrified of truth and good logic.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAd hominem, again.  Unworthy of you.  You&#8217;re better than this.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 7b He's been trying to stitch me up all day, he repeatedly tries to represent things that are in no way alignment-indicative as scumtells (namely: pretending voting record is an alignment tell. He gets points for persisting on the \"he knows Riabi's jacket is broken he's scum!!11!1!\" bit even after TheSoldier and I explained it and Riabi himself sided with me re: that \"scumtell\"). Further, he's been making blatant AtE all Day long.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes you gave an answer, but it was an answer to a question I&#8217;m not asking!  This isn&#8217;t about jackets being broken and what that means.  It&#8217;s about how you knew about a night on Riabi.  It&#8217;s about you saying Riabi claimed he was a N1 target when he never claimed anything of the sort.  I don&#8217;t care what site you&#8217;re on but <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">claiming bulletprood does not equal &#8220;I was shot at the night before.&#8221; </div>  So how did you know when Riabi was a target when he never said he was ?  That&#8217;s the question you need to answer.  And you haven&#8217;t.  And yes, I&#8217;ll be on your case until you do.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>8.

{"number": 1914, "id": "6925765", "user": "Terrador", "user_id": "25744", "content": "Yeah, this response is just bad. Full of all sorts of half-truths and strawmen. I'll break it down for our townies (and by that, I really mean Riabi) piece by piece.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 1: Evading the point. The point is not that Zerediah had a null read on Random--it's that Zerediah treated Random as \"definitely not scum\" and gave off a vibe that he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">wanted</div> to be able to read Random as more town, but couldn't justify it. It's not the column, it's the reasoning, as I've noted before.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 2: The problem isn't not being on a mislynch wagon--of course that's not scummy. Don't act dense. It's because you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">say</div> you don't want Drixx lynched, but you fail to provide any substantive support to another lynch, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">which means you don't care</div>.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 3: You misinterpret me. I'm not saying you don't know--I'm saying you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> have a brain stem, so you know what's up. And if you're speaking to his inexperience--he's got several games under his belt, and recent ones, too. He's not a complete moron, and would understand that there is absolutely <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">zero</div> reason to try to select a night target publicly without information when you can do so privately with information. And as far as \"looking for evidence to clear him\" goes--point me to one person who voiced agreement with your thoughts of dragonspawn telegraphing his TheSoldier track.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 4: The problem is not that you're defending yourself, it's that you're trying to intimidate people. You threatened people with scumreads repeatedly, all while doing nothing of substance to demonstrate protown intent. And assuming every misdirected wagon is coming from scum is: 1) an argument from authority of your mentors, and 2) hilariously, patently, immediately wrong. Just this game, remind me, who was one of the main drivers of the wagon on dragonspawn, who's town? By your own \"logic\", we should have every reason to believe that you're scum.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 5: Not making mistakes my ass. Committing to reads makes you more easy to read, helps other townies evaluate your reads so you have a better picture of the game, and generally is much, much better for town. It also helps ensure that your thought process is internally consistent. Not providing reads is scummy. Don't pretend it isn't. And guess what? Being wrong about your secondary reads when your primary one is right <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">literally does nothing bad</div> if it's a good-faith case. You just don't need to post your secondary reads because you don't need reads at all--just the appearance of not knowing the scumteam with total certainty.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 6: You just said that you assume those accusing you are scum, and respond vigorously. And yet you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">did not do so for someone you claim to be scumreading</div>. You aren't scumreading him. You just saw what you thought was a chance to convince the town that TheSoldier and I are acting in concert, and jumped on it. Not happening.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 7a: If you would play ball, I wouldn't have to point out that you're not doing anything.<br>\nResponse 7b: Two parts here. One: you refuse to address that I've called you on representing voting record as alignment-indicative. With Riabi noting that it isn't, suddenly you want to drop that piece of bullshit and hope we don't pick it up, but you're not getting away with that. Secondly, for the millionth time, it was a very, very short leap to (with my knowledge/assumptions), think that Riabi was claiming a shot vest.<br>\n-One person, someone who was going to be lynched Day 2, got killed Night 1.<br>\n-TheSoldier, someone generally very townie, claimed the kill.<br>\n-Players with bulletproof vests know that they got shot (this being the faulty bit)<br>\n-Riabi, an active and confirmed-town player, claimed a bulletproof vest.<br>\nAnybody can see how this amounts to me thinking \"oh, Riabi's claim implied he got shot Night 1\". And even once you remove the third bit, assuming Riabi got shot and TheSoldier is a vigilante makes much, much more sense than scum!Soldier and MonkeyMan being a threat to the scum team.<br>\n<br>\nResponse 8: You've responded now, yes--but you've twisted or evaded every point except the ones that, though compelling, are honestly open to interpretation. That post is a steaming pile of crap, and I'm not sure why I'm bothering with you--good practice, I suppose. You've already got what, three people on the wagon, one more with intent to hammer, and two others that believe me over you? Eh.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nHonestly, I'm feeling pretty comfortable with a hammer right about now. Everyone has taken a stand on Random, and though Lapsa v.

The ones who remained stared at the body, clearly in some kind of emotional shock.  They didn't notice when a small group of men and women pulled a small cardboard box from behind a nearby tree.  They gently pried the box open and walked over to the flag pole.  Lowering the American Flag slowly, they stopped when it was at half mast.  Silently, they watched it flutter poignantly for a few seconds before they continued it along its descent.  They deftly removed it and tied their own flag in its stead.  The red flag of communism Rose like a phoenix.  Their gentle task done, the group turned to the surviving populace and explained that they were now a part of something bigger than themselves.  Everything they owned, knew, and were belonged to a burgeoning State, to be distributed for the benefit of all.  Their new administrators would of course require more than the others to ease the stress accrued ensuring everyone else was equal, of course; but otherwise they were all comrades now.
