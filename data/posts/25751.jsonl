Respect each other. Intolerance will not be tolerated.<br>2. Play to your win condition.<br>3. Do not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>4. Do not communicate outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a \u201cNo Action\u201d PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>6. I reserve the right to make any changes to the rules at any time. My word is law.<br>7. Abusing exploits or loopholes will not be tolerated.<br>8. This is a normal game.<br>9. Enjoy ~<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death:</span><br>1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone\u2019s fate.<br>3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not required, but are helpful.<br>6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>8. I will post votecounts as often as possible, at least once a day (excluding possible holidays).<br>9. Deadlines may be extended to account for holidays.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous/Mechanics:</span><br>1. Purple is my color. Using purple will count as impersonating the mod.<br>2. No hidden text or cryptography.<br>3. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM me privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>4. I may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>5. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don\u2019t get missed.<br>6. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>7. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>8. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread.<br>9. If you think you may need to be replaced, notify me as soon as possible.<br></span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Remember, this is a normal setup, so there are at least 2 mafia members and one vanilla townie. Here is a sample Role PM:</span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: #005000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie:<br><br>You have no special abilities. You win when all other factions have been eliminated.<br><br>Please Confirm by sending me a PM saying /confirm and your Role Name.<br><br>Game Thread Link: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25751\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25751</a></span></span>"}

Basically the pony who is always lynch bait and generally seen as not very good.<br><br>Also just friendly advice, claiming VT way early and especially under no pressure is tactically a very bad move since it just lowers the PR pool for scum.  Yeah players will say stuff that if you look closely at times make it obvious they are VT or a PR and that actually very good for alignment tells at times, but just saying it like you did is really bad if you are town and still fairly poor even if you are scum.  If you think im going to break roleplaying which I havent for now getting close to a couple of years... yeah you have another thing coming.  If it bugs you that much you are free to replace out since you are apparently overburdened already though.<br><br>You also need to give more reasons behind your reads, especially the YOLO one because its a very valid point, not only that KH is one of the most overrated anythings ever but also that jeromus is just sidestepping quite a few key topics of coversation.

Either this or we are playing with somepony who only reads the post directly ahead of theirs or something.<br><br>Best way to deal with VI players is look at motivation behind their moves, depending on the type it can be very easy or difficult to do and work in certain ways.  Umbrage (caustic VI) is one of the easiest players to read as scum on the site but are hard to read as town (lest lack of scum read), while more raw newbies are easier to read as town than as scum.<br><br>KBW seems to at least be reacting to things in such a way that I can see a thought process and genuine confusion to things.  Emotion (yeah yeah coming from me) is not that easy to efficiently fake, especially emotion that takes a shot at making you seem competent.  While I think he is wrong and should try doing things a new way, listen to others and base opinions off that, replace out because he is overburneded, etc... im actually thinking KBW is more likely going to be town than scum.<br><br>@Elyse - YOLO is actually not super townie, but the fishing tell in that way is somewhat of a town tell.  If its obvious what is going on, scum usually will just log that one away while town is more likely to say something blatantly derpy about it.  There are more sly ways to fish that are scummy but when KBW says \"I am a VT\" thats basically something scum would keep hooves off of.  His ignoring of everything at first (like jeromus) is scummy but I do somewhat like his last post.  Probably is in a null-town group for me.<br><br>@jeromus - WHat is your read on KBW?"}

Pair that with the lack of really pushing in any big direction and more hanging back from key topics of conversation I think you are a good scum pick.  It sorta reads like a player who is really uncomfortable in the game, and with a lot of noise early that tends to equate as scum a whole lot more than town.  Even not for new players if something is going on that they dont get most tend to be a little quieter as they try and get a good grasp on what is actually happening.<br><br>Also for being aggressive, it really is very situational for me and tends to be mostly due to how aggressive I feel I need to be to keep the game on the tracks.  This one we have a lot of really shoddy early play so im going to clamp down hard as opposed to a game I have more ability to sit back and get reads.  Dont like being aggro usually, but realize the need in situations.<br><br>Also KBW is definantly the VI, whether he actually admits it or not and trys to correct it is how he eventually gets viewed in the course of site meta.

Dubious categorizations pretty much everywhere (what specifically separates null qwints and null-lurker Yoshi?  You even use the word lurker in qwints' blurb.

Anyway, let me recap what AA has done thus far:<br><br>- Explicitly stated five times that they will be \"jumping in\" or giving reads soon, only to never do so<br>- Greeted HD and then used one of their 14 total posts to vehemently defend him from a single-vote wagon<br>- Implying that they found Jeromus scummy despite never voting for him.  <br><br>That's it.  The post defending HD was particular jarring--in a sea of barely intelligible promises to start playing soon i promise!!!!!!!'s, they come out of nowhere to defend Human Destroyer for a basically indefensible position, claiming that it is somehow OK for some to replace in and not read the game because \"replacing in doesn't require you to read all the pages.\"  Huh?<br><br>This doesn't change my feelings on Jeromus either.  Notice how AA was cheerleading the Jeromus lynch without actually joining it, and her general lack of participation during basically the entire \"should we or shouldn't we lynch Jeromus\" period of the game.  They're both scum for me at this point."}

KBW though I have been reading as townish although at some points (especially around wagons) not as such, could be that \"so scummy just looks like bad player so statistically town\" or something.  Jeromus I thought was town for NOT voting AA when given the chance and me half threatening him with a lynch if he didnt do such, but again now im not as sure.<br><br>Most others I dont think would kill BY outside of a stalling kill but that usually suggests scum in a good spot (Desp in particular, gut still going crazy there but I cant find the reasons) or just a reason we cant see at point blank.  Most of my reads are being challenged by this and im lazy enough to not want to put the couple hours into reorginizing that I need to if its not actually needed.<br><br>Maybe im just holding out hope, but will probably figure something out soon.  Thinking vote for one of KBW/Desp/HD, outside chance YOLO.<br><br>I actually think the most town from this kill is Elyse because not too many scum wipe out the lynchable townie they are tunneled on without stunningly good reason (which would be jeromus scum, specifically jeromus scum).  Scum either is new, detached from the game or is somepony like Desp who views other power ponies as willing to defend them.  The kill is just so out of left field it seems like im missing something, I always keep my list of \"who I wont believe a PR claim from\" and BY was close to being on that list... pssh."}

I feel there's a very good chance at least one scum is hiding among them, possibly more. Out of those four, quints definitely looks the worst. Desperado and Human Destroyer have been posting decent content, while KBW still reads (Village) Idiot. Quints on the other hand does not help this game further at all. His play amounts to agreeing with other players and joining popular wagons. What's also interesting is that he criticizes other players for not giving reads, while he himself barely gives reads at all. After the first few pages of the game, all he has said about reads is that Elyse is town and ArcAngel/Jeromus seem scummy. So all we know about Quints's thoughts currently is that he thinks Elyse is town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Quints</span>"}

You never defended Jeromus yesterday.  You thought you were hammering him in #278, you still supported a Jeromus lynch even if he flipped town in #287, you were still happy with a Jeromus lynch in #299, and then you voted AA in #302 and then never talk about a Jeromus lynch again.  And my response was \"it was everyone's fault\" because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what you're saying isn't true</span>.  The closest you ever come to defending Jeromus is in #411, where you say you are still \"iffy\" on Jeromus but just don't think Jeromusscum wouldn't pass up the opportunity to lynch AA.  OK, but consider the alternative: Jeromusscum just escaped L-1 and probably isn't getting voted.  Why jump at the first ML opportunity (AA) when he's not in any more danger?  Jeromusscum was just as likely to defend AA as he was to lynch him.<br><br>Bottomline: it's pretty clear to me that your recollection of my interaction with KBW is flawed, so I suggest you re-read and reevaluate your relational tells, because this one is busted. <br><br>Personally, I'm struggling here.  I did not expect Jeromus to flip town and I have too many townreads, which means one of them is probably wrong.  My best read right now is that Flay/KBW are not teammates, but I'm suspicious of Qwints' vote just now and I obviously disagree with the basis of Dash's vote.  Given that mistrust, I'm disappointed in myself for dismissing my original read on Flay because of Dash's defense earlier, so I'm going to trust myself here and go this way.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Mr. Flay</span>"}

This isn't really different from yesterday, except Desperado hammered KBW for seemingly no reason at all. Desperado has been supporting his actions with (in my opinion) good reasoning, so I'm surprised he would hammer KBW out of the blue. His 'KBW would be lynched anyway' is an extreme weaksauce hammer. So yeah, let's lynch him.<br><br>Back to quints, the guy I voted yesterday because he did nothing and only joined town wagons. And he is... still doing nothing except advocating a quicklynch while we're most likely in LYLO. What a joker. Quints, I want to see you claim in your next post. If you don't, I'll vote you right away.<br><br>In any case, I certainly do not approve of a lynch before the massclaim is over (unless quints keeps refusing to claim). So far only vanilla townies have died, so a massclaim might actually give us another clear or two."}

My \"obv-scum\" post at the end of the day gave me the ability to push a lynch on my guilty target without arising suspicion, meaning scum might have a chance to get another investigation in without scum being aware of my role. I can certainly understand the argument that a Desparado investigation wasn't optimal, but calling bizarre just doesn't make sense. Here's why you can know I'm actually a cop:<br><br>1) Breadcrumbed D1<br>2) Reported result of my N1 investigation in my first D2 post<br>3) Reported result of my N2 investigation in my first D3 post<br><br>Why I chose Elyse - she got on the AA wagon in a somewhat awkward way. She had several posts complaining about the AA wagon, then says she's willing to join it because of the lack of progress and finally only votes after a vote count. I got town and behaved accordingly.<br><br>Why I chose Desperado - I didn't want to lose if he was a VI. <br><br>RBD, what possible benefit do we get out of continuing the mass claim? Set-up spec leads me to guess that, at most, there's some sort of protective role left. If we don't claim, scum have to figure out whether to shoot Elyse or me while worrying about a protective role. If we do, scum can plan their night actions accordingly. Why help them?"}

If you have a guilty in what you think is lylo you claim it.  Plus given that you never were a town read for me at any point in the game really, not sure what your point is there.<br><br>Anyway, just because you are acting like you have role related information does nothing to make you obviously town or anything like that.  First its not always possible to tell saying you have information apart from \"im sure\".  Just because a player reads like they might have role information doesnt mean you just blindly buy it, especially at lylo, double especially when they are claiming it on a player who logically should never have been targeted.  Even now \"no way anypony could believe he was town\" and you TARGET him??  I would actually not at all be shocked if you are still scum because your own logic just says you shouldnt have targeted him.<br><br>Basically all you are saying is \"I was obv-town and Desp was obv-scum\" when really, you were not at all.  You actually targeting him proves that.  Also the whole \"go to mislynch\" thing is a joke.  If I pegged you as a good cop bet as TOWN you could bet I would have done that as scum looking for more PRs, I tend to be pretty good at tracking them down by behavior alone, when they are breadcrumbing or anything its easier.  Ask HD on that one, was scum in a game with him recently and I called the BG night one and figured the tracker within the first couple posts of D3 when they started talking about my partner.  Either way as scum my \"go to mislynch\" would have been Flay/YOLO, I had called both scum together and was very free to attack either of them.  Never even really mentioned you up untill that point, I looked good with a Desp-scum flip being basically the only one who called him scum before the hammer, why destroy a good thing try to defend him from role information there?  Also for that matter why kill BB who was suspicious of you if you were my mislynch?<br><br>Second, as I have said Desp was a horrible target for an investigation.  Yolo/Flay or something would have been better since neither were dying and both were more likely to be around in an endgame.  You dont target the player who you think is most likely scum as cop.  Or any info role really.  Its fundamentally bad play.  A couple of cop play 101 failings still make me only at about 80% you are actually a cop because you should know this stuff.<br><br>Third... im not sure what your point is.  It seems like you are complaining that you werent obviously town really more than anything else.  Given that its obvious that I figured you for PR, why do I play how I did as scum there?  Only way you would ever have been lynchable is another strong PR claims, which as scum would be obvious doesnt exist - since I was coming out the gate swinging I would have had all partners compared for massclaim as well.  So where is my advatage as scum for doing that?  Even if im going to push you are most likely in a scum duo only, Desp is still the correct lynch there so that doesnt work.  There is no win playing like that as scum.  None.  So why even do it?"}

It should be obvious I know what im talking about when it comes to PRs and VTs, thats what I do in these games.  Everpony is good at something and one of the things im best at is quickly hunting down who is a PR and who is not.  Given how everypony played, I would have known instantly as scum that qwints had role info on Desp so there is no way I would have tried to antagonize him when it would have been an easy bus.<br><br>Also im not sure how you are calling HD scum with me when I was pushing hard for a lynch of Bomb and pretty much have been calling HD scum untill late yesterday.  Also the fact that apparently if calling somepony town makes them a scumbuddy, im town because I was basically the ONLY one calling Desp scum.<br><br>Or you can add in the fact that if I was scum BY (VT and lynchable) wouldnt have died (BB/qwints/Flay PR pool again).  And that you would have since you were saying \"the power players are scum\", last PR would probably be investigative so taking that risk is fine if you arent sure.  And I would have lynched Desp into the ground since I had been calling him scum and qwints fit the setup perfectly.<br><br>So lets here a reason then, or if you are going to stick to \"the vote\" explain why I would vote HD or YOLO when there apparently are three scum and they arent scum together."}

I don't like quickvotes in LYLO, especially not when they're without reasoning. Neither Rainbowdash nor Human Destroyer has made any kind of case on the living players, so I don't know why they would throw their votes out there. This 'X and Y can't be scum together' is neither helpful nor insightful.<br><br>I still think Human Destroyer is most likely to be scum. I've said it before but I'll say it again, this dude has done nothing but joined townwagon after townwagon without giving any reasoning of his own. He has been going with the flow all game and I'm completely appalled as to why he doesn't receive more scrutiny for his constant following behaviour. Even during LYLO he straight away hops on a wagon.<br><br>Mr. Flay is still a shitty poster. I called him out early game for playing weakly despite being a 2004 player, and he responded by saying his strength was in the late game. Where is that strength? All I'm seeing is 'Bad connection', 'Busy with scummies images' and 'I'm waiting for other players to say something first'. Flay still has done jack this game. I could even go as far to say he is active lurking.<br><br>Rainbowdash's constant theorizing isn't pro-town in my book, but at least she's putting some content out there unlike HD and Flay. The L-1 vote is really bothersome though, and I don't like this in particular:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4855327#p4855327\" class=\"postlink\">post 649</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>As you said, im not dumb.  There is no way im not going to be voting Flay outside of essentially a scumclaim from YOLO/HD.  Only way Flay is town is if there are two scum or if one of YOLO-HD is a traitor.  Why go through the motions if I know who im going to be voting?  That just wastes all of our time.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm all for not wasting time, but let's compare it to this post from yesterday:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4837615#p4837615\" class=\"postlink\">post 583</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4837609#p4837609\" class=\"postlink\">post 582</a>, qwints wrote:</cite>HD, you do realize that this just allows desp to self-hammer and prevent any more discussion of tells. I'm at a complete loss for why you wanted to prevent a quick lynch to mass claim but are pushing it now.</div></blockquote><br><br>Probably because there is no point unless you want to say stuff at this point.  Kill is probably already decided for scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span><br><br>Go for it.</div></blockquote><br><br>So yesterday you were sure Desperado was scum and voted him, but after Quints called you back you unvoted and then didn't vote Desperado again for the rest of the day. Today you vote Flay, confirmed-town Elyse calls you back, but now you suddenly decide you're not going to waste time? Talk about inconsistent behaviour.<br><br>At this point I could see myself voting for any of the three, so I'd definitely be interested in the thought processes of others. Please provide some content on which I can judge you. Bonus points for deeper reasoning than 'X and Y can't be scum together'."}

YOLO is taking absolutely zero stances about anything.<br><br>Also fun fact - if there are actually only two scum in the game its probably HD or YOLO.  Flay would be town there.  From a review standpoint though, something is still very off since even setup as stands assuming three goons I would think as somewhat scum sided - still almost would expect a traitor instead or two scum with daytalk (or gunsmith, etc) or something to that extent.  Funniest part is I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> feel like there is just one scum left.  If it wasnt for HD-YOLO making so little sense, I would be voting YOLO here I think.<br><br>Go look at past scum games, im anything but derpy.  Ive lost two games, one was due to listening to my partner against all my instincts followed by them (essentially) playing right into a forced loss and the other was a nightless game where town got a really lucky play in and there was to shot from there.<br><br>Just look at my last game, has me scum and HD town in it.  Heck just look at the scum QT.  I figured out the setup pretty fast, picked out a PR by the end of the first day, caught the breadcrumbing role fast while keeping heat away from my partner and myself easily.  I know its wierd to hear but im not dumb scum, never would have let the BY NK happen as scum.  Ever.<br><br>If you dont like the WIFOM, give me something to defend against.  If you want to call me scum for a fast vote - explain to me how HD and YOLO are scum together despite how HD entered the game and drew the YOLO reaction as he did.<br><br>Or for that matter how you are kinda using the HD-Flay interactions of HD not wanting Flay vigged as reason as to why im scum with HD (or whatever you were going for there).<br><br>Lets make this very easy, I know Elyse is going to call me scum or something for it but I will force things as clear as possible since even if this doesnt work we are going to lose anyways.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@YOLO</span> - Vote for me.

Make it Goon-Framer and its still about even here (slight town lean), even tri-goon works but the addition of a Framer creates massive counter swing to scum.  Basically framer target gets hit by cop and scum auto-wins it with this lineup so about 5-10% of iterations become crushing scum victory.<br><br>Framers are bad roles in general though in normals since it can create situations where players are more or less being lied to which is why they are constantly under discussion of being banned from normals.

You dont put all your cards down as confirmed town or ever vote first as confirmed town in lylo.  When the entire case was \"I voted first\" when it was based entirely on what must be true, its annoying because im being voted for correct play.

It just bugs me, I read 0% of any of the flavor and just want to see a flip on time instead of having to wait for one.  In a bit of a minorty there but its just a courtisy thing to the players in non-flavored games, should take you about a minute to get a flip together.

Given that 70% of the runs should be about 2/3 scum win, this is not balanced.  At all, and thats assuming all scum are goons.  Add in the framer and you are taking about 15% of hitting scum D1 with vig to critical town loss due to cop targeting framed player.  If you are going to say they shoot without a claim, you are increaseing the large scum sided scenario to 73% with a 9% essentially scum auto-win.<br><br>Its simply not balanced.  I would be floored if scum won less than 60% of this in a long run and would probably put my money on closer to 2/3 or even slightly higher.  Town needs a cop D3 with two results or they are dead to rights.<br><br>Didnt help having KBW as town though."}

Im part of that group and would never have signed off on it being balanced because its quite simply not.  Second, lynching bad players who are remotely scummy is a good thing.  As callous as it sounds, it tends to make them realize they need to get better or just stop playing.  Its worked in the past both ways (klick/kondi is a perfect example of learning how to get better).  I would fully be willing to policy lynch KBW to start in any other games though, almost five years into playing and there are few players I think skill wise are near him that ive ever seen."}

Im not going to waste a week trying to act like im reaching a conclusion im already at, if I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">SCUM</span> I absolutely would have not voted fast there not only to see if I could get town to lay a bad vote but aslo because its \"pro-town\" to do.

Really +2 VT and this is probably a decent setup, or with two scum and daytalk.  The way it is scum should just crush, whenyou have scum afraid to hammer because town is underpowered something is very wrong."}
