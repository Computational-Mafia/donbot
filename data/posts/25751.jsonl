Halt!&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nYou hear an unfamiliar voice coming from the side of the road. Swerving your headlights in the direction of the voice, you make out the outline of a figure cloaked in black. Trying to get a better view, you switch off the windshield wipers momentarily.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Stop the car.

You roll down the passenger side window as you bring the old car to a halt by the curb.<br>\n<br>\nThe figure slowly approaches your car. Rain glitters in the beams of your headlights. The figure slides off her hood, revealing a young policewoman in uniform.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;There&#8217;s been a murder up at Hell&#8217;s Bottom. We&#8217;ve been ordered to stop all cars leaving the area.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nA few hours later, you&#8217;re in a room with 11 other suspects rounded up from around the county. By some grave mistake the police have been sent away to cook noodles in a noodle factory.<br>\n<br>\nYou have all been placed into a single large cell, and the door has been locked. Most of you are innocent &#8211; but some of you are cold blooded killers. Someone says that everyone should just wait until the police come back. Of course, everyone else disagrees.<br>\n<br>\nSomeone finds a rope strung between the bars of the cell.

Respect each other. Intolerance will not be tolerated.<br>\n2. Play to your win condition.<br>\n3. Do not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n4. Do not communicate outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. I reserve the right to make any changes to the rules at any time. My word is law.<br>\n7. Abusing exploits or loopholes will not be tolerated.<br>\n8. This is a normal game.<br>\n9. Enjoy ~<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death:</div><br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not required, but are helpful.<br>\n6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n8. I will post votecounts as often as possible, at least once a day (excluding possible holidays).<br>\n9. Deadlines may be extended to account for holidays.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous/Mechanics:</div><br>\n1. Purple is my color. Using purple will count as impersonating the mod.<br>\n2. No hidden text or cryptography.<br>\n3. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM me privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n4. I may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n5. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n6. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n7. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n8. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread.<br>\n9. If you think you may need to be replaced, notify me as soon as possible.<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Remember, this is a normal setup, so there are at least 2 mafia members and one vanilla townie. Here is a sample Role PM:</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#005000\">Vanilla Townie:<br>\n<br>\nYou have no special abilities. You win when all other factions have been eliminated.<br>\n<br>\nPlease Confirm by sending me a PM saying /confirm and your Role Name.<br>\n<br>\nGame Thread Link: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25751\" class=\"postlink\"></a><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25751\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25751</a></div>", "time": "Mon Feb 18, 2013 2:38 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25751&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "25751"}

If you don't \"do\" RVS, then by definition your first post should be contentful and contain pertinent questions.  By saying you don't do RVS but you also aren't going to post any content, what you're really saying is \"I'm going to post unreadable shit AND not give you a vote to be analyzed later.\"  You're trying to have your cake and eat it it too.</div></blockquote>I'm going to chalk you up to \"not getting it\" for now, but keep an eye on you for later. RVS/RQS is just a way to kick off the lowest-information stage of the game. Since Day Starts have become the norm, it is much harder to get the ball rolling. Whatever people do to get information is fine, so long as it's actually forwarding the game. \"wait and see what other people do next\" (i.e. Blue Yoshi) is not useful. Lurking is not useful. Attacking is useful, so I'll grant you that. As for why I posted, I was online and it got the game into my topiclist.

Basically the pony who is always lynch bait and generally seen as not very good.<br>\n<br>\nAlso just friendly advice, claiming VT way early and especially under no pressure is tactically a very bad move since it just lowers the PR pool for scum.  Yeah players will say stuff that if you look closely at times make it obvious they are VT or a PR and that actually very good for alignment tells at times, but just saying it like you did is really bad if you are town and still fairly poor even if you are scum.  If you think im going to break roleplaying which I havent for now getting close to a couple of years... yeah you have another thing coming.  If it bugs you that much you are free to replace out since you are apparently overburdened already though.<br>\n<br>\nYou also need to give more reasons behind your reads, especially the YOLO one because its a very valid point, not only that KH is one of the most overrated anythings ever but also that jeromus is just sidestepping quite a few key topics of coversation.

Either this or we are playing with somepony who only reads the post directly ahead of theirs or something.<br>\n<br>\nBest way to deal with VI players is look at motivation behind their moves, depending on the type it can be very easy or difficult to do and work in certain ways.  Umbrage (caustic VI) is one of the easiest players to read as scum on the site but are hard to read as town (lest lack of scum read), while more raw newbies are easier to read as town than as scum.<br>\n<br>\nKBW seems to at least be reacting to things in such a way that I can see a thought process and genuine confusion to things.  Emotion (yeah yeah coming from me) is not that easy to efficiently fake, especially emotion that takes a shot at making you seem competent.  While I think he is wrong and should try doing things a new way, listen to others and base opinions off that, replace out because he is overburneded, etc... im actually thinking KBW is more likely going to be town than scum.<br>\n<br>\n@Elyse - YOLO is actually not super townie, but the fishing tell in that way is somewhat of a town tell.  If its obvious what is going on, scum usually will just log that one away while town is more likely to say something blatantly derpy about it.  There are more sly ways to fish that are scummy but when KBW says \"I am a VT\" thats basically something scum would keep hooves off of.  His ignoring of everything at first (like jeromus) is scummy but I do somewhat like his last post.

Pair that with the lack of really pushing in any big direction and more hanging back from key topics of conversation I think you are a good scum pick.  It sorta reads like a player who is really uncomfortable in the game, and with a lot of noise early that tends to equate as scum a whole lot more than town.  Even not for new players if something is going on that they dont get most tend to be a little quieter as they try and get a good grasp on what is actually happening.<br>\n<br>\nAlso for being aggressive, it really is very situational for me and tends to be mostly due to how aggressive I feel I need to be to keep the game on the tracks.  This one we have a lot of really shoddy early play so im going to clamp down hard as opposed to a game I have more ability to sit back and get reads.  Dont like being aggro usually, but realize the need in situations.<br>\n<br>\nAlso KBW is definantly the VI, whether he actually admits it or not and trys to correct it is how he eventually gets viewed in the course of site meta.  Being seen as that at first isnt the end of the world, some players actually have overcame those types of things and are accepted as decent players on the site, others just continue to be shocked and appauled that they are always seen as bad (and if its always - yes you are a VI) .<br>\n<br>\nBasically step it up.  Dont complain about being seen as a bad player, do something to prove you arent.<br>\n<br>\n@jeromus - This isnt IRL mafia, im talking so obviously it isnt.

In particular, he seems to recognize that he's posting like a dick in #105 when he mentions that \"being snarky is bringing the game down,\" which he followed shortly thereafter with a post entirely composed by a GIF saying \"Getting real tired of your shit.\"  Pretty snarky, wouldn't you say?  <br>\n<br>\nHe also claims in #131 that Elyse's vote on him is wrong because he's \"upped the content level...made time for the game\" when in his posts there's really no indication of that.

Is this really such a big scumtell to you that you would contradict your earlier statement?<br>\n<br>\nSo I see Jeromus is the newest hype. I don't feel like joining. Jeromus is one of the most active posters in this game and while I agree that he has a low words/content ratio, it's not something I'm very concerned about. In my eperience active players very often receive heat Day 1. They say the most, so there's a good chance they post something that might be interpreted as scummy. Jeromus hasn't done even that, he just hasn't generated much discussion. Not L-2 worthy imo.<br>\n<br>\nSo what is vote worthy then? Tough call.<br>\nI'm not seeing anything very scummy yet, but I'm surprised about the lack of good stuff from Mr. Flay. When he replaced in, I was quite happy because I assumed we were going to see some amazing moves from him, with him being the site head and long time player and all. But his play so far has been very disappointing. He hasn't done much really.<br>\nRainbowdash reads like Keybladewielders' babysitter. Seriously, half her posts consist of interaction with KBW. Her other content is good though.<br>\n<br>\nTalking about peeps that don't post stuff, ISO this here Quints guy for kicks. Quints, you haven't done much since the start of the game. That's not uncommon, but half your posts are 'other people should post more'. In addition to that, you've voted two players on the basis that they haven't posted much. That's quite ironic coming from you, really.<br>\n<br>\nThis is not the big post I intended it to be, but at least I can say that I'll have more time now than I did past week so I'll be active.

Dubious categorizations pretty much everywhere (what specifically separates null qwints and null-lurker Yoshi?  You even use the word lurker in qwints' blurb.  Null-townish and town-leaning scum are equally vague).  Only one straight up read, in the form of a love letter to rainbow.  Are you suggesting that being the best player is a towntell?  I think there are far better (and convincing) ways to establish someone as town.    <br>\n<br>\nIn other words, I don't think there's really that much to cull from Yoshi's reads.  I'm also not sure how accurate we can expect someone's player-by-player to be on D1, so I question the purpose of this post.  As someone else said, activity is not a bunch of big, catch-all posts interspersed by inactivity, but constant and fruitful engagement in the town discussion.

The post defending HD was particular jarring--in a sea of barely intelligible promises to start playing soon i promise!!!!!!!'s, they come out of nowhere to defend Human Destroyer for a basically indefensible position, claiming that it is somehow OK for some to replace in and not read the game because \"replacing in doesn't require you to read all the pages.\"  Huh?<br>\n<br>\nThis doesn't change my feelings on Jeromus either.  Notice how AA was cheerleading the Jeromus lynch without actually joining it, and her general lack of participation during basically the entire \"should we or shouldn't we lynch Jeromus\" period of the game.

If you don't \"do\" RVS, then by definition your first post should be contentful and contain pertinent questions.  By saying you don't do RVS but you also aren't going to post any content, what you're really saying is \"I'm going to post unreadable shit AND not give you a vote to be analyzed later.\"  You're trying to have your cake and eat it it too.</div></blockquote>I'm going to chalk you up to \"not getting it\" for now, but keep an eye on you for later. RVS/RQS is just a way to kick off the lowest-information stage of the game. Since Day Starts have become the norm, it is much harder to get the ball rolling. Whatever people do to get information is fine, so long as it's actually forwarding the game. \"wait and see what other people do next\" (i.e. Blue Yoshi) is not useful. Lurking is not useful. Attacking is useful, so I'll grant you that. As for why I posted, I was online and it got the game into my topiclist.

KBW though I have been reading as townish although at some points (especially around wagons) not as such, could be that \"so scummy just looks like bad player so statistically town\" or something.  Jeromus I thought was town for NOT voting AA when given the chance and me half threatening him with a lynch if he didnt do such, but again now im not as sure.<br>\n<br>\nMost others I dont think would kill BY outside of a stalling kill but that usually suggests scum in a good spot (Desp in particular, gut still going crazy there but I cant find the reasons) or just a reason we cant see at point blank.  Most of my reads are being challenged by this and im lazy enough to not want to put the couple hours into reorginizing that I need to if its not actually needed.<br>\n<br>\nMaybe im just holding out hope, but will probably figure something out soon.  Thinking vote for one of KBW/Desp/HD, outside chance YOLO.<br>\n<br>\nI actually think the most town from this kill is Elyse because not too many scum wipe out the lynchable townie they are tunneled on without stunningly good reason (which would be jeromus scum, specifically jeromus scum).  Scum either is new, detached from the game or is somepony like Desp who views other power ponies as willing to defend them.  The kill is just so out of left field it seems like im missing something, I always keep my list of \"who I wont believe a PR claim from\" and BY was close to being on that list... pssh.", "time": "Sat Mar 16, 2013 6:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25751&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "25751"}

Scum either is new, detached from the game or is somepony like Desp who views other power ponies as willing to defend them.  The kill is just so out of left field it seems like im missing something, I always keep my list of \"who I wont believe a PR claim from\" and BY was close to being on that list... pssh.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy head hurts from all this WIFOM and night speculation. In any case, I can't see how this post leads up to a KBW/Desp/HD/YOLO vote.

I feel there's a very good chance at least one scum is hiding among them, possibly more. Out of those four, quints definitely looks the worst. Desperado and Human Destroyer have been posting decent content, while KBW still reads (Village) Idiot. Quints on the other hand does not help this game further at all. His play amounts to agreeing with other players and joining popular wagons. What's also interesting is that he criticizes other players for not giving reads, while he himself barely gives reads at all.

I still think you are a really good pick for scum though, especially as your response to me saying I disliked the wagon on him was \"its everyponys fault\".\"<br>\n<br>\nAlright, this is just dumb.  You never defended Jeromus yesterday.  You thought you were hammering him in #278, you still supported a Jeromus lynch even if he flipped town in #287, you were still happy with a Jeromus lynch in #299, and then you voted AA in #302 and then never talk about a Jeromus lynch again.  And my response was \"it was everyone's fault\" because <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">what you're saying isn't true</div>.  The closest you ever come to defending Jeromus is in #411, where you say you are still \"iffy\" on Jeromus but just don't think Jeromusscum wouldn't pass up the opportunity to lynch AA.  OK, but consider the alternative: Jeromusscum just escaped L-1 and probably isn't getting voted.  Why jump at the first ML opportunity (AA) when he's not in any more danger?  Jeromusscum was just as likely to defend AA as he was to lynch him.<br>\n<br>\nBottomline: it's pretty clear to me that your recollection of my interaction with KBW is flawed, so I suggest you re-read and reevaluate your relational tells, because this one is busted. <br>\n<br>\nPersonally, I'm struggling here.  I did not expect Jeromus to flip town and I have too many townreads, which means one of them is probably wrong.  My best read right now is that Flay/KBW are not teammates, but I'm suspicious of Qwints' vote just now and I obviously disagree with the basis of Dash's vote.  Given that mistrust, I'm disappointed in myself for dismissing my original read on Flay because of Dash's defense earlier, so I'm going to trust myself here and go this way.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Mr. Flay</div>", "time": "Mon Mar 25, 2013 5:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25751&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "25751"}

This isn't really different from yesterday, except Desperado hammered KBW for seemingly no reason at all. Desperado has been supporting his actions with (in my opinion) good reasoning, so I'm surprised he would hammer KBW out of the blue. His 'KBW would be lynched anyway' is an extreme weaksauce hammer. So yeah, let's lynch him.<br>\n<br>\nBack to quints, the guy I voted yesterday because he did nothing and only joined town wagons. And he is... still doing nothing except advocating a quicklynch while we're most likely in LYLO. What a joker. Quints, I want to see you claim in your next post. If you don't, I'll vote you right away.<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, I certainly do not approve of a lynch before the massclaim is over (unless quints keeps refusing to claim). So far only vanilla townies have died, so a massclaim might actually give us another clear or two.", "time": "Sat Mar 30, 2013 9:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25751&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "25751"}

My \"obv-scum\" post at the end of the day gave me the ability to push a lynch on my guilty target without arising suspicion, meaning scum might have a chance to get another investigation in without scum being aware of my role.

She had several posts complaining about the AA wagon, then says she's willing to join it because of the lack of progress and finally only votes after a vote count. I got town and behaved accordingly.<br>\n<br>\nWhy I chose Desperado - I didn't want to lose if he was a VI. <br>\n<br>\nRBD, what possible benefit do we get out of continuing the mass claim? Set-up spec leads me to guess that, at most, there's some sort of protective role left. If we don't claim, scum have to figure out whether to shoot Elyse or me while worrying about a protective role.

If you have a guilty in what you think is lylo you claim it.  Plus given that you never were a town read for me at any point in the game really, not sure what your point is there.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, just because you are acting like you have role related information does nothing to make you obviously town or anything like that.  First its not always possible to tell saying you have information apart from \"im sure\".  Just because a player reads like they might have role information doesnt mean you just blindly buy it, especially at lylo, double especially when they are claiming it on a player who logically should never have been targeted.  Even now \"no way anypony could believe he was town\" and you TARGET him??  I would actually not at all be shocked if you are still scum because your own logic just says you shouldnt have targeted him.<br>\n<br>\nBasically all you are saying is \"I was obv-town and Desp was obv-scum\" when really, you were not at all.  You actually targeting him proves that.  Also the whole \"go to mislynch\" thing is a joke.  If I pegged you as a good cop bet as TOWN you could bet I would have done that as scum looking for more PRs, I tend to be pretty good at tracking them down by behavior alone, when they are breadcrumbing or anything its easier.  Ask HD on that one, was scum in a game with him recently and I called the BG night one and figured the tracker within the first couple posts of D3 when they started talking about my partner.  Either way as scum my \"go to mislynch\" would have been Flay/YOLO, I had called both scum together and was very free to attack either of them.  Never even really mentioned you up untill that point, I looked good with a Desp-scum flip being basically the only one who called him scum before the hammer, why destroy a good thing try to defend him from role information there?  Also for that matter why kill BB who was suspicious of you if you were my mislynch?<br>\n<br>\nSecond, as I have said Desp was a horrible target for an investigation.  Yolo/Flay or something would have been better since neither were dying and both were more likely to be around in an endgame.  You dont target the player who you think is most likely scum as cop.  Or any info role really.  Its fundamentally bad play.  A couple of cop play 101 failings still make me only at about 80% you are actually a cop because you should know this stuff.<br>\n<br>\nThird... im not sure what your point is.  It seems like you are complaining that you werent obviously town really more than anything else.  Given that its obvious that I figured you for PR, why do I play how I did as scum there?  Only way you would ever have been lynchable is another strong PR claims, which as scum would be obvious doesnt exist - since I was coming out the gate swinging I would have had all partners compared for massclaim as well.  So where is my advatage as scum for doing that?  Even if im going to push you are most likely in a scum duo only, Desp is still the correct lynch there so that doesnt work.  There is no win playing like that as scum.  None.

This 'X and Y can't be scum together' is neither helpful nor insightful.<br>\n<br>\nI still think Human Destroyer is most likely to be scum. I've said it before but I'll say it again, this dude has done nothing but joined townwagon after townwagon without giving any reasoning of his own. He has been going with the flow all game and I'm completely appalled as to why he doesn't receive more scrutiny for his constant following behaviour. Even during LYLO he straight away hops on a wagon.<br>\n<br>\nMr. Flay is still a shitty poster. I called him out early game for playing weakly despite being a 2004 player, and he responded by saying his strength was in the late game. Where is that strength? All I'm seeing is 'Bad connection', 'Busy with scummies images' and 'I'm waiting for other players to say something first'. Flay still has done jack this game. I could even go as far to say he is active lurking.<br>\n<br>\nRainbowdash's constant theorizing isn't pro-town in my book, but at least she's putting some content out there unlike HD and Flay.

He had no real reasons though, so basically it just looks like distancing to me. When asked he said \"I see no content \" from a new replacement. But in the <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4770805#p4770805\">very same post</a>, he jumps ship to <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">ArcAngel</div> (2nd vote), while still saying he wants to lynch HD. ArcAngel gets lynched in about two more pages. <br>\n</li><li>Day Two: Again misses the first several days of the Day, though he did apparently get replaced in other games for similar lack of activity. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">(he <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4794268#p4794268\" class=\"postlink\">discloses this</a> so don't modkill me for ongoing games, 10506670)</div><br>\n</li><li>He's still talking to HD first out of the gate, but his read has \"improved\" and he \"like<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"> your town/scum lists and vote agression\". <br>\n<li>More interestingly, he complains about the NK analysis. Not the weird kill, just the analysis, mostly by RBD and myself. in fact he doesn't mention the <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">BY/FT</div> kill at all.<br>\n</li><li>After YANP (yet another prod), YOLO reacts to the Dayvig claim from <div style=\"display:inline;color:#000088\">Elyse</div> by...not reacting? <br>\n</li><li>Jeromus gets shot - YOLO finally launches into something approximating gameplay and analyzes the wagons.

He discards <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Desperado</div> and HD as pro-town, and <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">KBW</div> as a VI.

There was no mention of the other ten suspects, and for years afterwards the case at Hell's Bottom was forgotten.<br>\n<br>\nThere was only one loose end to be tied up. That was the third murderer rumored to be involved in the initial killing. The countryside stood sentinel for ten long years, but the last killer never surfaced ever again. It was reasoned that he must have been killed in some accident sometime or another or gone into permanent hiding.<br>\n<br>\n14 years after the case was first brought up, a constable at the Hell's County Jail made a startling discovery. While renovating the cracked floor of one of the cells, the constable found that one of the massive concrete slabs that made up the floor was surprisingly loose.

I mean really... no way that was balanced.<br>\n<br>\nKBW for +- scum MVP?<br>\n<br>\nMod stuff was fine, but as a MN reviewer myself there is no way I would have cleared this one.  Make it Goon-Framer and its still about even here (slight town lean), even tri-goon works but the addition of a Framer creates massive counter swing to scum.  Basically framer target gets hit by cop and scum auto-wins it with this lineup so about 5-10% of iterations become crushing scum victory.<br>\n<br>\nFramers are bad roles in general though in normals since it can create situations where players are more or less being lied to which is why they are constantly under discussion of being banned from normals.  Didnt come into play but im still not sure how this is balanced.  If three scum were mandatory goon-goon-traitor was very balanced here.<br>\n<br>\nElyse didnt play endgame right though.
