The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>\n2. Play to win.<br>\n3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>\n4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>\n6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">this color</div></div>. Do not use this color.<br>\n8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>\n9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>\n11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>\n12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>\n13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules</div><br>\n1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>\n3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>\n4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>\n5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>\n6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>\n7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>\n8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting Rules</div><br>\n1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player name or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Setup Rules</div><br>\nAs a Mini Normal game, the exact details of this game's setup are not public. However, you do know the following facts about the setup:<br>\n1. At least 12 of the 13 players have an explicitly normal role, from the following list: Vanilla Townie, Sane Cop, Doctor, Vigilante, Roleblocker, Mason, Innocent Child, Jailkeeper, Tracker, Watcher, Gunsmith, Miller, Bodyguard, Role Cop, Doublevoter, Hider, Neighbor, Neighborizer, Jack of All Trades, Serial Killer, Mafia Goon, Mafia Traitor, Mafia Godfather, Mafia Framer, Mafia-aligned versions of above roles, possibly with an explicitly normal modifier: Even/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Bulletproof, Neighbor, Compulsive, Macho, Weak, Backup (with or without primary role present). It is possible that all 13 players have a role on this list; it is also possible that the 13th player has some other role with \"basic\" Mafia traits.<br>\n2. There are either 1 or 2 anti-town factions consisting of 2 or more players; and either 0 or 1 anti-town factions consisting of a single player.<br>\n3. The only possible win conditions are the Town, Mafia/Werewolf, Traitor, and Serial Killer win conditions. (So no jesters, lynchers, survivors, or cults.)<br>\n4. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini 1472, [Player]! You are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Abilities:</div><br>\nYou have none aside from your voice and your vote.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Win Condition:</div><br>\nYou win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town-aligned player alive.<br>\n<br>\nPlease confirm via PM stating your role and your alignment.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Tue Jul 09, 2013 6:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

However, I don't buy that he is telling the truth about his intended goal because his posts weren't actually threatening. As for \"trying to get a discussion going,\" I think most people are trying to do that, some in more effective ways than others. For instance, I started a discussion with my FOS on Tammy and Slumber.

I react a lot differently to being called scum when scum than when town.

Also, anyone who actually knows my meta knows that though I do try day one, I'm not one for always taking day one too too seriously because my reads tend to suck ass day one.  And anyone who even knows a small bit of my meta knows that I take the first few pages of the game even less seriously than that.  It's actually a rare game that I do something really serious before page five and that's if something strikes my fancy.

This point is also reinforced by the fact that The Fonz has been on this site for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">6</div> years.

The only reason I knew that it was a hydra is because I saw them being denied entry into another game because of MM being in too many games.  It's not listed on the first page that they're a hydra or who their heads are, and asking for someone to state who the heads of a hydra is is a whole lot different than asking for someone to link to their past scum/town games.  It takes a hell of a lot less digging to find out someone's meta, no matter what is or isn't on a wiki, than it does to find out if someone is a hydra and who they are.  That information should be readily available to us.<br>\n<br>\nI don't see anything wrong with Implosion's vote on PL especially at this point in the game where adding pressure to someone who looks suspicious is helpful and I think you guys are making a really weird thing about it.

Because as far as I'm concerned anyone who actually knows my meta, knows that the lighthearted let's have fun, omigod empire's a troll and i'm town here beginning, makes me far far more likely town.  So, yes, some of his posts annoyed me because it didn't seem to me that he was reading what I said and putting it into context.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yes, the interaction between me and sbp was fun banter.  I was having fun.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now for the incorrect meta knowledge of me?  I don't think anyone has ever described my town play as being laid back.  That actually far more describes my scum play.  You have knowledge of me from two games.  I was scum in Abarat (I replaced Matt hi!) and was pretty laid back as is my tendency as scum.  I was town in Ladies Night which was actually kind of an odd game for me.  I was super busy during day one, so I came in and gave reads and whiteknighted people who were getting run up for silly reasons.  Then day two I super hard pushed a mislynch and was killed that night.  I came under no suspicion that I remember during that game at all.  I'm not very laid back.  In black flag faraday called out arthur for scum reading me by saying I'm way more bitchy as town.  In yoloville Shadoweh was scum reading me because I wasn't being bitchy enough and yelling at enough people.  In short, I'm a bit high-strung, easily annoyed, a bit of a bitch, self-absorbed, condescending, and sometimes aggressive.  BUT I do like long walks on the beach.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 146 wrote:</cite>Hell yes I was being dismissive.

What reasons do you have to be dismissive other than being perturbed at having to address suspicions in a game of Mafia? <br>\n<br>\nAlso, you mentioned you were celebrating, but earlier you mention you and SBP were sort of \"testing\" each other.

I do have a tendency to treat what I view as silly suspicions in a condescending or dismissive way...when town but you'd have to actually know my meta to know that of me.  I do mind incorrect meta being applied to me.  <br>\n<br>\nPoint B:  Why can't you?  But, I wasn't actually testing Matt.

He had just posted, he's clearly not making an effort (and telling us that he isn't), and he's not even clear about that.<br>\n<br>\nIt's junk posting. Do you intepret it differently?</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't have a read on him right now, but people post that they don't have reads on anyone all the time, so I'm wondering why you're pointing it out as junk posting.  And it basically goes to the problem that I'm having with your posting overall.  You don't seem to actually be seeking anyone's alignment, but you do seem to be trying to point out what is scummy or can be construed as scummy but really isn't indicative of scum.  It's shallow and it's not actually scumhunting but trying to make others look like scum, which is far more indicative of you being scum.", "time": "Thu Jul 11, 2013 5:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

Obviously, if you don't think I'm town, then that breaks down. Also, I myself am by no means sold on purple being scum, so... yeah. Early on when i voted purple, it was almost entirely to apply pressure, as I've said. <br>\n<br>\nI doubt you can find meta of me ever proposing a voting bloc because I can't remember myself ever doing it, but I'm sure you can find meta of me strongly townreading people as both alignments easily.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>PL wrote:</cite>Reasons?

You voted solely because your fellow bloc member did AND you distanced yourself from the vote by putting all the responsibility on Tammy. The implication of your 196 was that you wouldn't have voted RedCoyote if Tammy hadn't. So how was your vote supposed to help pressure RedCoyote? <br>\n-Why not try to convince Tammy to vote PURPLE LOBSTA, who I assume was/is still your top suspect at the time?     <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>The Fonz wrote:</cite>ITT When presented with a simple and obvious explanation or the opportunity to produce a nonsensical conspiracu theory to paint me as scum, PL chooses the latter.</div></blockquote>\nDoes that mean you're more suspicious of them?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mirari wrote:</cite>I'm not sure how I feel about Implosion now that he coherently explained his vote after Fonz.

Firstly, it is odd that you 'feel better' about implosion because of his new vote, because he was simply following Tammy and you have completely ignored the person that he voted despite implying suspicion of that player. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, I'm not sure Fonz is town, but your justification is really weak considering you want a wagon on him. It's been brought to your attention that there was no obvious/easy way to discern whether or not PL is a hydra yet you are ignoring that. Why are you ignoring that? Do you think it's a lie?

He intends to go look at meta and 'work out the most fake scumhunts' despite expressing very little interest in the game. I get the impression that his entire post was not genuine. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nF-16, I have trouble believing you thought it was possible for Tammy and Slumber to both be mafia.

I think I disagree with/don't understand pretty much everything you said in your exchange with implosion. I get the impression you are not reading the thread very carefully, you are not articulating your thoughts very well, I think you are being stubborn, and it is frustrating (or at least the head arguing with implosion was). Please explain; <br>\n1) How was asking for meta from Tammy supposed to generate reactions? You were asked this question already but seemed to avoid answering. Until you can explain how Tammy's response could be telling, I'm calling BS on this. <br>\n2) It seems pretty obvious that Fonz is referring to your vote on yabbaguy. It bothers me that you still believe otherwise (179). Please, tell me. What is the motivation for Fonzscum to call your obvRVS vote a serious vote?<br>\n3) I find it strange that you went from calling three people 'so obviously scum it isn't funny' to voting someone, not among the three, fifty posts later.

It was the first thing I noted from you.  My bad for not remembering precisely who it was who'd made contentless posts right at the start of the first page when reading the second, I guess.  Unsurprisingly, I pay more attention to things that I think are of scumhunting relevance than those that aren't.  This should be obvious on the grounds that the point makes sense if taken as referring to the Yabba vote, and does not make sense if taken as referring to the Slumber Party vote.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want to know why I mentioned the early posts in the second paragraph, it was because while writing the second paragraph, I opened your ISO up to see if you'd been using 'I' or 'we' in order to work out if you were a hydra.  I wasn't thinking about the precise wording of the first point when writing the second  and I don't preview edit.  Maybe I should as a matter of style, but it's hardly an alignment indicator to not preview.<br>\n<br>\nIt's either complete illiteracy or a lie to claim that I said Purple Lobsta 'came back to their vote.'  Here, for anyone who is at all unclear, is what I am actually alleging:<br>\n<br>\n1.  PL made a vote for yabbaguy that they claimed was serious.  They did not explain this vote.<br>\n<br>\n2.  They return TO THE THREAD in post #90, but don't mention yabba in that post.  Now, if I'm PL, voting for someone seriously, and my vote goes largely unnoticed, when I return to the thread, I do something to try to push the wagon.  Maybe I explain my vote to see if that convinces anyone else.  Maybe I ask Tammy, who seems to think yabba's posting is 'bad' if she'd be willing to join me on yabba.  Maybe a point out a criterion by which yabba looks scummier than other players people are voting for.  Maybe I just go 'More Yabba votes kthanxbai!'   Purple Lobsta only actually gives a reason for finding Yabba scummy after implosion specifically asks them to justify themselves.  This does not look, to me, like the behaviour of someone who is actually trying to get yabbaguy run up.  It looks to me like the behaviour of someone who is either a) trying to sneak a vote onto yabba while keeping options open b) distancing from yabba, or c) just wants to look like they're scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\n3.  That the 'meta please' comment is an attempt to 'look town' rather than because they have any particular meta information they're interested in with regard to Tammy.  Indeed, they pretty much concede that they weren't really going to look at Tammy's meta when they start blathering on about 'town mindset.'  They seem to be implying some kind of reaction test.  There's a few problems here.  One, as others have pointed out, linking to your games isn't any harder for scum than town.  Two, Tammy did react - she asked why they couldn't look themselves as well as telling them that American Revolution mafia was her last scum game.  How did they interpret this?  I don't have a clue, they haven't said anything about it.  They didn't say she was scummy for being obstructionist.  They didn't say she was townish for not really caring what they thought of her.  I don't believe they've answered F-16's similar query about what they were expecting to see from town/scum.  A reaction test where you have no idea how town and scum reactions would differ is just filler.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>the only serious vote that was placed was the vote on Yabba</div></blockquote>\n\nYes, so how the hell do you not put two and two together and realise that when I referred to 'The vote that you said was serious' I was FUCKING WELL TALKING ABOUT THE VOTE YOU SAID WAS SERIOUS?<br>\n<br>\n@Mirari: Is wickedestjr scummy for asking Purple Lobsta if they're a hydra?<br>\n<br>\nThoughts on other things happening in the game to follow shortly.", "time": "Sat Jul 13, 2013 12:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

To begin with, a minor point of anti-townness, it is never helpful to speculate out loud about the likelihood that someone else is a power role.<br>\nIt's not easy to understand exactly what you're saying, but I think it boils down to:<br>\nA) You think that suggesting you're faking having bad grammar etc is a bad reason to vote someone.  I agree.<br>\nB) He's attacking people for fluff posting but doing it himself.  That's not actually true.  <br>\nC) You say he's refusing to re-read, he's not talking about himself though.  Tammy was telling F-16 to re-read.  He's stating that 'Re-read my posts' is an unnecessarily dismissive and antagonistic thing to say.  Which is true (generally, if someone's read your posts and what you think is obvious isn't obvious to them, telling them to re-read isn't going to make it obvious) though not really of any scumhunting value (I don't think Tammy being dismissive is alignment-related).<br>\nD) You have no basis for asserting 'he looks like he's about to shift the attention.'  <br>\nE) I kind of agree that it's not realistic to expect players not to ask each other to justify their actions.  I don't think this is scummy though, he's just showing frustration at the way the game is being played.<br>\nF) You think it's scummy or hypocritical for him to claim to find it scummy that you are posting to say you have no reads.  I agree with him that you posting to say you have no read isn't valuable to the town and is just filler.  You seem to think that a mafia game is built on 'normal talking' then scumhunting at some arbitrary point when you have 'enough information.'  His point is that he believes there was enough information to start scumhunting, and yet you continued with 'normal talking.'  He's right and you're wrong.  However, the real question is not who's right, it's whether it's reasonable to think you scum for it.  I say no.<br>\nG) Your reaction to his post three is a Barnum statement (maybe one thing, or maybe the other).  It's of no value.<br>\nH) There are some grounds for accusing him of hypocrisy.  I don't really care though, I don't find this to be a reliable indicator of scum.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, you make some OK points, and some points that are baseless.  If you'd done this a page ago, I'd have considered it a town sign because although it's not great analysis, it shows town motive.  However, the timing is suspicious.  Just as a noticeable wagon is building on Red and other people are expressing suspicion, you choose to do a big analysis on him, and lo and behold this analysis happens to find him to be likely scum.

Delibrately trying to frustrate you. Mainly through, \"are you being serious?\" and \"read my posts\" over and over. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>And yes, the interaction between me and sbp was fun banter. I was having fun.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now for the incorrect meta knowledge of me? I don't think anyone has ever described my town play as being laid back.</div></blockquote>\n\nBut these two statements already start contradicting each other before you even begin talking. On the one hand, you say no one would describe your town meta as laid back, on the other, you say you start this game with fun banter toward SBP. I mean, we could split hairs and say \"having fun =/ laid back\", but in the greater context of whether you come into a game as cheerful, fun loving, and happy-go-lucky as opposed to \"high-strung, easily annoyed, and a bit of a bitch\", I consider those polar opposites. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>I was town in Ladies Night which was actually kind of an odd game for me. </div></blockquote>\n\nOf course the one game I have with you as town (and I consider Mod-player games count given the fact that I read the game thoroughly) is the outlier. <br>\n<br>\nThat aside, I didn't come into this game with detailed reports on each player's game history. I'm not the meta guy. If you say that I absolutely don't know what I am talking about to call you laid back, then I don't care to tell you I know more about you than you. My only town reference point is one game. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>I don't have a read on him right now, but people post that they don't have reads on anyone all the time, so I'm wondering why you're pointing it out as junk posting.</div></blockquote>\n\nHas anyone else gone out of their way to do it this game? Feel free to point it out if I have missed it. ZZZX's posts contain a lot of fluff that you are implying is acceptable. I do not find them acceptable.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>You don't seem to actually be seeking anyone's alignment, but you do seem to be trying to point out what is scummy or can be construed as scummy but really isn't indicative of scum. It's shallow and it's not actually scumhunting but trying to make others look like scum, which is far more indicative of you being scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't know what any of these means. These are just a lot of buzzwords. I'm not seeking anyone's alignment yet I am pointing out what is scummy and voting in kind? That's doublespeak, Tammy. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>implosion 209 wrote:</cite>It's been a loooong time since I remember a game that actually had a voting bloc, but early in the game the point of a voting bloc isn't to find scum, it's to have a cohesive unit of townies that townread each other that can cohesively apply pressure in one place after another until it settles into what it collectively believes is a good place.</div></blockquote>\n\nBut there is no cohesion thus far. I've seen little of this proposed voting bloc and more of \"implosion latching onto whomever seems the most popular townie atm\". Perhaps that's a little harsh, but it's looking more like an excuse for you to sheep than it is a solid triumvirate.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>panda 210 wrote:</cite>I don't want to do too much PbPA, I'm going to now go and get some meta<br>\nalso gonna try to work out the most fake scumhunts</div></blockquote>\n\nHeh, well, I'll hold you to this then, my friend. Because I'll bet dollars to donuts you're just saying that because meta has been the word of the game so far. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 212 wrote:</cite>What are your thoughts on the Purple Lobsta situation? Like what is your read on them? On Fonz/Implosion? And why have you not paid any attention to that discussion?</div></blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5116431#p5116431\" class=\"postlink\">I have (see the bottom)</a>. Those couple of sentences are probably the summation of my interest in it so far. None of those players (PL, Fonz, and especially implosion) have sold me enough to abandon my independent scumhunting in favor of following their lead. It may happen yet, but PL has shown enough righteous indignation to make me skeptical of him being scum despite liking Fonz's argument better. <br>\n<br>\nBesides, I'm having too much fun with you and ZZZX. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mirari 217 wrote:</cite>I do like his current vote which makes me feel better about him.</div></blockquote>\n\nReally? It doesn't bother you that neither of his bloc-mates have shown enthusiasm toward his proposal? Without consent, it's just \"me too\". <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked 230 wrote:</cite>I'm also not a fan of pandashnoo's post. He explains his town reads, but not his scum reads. He joins the RC bandwagon in an effort to 'possibly move us closer to lynching scum', making it clear that this is not a strong read. He intends to go look at meta and 'work out the most fake scumhunts' despite expressing very little interest in the game. I get the impression that his entire post was not genuine.</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm in the unfortunate position of being the recipient of these three votes (implosion, panda, ZZZX), so it's difficult for me to speak out against them with any real authority. That said, I agree very strongly with this. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DV 234 wrote:</cite>Sorting out my reads and explaining some of them later.

Additionally, people are more likely to give you a pass if you have a lot of posts, even if they don't understand what the hell you're trying to do. I very much think you're an alt that is making many of these mistakes purposefully. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ZZZX 237 wrote:</cite>I saw you swear to vote anyone who askes why to do something?</div></blockquote>\n\nThat was of course tongue-in-cheek.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ZZZX 237 wrote:</cite>that contained no scum hunting or contained some talk (which is contracting himself)</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is out of context. It's fine to participate in a game and make time for the occasional cutesyness, but it's not fine to go through the game with posts like, \":) no reads yet!!! :&gt; been thinkan tho LOL <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> what is this game it is mafia lots of people! dont be in the gam but if u think it rite:? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> okay rdy to ply!! but r u?? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">\".<br>\n<br>\nThat's nothing. That's junk. I will call it out as junk.

I was under the impression that this was some alt given how peculiar all of his mistakes are. They didn't read to me like someone that is struggling with English (although with his last post, I definitely see how this could be so). <br>\n<br>\nZZZX, is that true?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ZZZX 254 wrote:</cite>Actually I voted him because my analysis ended up as showing him scum, I havent caught up with the game untill now infact</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd am I your only read?", "time": "Sat Jul 13, 2013 10:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

Though he is trying to assign a behavior to me that wasn't intended and couldn't even be interpreted that way.  This is an attempt to manipulate Falcon into going back to his earlier scum read on me by trying to paint something I did as scummy.  Part of the reason I kept telling him to read my posts was I wanted to see if he would realize that he was mistaken about me without me pointing it out.  At one point he said that both of his scum reads had omgused him and that made him feel like he was on the right track.  After that I told him to go back and read my posts.  Because I omgused everyone that night who voted me or cast suspicion on me.

My answer concerning me being annoyed and seeing if Falcon would see what I was referring to should have made you recognize that here.

On the one hand, you say no one would describe your town meta as laid back, on the other, you say you start this game with fun banter toward SBP. I mean, we could split hairs and say \"having fun =/ laid back\", but in the greater context of whether you come into a game as cheerful, fun loving, and happy-go-lucky as opposed to \"high-strung, easily annoyed, and a bit of a bitch\", I consider those polar opposites. </div></blockquote>\n\nWere you on drugs when you wrote this?  Or in your whole life have you lacked interaction with human beings?  You know what's funny every single description in that paragraph you just gave is an accurate depiction of my personality.  I am all those things.  You can consider that polar opposite all your want or contradictions, but the fact remains that it's part of my personality.  So, what you are basically doing is arguing about my personality, which I'm sorry but has nothing to do with my alignment.  I mean I even said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5117044#p5117044\">Post 204</a> which you did read but cut out that in the game that you are referring to me being town and laid back that I didn't really come under suspicion, which should put some things into context for you.  The only \"suspicion\" I did get in that game was when springlullaby, who was scum, called me out for whiteknighting and I'm pretty sure my response was that only scum have ever tried to cast suspicion on me for whiteknighting people before.  I even said in that post you are referring to that I tend to view silly suspicions on me in a condescending or dismissive way.  So, context, darlin.

I think that you are picking an easy target to look busy and like you are scumhunting, and pointing out that it was junk posting was just as much junk posting as any fluff.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>You don't seem to actually be seeking anyone's alignment, but you do seem to be trying to point out what is scummy or can be construed as scummy but really isn't indicative of scum.

These are just a lot of buzzwords. I'm not seeking anyone's alignment yet I am pointing out what is scummy and voting in kind? That's doublespeak, Tammy. </div></blockquote>\n\nOkay you know what you get to do now?  Point out the buzzword.  Point out any one.  Unless you're trying to say scumhunting is a buzzword nowadays.<br>\n<br>\nThere is no doublespeak anywhere and you've been playing mafia long enough to understand exactly what I mean.  Acting like you don't is just another reason why you are far far more likely scum than town.<br>\n<br>\nBut, in case you just are honestly baffled, let me explain it for you.  You are not scumhunting.  You are assigning things as scummy, but scummy does not always equal scum.  If it did, town wouldn't be mislynched as much as they are.  Scum love to hunt through the actions that can be construed as scummy, and might be anti-town in a sense, but that isn't indicative of scum.  Town hunt, or should if they want to win, below the surface for the motivations and the intent of the person to figure out who is the murdering bastards among them.<br>\n<br>\nHere I'll even make it personal for you.  Remember in Abarat, when you replied to Fate, who was an IC, that the two of you \"may\" be on the same team that game?  I seem to recall people jumping on that \"may\" for proof you were scum.  You weren't, you were town.  Scum could easily exploit that may and not look further below the surface to see your alignment, while town should have.<br>\n<br>\nSo, a typical practice for scum, is exactly what you're doing.  You're trying to twist my interaction with Falcon into something that it wasn't, so you can look busy and manipulate people.  You're pointing out \"junk posting\" and anti-town behavior but not looking to see if it actually comes from scum.  In short, you're being calculating instead of natural.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>implosion 209 wrote:</cite>It's been a loooong time since I remember a game that actually had a voting bloc, but early in the game the point of a voting bloc isn't to find scum, it's to have a cohesive unit of townies that townread each other that can cohesively apply pressure in one place after another until it settles into what it collectively believes is a good place.</div></blockquote>\n\nBut there is no cohesion thus far. I've seen little of this proposed voting bloc and more of \"implosion latching onto whomever seems the most popular townie atm\".

Here is the glorious topping on the red coyote scum cake.  Selective scum hunting at it's finest.  Those couple sentences in which he says that the argument is not catching his attention.  Let's take a little peek at what his complaints about me have been shall we?  In asking Falcon if he was serious and to reread my posts repeatedly I was being dismissive and baiting him and unnecessarily aggressive, and that's bad mkay.  That is pretty much one of the most interesting things to him.  He even applied wrong meta to me about it!  Now, let's take a look at the Lobster/Fonz argument, shall we?  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112931#p5112931\">Post 116</a> shows the lobster being dismissive to Implosion.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5113571#p5113571\">Post 137</a> has lobster telling fonz to go back and *gasp* reread their post because he's confused.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5114109#p5114109\">Post 155</a> has lobster calling the fonz illiterate and that his post didn't make any goddamn sense and then in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5115732#p5115732\">Post 167</a> suggests fonz is borderline retarded.<br>\n<br>\nSo, now if my interaction with Falcon on the first couple of pages is being interpretted as dismissive and needlessly overaggressive, why is this discussion with lobster and fonz not worthy enough of discussion.  And how is lobster showing enough righteous indignation any different from the indignation I showed falcon over him not realizing that I was celebrating getting a job and having fun in the first few pages of the game?<br>\n<br>\nThis my friends, is selective scum hunting.  He is not applying similar tests of behavior to people overall, but is picking and choosing.  I haven't decided what this means for lobster or even the fonz yet.  But the last time I caught someone on selective scumhunting like this they were scumhunting town but then dismissing that same thing when it applied to their partner.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ZZZX 237 wrote:</cite>he think I am faking typos and capitalization which... makes no sense. why would a scum or town do that?</div></blockquote>\n\nSo that you're difficult for others to read.

You making fun of the way he posts in the text type speak you did was uncalled for.  He hadn't shown any evidence for him posting that way, and it looks like you just trying to make someone look bad instead of try to figure them out.  What's worse is here you are responding to Fonz saying he's not a native speaker, and it didn't make you reconsider your ridiculing him for no reason whatsoever.

{"number": 307, "id": "5124901", "user": "F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "user_id": "20121", "content": "Upon a re-read, the first poster that came across as scummy to me was Wickedestjr. SlumberParty tells him to ask him why he (wickedest) is scum, and Wickedest agrees. When asked to guess, he provides 4 reasons as to why he could possibly be scummy, then says he gives up and asks Slumber to tell him. I get the tone that he is trying to appease Slumber by giving in to his demands. Slumber was clearly pushing him around and I felt Wicked was allowing himself to be pushed around too easily and not step on any toes. Wickedest&#8217;s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111096#p5111096\">63</a>, he asks me whether I thought it was possible for both Tammy and Slumber to be mafia. Of course it is possible &#8211; just like it is possible that any two players in the game could be on a team together. He didn&#8217;t ask if it was likely but whether it was possible at all. This implies that he doesn&#8217;t believe that it is possible (which he later confirms) that Tammy and Slumber could be scum together. However, until this point, I had seen nothing to make me rule out a Tammy/Slumber scumteam entirely. They were arguing with each other but scum are just as likely to argue with each other during RVS as any random pair of players. It isn&#8217;t a tell. <br>\n<br>\nYabbaguy&#8217;s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111753#p5111753\">92</a> reads scum primarily based on gut. It is the sort of thing I&#8217;ve done as scum before, thanking someone for buddying with me and voting them. I have trouble seeing a town motivation for this post. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112584#p5112584\">100</a>, he defends Slumber saying that he felt Slumber was acting anti-town but had good intentions. I am conflicted about this post because on the one hand, Yabba did attempt to scumhunt for deeper motivations, but on the other, he seems to have taken Slumber&#8217;s word for it that Slumber was working to achieve his stated intentions. Slight town because of this though. The rest of Yabba&#8217;s post showed his annoyance at being asked questions which I am leaning scum on because as others have pointed out, the intent behind the questions was fairly obvious.<br>\n<br>\nThe Fonz&#8217;s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112522#p5112522\">96</a> where he posts &#8220;/inb4omgeasylynch.&#8221; I find Fonz scummy precisely because he picked an easy target. The above remark implies that Fonz knows that Purple was likely to be an easy target. His first point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\">101</a> about Purple not coming back to a serious vote doesn&#8217;t show any scum motivation. His second point about asking for meta isn&#8217;t really scummy either. Another problem with this post is that he didn&#8217;t really wait a while to check whether Purple came up with any conclusions based on Tammy&#8217;s meta but merely attacked Purple for asking for meta. His post felt a bit too smooth to me. At first glance, it seems well-thought-out, but the more I think about it, the more it seems more like a bad post with good presentation. <br>\n<br>\nPurple couldn&#8217;t believe that they were being FOSsed and their response was quite townish. It wasn&#8217;t logically airtight and had plenty of holes which Fonz pushed upon. <br>\n<br>\nRedCoyote&#8217;s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112983#p5112983\">119</a>, why do you believe that Wickedest&#8217;s question was solid? In fact I found it rather useless &#8211; perhaps to dig into my thought process a little, but no better than any other question. Also, I don&#8217;t like RedCoyote&#8217;s push on ZZZX. He is pushing on an easy target, like The Fonz with Purple Lobster. His reasoning of typos, goofy capitalizations etc speaks more to the personality of the player rather than their affiliation. <br>\n<br>\nI agree with most of Pandashnoo&#8217;s reads. However, he didn&#8217;t provide any original thoughts. He townreads Purple for &#8220;frustration&#8221; which is pretty much the exact same thing I said 4 posts earlier.<br>\n<br>\nMirari hasn&#8217;t posted much content. I agree with him that Fonz is likely scum and I think Mirari is likely town (their interaction isn&#8217;t scum-scum). Wickedest&#8217;s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5109188#p5109188\">230 </a>where he votes Mirari is bad. He starts off with questions to implosion which are decent. Wickedest, what do you believe is Mirari&#8217;s motivation for pushing Fonz? <br>\n<br>\nFrom most town to most scum, I&#8217;d say: Implosion, Tammy, Purple, Mirari/RedCoyote/Pandashnoo, DeasVail, Yabba/Slumber, Wickedest/Fonz.

Scum often try to be town when they're being suspected, and I haven't seen anything that I wouldn't expect from scum doing so.<br>\n<br>\nPurple Lobsta, what is wrong with someone using reasons presented by someone else to suspect a player? Nothing. If someone suspects a player for X reason, and you think X reason is a good one, then you may just suspect the player for the same reason, no? Only scum would go out of their way to be original, and accusing someone of not being original is not much better in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nI understand what you mean about the pacifying, but I've read someone as scum before, while also asking them to cool down as they might have been (and were actually) town.

People don't necessarily act the same every game; we aren't robots. Emotions, different players, different roles, the passage of time... all of this affects the all-powerful \"meta\" school of scumhunting.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>panda 279 wrote:</cite>Re: RC scum read I do think you're playing differently to some town games I've read you in and more like the scum micro I've read you in so I'm going to stick with these two reads definitely.</div></blockquote>\n\nWell, I wouldn't interpret it that way (another potential problem with relying too heavily on meta). I try very much (as I would suspect most people do) to play the same regardless of my alignment. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>panda 284 wrote:</cite>I've chosen Tammy and RC so far to shout about because I feel like they're pretty strong voices in the game and I want to know where I stand with them before going along with something they say because they're going to be influential (to me at least).</div></blockquote>\n\nAs I've said earlier, I tend to echo what yabba's saying here. I don't think you're as keen on going back through meta as much as you are using that word to try and sneak a vote in on a leading wagon. Now, should you prove me wrong, I'll certainly take that into account. As it stands, I think you're skirting by with very little independent contributions and without taking any real controversial positions.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>There is no attempt here whatsoever to try to ascertain my alignment. Though he is trying to assign a behavior to me that wasn't intended and couldn't even be interpreted that way.</div></blockquote>\n\nIt was interpreted that way (by me), so it could have been. As I've already stated, I'm given a negative perception by your badgering. I don't see it so much as trying to get a read on F-16 as I do see it as you getting your panties in a wad over something as relatively mundane as \"what are you and SBP talking about?\"<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>This is an attempt to manipulate Falcon into going back to his earlier scum read on me by trying to paint something I did as scummy.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's awfully presumptive of you. The man asked me a question. I didn't voluntarily ask him to take another look at you. I gave my honest opinion about the interactions between you two and he wanted clarification. To label that as manipulative is incorrect.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>But it didn't, and if you were town, I really think you'd be trying to figure me out.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd what do you call this then? I'm not picking a fight with you for my health. I think you're being surprisingly emotional for a townie (which you challenge, perhaps fairly, so I'm not going to overstep) based on my experiences. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite> You know what's funny every single description in that paragraph you just gave is an accurate depiction of my personality. I am all those things. You can consider that polar opposite all your want or contradictions, but the fact remains that it's part of my personality. So, what you are basically doing is arguing about my personality, which I'm sorry but has nothing to do with my alignment. </div></blockquote>\n\nI don't know how you can say with a straight face that \"cheerful\" and \"bitchy\" are synonyms, but we'll leave the lexicological debate for another day. <br>\n<br>\nOkay, so you're everything at once. There's no way to describe you because you are a human being with emotions that as whimsical as a leaf blowing in the wind. That's a perfectly sound philosophical viewpoint that I can comprehend. <br>\n<br>\nBut if that's the case, then you can't sit here and say that any attitude you have makes you necessarily townie or scummy. It certainly limits someone's scumhunting a great deal to boot. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>When you say \"of course the one game I have with you as town is the outlier\". What do you mean by that?</div></blockquote>\n\nThat our previous interactions happen to not count is ironic given that it was a reason for which I called you out. But that's the problem with meta. Sometimes it's valid and sometimes it isn't.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>I think that you are picking an easy target to look busy and like you are scumhunting, and pointing out that it was junk posting was just as much junk posting as any fluff.</div></blockquote>\n\nCertainly not, and this is a poor argument that I will gladly shoot down anytime it's made. It's made too often anyways. Just because a player is, speaking in a general sense, weaker, doesn't necessarily make them more or less likely to be scum. That's a fallacy. I wasn't voting ZZZX because he was weaker, I was voting him because he did something that I thought was scummy. It doesn't matter if his name is ZZZX or The Fonz or Tammy or mith, if someone makes a post like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111769#p5111769\" class=\"postlink\">post 93</a>, I will call them out for it. <br>\n<br>\nAnd, yes, you are implying that that is an acceptable post when you criticize me for suspecting it. You say my motivations are tainted, but it didn't matter that it was ZZZX made that specific post. It's bad. It's universally bad. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>Point out the buzzword. Point out any one. Unless you're trying to say scumhunting is a buzzword nowadays.</div></blockquote>\n\n\"Scumhunting without seeking alignment\"? What do you mean? That's just noise. These whole paragraphs are a bunch of wafty academic concepts of someone that's technically scummy, not scum, but scumhunting as a construct of pointing out the scuminess. At a certain point, you have to take a step back and say, whoa, maybe I'm getting a little too deep in all this. Sometimes there's just scummy and not scummy. <br>\n<br>\nMy theory? One player sees something a scummy and they say something. The other player responds and the game moves forward. Simple. There's no motivations within motivations here. These are just a lot of words. <br>\n<br>\nAs for your example, I understand your point. Sometimes townies do things that seem scummy. Fine. Then that's up to the townie to work to erase that image with defense and further contributions. ZZZX, I think, did this in my eyes for right now. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>You're pointing out \"junk posting\" and anti-town behavior but not looking to see if it actually comes from scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's what votes are for. That's what dialogue is for. No, unfortunately my votes will not always be on scum when I am town. But neither will yours.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>What does that say about implosion's alignment?</div></blockquote>\n\nThe fact that he's satisfied with his voting bloc despite no positive or negative or neutral or any bankable response from the supposed participants? I'd say that scummy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>Why when given an opportunity to interact with someone do you immediately try to make them look bad?</div></blockquote>\n\n\"Given the opportunity to interact with someone\" What do you mean? I can interact with any player at any time. This is a leading question, by the way, Tammy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>And how is lobster showing enough righteous indignation any different from the indignation I showed falcon over him not realizing that I was celebrating getting a job and having fun in the first few pages of the game?</div></blockquote>\n\nYou ought to have known better. I've never played with PL, and from the looks of it, they're relatively new players. It's expected for them to get overly emotional. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>it didn't make you reconsider your ridiculing him for no reason whatsoever.</div></blockquote>\n\nLol, if that's the worst ridiculing he gets on this site, then I think he just might survive. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>F-16 307 wrote:</cite>However, until this point, I had seen nothing to make me rule out a Tammy/Slumber scumteam entirely. They were arguing with each other but scum are just as likely to argue with each other during RVS as any random pair of players. It isn&#8217;t a tell.</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't think so. Let me preface by saying I don't necessarily consider Tammy or SBP as impossible partners, but I do think it's less likely.<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, I certainly don't think it's worthy of giving Wicked scumpoints. Your first point (getting pushed around by SBP) is a fair one though.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>F-16 307 wrote:</cite>I find Fonz scummy precisely because he picked an easy target. The above remark implies that Fonz knows that Purple was likely to be an easy target.</div></blockquote>\n\nAs I said to Tammy, this is a poor argument. It's poor when she does it, poor when you do it, and poor when Fonz does it. I, for one, will suspect who I want, when I want, with little to no regard for how \"easy\" they are. I've seen people that joined the site within a week be stronger than some that have been here for years. I've seen players that post very little wield more power than those that post walls. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>F-16 307 wrote:</cite>RedCoyote&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5112983#p5112983\" class=\"postlink\">119</a>, why do you believe that Wickedest&#8217;s question was solid?</div></blockquote>\n\nI hadn't considered it, and it opened up a new way to percieve your argument entirely. Because both parties were doing similar things, the case could be made that you were going after both. I think it wasn't until this question that your really focused your arguments.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DV 310 wrote:</cite>Scum often try to be town when they're being suspected</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't agree with this in the general sense. I mean, scum always \"try to be town\". This is really kind of pointless. I get what mean, that they're more inclined to blend in, but I think that's dependent on the player.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DV 310 wrote:</cite>As scum, he would suspect that this difference from everyone else would be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because</div> of his difference in alignment, and therefore I think he would not reveal it.</div></blockquote>\n\nI strongly disagree. I can kind of see where you're coming from, but I don't think it applies to ZZZX. ZZZX strikes me as flying by the seat of his pants. You're overthinking post 93. It's a bad post. It's not a bad post that's seceretly revealing as good. It's just bad. It's simple, he doesn't want to say he has any reads because he doesn't want to catch any flak by voting anyone. Once I call him out, then he feels justified in voting me (since I'm already doing it) and thinks people will sympathize.<br>\n<br>\nPlease keep in mind that I definitely don't have a townread on ZZZX, I only think he isn't as bad as I previously thought. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>panda 311 wrote:</cite>I'm on here for a minute, just wanted to clarify I'm female and so would prefer the pronoun 'she', thanks.</div></blockquote>\n\nJust FYI, you can specify this in your control panel, if you want. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nLet's line everyone up, because I think we've got a lot of input so far from most people: <br>\n<br>\n[<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town</div>]--------Wicked--yabba--Fonz-F16-PL-SBP[<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&#8729;</div>]-Mirai---Tammy---ZZZX-DV-implosion--panda----[<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum</div>]<br>\n<br>\nEveryone's still bunched up around the middle because it's early yet.

Fate busses chesskid. Implosion adds his vote to bus after it becomes obvious that the lynch will go through. Townreads fate and a townie as town vs town. Continues bus after the lynch was already pretty much set in stone. Repeated apologies for inactivity along with excuses. Promises content later and delivers as promised. <br>\nNext day, agrees with the case on a generally accepted lynch which his buddies are pushing, cites a townie&#8217;s reasons for agreeing. Generally gives extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote. Information about the accelerated lynch. Repeats a townie&#8217;s (AV&#8217;s) analysis about Gandalf having up to 6 votes being bad for town. There is a lot of being on the fence such as &#8220;I'm going to get suspicious, but for now gandalf is probably town. He reads town anyway. It could also be a scum ability that gains from hammering, but I think it's more likely town.&#8221; Then votes a player for not taking solid stances. Interesting irony. Deflects suspicion from his buddy by saying that he already explained the reasoning for not voting a player. Pushes for one specific player (bv310) being the best lynch and says to &#8220;screw nightkill speculation.&#8221; Close mindedness as scum. Responds to the same suspicion from a townie by saying that he had already explained twice that he thought the person he didn&#8217;t vote for was hammered. Slight frustration, asks the same townie to explain a read. Inactivity could possibly be genuine since school started. Fake-claims something unbelievably powerful and elaborate. Buddies bus him. Disliked the bus, made a note of it in wiki. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be his favored strategy. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">S2) Frogs Mafia 2</div></div><br>\nModerately active, 48 posts out of 1131. Starts out with apologies and excuses for inactivity although that could be due to school. In post 101, votes meransial for lack of logic. Tries to get on the same page as scumread &#8220;I get that&#8230; but (etc.)&#8221; Dismantles stupid logic from the VI townie. When townie says changing vote too often, implosion says &#8220;the only way I can think of being risky is mafia who want to avoid looking scummy.&#8221; Interesting to note that he supplies scum-sided motivations for a townie&#8217;s statement and presents it as the &#8220;only way.&#8221; Questions the townie on why they think something is code. If they don&#8217;t and speculating, why bring it up at all? Covering all his bases. This continues further while he asks questions like &#8220;if so, why? If not, why not?&#8221; Says another townie would make sense as a pair but wishes to stay away from pair speculation. In the same post, nitpicks his scumbuddy Amrun&#8217;s statements. Nitpicks a townie on another townie&#8217;s question. Says that the question was whether they were townie or scummy, not whether they were new or fluffposting. When questioned about his case, clearly explains why being strange is not scummy but being illogical is. Overall, implosion is very nitpicky as scum, agrees with generally established norms, and refers to his previous explanations &#8220;I already said&#8230;&#8221; a lot possibly out of frustration at being ignored. Can&#8217;t see a reason for frustration when pushing town lynches as opposed to defense. Could be a null-tell. Verify with town games. Furthermore, implosion seems to be remarkably good at deconstructing the logic of VI&#8217;s and painting them as scummy. He clearly has the upper hand since he used superior logic and a more experienced viewpoint. Heavily nitpicks very specific points to the point where he earned townreads from other players. Calls out potential scum-pairs which he had a problem with as town when done excessively. In post 154, he picks out things that are odd and not necessarily scumtells going so far as to just call them odd and leaving them at that. Continues asking townies why his supposed scumread is town. This contrasts with his behavior here where he jumps off the wagon off of his own accord. Asks a player why they are not attacking another player. Also asks players to make a case pushing town on town fights. Switches vote to Mozamis upon seeing pressure wane on his previous target and mount on Mozamis. Attacks people for pointless BS reasons, especially for disagreeing with him. <br>\n<br>\nDay 2, continues to point out what is &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; as opposed to what is scummy. Also, points out &#8220;odd&#8221; things instead of actual scumtells.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3, posts a long ISO on his buddy Amrun and two other townies. Anything that he agrees with is immediately branded town &#8211; especially his buddy Amrun also having the same reads as him at specific points in time.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">T1) Nexusville Mafia</div></div><br>\nModerately active, 51 out of 933 posts. At the beginning, implosion was more defensive than aggressive saying that it was not his playstyle to be a leader. Then attacks Mongoose for the classic, vote a townie, FOS a scumbuddy move. This makes sense as he has done this before as scum in Frogs Mafia. Asks Womc to provide a completed game where he set traps before as town. Then puts out a list of reads town (5), leaning town (1), neutral (2), leaning scum (1), scum (3). Womc isn&#8217;t on the list although two others including Mongoose are. He then asks for discussion. Response to suspicion: Iceninja in 82 makes a post FOSing implosion. FOSses someone for being overly cautious, says he has no idea why he has a certain player in his scum list. Seems to be a little more careless and prone to making mistakes as town as opposed to scum where he covers all his bases. Calls out a player for using Ate and claiming and defends his stance on the list of reads. Excuses for activity level and slight frustration at having already explained stuff. Both seem to be nulltells and based on personality rather than affiliation. The biggest difference here is that he doesn&#8217;t push an &#8220;easy&#8221; read and instead attacks the wagon saying that there is likely scum on the wagon. Contrast with pushing players based on their bad logic when he is scum. Implosion as town tries to see the greater picture as opposed to push nitpicky logic-based arguments. Interesting how quickly he changed his mind because said easy target as at the bottom of his scumlist (most scummy). He admits in this game in post 164 that he would push very hard on him if he were scum because he appears unlikely to defend himself well. He goes mostly on gut and and makes statements that transcend basic logic. For example, he says that despite the votes on the VI being justified, the people voting the VI are still scummy. There is a greater thought process going on and not just logic 101. Post 167 is a good deconstruction of his logic. <br>\n<br>\nImplosion FOSses a player for having not much content of their own (Salivor). Eventually starts to suspect Ice for unreasonably pushing on the same point many times. Implosion in 465 further says that a player isn&#8217;t scummy based on not giving &#8220;scummy vibes&#8221; despite being strange. Another point of note is that implosion doesn&#8217;t really question his scumreads much in this game and keeps arguments with them to a bare minimum. Clearly doesn&#8217;t mind voting for the information lynch because his read is so fluctuating. <br>\n<br>\nDay 3, admits that Ice flipping cop screws up his reads on the game. He has a couple of townreads but not solid scumreads. Posts a huge long vote count analysis and gives several permutations and combinations for who could be scum. Behavior becomes obv-town at this point. <br>\n<br>\nDay 4, the final day before scum win, he says that the stranger a claim is, the more likely it is to be true. In general, shows an acceptance of strange things. Also, townreads a townie who he heavily FOSsed for voting someone that everyone else read town. Couldn&#8217;t see the point of mafia in such a great position doing that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">T2)Open 480 C9++</div></div><br>\nArgues with another player.

While he did 3/8, I still had a confident town-read just based on the other games I've read.<br>\n1)\tNitpicking on logic (Nitpicked a little with Purple but it was mostly just explaining reality to them. Soon calls them a biased townie and votes for some other player).<br>\n2)\tCalling players scum for agreeing/disagreeing with him as opposed to looking for motivations (doesn&#8217;t have a townread on the Fonz despite agreeing with him).<br>\n3)\tGoing after easy targets (does go after purple but actually stops going after them). <br>\n4)\tGiving extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote unprompted. (He did with Fonz&#8217;s vote but only when he was challenged). <br>\n5)\tGetting on the same page as target (this happens with Purple and undermines my townread).  <br>\n6)\tCovering all his bases. (Check)<br>\n7)\tPredicting all possible reasons (does so with purple which undermines my townread). <br>\n8)\tCalling out scumpairs (no occurrence of this so far).<br>\nImplosion goes after Purple in this post, says that his post was intended to look scummy. Logically argues with Purple. However, he unvotes on Purple and switches to Coyote saying that Purple has confirmation bias. He also barely provides any reasoning for switching to RedCoyote and blatantly bandwagons with Tammy. Has been highly active &#8211; in fact, one of the most active players in the game. While he had provided excuses for inactivity as both affiliations before, activity by itself is pro-town and warrants a townread for most players of average skill. <br>\nOn the other hand, he tells me to bandwagon, votes along with Yabba despite scumreading him, and forgets Yabba later on. However, voting along with Yabba can be explained by a belief that if Purple was scum, Yabba would bus. Town games suggest that Implosion holds such beliefs.</div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Jul 15, 2013 8:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

Implosion in 465 further says that a player isn&#8217;t scummy based on not giving &#8220;scummy vibes&#8221; despite being strange. Another point of note is that implosion doesn&#8217;t really question his scumreads much in this game and keeps arguments with them to a bare minimum. Clearly doesn&#8217;t mind voting for the information lynch because his read is so fluctuating. <br>\n<br>\nDay 3, admits that Ice flipping cop screws up his reads on the game. He has a couple of townreads but not solid scumreads. Posts a huge long vote count analysis and gives several permutations and combinations for who could be scum. Behavior becomes obv-town at this point. <br>\n<br>\nDay 4, the final day before scum win, he says that the stranger a claim is, the more likely it is to be true. In general, shows an acceptance of strange things. Also, townreads a townie who he heavily FOSsed for voting someone that everyone else read town. Couldn&#8217;t see the point of mafia in such a great position doing that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">T2)Open 480 C9++</div></div><br>\nArgues with another player. I haven't read this in much detail but this is the one implosion provides himself as self-meta.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Current: Swagtown</div></div><br>\n<br>\nHere are potential things I looked out for and whether he did or didn't do them. While he did 3/8, I still had a confident town-read just based on the other games I've read.<br>\n1)\tNitpicking on logic (Nitpicked a little with Purple but it was mostly just explaining reality to them. Soon calls them a biased townie and votes for some other player).<br>\n2)\tCalling players scum for agreeing/disagreeing with him as opposed to looking for motivations (doesn&#8217;t have a townread on the Fonz despite agreeing with him).<br>\n3)\tGoing after easy targets (does go after purple but actually stops going after them). <br>\n4)\tGiving extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote unprompted. (He did with Fonz&#8217;s vote but only when he was challenged). <br>\n5)\tGetting on the same page as target (this happens with Purple and undermines my townread).  <br>\n6)\tCovering all his bases. (Check)<br>\n7)\tPredicting all possible reasons (does so with purple which undermines my townread). <br>\n8)\tCalling out scumpairs (no occurrence of this so far).<br>\nImplosion goes after Purple in this post, says that his post was intended to look scummy. Logically argues with Purple. However, he unvotes on Purple and switches to Coyote saying that Purple has confirmation bias. He also barely provides any reasoning for switching to RedCoyote and blatantly bandwagons with Tammy. Has been highly active &#8211; in fact, one of the most active players in the game. While he had provided excuses for inactivity as both affiliations before, activity by itself is pro-town and warrants a townread for most players of average skill. <br>\nOn the other hand, he tells me to bandwagon, votes along with Yabba despite scumreading him, and forgets Yabba later on. However, voting along with Yabba can be explained by a belief that if Purple was scum, Yabba would bus. Town games suggest that Implosion holds such beliefs.</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nOkay wow thanks.  A lot more in depth than I expected.

Post 392 was essentially me describing the straw that broke the camel's back. It's not shirking responsibility for the vote when you put it into the context of me justifying the vote in the previous vote; it's simply me explaining my thought process behind voting him, i.e. i've been reluctant to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but i am now scumreading them</div>. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm sorry, but by now you should have at least one tangible scumread that isn't like pulling teeth to arrive at.

It's fine to feel that way about my play, and I can frankly see where you're coming from.

I just do not see, and still don't, how someone can't read that I was like \"got a job! yay...been drinking and celebrating...omgus for stupid wiki tell\" and not recognize that I was celebrating getting a new job and having fun, but instead goes \"omigod so she's scum cuz she's celebrating and not being serious on page two.\"  I just don't.

In fact, people have made the very correct assessment that I get too emotional invested in games.

Fate busses chesskid. Implosion adds his vote to bus after it becomes obvious that the lynch will go through. Townreads fate and a townie as town vs town. Continues bus after the lynch was already pretty much set in stone. Repeated apologies for inactivity along with excuses. Promises content later and delivers as promised. <br>\nNext day, agrees with the case on a generally accepted lynch which his buddies are pushing, cites a townie&#8217;s reasons for agreeing. Generally gives extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote. Information about the accelerated lynch. Repeats a townie&#8217;s (AV&#8217;s) analysis about Gandalf having up to 6 votes being bad for town. There is a lot of being on the fence such as &#8220;I'm going to get suspicious, but for now gandalf is probably town. He reads town anyway. It could also be a scum ability that gains from hammering, but I think it's more likely town.&#8221; Then votes a player for not taking solid stances. Interesting irony. Deflects suspicion from his buddy by saying that he already explained the reasoning for not voting a player. Pushes for one specific player (bv310) being the best lynch and says to &#8220;screw nightkill speculation.&#8221; Close mindedness as scum. Responds to the same suspicion from a townie by saying that he had already explained twice that he thought the person he didn&#8217;t vote for was hammered. Slight frustration, asks the same townie to explain a read. Inactivity could possibly be genuine since school started. Fake-claims something unbelievably powerful and elaborate. Buddies bus him. Disliked the bus, made a note of it in wiki. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be his favored strategy. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">S2) Frogs Mafia 2</div></div><br>\nModerately active, 48 posts out of 1131. Starts out with apologies and excuses for inactivity although that could be due to school. In post 101, votes meransial for lack of logic. Tries to get on the same page as scumread &#8220;I get that&#8230; but (etc.)&#8221; Dismantles stupid logic from the VI townie. When townie says changing vote too often, implosion says &#8220;the only way I can think of being risky is mafia who want to avoid looking scummy.&#8221; Interesting to note that he supplies scum-sided motivations for a townie&#8217;s statement and presents it as the &#8220;only way.&#8221; Questions the townie on why they think something is code. If they don&#8217;t and speculating, why bring it up at all? Covering all his bases. This continues further while he asks questions like &#8220;if so, why? If not, why not?&#8221; Says another townie would make sense as a pair but wishes to stay away from pair speculation. In the same post, nitpicks his scumbuddy Amrun&#8217;s statements. Nitpicks a townie on another townie&#8217;s question. Says that the question was whether they were townie or scummy, not whether they were new or fluffposting. When questioned about his case, clearly explains why being strange is not scummy but being illogical is. Overall, implosion is very nitpicky as scum, agrees with generally established norms, and refers to his previous explanations &#8220;I already said&#8230;&#8221; a lot possibly out of frustration at being ignored. Can&#8217;t see a reason for frustration when pushing town lynches as opposed to defense. Could be a null-tell. Verify with town games. Furthermore, implosion seems to be remarkably good at deconstructing the logic of VI&#8217;s and painting them as scummy. He clearly has the upper hand since he used superior logic and a more experienced viewpoint. Heavily nitpicks very specific points to the point where he earned townreads from other players. Calls out potential scum-pairs which he had a problem with as town when done excessively. In post 154, he picks out things that are odd and not necessarily scumtells going so far as to just call them odd and leaving them at that. Continues asking townies why his supposed scumread is town. This contrasts with his behavior here where he jumps off the wagon off of his own accord. Asks a player why they are not attacking another player. Also asks players to make a case pushing town on town fights. Switches vote to Mozamis upon seeing pressure wane on his previous target and mount on Mozamis. Attacks people for pointless BS reasons, especially for disagreeing with him. <br>\n<br>\nDay 2, continues to point out what is &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; as opposed to what is scummy. Also, points out &#8220;odd&#8221; things instead of actual scumtells.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3, posts a long ISO on his buddy Amrun and two other townies. Anything that he agrees with is immediately branded town &#8211; especially his buddy Amrun also having the same reads as him at specific points in time.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">T1) Nexusville Mafia</div></div><br>\nModerately active, 51 out of 933 posts. At the beginning, implosion was more defensive than aggressive saying that it was not his playstyle to be a leader. Then attacks Mongoose for the classic, vote a townie, FOS a scumbuddy move. This makes sense as he has done this before as scum in Frogs Mafia. Asks Womc to provide a completed game where he set traps before as town. Then puts out a list of reads town (5), leaning town (1), neutral (2), leaning scum (1), scum (3). Womc isn&#8217;t on the list although two others including Mongoose are. He then asks for discussion. Response to suspicion: Iceninja in 82 makes a post FOSing implosion. FOSses someone for being overly cautious, says he has no idea why he has a certain player in his scum list. Seems to be a little more careless and prone to making mistakes as town as opposed to scum where he covers all his bases. Calls out a player for using Ate and claiming and defends his stance on the list of reads. Excuses for activity level and slight frustration at having already explained stuff. Both seem to be nulltells and based on personality rather than affiliation. The biggest difference here is that he doesn&#8217;t push an &#8220;easy&#8221; read and instead attacks the wagon saying that there is likely scum on the wagon. Contrast with pushing players based on their bad logic when he is scum. Implosion as town tries to see the greater picture as opposed to push nitpicky logic-based arguments. Interesting how quickly he changed his mind because said easy target as at the bottom of his scumlist (most scummy). He admits in this game in post 164 that he would push very hard on him if he were scum because he appears unlikely to defend himself well. He goes mostly on gut and and makes statements that transcend basic logic. For example, he says that despite the votes on the VI being justified, the people voting the VI are still scummy. There is a greater thought process going on and not just logic 101. Post 167 is a good deconstruction of his logic. <br>\n<br>\nImplosion FOSses a player for having not much content of their own (Salivor). Eventually starts to suspect Ice for unreasonably pushing on the same point many times. Implosion in 465 further says that a player isn&#8217;t scummy based on not giving &#8220;scummy vibes&#8221; despite being strange. Another point of note is that implosion doesn&#8217;t really question his scumreads much in this game and keeps arguments with them to a bare minimum. Clearly doesn&#8217;t mind voting for the information lynch because his read is so fluctuating. <br>\n<br>\nDay 3, admits that Ice flipping cop screws up his reads on the game. He has a couple of townreads but not solid scumreads. Posts a huge long vote count analysis and gives several permutations and combinations for who could be scum. Behavior becomes obv-town at this point. <br>\n<br>\nDay 4, the final day before scum win, he says that the stranger a claim is, the more likely it is to be true. In general, shows an acceptance of strange things. Also, townreads a townie who he heavily FOSsed for voting someone that everyone else read town. Couldn&#8217;t see the point of mafia in such a great position doing that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">T2)Open 480 C9++</div></div><br>\nArgues with another player.

While he did 3/8, I still had a confident town-read just based on the other games I've read.<br>\n1)\tNitpicking on logic (Nitpicked a little with Purple but it was mostly just explaining reality to them. Soon calls them a biased townie and votes for some other player).<br>\n2)\tCalling players scum for agreeing/disagreeing with him as opposed to looking for motivations (doesn&#8217;t have a townread on the Fonz despite agreeing with him).<br>\n3)\tGoing after easy targets (does go after purple but actually stops going after them). <br>\n4)\tGiving extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote unprompted. (He did with Fonz&#8217;s vote but only when he was challenged). <br>\n5)\tGetting on the same page as target (this happens with Purple and undermines my townread).  <br>\n6)\tCovering all his bases. (Check)<br>\n7)\tPredicting all possible reasons (does so with purple which undermines my townread). <br>\n8)\tCalling out scumpairs (no occurrence of this so far).<br>\nImplosion goes after Purple in this post, says that his post was intended to look scummy. Logically argues with Purple. However, he unvotes on Purple and switches to Coyote saying that Purple has confirmation bias. He also barely provides any reasoning for switching to RedCoyote and blatantly bandwagons with Tammy. Has been highly active &#8211; in fact, one of the most active players in the game. While he had provided excuses for inactivity as both affiliations before, activity by itself is pro-town and warrants a townread for most players of average skill. <br>\nOn the other hand, he tells me to bandwagon, votes along with Yabba despite scumreading him, and forgets Yabba later on. However, voting along with Yabba can be explained by a belief that if Purple was scum, Yabba would bus. Town games suggest that Implosion holds such beliefs.</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nYour games are some older games, and I think you would have been better served looking at some newer games.  I mean my knowledge of implosion's scum games are like a year old and a recent town game, so I'm not sure what I would suggest.  But I do think that your digging into the meta and going that detailed makes my town read on you stronger. I have some doubts that I think are kind of minor about you, and would involve you going back and reading empire's case and purposefully trying to change certain aspects of that, which I think is not very likely and probably not that important day one anyway.  But as Implosion said as town he tries to just look town, I think that certain things he would have done today he would have done differently as scum.", "time": "Wed Jul 17, 2013 6:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

I do that alot though, and I admit it's dumb and a weakness. I'll cool it down.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe depth of thought that implosion shows reads by digging into SPB's thought process reads as town. SPB is a null read for now. I didn't have time to check on MattP's meta, I'll do that sometime later. <br>\n<br>\n@ MattP, as a general suggestion, I recommend you not ignore people or be an ass. It is not going to be helpful. Reads change over the course of a game. If you think somebody is scum and be rude, what happens when you get a stronger scumread and want to convince your initial scumread to vote for your new, stronger scumread? Much better to be polite as far as possible. Rudeness wont get you anywhere.<br>\n<br>\nI am really conflicted on PurpleLobsta. I want to believe they are scum but if I look at it objectively, it makes no sense for them to antagonize the only person defending them - unless they think that MattP will come to their rescue if they lash out at the guy attacking him. However, they change their mind - again and read me as town which negates any benefit they would get by buddying with MattP. <br>\n<br>\nI find it hard to buy the \"reaction test.\" I don't believe that a player would ask another for meta to generate reactions because they got <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">no</div> reactions initially that they could use. I doubt they expected Fonz to pick up on that and FOS them hard for it.<br>\n<br>\nI felt that PL's posts looked genuine because their emotions felt very real to me. Even when I thought their logic didn't make sense, they gave off a town-vibe. I am not as sure anymore for a few reasons: first why would they be angry at me FOSsing MattP - they are not the ones that are involved. That makes me think they are faking their emotions. Also, I hadn't thought of this before: hydras have space to vent in their hydra PM so I'd expect them to be less emotional. I know for a fact that I rarely put in any emotions when playing as a hydra because the content has all been hashed out in the hydra PM already.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5129897#p5129897\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5129897#p5129897\" data-post-id=\"5129897\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 411</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21995\">PURPLE LOBSTA</a> wrote:</cite>\nTown read on F16 due to his reaction to Matt, though I don't explicitly agree with them.

I doubt scum would want to post additional info before replacing out. Less info = better for scum. Slight town-read on Zachrulez.<br>\n<br>\nRedCoyote's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5133084#p5133084\">428</a> is very well-thought out and I am more certain in a RedCoyote townread although I don't agree with his scum suspects. I did feel that Zach was summarizing popular opinions - but then he could just be agreeing with the popular opinions as town. Mirari's pre-replacement post was what struck me as townish. I am starting to doubt my implosion read based on this post. I am going to wait for more content to be posted before I figure it out.<br>\n<br>\nI am suspicious of Wickedest for still posting about stuff from the first few pages. I don't see the relevance. I think I made it fairly obvious that I don't believe Tammy to be scum and I find it suspicious that he keeps demanding justification for reads that I have changed as opposed to making me justify my current reads for instance - which would be a lot more productive. <br>\n<br>\nYabba hasn't done anything to make me think he might be town. Mostly, he has been very passive and useless but the little content that he did provide doesn't look townish either. For instance, my back and forth with MattP, Yabba might as well have shown up to snore. There was no real interaction with the content of any of our posts. And that was the biggest difference I saw between him and others who were online then - like implosion who actually went through the content and tried to gain affiliation depending information from it. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Slumber</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Yabbaguy</span>", "time": "Wed Jul 17, 2013 6:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

I feel like I should know though.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br>\n<br>\nI've been thinking quite a bit about RedCoyote and still can't commit one way or the other. The warm fuzzy feelings I feel from the idea of lynching him have lessened a fair bit though.<br>\n<br>\nPURPLE LOBSTA is the name that should be between everybody's vote tags right now though. Purple is a really nice colour and all, and the fusion of their eyes in combination with the shape of their head even makes me want to ignore the pincers and attack them with an over-enthusiastic cuddle. However, the pincers do exist and must not be ignored!!!<br>\n<br>\nI suspect that in Purple Lobsta's case, lying has been much like softclaiming and potato chips in that once they start, they just can't stop! There seems to be a complete lack of anything genuine in their posts.<br>\n<br>\nFirstly, we have the famous 'asking for Tammy's meta' in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111455#p5111455\">90</a>. This is slightly scummy and a decent appetizer, but for those wanting the main course, look at Purple Lobsta's next few posts, a couple of which (152 and 155) indicate that Zoid has been looking at the thread. Now, if he was really reaction testing Tammy, as is later claimed, why doesn't he just say so here? The cute lobsta should be feeling so clever that at the mere mention of the reaction test, his response would be something along the lines of 'Oh but it was a reaction test!!! HA!\" As much as it may not sound like it, I am being completely serious. Players tend to be eager to show off their reaction tests after ~the reaction~ and I don't see any reason why Zoid wouldn't explain it when it was mentioned. So, I think it was an excuse for it made up later.<br>\n<br>\nNext, going over my previous points, I still think that the argument about Fonz's scummy not meaning anything to them (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5116427#p5116427\">179</a>) because they don't know what it's for is fabricated. It's pretty likely from even a newbie's point of view that he's an established player, so I think they're just trying too hard to defend themselves to the point where they have to lie.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason for the read on F-16 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5128267#p5128267\">385</a> does not feel genuine and so I think it was decided beforehand. This is because there is nothing about the reason given that could indicate town more than scum.<br>\n<br>\nThere is other stuff too, but these are the main things that stick out as I read through Purple Lobsta's ISO and my own previous posts. So yeah, I'd love a Purple Lobsta lynch/wagon/whatever happens to be cool these days.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, my second choice right now would probably be Yabba.", "time": "Thu Jul 18, 2013 1:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

If anything though, dealing in logic and more reliable facts is pro-Town, and I'd rather get a jump on what I know will be my modus operandi going forward. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: implosion</div></div></blockquote>\n\nThis is a very long-winded way of saying 'lynch for information.'

It was made by a townie, and he inadvertently managed to pinpoint both scum in it; they were at the bottom of the list (smitster and maluski_cop). <br>\n<br>\nIn other words, \"we will get information out of X's lynch\" is just a bad way to think about things insofar as it doesn't lead to scum.

You straddle the line between having him as a scumread and qualifying the vote as possibly in response to the arguments you two have had. Again, this isn't the worst thing in the world.

If someone is comfortable, at this stage in the game, to say they only have one scumread in me or PL or they only suspect me and PL, then I consider that to be lackluster. Not good enough. Compare and contrast you with Tammy, for instance. Tammy has fought at F-16, suspected yabba, generally went through the rigmarole associated with scumhunting. That's why my vote is not on her.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI still would like to respond to a couple of Tammy's points, but I don't want this post to be too long and I want to focus on one more effort to get implosion as a leading wagon. <br>\n<br>\nFonz, your latest point is duly noted.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>F-16 460 wrote:</cite>RedCoyote, can you explain your townreads on Wickedest and Yabbaguy?</div></blockquote>\n\nKind of retracted that yabba read, but still wouldn't be interested in joining your wagon.

He wasn't overly hostile or overly agreeable. I know you weren't moved by him questioning your scumreads, but I was. Enough to point it out even. I loved his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5120191#p5120191\" class=\"postlink\">post 230</a> and it really solidified my townread on him.

I know for a fact that I rarely put in any emotions when playing as a hydra because the content has all been hashed out in the hydra PM already.</div></blockquote>\nI hardly ever logically make sense, zoid has a bit more I think but this game has been more me than him so far &gt;.&gt;<br>\n<br>\nand I wasn't angry at you for FOS'ing matt, I found you suspicious for FOS'ing matt. as far as emotions go, in this game I have been fairly calm as has Zoid I think.<br>\n<br>\nyes, we do talk about stuff in our hydra chat. If you think I'm being high strung, and if you think Zoid is being high strung then You aren't going to want to read our QT post game.<br>\n<br>\nalso, I am not you. I am not going to play like you.</div></blockquote>\n\nWhy would you find FOSing MattP suspicious? He has been the single most anti-town/useless player in this game. First, he spams the start of the game, then goes inactive. Then comes back and gives everyone attitude.<br>\n<br>\nI guess one way to look at it is to think \"why would scum act like a jerk?\" and then draw conclusions from it. The problem is, with a player like MattP, it all boils down to WIFOM. He may act like a jerk specifically because town might think the above and then read him as town. In cases like that, I feel it best to look for effects rather than motivation. If that player is doing something that is hurting the town, I will FOS them and attempt to lynch them. If they are helping the town, that's great. It wouldn't apply to all players but some. MattP, from what I gather makes it a point to be antagonistic on purpose. There is no reason to tolerate the behavior as something scum wouldn't do because he could do it precisely because we would think that. On the other hand, most times that you have antagonized players, I read you as town because it seemed like a spontaneous reaction that you couldn't help yourself with as opposed to something deliberate and planned. <br>\n<br>\nElaborate on what you mean by you are not going to play like me?<br>\n<br>\n____<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Fonz reads as town from his later posts.", "time": "Fri Jul 19, 2013 6:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

I agree with Red that it's an utter bullshit argument (that's the whole point of my /inb4easylynch comment: I get easy lynch arguments every.fucking.game as town for attacking bad players who also happen to show tons of scum motive, and it's moronic).   But that's not my argument with regard to Red himself.  There's all the difference in the world between attacking a new/annoying/bad at writing player because they're dropping scum tells, and attacking them solely because they're new etc.  You LITERALLY suggested that ZZZX was scum on the basis of his writing style.  A similar argument applies to wickedestjr.  He attacks Mirari for making a 'weak' argument.  Let's not consider whether it's a weak argument that scum would benefit from making or anything.  Oh no, he's clearly scum because he's bad at logic.  (Also some misrepresentation there: Mirari didn't say he changed his mind on implosion because implosion changed his vote.  He said he changed his mind because implosion gave a good explanation of his vote).<br>\n<br>\nI'll have to consider whether red or wickedest is worse if not PL.

Asking me to explain why you're scummy isn't going to convince you to vote for yourself, and it doesn't seem to me that anyone has been convinced by your defences, so I don't have to bother refuting them.  Then again, I'm bored and nothing else new has happened overnight.<br>\n<br>\nI do not like that instead of responding to my analysis of your behaviour around your yabba vote, you spent multiple pages making a ton of noise about how I was talking about your random SlumberParty vote, which clearly made no sense.  You also misrepresented me as saying you returned to your random stage vote, which I never said.  So for starters, I don't like that.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing I don't like is how, after admitting I was talking about the yabba vote, you then misrepresent THAT vote.  I actually said \"Don't care that it was unexplained at the time.\"  What bothers me is that when you next posted, it was your boondoggle Tammy meta post.  You didn't mention yabba.  You didn't say 'More Yabba votes!'  You didn't respond to wickedestjr voting Yabba.  You didn't tell anyone that yabba was scummier than their current vote.  And no, you didn't give a reason that anyone else could get behind.  You only explain when pressed on it by others, IE to defend, not to rally support for a Yabba wagon.  Oh sure, you kept him on a 'scumlist'.  Along with the players who'd attacked you, who were of much more concern to you.  Tammy's #184 is a good example of what it looks like when people are trying to get their suspects lynched.<br>\n<br>\nYou claim that your Tammy vote was some kind of reaction test.  Yet, as I note, you drew no inference from it in the thread until yesterday (RL).  After F16 and I had been asking you for days on end what you had learned, and you'd been throwing out these ideas like \"Well maybe it wasn't Tammy's reaction we were after.\"  This smacks of changing your story, because if that had been your reaction all along, why didn't you say that instead of obfuscating?  Who else's reaction did you find noteworthy?  Why, the one guy who voted for you, of course.  And lo and behold, you happened to think the reaction of 'voting for you' fell under 'scummy.'<br>\n<br>\nI do agree that Implosion calling you not a scum-read is weird given the strength of his push.  But then, he also lists you as the scummiest player in the game.  I'm filing that under 'odd' rather than scummy for now, though.

Way too much posting for a Cop, it's really poor strategy if in fact the claim ends up true. They've been so frequent and verbose in their posts that I had them on a Vanilla-or-Mafia read, because posting a lot tends to land you into the obvTown or obvscum categories way too quickly - which tends to lead to your death; bad news for a PR. <br>\n<br>\n2. They're acting weird ever since they've laid the claim down. They're trying to respond to these \"abNormal\" and \"uncreative\" accusations as if they should care - whereas if I were genuinely Cop having to claim, I'd say \"well, I'm Cop, so that's unfortunate because there's nothing more to it\". I'm a different person, but I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation.<br>\n<br>\nBUT!<br>\n<br>\nPURPLE LOBSTA could still be useful regardless of alignment. If they're scum, we're still gonna ask them for investigation results. Although Mafia could work on a \"one-behind\" principle and kill any Innocent results, we might still have some utility from using even a fake Cop to point out the less-than-obvious Townreads (or we lynch if we think they're sabotaging the duty at any point).

Take a look at the last ten completed mini normal games and you'll see that 90% of them did NOT have an ordinary cop. The anomaly was <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=27393\" class=\"postlink\">a game modded by Zoidberg himself</a> !! The cop role in general is much less inserted into games now than it used to be and Empire strikes me as a creative person.<br>\n<br>\n2) I'll echo yabba's point in 575. PURPLE pretty much demonstrated how not to play the role of cop. Active, stubborn, aggressive, unreasonable. <br>\n<br>\n3) Seems convenient, especially considering points 2 and 4. <br>\n<br>\n4) The slot is still very suspicious, the claim doesn't change that. <br>\n-The meta reaction test thing is still complete BS. I've been around for a while and I don't think I've ever seen someone get flak for asking for someone's meta. In my experience comments like that are insignificant and never discussed. I seriously doubt that PURPLE actually thought 'well maybe this will help us', considering they made the post in the midst of a long distracting Tammy/Falcon exchange (hmm Tammy and Falcon are getting in a serious argument right now but I think I'll throw in a meta request to get the game into serious mode). If it was a reaction test, then it was the worst reaction test in the history of reaction tests.<br>\n<br>\n-Their suspicion of Fonz for portraying their obvious random vote as a serious one is one that has not been well thought out. Why would any experienced player, as scum, deliberately exhibit such a blatant and easily refutable misrep? Hint: nobody would. Their half-day focus on Fonz's use of the word 'initial' was a waste of time and imo resembles fake scumhunting.   <br>\n<br>\n-Suspicion of yabba is just awkward. I'd have to reread to tell you exactly what their reasons are even though they've apparently been suspicious of yabba the entire game.

And RedCoyote actually had votes on him - and he doesn't seem to be a significant townread considering you preferred him as scum to PL at the time of this post.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5140674#p5140674\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5140674#p5140674\" data-post-id=\"5140674\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 553</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11436\">yabbaguy</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nMe bringing up panda's behavior was that I initially believed it was her <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">acting</div> and pretending to be Town.

I don't buy the 'overposting' argument AT ALL.  How much people post should have little relation to which (town) role they have.  Making a noticeable change to your posting rate as PR is obviously a bad idea.  The Lobsta's play has been very omgussy, and I've seen that kind of paranoia from town PRs who aren't particularly great players before - they get into this mindset where anyone who attacks them is scum trying to out them.<br>\n2.  That said, not a word of my case against them is retracted.<br>\n3.  I don't like the 9/10 argument.  Small sample sizes ftl (ten games is what, less than a month's worth of games?).  As Deas notes, if mods are getting 'creative' than any given role is going to be unlikely, plus there's only so many roles available to normal mods.  Or maybe Empire decided to zig where others zag.  That a role has been claimed is evidence that it is more likely to exist than your priors might suggest (Bayesian conspiracy ftw).  Though I also dislike the Lobsta trying to bring in 'why would we claim that' WIFOM.<br>\n4.  The value of a town cop is greater than that of a scumbag who now is forced to target players in keeping with his 'suspicions.'  Plus, we may have other ways to prove they're lying.<br>\n<br>\nI think I'm willing to give them one night.  If they come up with something really scumvenient, I'll hop back on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote, vote: wickedestjr</div>  He's my top suspect other than PL, I don't really want to lynch RC any more, and no-one else has &gt;1 vote.

And I vastly prefer a PL lynch.<br>\n<br>\nFonz: Yes, 10 may be a small sample size, but it also means that those games are the most recent, and therefore the most relevant; the issue is, if Empire as a moderator had the idea to \"zig where others zag\" I don't think the first thought would be to put in a cop. I think the first thought would be to do something else that's more interesting. I used to be of the opinion that it's universally better to wait on PR claims, but I've recently changed my view on that (see Maxous's lynch in HxHxMafia). At this point, I am much, much more confident that PL is scum than I am of anyone else in the game. I could be wrong, yes, but I really don't think I am. I just feel like them being scum explains the gamestate much better than them being town does. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, another thing comes to mind: PL (and I'm sure they know this if they're scum, as a pre-emptive response to 'stop giving scum advice, implosion') can just claim roleblocked if they are scum. Even if they're town, they damn well could just wind up roleblocked for the rest of the game.

There are no words to describe how exhausted I am after moving more than half my apartment halfway across the state to get ready for my cross country move in a couple weeks followed by a going away party and trek back home /whining.<br>\n<br>\nIf I wake up early enough in the morning, I will get to this before work, if not I definitely will when I get home from work tomorrow night.<br>\n<br>\nStill though please don't lynch until I have a chance to get caught up from the last couple days.  I doubt I'll get targetted for a kill, as there are better people to target and I never get targetted here night one, but still please don't lynch.  I'll be around and won't let the game go to no lynch, just don't get itchy please.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to ramble about some of my current thoughts until I can't stay awake any longer:<br>\n<br>\nI am having current doubts about red coyote being scum, but I keep feeling like I did in the wire when I was convinced that Jason was scum and pushed for it, but then the majority of the game decided he was town and I second guessed myself only to lurker lynch him on day five and have him flip scum.  He still doesn't feel right.  He's saying all the right things, but still doesn't feel right to me.  But if he is town, this is going to be empires message to me after the game...\"red coyote was obvtown day one FYI\".  I'm not going to keep pushing it today with all the pushback from people, but I swear to iomedae if he ever flips scum you better plug your ears because the \"I told you so\" will be heard around the world.<br>\n<br>\nMm - I have serious doubts about your claim that every game you've been in has had a cop.  Open 501 didn't nor did nightless.  I was going to look through your games to see how accurate your statement is, but exhaustion trumps that.  I did like you mentioning that ou normally don't care though, I was looking for something along those lines.  Oh yeah, you said that my post where I told zoid to look for himself rang townish because of lack of being compliant, but what do you make of me saying I would have responded that way even as scum?  Also, you just got done playing in a game with me where I was scum where I don't know that I would be classified as compliant.  (I know you qualified that as especially early game, but I'm still interested in your take)<br>\n<br>\nI still don't like RC's original jump on pl, but can't remember why.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't like the claim stalling but I don't know what to make of that.<br>\n<br>\nI need to read through wickets case on pl, but I'm more of the mind that you don't lynch a claimed power role day one if there's some reason to believe it, and I tend to be very suspect of claims at l-1 and the past few games I've been in/read mafia has fake claimed cop day one.  I feel like with as much as I talk to empire/hydra with him that I would have a better idea of what roles he would typically put in a game, but I don't.  And I'm not about to outguess the mod on what I think he might or might not put in the game as that has just ended badly almost every time I've seen someone do that.  <br>\n<br>\nOh yeah mm cops are not needed to win games, games can be won on day play alone.  I understand the points brought up about role locking and liens about it.  I've as a scum roleblocker blocked the tracker every single night until endgame.  Then as scum once I claimed to be roleblocked every single night and somehow was believed.  I don't know I'm kinda of the mind that this discussion should be tabled until tomorrow.  I'll read through wickets case and everyone else's thoughts tomorrow though and see if I can make sense of it with a working brain.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't know that Sottyrulez was v/la this weekend, but still his contribution is meh, and I am still concerned about a bus on rc if he is scum.  Zach said he would catch up and contribute Friday morning but never posted again.  Zach doesn't really like being scum and tends to lurk and be less engaged, and his replace into this game is far more reminiscent of his replace into castle zar where he was scum than it is yoloville where he was town.  Juries still out on that and I guess we'll see what he brings tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nHave a town read on implosion and falcon still.<br>\n<br>\nThink that fonz sounds good and reasonable for the most part.  I think he's town but worry he's scum.  I feel the same way about the party bois.<br>\n<br>\nYabba is suspicious.  Dgb said in a game once that she advised her partner to write out his posts and then rearrange the sentences so his posts wouldn't make sense, and that way people wouldn't read them and would leave him alone.  That's the vibe I get from some of his posts because I have no idea what he's trying to say.  I don't agree with him that people shouldn't give out their town reads unasked.  Some people just do it, and like implosion said scum are smart enough to know who the obvtownn are.<br>\n<br>\nI'm suspicious of deasvail but can't remember why.  I'll try to work that out tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nOkay I think that's all the things I was tossing around during my drive home today and I'm going to hopefully pass out now.", "time": "Sun Jul 21, 2013 2:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

For instance, my back and forth with MattP, Yabba might as well have shown up to snore. There was no real interaction with the content of any of our posts. And that was the biggest difference I saw between him and others who were online then - like implosion who actually went through the content and tried to gain affiliation depending information from it. </div></blockquote>\n\nNote that F-16 is likely Town, but he's tinting his lens by suggesting that I have to play the game the way he does. If I'm playing a bad game, so be it, and to be frank I am cross with myself for constantly running into brick walls with my votes to start this Day out. But that just means I'm guilty of a bad game.<br>\n<br>\nWhy I needed to weigh in on their conversation is beyond me, if F-16 finds it fascinating, congratulations, but I don't. It's a silly point.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>F-16, Post 549 wrote:</cite>Just look at Yabba's ISO starting from post 100 (ISO #5). It's full of scum. For instance 281, he votes pandashnoo for a completely null tell. There is absolutely no reason why town wouldn't say that they would meta-read someone. It is similar to saying \"I'll ISO this player and come to a decision.\" Yet Yabba makes it out to be scumtell. <br>\n<br>\nHis 370 by itself isn't terrible. When you compare it to 281, it is inconsistent. He tells me \"There are Town who will say \"voting me is obvscum, thanks\" and mean it in jest. I'm saying it's null for Matt to do that.\" However, he doesn't wonder whether Pandashnoo is town and is simply saying that she will meta players because she wants to do so.</div></blockquote>\n\nI've gone over this point already, explaining that I thought the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">way</div> that she was announcing her intentions sounded scummy to me. Again, weak read, but not null when I said it because I thought it was her pretending to scumhunt instead of actually scumhunting. There was a difference, there was no inconsistency, simple as that. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5142208#p5142208\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5142208#p5142208\" data-post-id=\"5142208\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 585</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20121\">F-16_Fighting_Falcon</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5123170#p5123170\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5123170#p5123170\" data-post-id=\"5123170\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 281</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11436\">yabbaguy</a> wrote:</cite>The more important objective for me is to get someone lynched where it's most informative one way or another. pandashnoo flipping scum would almost assuredly clear RedCoyote given the way they slinked onto the wagon:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I am therefore going to vote RC to move us possibly closer to lynching scum</div></blockquote>\n\nAlso might shed light on that implosion read which was weak for them and seems to be a controversial one for everyone, and anyone else who might hop on this bandwagon in case they're Town.

Suggesting an information lynch without really scumhunting. It is one thing to choose from among the leading wagons as to which will provide you the most information, but quite another to put your solitary vote on a player based on a \"dubious\" case hoping it will give you info about RedCoyote. <br>\n<br>\nMost of your posts are based on associative tells and information lynches - you never say with conviction that you think someone is scum.<br>\n<br>\nWouldn't lynching RedCoyote give you that same info?

I could vote there.  The only thing holding me back is moraris replace out post, but I think this slot has a really good chance to flip scum.  Regardless, on the off chance I don't make it through the night, look at zach's posting.  From what I understand sotty is good at scum, but zach tends to lurk.  If he's doing the majority of the posting and is engaged, they have a decent chance at being town, if not, they have a decent chance at being scum.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like that DV commented on me not remembering why I was suspicious of him and didn't actually engage with me about what I said about zach's replace in.  Dv was in both of the games I referenced, and was scum in both, and partnered with zach in one.  His feedback would have been nice.<br>\n<br>\nDV is suspicious to me mostly because he just feels staged.  Like his posts are designed to be \"look at how town I am!\"  Rather than be his town self.  He just seems too sure of himself.  I'm not the greatest reader of DV and usually have empire to bounce my thoughts off of regarding DV so I don't feel super confident in myself here, but I don't think he's town.<br>\n<br>\nI am suspicious of the lobster but I don't think they're a good lynch today.  I don't know how much of the issue is actual playstyle and how much is scum.  I think that they both are easy lynches in games I've read and tend to arouse suspicion.  Although Mara was decidedly more protown and easier to read as town in open 501 as pinksmoke, but as I was scum there that's harder for me to tell.  I do know I was able to twist some of what she said to make her look scummy pretty easily though.  I'm also stuck on the downgrading of the town read on me based on just being fooled by me.  I don't know what to think of them opposing the rc wagon as it would be their most  viable though.  I thnk that superficially looks townish, but ive been fooled by scum taking that tactic before so.  I don't know, they overall look pretty scummy and I won't cry if they're lynched, but I also don't think it would hurt us to wait a day.  But if we do lynch and they flip scum, don't discount sottyrulez as a partner bussing right now.<br>\n<br>\nI don't get RC's super town read on wicked or the reasoning, and I'm going to hate myself for saying it, but its part of my lingering suspicion of him.  (And I hate myself for saying that because of the flak I've taken over townreads sometimes as that's what I work more from.). I think wicked looks okay, but the reasoning rc gave for town reading him so strongly is on stuff that can easily be faked, so my tinfoil hat was he's picking an unpopular read to promote.  I think the thing that I felt best about was him actually looking at the last ten games, though I don't agree that just because they're not there they are likely to not be here.<br>\n<br>\nI like yabbas recent posting and don't necessarily buy the meta information from falcon about how he recently didn't defend from a day one lynch.  But I do find it interesting that yabba didn't respond or comment on that.  I'd have to see how yabba reacted in more than one game though to see if its a thing.<br>\n<br>\nI think that's about all I wanted to say.", "time": "Mon Jul 22, 2013 2:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

Commenting on both you and kanye forgetting why you suspect me is much easier and quicker. I don't really think this is a scumtell for me though. I think I'm pretty keen to engage and look pro-town when I am scum.<br>\n<br>\nThere's nothing I can say about the staged part except that I'm town, but I've been trying to improve my town play and be (or at least appear) more confident in recent games. I feel like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=27393\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1445</a> could be an example of this, as I was trying to do the same there with my scumread on Bacde, and you probably know that people have commented on my lack of confidence and meekness many times, so I hope it would make sense that I'd try to change this.<br>\nYou also know from YOLOville that I'm comfortable replicating the lack of confidence as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI don't appreciate people using my unvote of Lobsta against me because I think the stance I took is pretty reasonable.<br>\n<br>\nAnd for those of you who are just loving my self-analysis, I've got more!! <a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/50/H/ULwcM2WS5Wv\" class=\"postlink\">This</a> is the mafia QT to a marathon game (during the most recent period) where I bussed one of my buddies and they got really angry with me. I think anyone that knows me reasonably well would know that I probably wouldn't bus a buddy so hard here after that. (I was one of the few voting for PL for a while and up until their cop claim I've been consistently calling them scum). And I really think Purple Lobsta is likely to be scum, so if I am lynched please don't think they're town without good reason.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not really in a position to choose, who, if anyone gets to be the lynch instead of me, but I don't like RedCoyote's decision to pursue me after deciding that Purple Lobsta was likely enough scum (following wicked's argument) to risk lynching a town cop, which is a really powerful role. So *hint *hint I guess.<br>\n<br>\nOther stuff is that I don't trust the Bois at all, I feel that their (well kanye's) attitude to the game the last few days has been surprisingly lackluster and I also don't think Implosion is as town as I did, but they may still be a weak townread.", "time": "Mon Jul 22, 2013 10:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

I think a lot of their play is scummy but there are those tiny things I've mentioned that make me doubt, but not enough to try to save them.  I do worry about lynching the cop, but their play after the claim doesn't make me get over my natural suspicions of a fake cop claim.<br>\n<br>\nBasically I'm at the point in day one where a scum read I felt really good about (and still do a bit) either is town or isn't getting lynched and I don't really know what to do.<br>\n<br>\nI feel better about you after your reaction to getting run up, and feel better about yabba after his recent postings.  But if you, rc, and yabba are town, then I've gone wrong somewhere on people I've considered town or haven't paid much attention to and need to figure that out.  But that's just par for the day one course for me.  (I still don't feel good about rc though.)<br>\n<br>\nI do think that panda sounds like overwhelmed town, but its frustrating how little she does.  Zzzx does sound like newbtown but doesn't give enough to feel confident one way or the other, and is super frustrating how little input he gives on the larger wagons.<br>\n<br>\nI thought that if the people that I seem to have been wrong about on being suspicious aren't then maybe I was wrong about implosion being town.  I read through aia today, as falcons games for meta were rather old, and I replaced into that game so it's a meta I feel better about, and meh I don't know.  I guess I saw some reasoning to doubt myself on that versus some of the recent town games I've had with him but then he posted 728 and that sounds so genuine and just as frustrated as I feel and I'm back to feeling good about implosion.<br>\n<br>\nI read through empires meta case on falcon from dv's game, and unless he read that and made sure to really change some of his meta, I still think he's town.  He's probably the town read I feel best about.  His meta research on implosion just was so detailed, and not what I would expect from scum.  I mean I meat when I'm scum too sometimes to look town, but the level of detail in that suggests more of a town read than scum.  And he really had no reason to change his earlier implosion scum read to town based on his meta research is he was scum.  The only reason why I could see that if he were scum were if they were partners and he was trying to make it look like they weren't.  I don't believe this though, and think it would just have been easier for him to continue his implosion scum read especially when several people started calling him suspicious as well.<br>\n<br>\nI think what that leaves me with is fonz and the boiz.  They're both people that I want to think are town, but I have a nagging feeling in the back of my head that is eating at me.<br>\n<br>\nOh wait there's still sottyrulez.

I think the first thought would be to do something else that's more interesting. I used to be of the opinion that it's universally better to wait on PR claims, but I've recently changed my view on that (see Maxous's lynch in HxHxMafia). At this point, I am much, much more confident that PL is scum than I am of anyone else in the game. I could be wrong, yes, but I really don't think I am. I just feel like them being scum explains the gamestate much better than them being town does. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, another thing comes to mind: PL (and I'm sure they know this if they're scum, as a pre-emptive response to 'stop giving scum advice, implosion') can just claim roleblocked if they are scum. Even if they're town, they damn well could just wind up roleblocked for the rest of the game.

Can't it just be kanye's personality (read: that is, pretty much, kanye's personality)?</div></blockquote>\n\nErm, if you rebut a case on someone, you're defending them.  Why are you afraid of the label?  It's an accurate description of your actions.<br>\nAlso, evasiveness is obviously beneficial to scum (they are trying to hide their true thought process) and harmful to town (who should want their actions to be transparent, some edge cases involving PRs aside).  It might be explained away by meta, but it IS prima facie suspicious.  I'd also quite like to know why one member of a hydra being away is a good excuse for dissonance, when it seems like the opposite (if only one head is playing, it should function like a single player).<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I think the bois case is stronger than you're giving it credit for.  It's not scummy for them to assert their town-ness or to have some fluff, if it's in combination with some good scumhunting.  I can live with them being annoying, that's probably just playstyle.  But they've made pretty much zero impact on the game, they almost totally ignored the LOBSTA wagon.  Like, seriously.  Look for anything they say in relation to it.  They call you (Implosion) out for your tone in responding to Ms M saying she didn't want to claim, and push the DV counterwagon.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, the fake accusations.  It is possible ZZZX's entire mafia-playing career to this point was a setup so that we'd mistake him for a town derp in this game, but it's REALLY, REALLY fucking unlikely.  You know what looks much more fake?  ZZZX is not THAT hard to spell.  Three Zs and and X.  They've spelt it Zyxxy, Zoxyx, Zyzzy.  Despite getting it right the first time they mention him.  That looks like they're deliberately trying to create a 'don't give a shit' vibe around themselves in order to look like lazy town.  Also, their response to ZZZX's townslip reads like a scum who is afraid of too many players becoming obvtown because they'll run out of mislynches. <br>\n<br>\nSo... currently going after obvtown newbie with contrived 'faking' case, and pushed the counterwagon without being willing to directly defend PL.  Yeah, that's plenty for a wagon.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: SlumberPartyBois</div><br>\n<br>\nMy suspicion of Wicked has abated somewhat given the Lobsta scum flip.  Still don't like the 'list five players as scum with no analysis and no differentiation between the scumminess of those players,' but obviously once the 'nefarious plot to get rid of powerful town PR' explanation is disproved, then 'good-faith effort to work out how likely a cop is, but doing it wrong' is the most likely scenario by far in terms of his tortured statistics.<br>\n<br>\nPanda, like... if it weren't for other people suspecting her, I wouldn't remember she's in the game.  The only post I can really recall is the one when she got annoyed at being misgendered (which is fair enough, but shouldn't be the most memorable thing anyone's done).<br>\n<br>\nOn Sottyrulez... had Mirari as town, liked their last post (wish they'd quote less, though).  They became more active at the end of yesterday and early on today.  I think I'm going to file the earlier prod-dodging off as being busy.  Fits with Zach feelings the need to bring Sotty into the game.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't got a fucking clue with Yabba.  He just... feels dishonest.  But I seem to recall getting a similar vibe last time we played together (do you remember that, Yabba?  Came down to endgame, we voted each other, the other guy was the scum).", "time": "Sat Jul 27, 2013 3:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

Honestly, a lot of the reason I was kind of bleh about PL is because I don't like reading their posts. So many line breaks. They start a new paragraph with every sentence. The language, the way they structure their posts, and the AtEs all combine into making one big glob of mess. panda's post before night was awkward, almost like she rushed to get it in there. I would've felt much better about that slot had she not made that post. SBP holding on to the DV wagon isn't great, but he wasn't really around when it swung back to PL. Of the living people who weren't on that wagon, panda probably is the most conspicuous.<br>\n<br>\nWhere would the scum have gotten on? I'd say DV's hop was kind of resigned, but he was backed into a corner regardless of where he put his vote. yabba saw the way the game was going, so he may have made a play to get some credit since he kind of came out of nowhere.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>yabba 696 wrote:</cite>Actually, let's not lynch the claimed cop, despite that I still have some doubts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div></div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>sotty 643 wrote:</cite>Ah huh...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Vote: Purple Lobster.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe question for me isn't how likely is it that there's a cop in the setup, but rather how likely I think it is that Purple is scum.

Now, look, I know this is hypocritical of me to attack yabba on. yabba, you get to use that against me. I have no defense of jumping off PL when I did. I did so because I really, really dislike lynching claimed PRs on D1 and I was greatly torn about it. It's quite possible that yabba was thinking the same things, but I have reason to doubt him. He was seemingly pretty intent on getting PL lynched post-claim. He goes through Wicked's post and rebuts his points and gives PL the scum stamp of approval in the read list.<br>\n<br>\nWith sotty, I don't like the passivity. I haven't like it since they started playing, and their vote on PL is just lacking of character. That the claim doesn't have anything to do with their read of PL is disconcerting. Why not? Why not address those that may be concerned with the claim?

I was rereading through zach's iOS in mafia raptured to refresh my memory on how he reacted to tierce suspecting him and me starting to doubt my town read on him in that game, because it seemed odd to me that he didn't address me about it and I came across his suspicion of Matt in that game.  Now to be fair I was super suspicious of Matt in that game too, but I'm finding it odd that he's not taking into consideration some of that being Matt's posting style. Also, I don't know about kanye, but I don't think Matt is one to just ignore a growing wagon on a buddy when he should bus.  I know that Matt hasn't played scum in a while, so I suppose he could be rusty, but I think he tends to bus day one.</div></blockquote>\n\nWhat am I supposed to be taking into account? Implosion's response to my points seems to indicate a lion's share of what I was quoting and responding to is coming from Kayne. Is there a specific aspect of Matt's posting style I should be considering as far as meta goes? The expectation of taking Matt's posting style into account seems like a vague way to attack the points I've made on him.</div></blockquote>[/quote]<br>\n<br>\ntwo things.  a good half of what you quoted was from matt.  implosion suggests some of that is kanye, but did you think it was kanye when you commented on things that were said?  or did you think it was matt?  you were super suspicious of matt in mafia raptured, as was i, but you're acting like the posting style is completely new to you, like that you didn't just suspect him for similar things in a game where he was town.<br>\n<br>\noh wait three because this part is so super cute.  There is nothing vague in my attack.  i'm flat out attacking you, and i'm not hiding it or being subtle.  my vote is on you.  i've complained about you ignoring my suspicions of you and you've just responded. i've said your replace in feels way more like castle zar than invitational.  i suspected that your original vote on red coyote was a bus/distancing vote, which i've since taken back.  i believe your vote on the lobster was a bus. so now, go on tell me how i've been vague at all.  i literally said \"some of the points against them is meh.\"  That's not vague, that's me not buying some of your points or fonz's.", "time": "Mon Jul 29, 2013 4:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

The quality of someone's spelling is, of course, null.  I said that your misspelling looked much more likely to be fake than ZZZX's behaviour, you know the stuff that is completely consistent with how he acted in the other site meta he gave us?  IE pointing out how terrible your case is.  There is obvious scum motive in refusing to accept the validity of a strong towntell when it looks like you might well need to mislynch that player to win. <br>\n<br>\nHow about you address the actual substance of the case, IE that you appeared to go out of your way to avoid saying pretty much anything about PL while pushing the Red Coyote and then Deas Vail wagons which were the alternatives to it?  And that your case on ZZZX fucking blows?<br>\n<br>\nEveryone else should note the similarities between this response and PL's attempts to turn my case into an argument about which post I meant.  Their spelling is a really minor point (if anyone here's fake, it's them) used to highlight a much bigger and more important point (accusing ZZZX of being fake is really bad and scummy).  They're focusing on a small detail that they think they can use to make me look stupid, rather than engaging with the substance of the case.<br>\n______________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Implosion:</div> So your defence of the Bois feels very meta.  It seems to me that you're essentially saying that their tone and the arguments they're using sound like the sort of things they'd do as town.  To me, this seems to miss the point: no half-decent scum player will adopt a completely different tone or use totally different arguments than as town.  Hence, I don't really give two shits about their tone, even if it does sound kinda forced to me.  If they'd declared themselves SUPA-town while wagoning the fuck out of PL, they'd be a town read.  But they didn't.  <br>\n<br>\nI guess what I'm saying is: what have they done that you think they'd have difficulty faking as scum?

FTR, when i said dissonance, i meant hydra dissonance. You're listing all of these very broad, generic scumtells without considering context. In fact, for both rolefishing and fluffposting, you admit that they aren't necessarily scummy; saying that they're anti-town at best means that they are not necessarily scummy in all instances. That is, there can be instances where they're merely antitown instead of scummy.

I like how she goes back and forth on some of her thoughts/accusations. It reads as genuine and I think it'd be a lot of unneccessary effort for her if she's scum. I especially like how she is uncertain in her Fonz read- it would be really easy to just read him as town because he heavily attacked PL.    <br>\n<br>\nimplosion town read is almost just as strong. I've read/played in two of his past games, one where he was scum and one where he was town, and I think there's a significant distinction between his scum and town play. His play here resembles what I recall to be his town meta. Sure, he could have a good understanding of his meta and know how to fake it, but I don't get that impression. He's been very active and really put himself 'out there' in a way that I doubt scum would. It's a little strange how cautious he has been with his reads, but it doesn't appear to me like he actually cares what people think about him. Finally, I'm... inclined to say that Purple vs. implosion wasn't bussing. <br>\n<br>\nRedCoyote town read is mostly gut. A lot of the comments he made seem to have a town mindset behind them. Maybe I'm biased, but I also don't see the scum motivation for him to town read me so strongly either. Some players seem to think his back and forth on PL near the end of yesterday was a town tell, but it is actually the one thing giving me doubts about him. Part of me says it was just for show, especially considering I can't remember him being so open with his thoughts on any other occasions (I'll have to check later). <br>\n<br>\nDeasVail's play here seems different from #YOLOville where he was scum in that I've actually gotten the impression that he is trying to get scum lynched here. He's paying attention, seems to believe in his reads, and he's made some good points. My only issue (and the reason why he's in 'leaning town' rather than 'probably town') is that sometimes I feel that he's trying to appear pro-town. <br>\n<br>\nOriginally I thought pandashnoo was town for her 'replace out' suggestion, but I've come to realize that this is the only reason why I townread the slot. DeasVail raised a good point in 688 and there could very easily be another explanation I'm not seeing for pandashnooscum. I probably need to reread the slot, think it over some more, or wait for something from Nacho before I can really tell for sure.  <br>\n<br>\nThe Fonz was in my bottom five yesterday mostly due to POE. I hadn't seen anything from him that I thought he couldn't have faked as scum. Even the PL scumflip doesn't have me convinced- I could very easily envision a scenario where Fonz bussed PL- it might partially explain PL's irritating stubbornness. I do, however, really like his attack on SlumberPartyBois, so he's almost leaning town. <br>\n<br>\nI still think Mirari's vote for Fonz was off, but post 421 was not what I was expecting from Mirariscum. I agree that 421 was townish. Zach's now replaced in and I actually think his accusations towards SlumberPartyBois somewhat resemble genuine interest in determining who scum are. <br>\n  <br>\nI explained why I suspected yabbaguy yesterday and the reasoning hasn't changed. New thought; there was almost definitely a scum on the PL lynch bandwagon yesterday and yabbaguy is the most likely to be it. <br>\n<br>\nSlumberPartyBois has shown significantly more interest in appearing town than hunting scum. I like Fonz's point that they are trying to create a 'don't give a shit' vibe- worth noting that kanye's posting style improved slightly, after Fonz pointed that out. Secondly, they keep calling their selves obvtown. Mostly a bad gut feeling, but it feels like they're trying to make us doubt that they are scum because they are blatantly spending so much time calling their selves obvtown (hey hydra buddy lets call ourselves obvtown over and over again- there's no way they'd think scum would do that!). @Slumber or individual heads- have you ever played in a game where you frequently called yourself obvtown as town? ever done it as mafia? Finally, I'm getting an ingenuine vibe from them similar to the one I got from PL yesterday. Some examples;\n<blockquote><div><cite>SlumberPartyBois wrote:</cite>is there a wagon on zzzx? was there at any point? cus there should be. also implosion is town. matt are you there? is implosion town i think he is.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SlumberPartyBois wrote:</cite>dang my townlist is swellin im gettin really amped about shit now hiow come i put this one off to last on my catchup list fiuck.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SlumberPartyBois wrote:</cite>btw matt pls diont read any of my posts below v this line v until you discuss some shit w. me</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SlumberPartyBois wrote:</cite>no but seriously guys, if you fucking lynch the red coyote im gonna throw such a fucking hissy fit. matts gonna have to like, i dunno. but its gonna be roguht for every1one.</div></blockquote>\n\nI read ZZZX as town yesterday but that was 100% gut. He's made two posts since then which are now giving me doubts. Firstly, post 586;\n<blockquote><div><cite>ZZZX wrote:</cite>The Purple claim is really weird honestly,,, I think I will go for RedCayotte for the time being again since i got no better target<br>\n<br>\nVOTE: Red Cayotte</div></blockquote>\n\"Purple's claim is really weird... guess I'll vote RC because I've got no better option.\" I really get the impression that ZZZX simply didn't want to vote his scumbuddy. He gives no reason for preferring the RC vote in this post. Note also that he decided to change his vote but still didn't vote PL. Instead he voted somebody that had no chance of getting lynched, F-16. He does make it clear that he is suspicious of PL though- it feels like preparation for a PL lynch. <br>\n<br>\nThe second post from ZZZX that I dislike is the post which several players view as the 'townslip'. ZZZX should be familiar with the aspect of the game which involves people dieing during the night. So why he decided to resume playing without checking to see who died and what role they were is a mystery to me if he's town. Especially considering he cast his vote for F-16 on the same page that it was revealed he was town. I don't know how he could have missed it or why he had no interest in seeing who it was that died during the night if he really is town. But I can see plenty of motivation for ZZZXscum to make what appears to be a townslip. Otherwise it's convenient that ZZZX chose to vote F-16 instead of RC AND he neglected to check the night result. I've seen inexperienced scum try something like this before and I think ZZZX is making a similar attempt. Take a look at <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=17323\" class=\"postlink\">this game</a>, page 1 specifically. neil1113 is mafia in a jungle republic and he pretends to think that there are two mafia rather than three. In the mafia qt he even says that he's playing the noob card. I think that's exactly what ZZZX is doing here. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: ZZZX</div>", "time": "Mon Jul 29, 2013 5:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

I don't know, I didn't really read the reasoning for any of your reads besides us too. I'll try to read through shit ASAP, I get the feeling you're just conf biasing.

It started right from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112522#p5112522\">96</a> (with no votes on Purple Lobsta) and continued right until the end of the day. I know there was a period during the day where I was the only one other than The Fonz that was interested in lynching Purple Lobsta, so it would make much more sense for Fonz as scum to be open to not lynching Purple Lobsta in a situation like that. Also, the fact that I completely agreed with The Fonz and was similarly consistent with my Purple Lobsta scumread makes it quite plausible. So, I'm not too worried about him having such a persistent scumread only because he was bussing.<br>\n<br>\nIf someone knows of The Fonz being a super keen busser, then let me know and I probably won't consider this as a towntell anymore.<br>\n<br>\nI think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5120457#p5120457\">238</a> is a pretty town post. I get the sense that he is really trying to convince others that Purple Lobsta is scum. There is more reasoning than is necessary, everything is clearly explained and the points are good. Scum are less likely to care so much about convincing the town of their read. The fact that it's about Purple Lobsta elevates it from slightly town to very town.<br>\n<br>\nThe worst thing I can find about him is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5145755#p5145755\">648</a> where he acknowledges that Wicked would look better with Lobsta Scum. I felt that we shared very similar opinions on Purple Lobsta and their claim and if I thought someone was more likely to be town with Lobsta Scum, then I probably would have been less interested in lynching them. Even when I took my vote off Purple Lobsta, I still thought it was very likely they were scum, and I think The Fonz should have as well. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5165466#p5165466\">770</a> supports this point.<br>\n<br>\nDespite this, and the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Fonz's post toward the end of Day 1 either, most of his posting I find to be pretty town and the points that I made are pretty big for me. I hadn't realised the bad things before now though.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5172700#p5172700\">805</a> is pretty alarming to me.

ZZZX should be familiar with the aspect of the game which involves people dieing during the night. So why he decided to resume playing without checking to see who died and what role they were is a mystery to me if he's town. Especially considering he cast his vote for F-16 on the same page that it was revealed he was town. I don't know how he could have missed it or why he had no interest in seeing who it was that died during the night if he really is town. But I can see plenty of motivation for ZZZXscum to make what appears to be a townslip. Otherwise it's convenient that ZZZX chose to vote F-16 instead of RC AND he neglected to check the night result. I've seen inexperienced scum try something like this before and I think ZZZX is making a similar attempt. Take a look at this game, page 1 specifically. neil1113 is mafia in a jungle republic and he pretends to think that there are two mafia rather than three.

I just don't see it that way. You've got good company on the wagon though. <br>\n<br>\nEveryone is saying a lot. We're going in too many different directions, but I don't want to encourage either the ZZZX or SBP wagons. Frankly, I don't want them lynched. Wicked, DV is right. ZZZX has offsite meta of acting this way pretty evenly. I really don't think he's playing a card here. Your pointing out post 586 is good though. The fact that ZZZX was never on PL is not something that is in his favor. Do you think his vote of F-16 was concocted? It really looks genuine to me. If it was faked, did someone advise him to do it (suggesting a scum mastermind that I don't think anyone here is really capable of... maybe Fonz, but Fonz is super town), or did he come up with it on the fly? No, man, ZZZX is town. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's the other alternative? Nacho? Man, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel to vote Nacho on the back of, let's face it, one or two bad posts from panda. The \"I would've hammered\" is slimy, but there's no pattern of slime. If anything it fits her pattern of being a day late and a dollar short.

We're going in too many different directions, but I don't want to encourage either the ZZZX or SBP wagons. Frankly, I don't want them lynched. Wicked, DV is right. ZZZX has offsite meta of acting this way pretty evenly. I really don't think he's playing a card here. Your pointing out post 586 is good though. The fact that ZZZX was never on PL is not something that is in his favor. Do you think his vote of F-16 was concocted? It really looks genuine to me. If it was faked, did someone advise him to do it (suggesting a scum mastermind that I don't think anyone here is really capable of... maybe Fonz, but Fonz is super town), or did he come up with it on the fly? No, man, ZZZX is town. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's the other alternative? Nacho?

The \"I would've hammered\" is slimy, but there's no pattern of slime. If anything it fits her pattern of being a day late and a dollar short.

This would be an extremely balls-to-the-wall bus, with the might of the yellow buses from School Districts 1-300. Sottyrulez's bus was piss poor. Started out with defense, randomly shifted to bus when it was clear that the Lobsta wasn't living long. Fonz, if scum, would be lying down to rest from his mighty bussing experience. Maybe he would use his towncred to destroy someone else's towncred, but probably not. He would probably just go for the easy lynch.<br>\n<br>\nSottyrulez was already posturing for possible votes on Panda and Wicked. Who else can he really push? ZZZtownslip? You? RC? Deas? Yabba?

The way you tried to manipulate statistics to give the impression of hard numerical evidence of the falsity of the cop claim also looked really scummy, and had PL flipped town, I'd probably never have unvoted you.

Pretending the 'look fake' point is a major part of the accusations against them when it's a sub-point of 'their ZZZX push is scummy' (EVEN IF ZZZX is projecting a persona, a) he does is consistently across all games therefore it's equivalent to voting Fate for having capsrage and b) they look to me to be doing the same thing thus it's hypocritical) which is in itself a less important point than their behaviour around PL.  So you're taking something minor, making out it's something it isn't, and giving what is a REALLY FUCKING VAGUE defence of the major allegation (think it can be explained by how they look at a game).  I want to know how you think they look at a game, how you think you know that, and how you think that relates specifically to their behaviour around the Red, Deas, and PL wagons.

If I'm confident enough in Lobsta scum for it to have the bearing you think it should on my other reads, then the correct move is the lobsta vote.  If I'm not, then I vote the next scummiest.

You are trying to underhandedly throw suspicion on me for something that had not occurred instead of honestly interacting with me to figure me out.  You did a similar thing with me and falcon and yes I still think you were being manipulative and you were selectively scumhunting with the way you were treating me and the lobster.  It's super scummy.<br>\n<br>\nWell I guess if zach flips town ill get a town read on you, but until that day, I'm still going to be suspecting you because you just don't feel right.<br>\n<br>\nSo, hmm, lets see if I said why is no one questioning that claim in the middle of someone questioning that claim, logic would dictate that I didn't read it.  So why wouldn't your question be something along those lines?  \"Did you miss yabbas posts\" in a comment on that particular post, not a comment on me getting paranoid about the bois and trying to get Matt to post here and do something that would make me feel better about their alignment.<br>\n<br>\nSo here's the answer to the question that should have been asked.  I didn't read yabbas posts that day because they had a lot of numbers in them.  That takes me way more time to understand and I only had a few minutes that day.  I still don't understand the balance debate.  And now that I've actually read and thought about everything that has happened, I still don't know what to think.  But even if I had read his posts, I might not have commented on it, some times it helps to observe how things play out.<br>\n<br>\nAnd you want to know why the bolded is super slimy red?  I haven't shown any reluctance to talk about anyone this entire game.  I've talked a lot about yabba since the game started, so the bolded is just you trying to make something that runs counter to actual game evidence look like something it's not.

If Zach is scum and RC is his partner, then there's an extraordinarily large chance that that scumteam is going to crumble after a single day so your current argument with RC (sorting him out, all that) is essentially useless. I currently think that he's town because he seems agonized by your push on him in the same way that you seem to be antagonized by his slimy nasty attacks on you even though there is literally no reason for him to attack you when there's no way in hell that he's going to get you lynched. Not to mention that we're currently in the process of sorting out Zach and his confirmable ability, meaning that there is literally no reason to attempt to sort him out today.

That there were some interactions you initially didn't like between him and me and implosion but on a second look they weren't that bad.  So before your investigation, you were already softening your stance on red.

I was being sincere yesterday when I said that it spoke to me. It really did. I don't like voting PRs on D1 and I couldn't find myself able to refute his points accurately. Afterwards it was pointed out that his case wasn't as strong (only select 10 games, sometimes cop plays aggressive, etc), but I really disagreed then and still do.<br>\n<br>\nPrior to that, it seemed like he was a real voice of reason in this game when I felt a bit lost in the weeds.

I did think ninja was on it. (Wiki check: it's neither explicitly normal nor explicitly not, thought strongman which works similarly is explicitly normal).  But the point wasn't 'Well, they could be a ninja' which wouldn't be nearly enough reason to override the claimed tracking.  It's more 'What scum role with an active ability could there be, given what we know?'  I've been away for a while, but the most common scum PRs other than RBs seem to be various godfathers, secret voters, or the ninja, none of which would be trackable.  If there's a strongman, then it's not SPB, but that's not strong evidence for their innocence either since that role would be doing the killing.  Then you're getting into scum watcher or jailkeeper, which are really rare.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think 'Scum needs a PR given town power' is that reasonable a belief.

The implication of that post is crystal clear - I preferred to stay on SPB, who was my preferred lynch, but that wicked was a better lynch than ZZZX if no-one would buy the spb case and I was forced to choose between the two.  Hell, imho anyone was a better lynch than zzzx from my perspective other than me and maybe Tammy plus the claimed PRs. There's no reason to think I would consider starting a brand new wagon with what I thought would be weaker arguments than those against the Bois and no more likelihood of anyone else supporting me, that's just silly.

I took it as 'You voted for Deasvail yesterday, and need to justify it.' Which would be a weird thing to expect me to do spontaneously.  Even with the clarification, though, you're still completely ignoring the context of my DV vote - I voted him when I thought it was literally him or no-lynch (and probably no-lynch anyway, unless Empire was feeling nice).  I left it there for a little while, as I didn't want to cause a no-lynch by unvoting then disappearing.  That doesn't imply that I had him as a strong suspect.  I had him as basically null, as my posts at the time showed.  I still have no great town vibe on him, he remains middle-of-the-pack, but being the counterwagon to scum counts for something.  I think I prefer the nachowagon.

I did think ninja was on it. (Wiki check: it's neither explicitly normal nor explicitly not, thought strongman which works similarly is explicitly normal).  But the point wasn't 'Well, they could be a ninja' which wouldn't be nearly enough reason to override the claimed tracking.  It's more 'What scum role with an active ability could there be, given what we know?'  I've been away for a while, but the most common scum PRs other than RBs seem to be various godfathers, secret voters, or the ninja, none of which would be trackable.  If there's a strongman, then it's not SPB, but that's not strong evidence for their innocence either since that role would be doing the killing.  Then you're getting into scum watcher or jailkeeper, which are really rare.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think 'Scum needs a PR given town power' is that reasonable a belief.  I mean, we've seen no evidence of a full cop, doc or vig thus far.  If both Zach and yabba are telling the truth, AND the secret role yabba apparently knows about is strong, THEN that might be enough to deter my SPB suspicion.</div></blockquote>\n\nNinja might be on the list in the wiki, but I went back and read the list of possible roles that empire has in the first page and its not listed there.  But there is a note of there possibly being one role that isn't listed but is basically normal, so I suppose there could still be a ninja.  I remember in zach's large normal moi arguing that the existence of a tracker implies a ninja, so I guess it is normal, although ces argued that it would just be mean, so who knows.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>fonz wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Really loving how zach showed up today and started towning himself.\n</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>\nWhat does 'towning himself' mean?  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, the identity theft thing could be true and them be scum.

I think that zach is one of those players that when town really looks town, or at least I've seen him in several games and even though I have suspected him a little when he was town before, I've been able to read him as town properly.  I kept hoping that if he was town, he'd do something that would look really town and I could feel better about him instead of constructing paranoid theories of how he could still be scum even if we do have a second kill tonight.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the identity theft thing could be true and him be scum.  Bad things happen even when you're scum.  I had a death in the family while scum once and had to tell the game about it because I was going to be gone for two game days (shorter days), but it was very matter of fact when I explained why I was going to be absent.  What makes that look more likely town to me is that he mentioned that he's struggling not to just replace out and he's not going to be playing again for the foreseeable future.

I wonder how long that was there for.  Also on maras wiki it says that this hydra has played two games, but this is the only game listed, so that's just weird.<br>\n<br>\nI looked at some more of Maria's scum games, and in most of them she does some pretty heavy distancing.  In a couple she gives her main scum read and then lists her partner among those that could be her votee's partner.  However, I did find one where she had her partners as null to leaning town, so she doesn't heavy distance all the time I guess.  She has several newbie scum games that I didn't read except for her most recent one where she was an KC.<br>\n<br>\nSo my overall impression is still that she's more likely to not ignore a partner especially when that partner directly asks her things or comments on her.  This isn't 100% as I remember in American revolution moi doing association research on shos and cleared my slot on that because he had changed his meta, but this does make me wonder about those that she pushed.  In one game, she was calling someone scum but then said she didn't like that persons votes or questions on her other scum read who was her partner.  Which kinda feels like the way she was pushing zzzx but then saying she didn't like yabbas vote on zzzx.  She also made sure to comment on panda calling her active lurkish and not really posting anything of worth.

What I don't understand though, is why people aren't considering how unlikely it is that I would bus someone like Mara/Zoid (who I don't know very well) right from the start as I did after what happened in the marathon game. There, when I thought pirate mollie looked scummy, I just voted for her out of PoE and my scumbuddies got upset with me for it. If anyone knows my personality, then they should know I would be very hesitant to bus immediately after that, and probably wouldn't bus someone I didn't know very well as I did.

There is some reason to think there might be a scum power role - there usually is.  However, what is a reasonable assumption is that this game is somewhere close to the usual mafiascum idea of a balanced game.  If that is the case, then that makes a scum PR seem unlikely in the event that Zach flips scum (which I put in the high nineties percentage wise, the remaining probability space being taken up by the possibility that he had an enormous brain fart and somehow thought offing the next-best claimed PR was the best move for town, and that simultaneously the scum thought offing the same role was the best move for scum in a world where Zach holds a *better* PR).  And it makes the scenario where there are only two town PRs, a tracker and a neighborizer (neither of which is that good) AND a scum PR seem really, really, fucking REALLY unlikely to be the case in the eyes of any reasonable person, because that would be stupidly unbalanced.<br>\n<br>\nSo the question for me is, do you really think this game is super unbalanced?  If not, either your \"Scum PR = likely\" or \"Nacho - not virtually certain to be town\" belief has to be discarded.", "time": "Mon Aug 12, 2013 11:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

{"number": 1375, "id": "5227013", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "Okay here are my PARAPHRASED thoughts of my thoughts this morning.  Lil' preview - I'm still concerned about mostly everyone.<br>\n<br>\nWe have a confirmed town tracker and a confirmed town neighborizer, a town bodyguard would  make sense for the tracker.  So, I think that nacho is more likely to be town.  There's some paranoia there, but I think it's a bit unnecessary.  Him being alive is odd, but I just would imagine there being some type of protective role.  I'm easy to manipulate though, just ask him, so there's that.<br>\n<br>\nI still think that Red Coyote's push on me the day before yesterday in linking me to Yabba looked more townish than not.  The only two things I'm concerned about with him is the earlier selective scumhunting on day one and on day two using the falcon kill against Yabba, and him pushing for yabba instead of sotty on day two.  But, that could also come from town who just suspected yabba more.  <br>\n<br>\nBut I called that sotty shit day one!  Go me!  Just pretend that I didn't start second-guessing myself, okay?  See that's what happens when you people make me wait too long...it gives doubt time to settle in.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, deasvail's defense of sotty day two is bothering me.  His post to me about thinking that mirari was town and for me to explain how that isn't a problem for  me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5160476#p5160476\">Post 750</a> is worrying me.  However, Nacho thinks that he can read Deasvail and as they both can't be scum together there is that.  Also, I guess there could be something to the thing that Kanye pointed out.<br>\n<br>\nI know that the bois were tracked to going nowhere but sometimes they just don't feel right.

(That is what the chainsaw thing is right?  I'm not big on buzzwords and tend to skip over them, but yeah.)  The only reason I could see that is if they were all going for distancing hard, but unless they went decided to enter a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uEBuqkkQRk\" class=\"postlink\">bizarre love triangle</a> I'm less inclined to believe it right now.  But, need to re-read how day one went down and won't have time to do that until the weekend.  I did have a flash of a scum read on Fonz during the lynch of day one, but not real sure on this one right now.<br>\n<br>\nBut Wicked thought that Fonz was the last scum but didn't want to show his suspicion because he didn't want scum to know he suspected Fonz if Fonz was town.  He basically suspected him due to PoE, need to look back at day one as he thought that fonz was the one who questioned his scum read on her day one, thinks day one was a bus, and thinks that the falcon kill made sense for a fonz/zach team who left alive the popular town reads so it wouldn't look weird that fonz was still alive.  He thought that was kinda a wifomy point.  Anyway, I know those are paraphrased thoughts second hand, so take that as you will but those are the only thoughts he left in the neighborhood when he got back from v/la.<br>\n<br>\nI do need to reevaluate implosion.  I still feel relatively good about implosion.  Well it's day four so you know me.  Anyway, Fonz and Implosion are the only two left that the lobster attacked, and I'm having a hard time she ignored or called her partners town.  I just looked and there's no interaction with mirari or sotty, really there's no mention of either of them in their iso.  I need to re-read through zach though.  I think i remember him attacking implosion, and from what I understand he tends to distance.  Don't know that for super sure, just what's been talked about it games.  I'll have to look back at Castle Zar and see how he treated his partners when he replaced in.  Yabba was convinced before he died that Red Coyote was scum with Sotty but idk.  I thought at the time it was a bus, and still think the inno read is wifomy, but his push on red coyote kinda fits in tone with his push against the dgb/nacho slot in castle zar.<br>\n<br>\noh yeah, while yabba was alive wicked's other suspect was nacho, but he didn't mention that to me this morning.  but before he got the track results his suspect was the bois.<br>\n<br>\noh wait, one thing that bugs me about fonz is the day two issue.  He didn't go after sotty but instead joined zach on the bois for some lame reasons.  Particularly the thing about the bois not buying the townsliip from zzzx because he was scum who didn't want too many obvtown running around.  I think I said that already.

The two more scummy scum are gone and there's bound to be one that looks town at least for a while.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nIf someone could do something to make me less paranoid of implosion and RC, that would be amazing.<br>\n<br>\nAssuming that that happens and it's a decision between Fonz and SPB (I have faith in you guys), I am unsure. The Bois have strange vote targets, and going after ZZZX for so long in particular was a little weird to me. Ignoring PL Day 1 is pretty conspicuous too, but there are posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5180070#p5180070\">897</a> where Matt connects Nacho to sotty, which is weird for experienced scum to do because they will realise that it doesn't help them, but is used as a scumtell.<br>\n<br>\nDespite finding him generally townish and the bus on PL seeming unlikely, I think I'm leaning toward voting for The Fonz because since Day 1 he hasn't been all that impressive, and dismissing my self-meta as just calling myself obvtown (when there was actually logic to it) seems quite convenient. To add to The Bois' point, there are actually 5 people that PL mentions in their post as possible scum, where The Fonz is the only unflipped player. The strong PL attack and how it just led PL to get shiftier and shiftier is still annoying me though. So, although if I had to vote now, I'd choose The Fonz, I am still open to both options and will even consider others if I'm not satisfied with others' reads on RC and implosion.<br>\n<br>\nI'll have another look at things later too. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBois, what was you read of me Day 2?", "time": "Sat Aug 17, 2013 12:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=1400", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

To add to The Bois' point, there are actually 5 people that PL mentions in their post as possible scum, where The Fonz is the only unflipped player. The strong PL attack and how it just led PL to get shiftier and shiftier is still annoying me though. So, although if I had to vote now, I'd choose The Fonz, I am still open to both options and will even consider others if I'm not satisfied with others' reads on RC and implosion. </div></blockquote>\n\nDeas: your selfmeta is invalid.  Anyone who is aware of their meta can deliberately follow it as scum.  I don't think I have ever accepted a pre-emptive self-meta justification in my career.  You can think this is scummy if you want, but I'm not ever going to change on that front.  I don't think it's 'convenient' to not buy every argument you bring for your own towniness, especially when I do other analysis which points the other way.<br>\n<br>\nI am really unsure how I have at any point in this game been less impressive than any other point, whatever that means.  My day two play was broadly similar to D1: push my top suspect hard. (I also defended my strong town read hard).  The main difference is that people weren't buying.  As to the accusation that I basically  \"skipped\" day two, notice that I do not post at all between the 29th and the first, then my posting picks up massively from Sunday 4th.  This was not a coincidence - the week which finished on the 2nd July was my last week of placement before breaking up for summer, and things were hella hectic (I had an all-day engagement on the Saturday).  Hence, one real post between monday night and Sunday.   This was the period when Zach was getting run up.  But, even so, I didn't and still don't see what Tammy thought was so bad about Zach's posting.  I felt his spb case was much better than it was being given credit for.   The first thing he did which really pinged my scumdar was the 'hope there's no rb' thing, which seemed like a pre-emptive attempt to explain away no second kill, but even then, confirmable claim.  So I just didn't buy the Zach case, and wouldn't have if I were here.  I'd probably have actively defended him, actually.  The 'disconfirming' thing is something I've seen scum do, and seemed to make sense for scum given there already seemed to be a large pool of strongly town-looking players running around after the lobsta lynch.  Hard to see any route to a scum victory which didn't involve lynching ZZZX at some point.<br>\n<br>\n@Tammy: look at the sequence of posts between 703 and 712 please.  Note how, under time pressure, I am torn.  Look how easy it would have been, given your not getting back to me and my massive aversion to lynching claimed cops day one, to justify the Deas wagon as a fait accompli or merely disappear without changing my vote.  Instead, I try to co-ordinate with you to force through a Lobsta lynch which looks like kinda an outside bet.<br>\n<br>\n@Everyone: please at least do me the favour of taking a look at the Deas wagon D1, because I think this is something that's being overlooked that is important evidence.  I'll do that myself next post, if i'm not dead by then.  If I am, note that SPB is trying to pre-emptively create a narrative for when I flip town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\">~Quote tags fixed.</div></div>", "time": "Sat Aug 17, 2013 11:26 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

That was you reaching out to me, sorry for leading you on. [/quote]. I know that your fantasy sounded good and all sorry for killing it.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I'm not scared as scum.  I hate being scum because I hate lying but I don't fear being scum.  You don't even have to take my word for it.  Nachos seen me as scum three times, red coyotes seen me as scum, fonz modded a game where I was scum.  I really doubt any of them will say that fear is a big part of my scum game.  I expect to get investigated and lynched as scum because I think my scum game is obvious and poor, but I don't fear it.  Nor do I fear getting tunneled as scum. That you're actually patting yourself on the back thinking I'd be afraid of you guys as scum is so laughable I don't know what to say.  Yes, in Kanyes game you caught me as scum.  Congratulations.  I was so obvious that game I don't know how I wasn't lynched day one.  I also didn't care about that game much.  It was the second scum game that I replaced into that trollie had replaced out of for one, and the game was frustrating for two.  I didn't even care when you were tunneling me, and you caught me but you're reasons for catching me were wrong.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Matt wrote:</cite>\nYou say you have NO townreads yesterday which means you're either on meth or you literally haven't been reading the game</div></blockquote>\n\nSo.  I never said I have NO town reads. Implosion has been a consistent strong town read for me.  He's someone I'm reevaluating as I'm looking back at flipped scum.  Yesterday I also made an argument for why red coyote was more likely town.  I looked to nacho for reassurance on my weak town read on deasvail, and had a town read on nacho.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I said was that I don't have a strong town base I feel good about because there are always things that are popping up to make me doubt.  Is there paranoia, sure?  Maybe some of its silly, but to actually accuse me of saying something I didn't say and that I haven't been reading the game means you're on meth.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Matt wrote:</cite>\nYour push on RC was terrible and I assumed you were just biasing</div></blockquote>\n\nSo.  Are you going to say all of your reads are right in mafia?  Always.  Were you right about zzzx?  How about this idiotic push you're making on me?<br>\n<br>\n[quote\"Matt\"]<br>\nYou responded irrationally to my most recent posts by saying \"wtf?\" and asking for a ridiculous explanation from me which make no sense from your general character and feels completely awkward. Your general play this game has been lackluster and has involved over paranoia and ridiculous pushes based on memory. I haven't looked over your push on Sotty or PL but I will, but before you act like an indignant princess realize if we are both town, my reads were better than yours, I made better decisions on Sotty and RC (I was not even here for PL) and you've been apparently unable to town hunt or use any semblance of critical thinking[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nHow is that irrational?  You ignored nacho's question when you made a similar statement previously, and then you make another.  I want to know what you mean, because to me it just looks like you're trying to throw out bs and give yourself an out if fonz flips town.  If scum are lining up mislynches or setting up a 1v1, who is the scum doing that.  It shouldn't be hard to answer, and the fact that you went into the tirades of insulting my intelligence and going omg town read gone boohooohioohhooohojhihihihihiihl just reads insane and scummy.<br>\n<br>\nUm you're actually calling my play lackluster?  I think it's been pretty strong actually.  And it's especially strong considering the life changes I went through this month, unless you want to consider moving across the country and starting a new job something silly that wouldn't have an effect on play.<br>\n<br>\nMaybe I have been a little over paranoid, but who cares.  Sometimes I get overly paranoid when town.  And my pushes haven't been bad.  I was most likely wrong on my red coyote push day one, but during that time I was also pushing on the lobster.  I followed you on deasvail because he was scum he was scum he was scum, and I changed my mind based on how he reacted and then correctly chose the lobster. Also also at the end of day one, I was trying to get the lynch moved to sotty because even though I originally had a townread on mirari, once zach came in I started scum reading him.  No one bit day one, so I pushed it day two, and I would have gotten my scum flip if it weren't for that claim.  Did his ate make me doubt that my scum read was right, yes, because I just didn't think he'd use that as scum, but when he didn't act like town again the next day I pushed him again.<br>\n<br>\nDid you literally say my reads were better than yours.  Matt please never ever sign up for a game I'm in ever.  The way you're behaving is clearly out of line and insulting, and I don't want to so with you,<br>\n<br>\nI'm done dealing with you.

It kills town cred a lot because framing your target as an easy lynch implies that you don't find them as important to the scum team AND it means that he could be simultaneously defending by giving them an easy avenue to be defended. A *tiny* little bit of digging (sorry Empire, I'm not wasting my time with a full dive) suggests that Fonz frames his distancing pretty strongly: In inbetweeners mafia, when Fonz voted Ree he only did so when he could build a substantial case and when he was already coming under fire (AKA when distancing is actually necessary), meaning it doesn't look like he's a turbobusser. It's also inconsistent with any sort of logical scum strategy to turbo bus one partner and then weakly defend the other who made a dead man walking claim (which is ignoring my personal opinion that defending stall-claims is usually a town tell, considering a good stall claim will probably let your partner live until the next day by the merits of the claim itself while defending your scumpartner will always gain you heat from someone somewhere since you're defending scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\" data-post-id=\"5112604\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 101</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6932\">The Fonz</a> wrote:</cite>OK fine.<br>\n<br>\n1.

Tammy was telling F-16 to re-read.  He's stating that 'Re-read my posts' is an unnecessarily dismissive and antagonistic thing to say.  Which is true (generally, if someone's read your posts and what you think is obvious isn't obvious to them, telling them to re-read isn't going to make it obvious) though not really of any scumhunting value (I don't think Tammy being dismissive is alignment-related).<br>\nD) You have no basis for asserting 'he looks like he's about to shift the attention.'  <br>\nE) I kind of agree that it's not realistic to expect players not to ask each other to justify their actions.

I agree with him that you posting to say you have no read isn't valuable to the town and is just filler.  You seem to think that a mafia game is built on 'normal talking' then scumhunting at some arbitrary point when you have 'enough information.'  His point is that he believes there was enough information to start scumhunting, and yet you continued with 'normal talking.'  He's right and you're wrong.  However, the real question is not who's right, it's whether it's reasonable to think you scum for it.  I say no.<br>\nG) Your reaction to his post three is a Barnum statement (maybe one thing, or maybe the other).  It's of no value.<br>\nH) There are some grounds for accusing him of hypocrisy.

It was a push that never really gained much traction from my understanding of it, and was a push that Purple kept up until the last minute DV wagon (and even the vote there took some serious pushing). Meanwhile, Implosion spent most of his time on RedCoyote AND DeasVail, but didn't actually end up dancing with PL for that long despite their incredibly convinced and irrational push on them (contrast this with Fonz, who stuck on PL the entire day and stepped up his conviction with the \"Fonz is framing me\" or whatever the hell the case was).<br>\n<br>\nNext, my use of nightkill analysis is usually very limited and based on things that are very subtle; it's usually easy to rule out people as scum or town based on the nightkills they make. For example, I will never kill someone for a \"no information nightkill\" as scum because those are fucking stupid. F-16's nightkill looked ridiculously strange to me, not because he's a bad player or anything but because there were so many other pertinent threats hanging out all over the place. His reads also weren't that good (he thought PL and mirari were both town for a while), and he was easily mislynchable. He certainly wasn't a meta threat to a lot of players here who have a few meta threats (DeasVail wouldn't want to kill him, Tammy wouldn't want to kill him, SPB wouldn't want to kill him).

Note that this is Mirari's second vote after an RVS on Wicked. There are two questions that I'm asking myself: First of all, would Mirari bus Fonz with such a specific point, and continue the bus throughout the day? Second, would Mirari frame a bus with the \"who can tell me why\" thing? <br>\n<br>\nI think the fact that it was a very specific point (and that it's the only point mirari ever gave against Fonz) would make a little more sense as a bus. I don't think it'd be natural for scum to tunnel a townie on something that they know can be so easily (and accurately, since they are town) refuted by said townie. It would make more sense to use against scum because either they'll be able to easily counteract it, or it's the kind of vote that mirari would later be able to easily drop (since it's only on one point) in favor of pursuing some other wagon, yet still get towncred in the eventuality that Fonz flips scum. <br>\n<br>\nThe second question, idk. I really want to think that it's a tell one way or the other, but it's probably just a personality thing. \n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5113571#p5113571\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5113571#p5113571\" data-post-id=\"5113571\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 137</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21995\">PURPLE LOBSTA</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\" data-post-id=\"5112604\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 101</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6932\">The Fonz</a> wrote:</cite>1.

I really can't put myself into a town frame of mind, irrespective of experience level, where Implosion's post makes sense.  To me this reads like scum stretching for reasons post-RVS.<br>\n<br>\nWe're going back and forth in our QT about it, more later.</div></blockquote>\nThis is a bigger point, and is also underscored by this other quote that I missed at first, which is the first time PL seriously refer to Fonz:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Fonz completely misreps our voting patterns, and makes our first vote sound like it was serious, if he missed the votes me and zoidy made on the first page then it's fine but he actually talked about the vote I placed on Matt/Kanye meaning he has seen them. </div></blockquote>\nThe point is to make a comparison between the way PL treats me and the way they treat Fonz. It feels like they almost went out of their way to never explicitly call Fonz scum - they constantly maraud his case as being wrong, fabricated, and illiterate. Yet, they never call him scum.

I don't think a whole lot about my posts when I'm town, unless they're analysis, and don't really worry about looking town when town because that tends to come easy for me.

Maybe I misread something. Hold that thought, I'll get back to you on this. <br>\n<br>\nThe reason that The Fonz's point is horrible is simple. It's hypocritical. The Fonz calls out Purple Lobsta for trying to look town (illusion of content) where they ask Tammy for her games. In that very same post, The Fonz questions whether or not the players are a \"hydra\" or a single player. To me that information is just as easily found as old games. This point is also reinforced by the fact that The Fonz has been on this site for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">6</div> years. I am sure he knows how to find out if a player is a hydra or not. It takes a little digging. <br>\n<br>\nI agree with the scum reads on Implosion. I did not like his jump onto Purple Lobsta and think their description that he \"slithers\" onto the wagon is appropriate. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know what this means about Purple Lobsta. I haven't made up my mind about them.</div></blockquote>\nThe way in which Mirari is explicitly indecisive about PL is interesting in retrospect. Frankly i think this post should make <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">me</div> look more like town - it'd be unnatural for mirari to jump onto me while simultaneously remaining so ambivalent on PL this way. I think the jump on me makes a lot of sense as a potential future out for mirari's Fonz vote, though~~<br>\n<br>\nThe main point of quoting this post is just to illustrate how specific mirari's point on fonz was, though.

Instead, I try to co-ordinate with you to force through a Lobsta lynch which looks like kinda an outside bet.<br>\n\n</div></blockquote>\n\nFonz, I hear you I really do and it's something that has had me thinking about you over and over.  But, here's the thing, not too long ago in open 501, I as scum expressed disbelief in my scum partner's cop claim.  Once he claimed a couple other people took their votes off and went for the counter wagon, and when I came in I could have easily \"believed\" the claim and voted the counter wagon too and saved my partner day one, especially as deadline was coming close.  But, I didn't.  I decided to try to coordinate with Nacho about the claim (which my partner gave in a really suspicious manner that would have made town me suspicious anyway) and end up voting out my partner.  I then used that later as a point for why I was town near endgame.<br>\n<br>\nI think you are a much better scum player than me, so I can see you doing something like that to come out looking good.<br>\n<br>\nIt's why I've more been looking at how they treated you and I'm torn. I really am.<br>\n<br>\n----------<br>\n<br>\nWhat I think is interesting right now, is that Implosion hurried up to do that fonz iso once nacho made the implosion case.  Also, I was reading back over day two in my (ha!) spare time, and I'm not totally enthused with the way that implosion seemed to kind of posture around the sotty wagon.  I'm just having a hard time giving up my strong town read here.<br>\n<br>\nRed Coyote - How did you not notice that the bois brought up that point about the lobster's scum list days ago?<br>\n<br>\n----------<br>\n<br>\nMatt - I'm sorry if I was being a bit of a bitch.  I really don't care if you tell me I'm being a bitch in a game though; I'll probably agree with you.  I wasn't calling you scum but you were talking about things that didn't make sense to me and I couldn't follow you.  You said that scum were trying to line up mislynches if fonz was town and then that they were trying to make it a 1v1 but that doesn't match what's in the thread, so it struck me as off.  I realize that I did talk about it being between you and fond but i didn't say it was definite and I think by me saying that I wanted to go back through the thread made it obvious that I hadn't narrowed it down for sure.  Also, anyone who's played with me more than once knows that I'm always reevaluating things and I tend to give my thoughts in the moment but they are never set in stone.  I was trying to get your thoughts beyond your random postings about things that didn't add up.  I wasn't telling you you have to post 50 times a day but you should be able to answer for your thoughts.  Where you got me the hardest and I felt most insulted was when you started insulting my intelligence, which you did in mafia.raptrued too, and then started accusing me of being a bad scumhunter and a bad player.  Yes, I tend to get paranoid and I know that, this game is nothing different, but I do think I've done pretty well up to this point and I really didn't appreciate the taunting, but I accept your apology for being a jerk.<br>\n<br>\nThere are some things I want to think about though so, sorry to put this off til tomorrow, but tomorrow.", "time": "Thu Aug 22, 2013 5:58 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

I feel that defending RC would, in their minds, just make things more awkward, whereas bussing would at least give one of them a good chance of survival for the days afterward. I could easily see PL defending RC-town as an attempt to look town by not pursuing the easy counterwagon.<br>\n<br>\nApart from this, there are some weak town things, and a general feeling, which may or may be complete paranoia, that he is actually scum.

Note that throughout this game, I have been suffering paranoia about you because of TM2012 and how my entire team read you as strong town and you were scum.

There are major problems, as Nacho notes, with claiming that the scum are setting up this 1v1 and at the same time being unwilling to risk pointing out which of these players he's been calling out is the potential scum he thinks might be responsible - at a point where he needs those players' votes to lynch me over him.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I'm finding it hard to believe that Implosion is more likely scum than RC or Deas.

It's not cool anymore.<br>\nSeriously though, what is your problem with the townreads on me?</div></blockquote>\n\nThe problem is that there are similar town reads on implosion until the last page or two, and on RC (with the exception of Tammy).  If I'm wrong on SPB - and I don't think I am (but more to the point I'm reasonably happy that if I'm lynched, I'm pretty confident y'all will lynch them tomorrow) then it is likely to come down to you three.  I think it is therefore important to see which of the three of you is the most town and the most scummy.  Additionally, I think a lot of the Implosion stuff is coming from a different branch of the same WIFOMy tree as me - it is similarly trivially easy to make a 'scum would have distanced' 'scum would have ignored' and 'scum would have supported' argument with regard to any player who was not under severe pressure at the time.  There is little real cost to scum to do any of those things, it's basically second-guessing how the town will weight those things.  <br>\n<br>\nTherefore, while I will obviously support an Imp lynch over a me-lynch if there are no other options, it is not clear, if the alternative to me can't be SPB (and I still don't see why it should be) that the next best option is Implosion and not Red or you, so I need to make my mind up on that.  I also believe that should I be unfortunate enough to be mislynched today, then that analysis has value in endgame once i'm flipped.  (Given that I'm currently weighting the probability something like 50-60% last scum is SPB, 35-45% it's in that group of three, and 5% something really weird is happening and it's Tammy running a super-bus strategy or the setup is bizarre).<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, now to do that analysis.

But, here's the thing, not too long ago in open 501, I as scum expressed disbelief in my scum partner's cop claim.  Once he claimed a couple other people took their votes off and went for the counter wagon, and when I came in I could have easily \"believed\" the claim and voted the counter wagon too and saved my partner day one, especially as deadline was coming close.  But, I didn't.  I decided to try to coordinate with Nacho about the claim (which my partner gave in a really suspicious manner that would have made town me suspicious anyway) and end up voting out my partner.  I then used that later as a point for why I was town near endgame.<br>\n<br>\nI think you are a much better scum player than me, so I can see you doing something like that to come out looking good.<br>\n<br>\nIt's why I've more been looking at how they treated you and I'm torn.

Note that throughout this game, I have been suffering paranoia about you because of TM2012 and how my entire team read you as strong town and you were scum.  However, when I consider your actions, it would have been equally easy for you as it was for me to go, \"Well, cop claim and the reasons I gave for this fitting meta and the fact I'm not sure we have time to get a PL lynch\" and then push pl day two and get the exact same amount of town cred.  Note that the most likely explanation for me not really being mentioned by Zach is that day one, expressing suspicion of me would tie him to PL and present severe cognitive dissonance with his PL scum read.  Day two, early on I support him, and later (as he's being pushed to claim) i'm simply absent.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nI'm not really following part of this.  I've been finding it really hard to feel great about anyone being town this game.  I townread falcon partly based on that and partly based on the meta case empire wrote on a scum falcon in deas' game.  Implosion isn't based on him sounding like he does as town.  His is partly gut based and part overcompensation from scum reading him when he was town not too long ago.  I didn't feel really great about deas until today when it became clear that nacho and him couldn't be on a scum team together and I still have bits of paranoia on that.  I did change my mind when he was run up day one because I've seen him run up as scum three times and he reacted more like I've seen him run up as town.  Nacho I had paranoia about until it became pretty clear that for him to be scum, the setup doesn't make sense.  I'm leaving alone the rc thing because of two reasons.  The push to try to tie me to yabba fell apart when yabba flipped town, though I still don't like a lot of his day one play.  But pretty much the entire town has basically told me I'm stupid for suspecting him and as they can't be scum with him, those town reads are real and either the entire town is wrong and I'm right, or I'm just wrong.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as spb goes I haven't and still don't have a town read on them.  I've flip flopped on them like crazy.<br>\n<br>\nIf that paranoia of me is real, thank you.  I think I have a really poor scum game but have been told its not as bad as I think it is.  But I really don't see it coming from team mafia as I was a replacement that game and. Large part of the town read you guys had on me was based on my predecessor.  Even after I \"accidentally\" hammered iam, which I sill feel bad about btw, he was using oms actions for why I was town and shouldn't be lynched.  The only thing I really did was not dispel any of the good feelings you guys already had about my slot.  I think I'd probably be a little more understanding if you used American revolution or something.  At least there I got caught in more than one lie and still managed to have people town read me and win the game.  I realize you were the mod there so it's less personal, but I'm just trying to understand if its real or not.  I had you as basically town day one, but something struck me at a gut level when we were talking at the end of day one as being off.  But I knew it could just be paranoia and is why I was getting others to explain their town reads on you.  I realize I've never played with you before so haven't been fooled, but I did follow along with the inbetweeners in which you were competent as scum.  <br>\n<br>\nSo while I might not be looking at your play and going \"this is a town tell\", and tbf I do want to give you town credit for the way you handled the lobster but I do consider the possibility of doing that as scum especially as I just did something similar, but I am looking at flipped scums behavior with you and think some of that makes you look townish.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>fonz wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nAlso, I would like a response to my point that it seems incredibly hard to imagine a route to a scum win that doesn't involve a ZZZX lynch somewhere along the line.</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't really get the point.  It seems to me that zzzx wasn't special in the need to get rid of pool, as scum have to get rid of as many town looking players.

In fact, his anger is something he's good at faking when scum.  The major AtE he did in mafia.raptured that I was arguing was fake, I was wrong about, he probably wouldn't be able or wouldn't fake that leverl of AtE, but the hostility, yes.  I can totally see him doing that.  But, I did go back to War is Hell and read the way he treated Tierce when she was scum reading him and he was just as hostile but he was actually being productive during the game while being angry, so don't know what to make of that there.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I just finished reading up to the beginning of this day, and I'm at a loss.

I feel good about RC town for various reasons, and I feel goodish about DV town - there's just some paranoia there on that one.  Even though I think that a lot of spb's posts come off scummy, Mara voted him in RVS and I just feel like that's something that she wouldn't do.  I don't feel really strongly about that but I think it's something she'd try to avoid.

{"number": 1572, "id": "5265685", "user": "The Fonz", "user_id": "6932", "content": "OK, so the Deas and PL wagons.  This is interesting to me for a few reasons:<br>\n<br>\n1) The Lobsta jumps on the counterwagon late, while still stating she thinks DV is town.  Vibe of expecting a DV townflip here.  Seems more likely, if they're both scum and it's one or the other, it's better to get the towncred for pushing DV. <br>\n2) Zach reacts similarly, expressing the willingness to do it over NL, but bewilderment at how it got to that level.  This seems less strong evidence of Deas' innocence, seeing as how if Deas is the buddy, he's in a tough spot tomorrow if he endorses this wagon whichever way the lynch ends up going, but it does still kinda seem 'hope it goes through without him.'<br>\n3) Implosion and Deas are both early adopters of the PL wagon.  Implosion, I think, adds much more, whereas DV largely just parrots me.  OTOH, Deas sticks to this wagon, whereas Implosion jumps off to vote RC.<br>\n4)  Zach pushes RC in preference to PL, but then jumps off, putting PL in the 'staring down a barrel' position.  This is a crucial vote in making PL and not RC the one who is run up to claim.  It seems like bad play to swing the momentum in favour of a buddy lynch like this, otoh sparing a good buddy over a terrible one makes sense.<br>\n5) Slumber sits on Deas pretty much all of day one, ignoring the lobster.<br>\n6) Red and Implosion are both key votes on the Deas counterwagon.<br>\n7) Implosion switches back to PL once I have done so.  Could be a degree of seeing the tide turning, idk, this seems like a pretty important vote in the context of things.  Takes it from 6-3 Deas to 5-4, then Deas' own vote puts it at 5-5.<br>\n<br>\nI'm thinking of the three, I'm leaning Coyotescum over Implosionscum or Deas-scum.

I am not going to be satisfied until I can satisfy my curiosity over PL's list. I also think we all need to see the nightkill tonight. That nightkill coupled with N1's kill will tell us a bit more.

Unfortunately, for the scum team, a lot of bad luck just seemed to hit them too early. The LOBSTA found themselves under a mountain of suspicion pretty quickly and, even though they did a good job of trying to shake it off, they ultimately couldn't. A lot of the players that looked like they could be mislynched given the game state ended up being PRs that had to be killed off. The Fonz did some amazing work in this game, especially with his Day 1 bus, but I felt PoE ultimately caught up to him in the end and his unfortunate V/LA towards the end crippled his opportunity to really turn his wagon around.<br>\n<br>\nThe town definitely deserves massive props here for great work pretty much all throughout the game. I thought them pushing through a LOBSTA lynch despite the cop claim was particularly noteworthy, as I think most other towns would have balked at the idea of possibly lynching such a strong PR. A lot of people were on to the scum team early on, despite a lot of the playstyle/personality clashes that occurred throughout. I really want to give a special shout out to Wickedestjr, who played his role excellently and nailed the entire scum team with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5140784#p5140784\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and drove home that The Fonz was the last scum in his final Neighborhood post. I think if he were a bit more active, he'd have been even more of a driving force than he was in the game.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as the setup goes, I want to do something simple and basic to get my feet wet as this was my first modded game. I basically went with the investigative PR/protective PR duo but wanted to make sure that they weren't too overpowered (hence the BG and tracker). I threw in a Neighborizer simply because of games like The Wire - having been part of a Neighborhood in that game that I felt was really effective, I wanted to put that to the test here. It would have been interesting to see the behind-the-scenes work Wickedestjr and yabbaguy would have done had they not been run up to claim on Day 2.<br>\n<br>\nSeeing as this was my first time modding, I think I did ok. I wish I could have been more on top of the game after the Bar exam, but real life got in the way of things. I tried my best to keep up and in the end I'm pretty satisfied with how the game turned out.<br>\n<br>\nThanks a lot to all of the replacements for stepping up to the plate and joining this game.

My takeaway - bussing credit isn't magic, there's still a lot to navigate through even if you gain that momentary invincibility shield for a few Days. The Mirari/sottyrulez (okay, Zachrulez <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) slot I think may have started okay but then dwindled away in activity too much - and I think I've learned that watching to see how your non-bussed partner in situations like this is the key part to any early Day bus. With my all-seeing 20/20 hindsight, I think Fonz's correct move would've been to try and escape the PL wagon at some point once his second buddy started becoming more and more suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nI prolifically posted in the Dead QT, so read there for my of my thoughts - I really like discussing with alive players who see what I've said after the game ends, but I think it was basically a great victory for Town.", "time": "Thu Aug 29, 2013 10:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=1600", "forum": "53", "thread": "29867"}

The dasterdly fiend they made me out to be would've gotten a noose wrapped around my neck before I could say stop. I actually agree with them and didn't think I played particularly well with the exception of going for Fonz there at the end. I didn't even get to vote Zach/sotty like I wanted to on D3 and was worried that that would be used against me. But, whatever, that's townRC for you. I'm just glad that I had SBP, Nacho, and implosion around to protect me. &lt;3 yabba, I love that line \"lost the plot\". I've heard it once or twice before. I want to start using that for myself. <br>\n<br>\nI think the town really played well here though. We all seemed to compliment each other well with minimal speed bumps along the way. It's almost like we all had townreads on different players and kind of just went like, \"well, if you say s/he's town, then okay, I'll go with it\". Had implosion and Fonz not been around to talk down scumNacho, I think very much I could've been convinced on that one. So that was nice. Me and Tammy butted heads, but ultimately I never really had a solid scumread on her. I don't know if it was in spite or because of the hostility though. Working with townNacho is always so great. He really helps me focus and I think we can read each other pretty well. When reading through the dead/neighbor QT, it was like yabba and Wicked were kind of different players. I wish, wish, wish they'd have defended each other a little more strongly. Wicked especially shocked me at how solid his reads were when you see what he has to say in the QTs. If only ZZZX hadn't turned so many people off. There was another person that agreed with me (implosion?) that that was just such an abysmal lynch. But that's what is cool about Mafia is that people can interpret things so much differently. I'm totally going to use the \"ZZZX tell\" going forward though, lol. <br>\n<br>\nThe scum and town MVP was Fonz, lmao. It's almost not a joke though. He effectively made the decision to lynch PL. Although he focused hard on SBP during D2, he did end up helping get sotty lynched on D3. And he was just unfortunately not really persuasive enough to defend himself and convince enough people on D4. Whether he realizes it or not, he helped keep me from going after Nacho, DV, and implosion harder at various points in the game. I mean, who knows what would've happened had he come out swinging for any of those three, but I just know that his dismissing of those players are potential scum targets was certainly a factor in me not being as vicious against them. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empire 1592 wrote:</cite>Any comments/suggestions/etc about the setup or my modding are definitely encouraged.

I especially enjoyed playing with you, and I didn't really expect someone I didn't know to play along with what I was doing in the way that you did. We did make a few mistakes that could have changed the outcome if they weren't made otherwise but that kind of stuff happen<br>\n<br>\nlike, I should have claimed Weak-cop instead of hinting that I could have had that modifier and hoped that town picked it up<br>\n<br>\nand Zack definitely could have handled that D1 bus better but overall, I don't really have anything to bad to say about you guys.
