{"forum": "53", "thread": "29867", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29867&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Tue Jul 09, 2013 12:48 pm", "user": "Empire", "content": "<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Game Rules</span></span><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">(stolen and modified from Tierce, Magua, and callforjudgement</span>)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General Rules</span><br>1. The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>2. Play to win.<br>3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">this color</span></span></span>. Do not use this color.<br>8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules</span><br>1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules</span><br>1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player name or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup Rules</span><br>As a Mini Normal game, the exact details of this game's setup are not public. However, you do know the following facts about the setup:<br>1. At least 12 of the 13 players have an explicitly normal role, from the following list: Vanilla Townie, Sane Cop, Doctor, Vigilante, Roleblocker, Mason, Innocent Child, Jailkeeper, Tracker, Watcher, Gunsmith, Miller, Bodyguard, Role Cop, Doublevoter, Hider, Neighbor, Neighborizer, Jack of All Trades, Serial Killer, Mafia Goon, Mafia Traitor, Mafia Godfather, Mafia Framer, Mafia-aligned versions of above roles, possibly with an explicitly normal modifier: Even/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Bulletproof, Neighbor, Compulsive, Macho, Weak, Backup (with or without primary role present). It is possible that all 13 players have a role on this list; it is also possible that the 13th player has some other role with \"basic\" Mafia traits.<br>2. There are either 1 or 2 anti-town factions consisting of 2 or more players; and either 0 or 1 anti-town factions consisting of a single player.<br>3. The only possible win conditions are the Town, Mafia/Werewolf, Traitor, and Serial Killer win conditions. (So no jesters, lynchers, survivors, or cults.)<br>4. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini 1472, [Player]! You are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Abilities:</span><br>You have none aside from your voice and your vote.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Win Condition:</span><br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town-aligned player alive.<br><br>Please confirm via PM stating your role and your alignment.</div></blockquote>"}

PL is a 'townsperson.'  Means newbie, alt, or hydra.  (Use of 'our' in first post suggests the latter?)  If PL is a newbie, then having played with Tammy before is not noteworthy.  If PL is an alt or hydra, ze or they (seriously, can we clear this up in order to make pronoun use easier?) knows full well how to search a user's past games.  Therefore, asking for meta fulfills the role of looking like you're doing something useful, whilst a) being unnecessary and b) not giving any actual opinions on what's happening in the game."}

However, I don't buy that he is telling the truth about his intended goal because his posts weren't actually threatening. As for \"trying to get a discussion going,\" I think most people are trying to do that, some in more effective ways than others. For instance, I started a discussion with my FOS on Tammy and Slumber. Upon examining Tammy's reaction, I initially had a scumread on her which changed to a townread. I wouldn't have developed those reads if I hadn't engaged with her. By letting you elaborate on your own reads and starting a discussion with you, I gain an insight into your affiliation as well."}

However, I don't buy that he is telling the truth about his intended goal because his posts weren't actually threatening. As for \"trying to get a discussion going,\" I think most people are trying to do that, some in more effective ways than others. For instance, I started a discussion with my FOS on Tammy and Slumber. Upon examining Tammy's reaction, I initially had a scumread on her which changed to a townread. I wouldn't have developed those reads if I hadn't engaged with her.

Matt/Kanye like to get the game going with reaction tests.  Matt especially, not really sure about Kanye, but I know that Matt gets his best reads early in the game.  Pushing an early scum read on me early in the game could have just been them reaction testing.  Matt's caught me as scum before in a game that Kanye modded, and we've all played together before.  I react a lot differently to being called scum when scum than when town.  In marketplace II they started the game with a strong scum read on me based on something I said, but realized after arguing with me for a couple pages that I was town but they continued to call me scum and used that argument to read people and the way they reacted to what was going on.<br><br>I'm not saying spb is town for their entrance into the game because they haven't given me much more to go on, but this is pretty standard for what I've seen of their beginning games."}

You haven't addressed his point 2; you've ignored it to harp on him for what is very, very obviously a misstatement or you misinterpreting his vote. Him saying the \"initial vote was serious\" may be referring to your first serious vote.

Also, he didn't even need the answer to that question - he asked it in passing and then explained why his point was valid regardless of the answer.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mirari wrote:</cite>I agree with the scum reads on Implosion. I did not like his jump onto Purple Lobsta and think their description that he \"slithers\" onto the wagon is appropriate. </div></blockquote><br><br>Did you read my post 156, notably this line:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Additionally (and lol at myself for this) i actually don't remember how serious i was being when i made that post. i THINK i made that post primarily because you had done a very interesting brand of nothing so far and i felt you were more deserving of pressure than yabbaguy. </div></blockquote><br>That vote was almost <span style=\"font-style: italic\">intended</span> to look bad. I joined the wagon because the specific kind of posting that PL had done deserved pressure. Describing my jump as having slithered onto the wagon does not in any way implicate it as a scummy jump, either. Obviously it's connoted to mean that, but me looking like i slithered on to the wagon doesn't equate to me being scum."}

It's hypocritical. The Fonz calls out Purple Lobsta for trying to look town (illusion of content) where they ask Tammy for her games. In that very same post, The Fonz questions whether or not the players are a \"hydra\" or a single player. To me that information is just as easily found as old games. This point is also reinforced by the fact that The Fonz has been on this site for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">6</span> years. I am sure he knows how to find out if a player is a hydra or not. It takes a little digging. <br><br>I agree with the scum reads on Implosion.

The only reason I knew that it was a hydra is because I saw them being denied entry into another game because of MM being in too many games.  It's not listed on the first page that they're a hydra or who their heads are, and asking for someone to state who the heads of a hydra is is a whole lot different than asking for someone to link to their past scum/town games.  It takes a hell of a lot less digging to find out someone's meta, no matter what is or isn't on a wiki, than it does to find out if someone is a hydra and who they are.  That information should be readily available to us.<br><br>I don't see anything wrong with Implosion's vote on PL especially at this point in the game where adding pressure to someone who looks suspicious is helpful and I think you guys are making a really weird thing about it.  I know I've helped someone pressure their reads for a heck of a lot less than that."}

I wasn't being unnecessarily overly aggressive I was annoyed, and I wanted to see if Falcon would realize why his statements to me didn't make sense.  His first argument was that I said I got a new job but had plenty of time to post in rvs, which read super weird to me because I plainly said I would be moving over the course of the next month.  Then he pulled out incorrect meta on me to explain why I was scum, and if you ever want to see how super annoyed I can get, claim to know my meta when you don't.  Because as far as I'm concerned anyone who actually knows my meta, knows that the lighthearted let's have fun, omigod empire's a troll and i'm town here beginning, makes me far far more likely town.  So, yes, some of his posts annoyed me because it didn't seem to me that he was reading what I said and putting it into context.<br><br>And yes, the interaction between me and sbp was fun banter.  I was having fun.<br><br>And now for the incorrect meta knowledge of me?  I don't think anyone has ever described my town play as being laid back.  That actually far more describes my scum play.  You have knowledge of me from two games.  I was scum in Abarat (I replaced Matt hi!) and was pretty laid back as is my tendency as scum.  I was town in Ladies Night which was actually kind of an odd game for me.  I was super busy during day one, so I came in and gave reads and whiteknighted people who were getting run up for silly reasons.  Then day two I super hard pushed a mislynch and was killed that night.  I came under no suspicion that I remember during that game at all.  I'm not very laid back.  In black flag faraday called out arthur for scum reading me by saying I'm way more bitchy as town.  In yoloville Shadoweh was scum reading me because I wasn't being bitchy enough and yelling at enough people.  In short, I'm a bit high-strung, easily annoyed, a bit of a bitch, self-absorbed, condescending, and sometimes aggressive.  BUT I do like long walks on the beach.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 146 wrote:</cite>Hell yes I was being dismissive.

Because I view it as negative. Why shouldn't I? What reasons do you have to be dismissive other than being perturbed at having to address suspicions in a game of Mafia? <br><br>Also, you mentioned you were celebrating, but earlier you mention you and SBP were sort of \"testing\" each other. Can you do both at the same time?</div></blockquote><br><br>Point A: Context is everything.  I don't mind, haha, addressing suspicions in a mafia game that make sense to me.  I do have a tendency to treat what I view as silly suspicions in a condescending or dismissive way...when town but you'd have to actually know my meta to know that of me.  I do mind incorrect meta being applied to me.  <br><br>Point B:  Why can't you?  But, I wasn't actually testing Matt.  I talked about how he reaction tests at the beginnings of games.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 146 wrote:</cite>Why is this junk?</div></blockquote><br><br>Updating the thread needlessly to say that you have \"basically no reasons on all the players (or most because he can't decide whether or not he doesn't have reads on everybody or almost everybody)\" is bad form. He had just posted, he's clearly not making an effort (and telling us that he isn't), and he's not even clear about that.<br><br>It's junk posting. Do you intepret it differently?</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't have a read on him right now, but people post that they don't have reads on anyone all the time, so I'm wondering why you're pointing it out as junk posting.  And it basically goes to the problem that I'm having with your posting overall.  You don't seem to actually be seeking anyone's alignment, but you do seem to be trying to point out what is scummy or can be construed as scummy but really isn't indicative of scum.  It's shallow and it's not actually scumhunting but trying to make others look like scum, which is far more indicative of you being scum."}

Now I'm not RedCoyote, however, I seriously doubt he felt any pressure from your vote. You voted solely because your fellow bloc member did AND you distanced yourself from the vote by putting all the responsibility on Tammy. The implication of your 196 was that you wouldn't have voted RedCoyote if Tammy hadn't. So how was your vote supposed to help pressure RedCoyote? <br>-Why not try to convince Tammy to vote PURPLE LOBSTA, who I assume was/is still your top suspect at the time?     <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>The Fonz wrote:</cite>ITT When presented with a simple and obvious explanation or the opportunity to produce a nonsensical conspiracu theory to paint me as scum, PL chooses the latter.</div></blockquote><br>Does that mean you're more suspicious of them?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mirari wrote:</cite>I'm not sure how I feel about Implosion now that he coherently explained his vote after Fonz. I do like his current vote which makes me feel better about him.<br><br>~ Join my wagon on Fonz!</div></blockquote><br>I dislike this post. Firstly, it is odd that you 'feel better' about implosion because of his new vote, because he was simply following Tammy and you have completely ignored the person that he voted despite implying suspicion of that player. <br><br>Secondly, I'm not sure Fonz is town, but your justification is really weak considering you want a wagon on him. It's been brought to your attention that there was no obvious/easy way to discern whether or not PL is a hydra yet you are ignoring that. Why are you ignoring that? Do you think it's a lie? I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">also</span> asked if PL was a hydra because I was unable to determine it. Were we both lazy/trying to appear proactive?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote. Vote: Mirari</span><br><br><br>I'm also not a fan of pandashnoo's post. He explains his town reads, but not his scum reads. He joins the RC bandwagon in an effort to 'possibly move us closer to lynching scum', making it clear that this is not a strong read. He intends to go look at meta and 'work out the most fake scumhunts' despite expressing very little interest in the game. I get the impression that his entire post was not genuine. <br><br><br>F-16, I have trouble believing you thought it was possible for Tammy and Slumber to both be mafia. Why would they behave the way they did if they were both mafia? And is Slumber your current top suspect?<br><br>PURPLE LOBSTA is irritating. I think I disagree with/don't understand pretty much everything you said in your exchange with implosion. I get the impression you are not reading the thread very carefully, you are not articulating your thoughts very well, I think you are being stubborn, and it is frustrating (or at least the head arguing with implosion was). Please explain; <br>1) How was asking for meta from Tammy supposed to generate reactions? You were asked this question already but seemed to avoid answering. Until you can explain how Tammy's response could be telling, I'm calling BS on this. <br>2) It seems pretty obvious that Fonz is referring to your vote on yabbaguy. It bothers me that you still believe otherwise (179). Please, tell me. What is the motivation for Fonzscum to call your obvRVS vote a serious vote?<br>3) I find it strange that you went from calling three people 'so obviously scum it isn't funny' to voting someone, not among the three, fifty posts later. Please, explain. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SlumberPartyBois wrote:</cite>I'm on chapter 40 of the 40 chapters I need to memorize for the MCAT<br><br>So I'm in a different zone right now.

Maybe I should as a matter of style, but it's hardly an alignment indicator to not preview.<br><br>It's either complete illiteracy or a lie to claim that I said Purple Lobsta 'came back to their vote.'  Here, for anyone who is at all unclear, is what I am actually alleging:<br><br>1.  PL made a vote for yabbaguy that they claimed was serious.  They did not explain this vote.<br><br>2.  They return TO THE THREAD in post #90, but don't mention yabba in that post.  Now, if I'm PL, voting for someone seriously, and my vote goes largely unnoticed, when I return to the thread, I do something to try to push the wagon.  Maybe I explain my vote to see if that convinces anyone else.  Maybe I ask Tammy, who seems to think yabba's posting is 'bad' if she'd be willing to join me on yabba.  Maybe a point out a criterion by which yabba looks scummier than other players people are voting for.  Maybe I just go 'More Yabba votes kthanxbai!'   Purple Lobsta only actually gives a reason for finding Yabba scummy after implosion specifically asks them to justify themselves.  This does not look, to me, like the behaviour of someone who is actually trying to get yabbaguy run up.  It looks to me like the behaviour of someone who is either a) trying to sneak a vote onto yabba while keeping options open b) distancing from yabba, or c) just wants to look like they're scumhunting.<br><br>3.  That the 'meta please' comment is an attempt to 'look town' rather than because they have any particular meta information they're interested in with regard to Tammy.  Indeed, they pretty much concede that they weren't really going to look at Tammy's meta when they start blathering on about 'town mindset.'  They seem to be implying some kind of reaction test.  There's a few problems here.  One, as others have pointed out, linking to your games isn't any harder for scum than town.  Two, Tammy did react - she asked why they couldn't look themselves as well as telling them that American Revolution mafia was her last scum game.  How did they interpret this?  I don't have a clue, they haven't said anything about it.  They didn't say she was scummy for being obstructionist.  They didn't say she was townish for not really caring what they thought of her.  I don't believe they've answered F-16's similar query about what they were expecting to see from town/scum.  A reaction test where you have no idea how town and scum reactions would differ is just filler.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>the only serious vote that was placed was the vote on Yabba</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes, so how the hell do you not put two and two together and realise that when I referred to 'The vote that you said was serious' I was FUCKING WELL TALKING ABOUT THE VOTE YOU SAID WAS SERIOUS?<br><br>@Mirari: Is wickedestjr scummy for asking Purple Lobsta if they're a hydra?<br><br>Thoughts on other things happening in the game to follow shortly."}

He called PL out on something I thought was significant, though, so there's evidence of scumhunting.  Oh, and Implosion looks town.  His explanations of why he believes what he believes are consistent and logical, he's not afraid of being seen to 'sheep,'   he doesn't change his positions when attacked.

To begin with, a minor point of anti-townness, it is never helpful to speculate out loud about the likelihood that someone else is a power role.<br>It's not easy to understand exactly what you're saying, but I think it boils down to:<br>A) You think that suggesting you're faking having bad grammar etc is a bad reason to vote someone.  I agree.<br>B) He's attacking people for fluff posting but doing it himself.  That's not actually true.  <br>C) You say he's refusing to re-read, he's not talking about himself though.  Tammy was telling F-16 to re-read.  He's stating that 'Re-read my posts' is an unnecessarily dismissive and antagonistic thing to say.  Which is true (generally, if someone's read your posts and what you think is obvious isn't obvious to them, telling them to re-read isn't going to make it obvious) though not really of any scumhunting value (I don't think Tammy being dismissive is alignment-related).<br>D) You have no basis for asserting 'he looks like he's about to shift the attention.'  <br>E) I kind of agree that it's not realistic to expect players not to ask each other to justify their actions.  I don't think this is scummy though, he's just showing frustration at the way the game is being played.<br>F) You think it's scummy or hypocritical for him to claim to find it scummy that you are posting to say you have no reads.  I agree with him that you posting to say you have no read isn't valuable to the town and is just filler.  You seem to think that a mafia game is built on 'normal talking' then scumhunting at some arbitrary point when you have 'enough information.'  His point is that he believes there was enough information to start scumhunting, and yet you continued with 'normal talking.'  He's right and you're wrong.  However, the real question is not who's right, it's whether it's reasonable to think you scum for it.  I say no.<br>G) Your reaction to his post three is a Barnum statement (maybe one thing, or maybe the other).  It's of no value.<br>H) There are some grounds for accusing him of hypocrisy.  I don't really care though, I don't find this to be a reliable indicator of scum.<br><br>Basically, you make some OK points, and some points that are baseless.  If you'd done this a page ago, I'd have considered it a town sign because although it's not great analysis, it shows town motive.  However, the timing is suspicious.  Just as a noticeable wagon is building on Red and other people are expressing suspicion, you choose to do a big analysis on him, and lo and behold this analysis happens to find him to be likely scum.  This makes me question your motives."}

Delibrately trying to frustrate you. Mainly through, \"are you being serious?\" and \"read my posts\" over and over. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>And yes, the interaction between me and sbp was fun banter. I was having fun.<br><br>And now for the incorrect meta knowledge of me? I don't think anyone has ever described my town play as being laid back.</div></blockquote><br><br>But these two statements already start contradicting each other before you even begin talking. On the one hand, you say no one would describe your town meta as laid back, on the other, you say you start this game with fun banter toward SBP. I mean, we could split hairs and say \"having fun =/ laid back\", but in the greater context of whether you come into a game as cheerful, fun loving, and happy-go-lucky as opposed to \"high-strung, easily annoyed, and a bit of a bitch\", I consider those polar opposites. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>I was town in Ladies Night which was actually kind of an odd game for me. </div></blockquote><br><br>Of course the one game I have with you as town (and I consider Mod-player games count given the fact that I read the game thoroughly) is the outlier. <br><br>That aside, I didn't come into this game with detailed reports on each player's game history. I'm not the meta guy. If you say that I absolutely don't know what I am talking about to call you laid back, then I don't care to tell you I know more about you than you. My only town reference point is one game. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>I don't have a read on him right now, but people post that they don't have reads on anyone all the time, so I'm wondering why you're pointing it out as junk posting.</div></blockquote><br><br>Has anyone else gone out of their way to do it this game? Feel free to point it out if I have missed it. ZZZX's posts contain a lot of fluff that you are implying is acceptable. I do not find them acceptable.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>You don't seem to actually be seeking anyone's alignment, but you do seem to be trying to point out what is scummy or can be construed as scummy but really isn't indicative of scum. It's shallow and it's not actually scumhunting but trying to make others look like scum, which is far more indicative of you being scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know what any of these means. These are just a lot of buzzwords. I'm not seeking anyone's alignment yet I am pointing out what is scummy and voting in kind? That's doublespeak, Tammy. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion 209 wrote:</cite>It's been a loooong time since I remember a game that actually had a voting bloc, but early in the game the point of a voting bloc isn't to find scum, it's to have a cohesive unit of townies that townread each other that can cohesively apply pressure in one place after another until it settles into what it collectively believes is a good place.</div></blockquote><br><br>But there is no cohesion thus far. I've seen little of this proposed voting bloc and more of \"implosion latching onto whomever seems the most popular townie atm\". Perhaps that's a little harsh, but it's looking more like an excuse for you to sheep than it is a solid triumvirate.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>panda 210 wrote:</cite>I don't want to do too much PbPA, I'm going to now go and get some meta<br>also gonna try to work out the most fake scumhunts</div></blockquote><br><br>Heh, well, I'll hold you to this then, my friend.

Those couple of sentences are probably the summation of my interest in it so far. None of those players (PL, Fonz, and especially implosion) have sold me enough to abandon my independent scumhunting in favor of following their lead. It may happen yet, but PL has shown enough righteous indignation to make me skeptical of him being scum despite liking Fonz's argument better. <br><br>Besides, I'm having too much fun with you and ZZZX. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mirari 217 wrote:</cite>I do like his current vote which makes me feel better about him.</div></blockquote><br><br>Really? It doesn't bother you that neither of his bloc-mates have shown enthusiasm toward his proposal? Without consent, it's just \"me too\". <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wicked 230 wrote:</cite>I'm also not a fan of pandashnoo's post. He explains his town reads, but not his scum reads. He joins the RC bandwagon in an effort to 'possibly move us closer to lynching scum', making it clear that this is not a strong read. He intends to go look at meta and 'work out the most fake scumhunts' despite expressing very little interest in the game. I get the impression that his entire post was not genuine.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm in the unfortunate position of being the recipient of these three votes (implosion, panda, ZZZX), so it's difficult for me to speak out against them with any real authority.

Part of the reason I kept telling him to read my posts was I wanted to see if he would realize that he was mistaken about me without me pointing it out.  At one point he said that both of his scum reads had omgused him and that made him feel like he was on the right track.  After that I told him to go back and read my posts.

My answer concerning me being annoyed and seeing if Falcon would see what I was referring to should have made you recognize that here.

On the one hand, you say no one would describe your town meta as laid back, on the other, you say you start this game with fun banter toward SBP. I mean, we could split hairs and say \"having fun =/ laid back\", but in the greater context of whether you come into a game as cheerful, fun loving, and happy-go-lucky as opposed to \"high-strung, easily annoyed, and a bit of a bitch\", I consider those polar opposites. </div></blockquote><br><br>Were you on drugs when you wrote this?  Or in your whole life have you lacked interaction with human beings?  You know what's funny every single description in that paragraph you just gave is an accurate depiction of my personality.  I am all those things.  You can consider that polar opposite all your want or contradictions, but the fact remains that it's part of my personality.  So, what you are basically doing is arguing about my personality, which I'm sorry but has nothing to do with my alignment.  I mean I even said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5117044#p5117044\">Post 204</a> which you did read but cut out that in the game that you are referring to me being town and laid back that I didn't really come under suspicion, which should put some things into context for you.  The only \"suspicion\" I did get in that game was when springlullaby, who was scum, called me out for whiteknighting and I'm pretty sure my response was that only scum have ever tried to cast suspicion on me for whiteknighting people before.  I even said in that post you are referring to that I tend to view silly suspicions on me in a condescending or dismissive way.  So, context, darlin.  Get it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 204 wrote:</cite>I was town in Ladies Night which was actually kind of an odd game for me. </div></blockquote><br><br>Of course the one game I have with you as town (and I consider Mod-player games count given the fact that I read the game thoroughly) is the outlier. <br><br>That aside, I didn't come into this game with detailed reports on each player's game history.

I didn't make any implication of the matter of fluff posting.

These are just a lot of buzzwords. I'm not seeking anyone's alignment yet I am pointing out what is scummy and voting in kind? That's doublespeak, Tammy. </div></blockquote><br><br>Okay you know what you get to do now?  Point out the buzzword.  Point out any one.  Unless you're trying to say scumhunting is a buzzword nowadays.<br><br>There is no doublespeak anywhere and you've been playing mafia long enough to understand exactly what I mean.  Acting like you don't is just another reason why you are far far more likely scum than town.<br><br>But, in case you just are honestly baffled, let me explain it for you.  You are not scumhunting.  You are assigning things as scummy, but scummy does not always equal scum.  If it did, town wouldn't be mislynched as much as they are.  Scum love to hunt through the actions that can be construed as scummy, and might be anti-town in a sense, but that isn't indicative of scum.  Town hunt, or should if they want to win, below the surface for the motivations and the intent of the person to figure out who is the murdering bastards among them.<br><br>Here I'll even make it personal for you.  Remember in Abarat, when you replied to Fate, who was an IC, that the two of you \"may\" be on the same team that game?  I seem to recall people jumping on that \"may\" for proof you were scum.  You weren't, you were town.  Scum could easily exploit that may and not look further below the surface to see your alignment, while town should have.<br><br>So, a typical practice for scum, is exactly what you're doing.  You're trying to twist my interaction with Falcon into something that it wasn't, so you can look busy and manipulate people.  You're pointing out \"junk posting\" and anti-town behavior but not looking to see if it actually comes from scum.

That is pretty much one of the most interesting things to him.  He even applied wrong meta to me about it!  Now, let's take a look at the Lobster/Fonz argument, shall we?  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112931#p5112931\">Post 116</a> shows the lobster being dismissive to Implosion.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5113571#p5113571\">Post 137</a> has lobster telling fonz to go back and *gasp* reread their post because he's confused.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5114109#p5114109\">Post 155</a> has lobster calling the fonz illiterate and that his post didn't make any goddamn sense and then in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5115732#p5115732\">Post 167</a> suggests fonz is borderline retarded.<br><br>So, now if my interaction with Falcon on the first couple of pages is being interpretted as dismissive and needlessly overaggressive, why is this discussion with lobster and fonz not worthy enough of discussion.  And how is lobster showing enough righteous indignation any different from the indignation I showed falcon over him not realizing that I was celebrating getting a job and having fun in the first few pages of the game?<br><br>This my friends, is selective scum hunting.  He is not applying similar tests of behavior to people overall, but is picking and choosing.  I haven't decided what this means for lobster or even the fonz yet.  But the last time I caught someone on selective scumhunting like this they were scumhunting town but then dismissing that same thing when it applied to their partner.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>rc wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>ZZZX 237 wrote:</cite>he think I am faking typos and capitalization which... makes no sense. why would a scum or town do that?</div></blockquote><br><br>So that you're difficult for others to read.

You making fun of the way he posts in the text type speak you did was uncalled for.  He hadn't shown any evidence for him posting that way, and it looks like you just trying to make someone look bad instead of try to figure them out.  What's worse is here you are responding to Fonz saying he's not a native speaker, and it didn't make you reconsider your ridiculing him for no reason whatsoever.

SlumberParty tells him to ask him why he (wickedest) is scum, and Wickedest agrees. When asked to guess, he provides 4 reasons as to why he could possibly be scummy, then says he gives up and asks Slumber to tell him. I get the tone that he is trying to appease Slumber by giving in to his demands. Slumber was clearly pushing him around and I felt Wicked was allowing himself to be pushed around too easily and not step on any toes. Wickedest\u2019s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111096#p5111096\">63</a>, he asks me whether I thought it was possible for both Tammy and Slumber to be mafia. Of course it is possible \u2013 just like it is possible that any two players in the game could be on a team together. He didn\u2019t ask if it was likely but whether it was possible at all. This implies that he doesn\u2019t believe that it is possible (which he later confirms) that Tammy and Slumber could be scum together. However, until this point, I had seen nothing to make me rule out a Tammy/Slumber scumteam entirely. They were arguing with each other but scum are just as likely to argue with each other during RVS as any random pair of players. It isn\u2019t a tell. <br><br>Yabbaguy\u2019s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111753#p5111753\">92</a> reads scum primarily based on gut. It is the sort of thing I\u2019ve done as scum before, thanking someone for buddying with me and voting them. I have trouble seeing a town motivation for this post. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112584#p5112584\">100</a>, he defends Slumber saying that he felt Slumber was acting anti-town but had good intentions. I am conflicted about this post because on the one hand, Yabba did attempt to scumhunt for deeper motivations, but on the other, he seems to have taken Slumber\u2019s word for it that Slumber was working to achieve his stated intentions. Slight town because of this though. The rest of Yabba\u2019s post showed his annoyance at being asked questions which I am leaning scum on because as others have pointed out, the intent behind the questions was fairly obvious.<br><br>The Fonz\u2019s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112522#p5112522\">96</a> where he posts \u201c/inb4omgeasylynch.\u201d I find Fonz scummy precisely because he picked an easy target. The above remark implies that Fonz knows that Purple was likely to be an easy target. His first point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\">101</a> about Purple not coming back to a serious vote doesn\u2019t show any scum motivation. His second point about asking for meta isn\u2019t really scummy either. Another problem with this post is that he didn\u2019t really wait a while to check whether Purple came up with any conclusions based on Tammy\u2019s meta but merely attacked Purple for asking for meta. His post felt a bit too smooth to me. At first glance, it seems well-thought-out, but the more I think about it, the more it seems more like a bad post with good presentation. <br><br>Purple couldn\u2019t believe that they were being FOSsed and their response was quite townish. It wasn\u2019t logically airtight and had plenty of holes which Fonz pushed upon. <br><br>RedCoyote\u2019s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112983#p5112983\">119</a>, why do you believe that Wickedest\u2019s question was solid? In fact I found it rather useless \u2013 perhaps to dig into my thought process a little, but no better than any other question. Also, I don\u2019t like RedCoyote\u2019s push on ZZZX. He is pushing on an easy target, like The Fonz with Purple Lobster. His reasoning of typos, goofy capitalizations etc speaks more to the personality of the player rather than their affiliation. <br><br>I agree with most of Pandashnoo\u2019s reads. However, he didn\u2019t provide any original thoughts. He townreads Purple for \u201cfrustration\u201d which is pretty much the exact same thing I said 4 posts earlier.<br><br>Mirari hasn\u2019t posted much content. I agree with him that Fonz is likely scum and I think Mirari is likely town (their interaction isn\u2019t scum-scum). Wickedest\u2019s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5109188#p5109188\">230 </a>where he votes Mirari is bad. He starts off with questions to implosion which are decent. Wickedest, what do you believe is Mirari\u2019s motivation for pushing Fonz? <br><br>From most town to most scum, I\u2019d say: Implosion, Tammy, Purple, Mirari/RedCoyote/Pandashnoo, DeasVail, Yabba/Slumber, Wickedest/Fonz. I am at the beginning of page 10. I\u2019ll probably vote Wickedest or Fonz."}

I don't think you're as keen on going back through meta as much as you are using that word to try and sneak a vote in on a leading wagon. Now, should you prove me wrong, I'll certainly take that into account. As it stands, I think you're skirting by with very little independent contributions and without taking any real controversial positions.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>There is no attempt here whatsoever to try to ascertain my alignment.

As I've already stated, I'm given a negative perception by your badgering. I don't see it so much as trying to get a read on F-16 as I do see it as you getting your panties in a wad over something as relatively mundane as \"what are you and SBP talking about?\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>This is an attempt to manipulate Falcon into going back to his earlier scum read on me by trying to paint something I did as scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>That's awfully presumptive of you. The man asked me a question. I didn't voluntarily ask him to take another look at you. I gave my honest opinion about the interactions between you two and he wanted clarification. To label that as manipulative is incorrect.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>But it didn't, and if you were town, I really think you'd be trying to figure me out.</div></blockquote><br><br>And what do you call this then? I'm not picking a fight with you for my health.

So, what you are basically doing is arguing about my personality, which I'm sorry but has nothing to do with my alignment. </div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know how you can say with a straight face that \"cheerful\" and \"bitchy\" are synonyms, but we'll leave the lexicological debate for another day. <br><br>Okay, so you're everything at once. There's no way to describe you because you are a human being with emotions that as whimsical as a leaf blowing in the wind. That's a perfectly sound philosophical viewpoint that I can comprehend. <br><br>But if that's the case, then you can't sit here and say that any attitude you have makes you necessarily townie or scummy. It certainly limits someone's scumhunting a great deal to boot. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>When you say \"of course the one game I have with you as town is the outlier\". What do you mean by that?</div></blockquote><br><br>That our previous interactions happen to not count is ironic given that it was a reason for which I called you out. But that's the problem with meta. Sometimes it's valid and sometimes it isn't.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>I think that you are picking an easy target to look busy and like you are scumhunting, and pointing out that it was junk posting was just as much junk posting as any fluff.</div></blockquote><br><br>Certainly not, and this is a poor argument that I will gladly shoot down anytime it's made. It's made too often anyways. Just because a player is, speaking in a general sense, weaker, doesn't necessarily make them more or less likely to be scum. That's a fallacy. I wasn't voting ZZZX because he was weaker, I was voting him because he did something that I thought was scummy. It doesn't matter if his name is ZZZX or The Fonz or Tammy or mith, if someone makes a post like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111769#p5111769\" class=\"postlink\">post 93</a>, I will call them out for it. <br><br>And, yes, you are implying that that is an acceptable post when you criticize me for suspecting it. You say my motivations are tainted, but it didn't matter that it was ZZZX made that specific post. It's bad. It's universally bad. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>Point out the buzzword. Point out any one. Unless you're trying to say scumhunting is a buzzword nowadays.</div></blockquote><br><br>\"Scumhunting without seeking alignment\"? What do you mean? That's just noise. These whole paragraphs are a bunch of wafty academic concepts of someone that's technically scummy, not scum, but scumhunting as a construct of pointing out the scuminess. At a certain point, you have to take a step back and say, whoa, maybe I'm getting a little too deep in all this. Sometimes there's just scummy and not scummy. <br><br>My theory? One player sees something a scummy and they say something. The other player responds and the game moves forward. Simple. There's no motivations within motivations here. These are just a lot of words. <br><br>As for your example, I understand your point. Sometimes townies do things that seem scummy. Fine. Then that's up to the townie to work to erase that image with defense and further contributions. ZZZX, I think, did this in my eyes for right now. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy 288 wrote:</cite>You're pointing out \"junk posting\" and anti-town behavior but not looking to see if it actually comes from scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>That's what votes are for.

It's not a bad post that's seceretly revealing as good. It's just bad. It's simple, he doesn't want to say he has any reads because he doesn't want to catch any flak by voting anyone. Once I call him out, then he feels justified in voting me (since I'm already doing it) and thinks people will sympathize.<br><br>Please keep in mind that I definitely don't have a townread on ZZZX, I only think he isn't as bad as I previously thought. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>panda 311 wrote:</cite>I'm on here for a minute, just wanted to clarify I'm female and so would prefer the pronoun 'she', thanks.</div></blockquote><br><br>Just FYI, you can specify this in your control panel, if you want. <br><br>---<br><br>Let's line everyone up, because I think we've got a lot of input so far from most people: <br><br>[<span class=\"noboldsig\">Town</span>]--------Wicked--yabba--Fonz-F16-PL-SBP[<span class=\"noboldsig\">\u2219</span>]-Mirai---Tammy---ZZZX-DV-implosion--panda----[<span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum</span>]<br><br>Everyone's still bunched up around the middle because it's early yet.

Nitpicks a townie on another townie\u2019s question. Says that the question was whether they were townie or scummy, not whether they were new or fluffposting. When questioned about his case, clearly explains why being strange is not scummy but being illogical is. Overall, implosion is very nitpicky as scum, agrees with generally established norms, and refers to his previous explanations \u201cI already said\u2026\u201d a lot possibly out of frustration at being ignored.

Furthermore, implosion seems to be remarkably good at deconstructing the logic of VI\u2019s and painting them as scummy. He clearly has the upper hand since he used superior logic and a more experienced viewpoint. Heavily nitpicks very specific points to the point where he earned townreads from other players. Calls out potential scum-pairs which he had a problem with as town when done excessively. In post 154, he picks out things that are odd and not necessarily scumtells going so far as to just call them odd and leaving them at that. Continues asking townies why his supposed scumread is town. This contrasts with his behavior here where he jumps off the wagon off of his own accord. Asks a player why they are not attacking another player.

He admits in this game in post 164 that he would push very hard on him if he were scum because he appears unlikely to defend himself well. He goes mostly on gut and and makes statements that transcend basic logic. For example, he says that despite the votes on the VI being justified, the people voting the VI are still scummy.

While he had provided excuses for inactivity as both affiliations before, activity by itself is pro-town and warrants a townread for most players of average skill. <br>On the other hand, he tells me to bandwagon, votes along with Yabba despite scumreading him, and forgets Yabba later on. However, voting along with Yabba can be explained by a belief that if Purple was scum, Yabba would bus. Town games suggest that Implosion holds such beliefs.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>Okay wow thanks.  A lot more in depth than I expected.

I agree with Red that it's an utter bullshit argument (that's the whole point of my /inb4easylynch comment: I get easy lynch arguments every.fucking.game as town for attacking bad players who also happen to show tons of scum motive, and it's moronic).   But that's not my argument with regard to Red himself.  There's all the difference in the world between attacking a new/annoying/bad at writing player because they're dropping scum tells, and attacking them solely because they're new etc.  You LITERALLY suggested that ZZZX was scum on the basis of his writing style.  A similar argument applies to wickedestjr.  He attacks Mirari for making a 'weak' argument.  Let's not consider whether it's a weak argument that scum would benefit from making or anything.  Oh no, he's clearly scum because he's bad at logic.  (Also some misrepresentation there: Mirari didn't say he changed his mind on implosion because implosion changed his vote.  He said he changed his mind because implosion gave a good explanation of his vote).<br><br>I'll have to consider whether red or wickedest is worse if not PL.

Post 392 was essentially me describing the straw that broke the camel's back. It's not shirking responsibility for the vote when you put it into the context of me justifying the vote in the previous vote; it's simply me explaining my thought process behind voting him, i.e. i've been reluctant to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but i am now scumreading them</span>. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm sorry, but by now you should have at least one tangible scumread that isn't like pulling teeth to arrive at.

It's fine to feel that way about my play, and I can frankly see where you're coming from. However, that doesn't link in to me being scum; as town, I have no obligation to have an \"impact\" on the game early on day one. My primary obligation is simply to find scum. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>implosion 408 wrote:</cite>It was just an idea that, if it happened, would be cool, and if it didn't then oh well.</div></blockquote><br><br>See this?

As I've already stated, I'm given a negative perception by your badgering.

To me it looked like F-16 was trying to \"look at me scumhunting on page 3\" without actually taking things into context.  He applied incorrect meta to me and didn't seem like he had actually read my posts.  He didn't say \"what are you and SBP talking about\".  He came up with an outrageous scenario that didn't take into account what I had said in my first post or my subsequent posts or the votes I was making.<br><br>As far as I was concerned either he wasn't actually paying attention while reading, he was trying to go look at me so protown mkay, or he was reaction testing, or he was joking.  Like this shouldn't be an issue.  Yes, I was annoyed if he was serious, because his reaction was flipping stupid as was the use of incorrect meta on me.  I just do not see, and still don't, how someone can't read that I was like \"got a job! yay...been drinking and celebrating...omgus for stupid wiki tell\" and not recognize that I was celebrating getting a new job and having fun, but instead goes \"omigod so she's scum cuz she's celebrating and not being serious on page two.\"  I just don't.

Fate busses chesskid. Implosion adds his vote to bus after it becomes obvious that the lynch will go through. Townreads fate and a townie as town vs town. Continues bus after the lynch was already pretty much set in stone. Repeated apologies for inactivity along with excuses. Promises content later and delivers as promised. <br>Next day, agrees with the case on a generally accepted lynch which his buddies are pushing, cites a townie\u2019s reasons for agreeing. Generally gives extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote. Information about the accelerated lynch. Repeats a townie\u2019s (AV\u2019s) analysis about Gandalf having up to 6 votes being bad for town. There is a lot of being on the fence such as \u201cI'm going to get suspicious, but for now gandalf is probably town. He reads town anyway. It could also be a scum ability that gains from hammering, but I think it's more likely town.\u201d Then votes a player for not taking solid stances. Interesting irony. Deflects suspicion from his buddy by saying that he already explained the reasoning for not voting a player. Pushes for one specific player (bv310) being the best lynch and says to \u201cscrew nightkill speculation.\u201d Close mindedness as scum. Responds to the same suspicion from a townie by saying that he had already explained twice that he thought the person he didn\u2019t vote for was hammered. Slight frustration, asks the same townie to explain a read. Inactivity could possibly be genuine since school started. Fake-claims something unbelievably powerful and elaborate. Buddies bus him. Disliked the bus, made a note of it in wiki. It doesn\u2019t seem to be his favored strategy. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">S2) Frogs Mafia 2</span></span></span><br>Moderately active, 48 posts out of 1131. Starts out with apologies and excuses for inactivity although that could be due to school. In post 101, votes meransial for lack of logic. Tries to get on the same page as scumread \u201cI get that\u2026 but (etc.)\u201d Dismantles stupid logic from the VI townie. When townie says changing vote too often, implosion says \u201cthe only way I can think of being risky is mafia who want to avoid looking scummy.\u201d Interesting to note that he supplies scum-sided motivations for a townie\u2019s statement and presents it as the \u201conly way.\u201d Questions the townie on why they think something is code. If they don\u2019t and speculating, why bring it up at all? Covering all his bases. This continues further while he asks questions like \u201cif so, why? If not, why not?\u201d Says another townie would make sense as a pair but wishes to stay away from pair speculation. In the same post, nitpicks his scumbuddy Amrun\u2019s statements. Nitpicks a townie on another townie\u2019s question. Says that the question was whether they were townie or scummy, not whether they were new or fluffposting. When questioned about his case, clearly explains why being strange is not scummy but being illogical is. Overall, implosion is very nitpicky as scum, agrees with generally established norms, and refers to his previous explanations \u201cI already said\u2026\u201d a lot possibly out of frustration at being ignored. Can\u2019t see a reason for frustration when pushing town lynches as opposed to defense. Could be a null-tell. Verify with town games. Furthermore, implosion seems to be remarkably good at deconstructing the logic of VI\u2019s and painting them as scummy. He clearly has the upper hand since he used superior logic and a more experienced viewpoint. Heavily nitpicks very specific points to the point where he earned townreads from other players. Calls out potential scum-pairs which he had a problem with as town when done excessively. In post 154, he picks out things that are odd and not necessarily scumtells going so far as to just call them odd and leaving them at that. Continues asking townies why his supposed scumread is town. This contrasts with his behavior here where he jumps off the wagon off of his own accord. Asks a player why they are not attacking another player. Also asks players to make a case pushing town on town fights. Switches vote to Mozamis upon seeing pressure wane on his previous target and mount on Mozamis. Attacks people for pointless BS reasons, especially for disagreeing with him. <br><br>Day 2, continues to point out what is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d as opposed to what is scummy. Also, points out \u201codd\u201d things instead of actual scumtells.<br><br>Day 3, posts a long ISO on his buddy Amrun and two other townies. Anything that he agrees with is immediately branded town \u2013 especially his buddy Amrun also having the same reads as him at specific points in time.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">T1) Nexusville Mafia</span></span></span><br>Moderately active, 51 out of 933 posts. At the beginning, implosion was more defensive than aggressive saying that it was not his playstyle to be a leader. Then attacks Mongoose for the classic, vote a townie, FOS a scumbuddy move. This makes sense as he has done this before as scum in Frogs Mafia. Asks Womc to provide a completed game where he set traps before as town. Then puts out a list of reads town (5), leaning town (1), neutral (2), leaning scum (1), scum (3). Womc isn\u2019t on the list although two others including Mongoose are. He then asks for discussion. Response to suspicion: Iceninja in 82 makes a post FOSing implosion. FOSses someone for being overly cautious, says he has no idea why he has a certain player in his scum list. Seems to be a little more careless and prone to making mistakes as town as opposed to scum where he covers all his bases. Calls out a player for using Ate and claiming and defends his stance on the list of reads. Excuses for activity level and slight frustration at having already explained stuff. Both seem to be nulltells and based on personality rather than affiliation. The biggest difference here is that he doesn\u2019t push an \u201ceasy\u201d read and instead attacks the wagon saying that there is likely scum on the wagon. Contrast with pushing players based on their bad logic when he is scum. Implosion as town tries to see the greater picture as opposed to push nitpicky logic-based arguments. Interesting how quickly he changed his mind because said easy target as at the bottom of his scumlist (most scummy). He admits in this game in post 164 that he would push very hard on him if he were scum because he appears unlikely to defend himself well. He goes mostly on gut and and makes statements that transcend basic logic. For example, he says that despite the votes on the VI being justified, the people voting the VI are still scummy. There is a greater thought process going on and not just logic 101. Post 167 is a good deconstruction of his logic. <br><br>Implosion FOSses a player for having not much content of their own (Salivor). Eventually starts to suspect Ice for unreasonably pushing on the same point many times. Implosion in 465 further says that a player isn\u2019t scummy based on not giving \u201cscummy vibes\u201d despite being strange. Another point of note is that implosion doesn\u2019t really question his scumreads much in this game and keeps arguments with them to a bare minimum. Clearly doesn\u2019t mind voting for the information lynch because his read is so fluctuating. <br><br>Day 3, admits that Ice flipping cop screws up his reads on the game. He has a couple of townreads but not solid scumreads. Posts a huge long vote count analysis and gives several permutations and combinations for who could be scum. Behavior becomes obv-town at this point. <br><br>Day 4, the final day before scum win, he says that the stranger a claim is, the more likely it is to be true. In general, shows an acceptance of strange things. Also, townreads a townie who he heavily FOSsed for voting someone that everyone else read town. Couldn\u2019t see the point of mafia in such a great position doing that.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">T2)Open 480 C9++</span></span></span><br>Argues with another player.

Soon calls them a biased townie and votes for some other player).<br>2)\tCalling players scum for agreeing/disagreeing with him as opposed to looking for motivations (doesn\u2019t have a townread on the Fonz despite agreeing with him).<br>3)\tGoing after easy targets (does go after purple but actually stops going after them). <br>4)\tGiving extensive reasoning for agreeing with a vote unprompted. (He did with Fonz\u2019s vote but only when he was challenged). <br>5)\tGetting on the same page as target (this happens with Purple and undermines my townread).  <br>6)\tCovering all his bases. (Check)<br>7)\tPredicting all possible reasons (does so with purple which undermines my townread). <br>8)\tCalling out scumpairs (no occurrence of this so far).<br>Implosion goes after Purple in this post, says that his post was intended to look scummy. Logically argues with Purple. However, he unvotes on Purple and switches to Coyote saying that Purple has confirmation bias. He also barely provides any reasoning for switching to RedCoyote and blatantly bandwagons with Tammy. Has been highly active \u2013 in fact, one of the most active players in the game. While he had provided excuses for inactivity as both affiliations before, activity by itself is pro-town and warrants a townread for most players of average skill. <br>On the other hand, he tells me to bandwagon, votes along with Yabba despite scumreading him, and forgets Yabba later on. However, voting along with Yabba can be explained by a belief that if Purple was scum, Yabba would bus. Town games suggest that Implosion holds such beliefs.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>Your games are some older games, and I think you would have been better served looking at some newer games.  I mean my knowledge of implosion's scum games are like a year old and a recent town game, so I'm not sure what I would suggest.  But I do think that your digging into the meta and going that detailed makes my town read on you stronger. I have some doubts that I think are kind of minor about you, and would involve you going back and reading empire's case and purposefully trying to change certain aspects of that, which I think is not very likely and probably not that important day one anyway.  But as Implosion said as town he tries to just look town, I think that certain things he would have done today he would have done differently as scum."}

See, Tammy, you replaced into that game, and as I recall (I'm looking back over it as I write this ... also Matt was in that game too, I forgot!) you didn't do so until late. By that time I just didn't feel very confident in myself and I <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4322347#p4322347\" class=\"postlink\">even said as such</a>. <br><br>But, yeah, if you want my honest opinion, I recall wanting to snuggle up to you at the end of that game because I was being attacked from all sides from almost everyone except you.

And there were more days of me being active in that scum game you have direct knowledge than of as the town game you referenced.  I replaced into the scum game day three; you weren't lynched until day seven.  The town game that you modded, I was killed night two.<br><br>My problem is that if you were trying to look at my behavior and compare it, you wouldn't only use the town game but also the scum game.  As far as nice-n-fun Tammy being scum, not really, and we should probably stop trying to assess a personality to me as scum or town.  I realize part of it was my fault for reacting to the \"laid back\" as town comment and saying it more fits my scum game because that is actually true.  But the fact of the matter is I play to my mood, and you need way more games with me or the ability to really assess tone to understand where I'm coming from.  If you try to assess personality quirks to my scum or town game, it's not going to work.  I do tend to be far more laid back as scum because I just care less about my scum games than I do my town games.  I hate being scum and find it a chore.  That does not mean that I haven't had a scum game here or there were I've tried my darndest to replicate as much as is possible my town game, but even in my attempt at replication there's a world of difference in my scum/town game to those who are familiar.<br><br>And now I'm rambling and should stop."}

I do that alot though, and I admit it's dumb and a weakness. I'll cool it down.</div></blockquote><br><br>The depth of thought that implosion shows reads by digging into SPB's thought process reads as town. SPB is a null read for now. I didn't have time to check on MattP's meta, I'll do that sometime later. <br><br>@ MattP, as a general suggestion, I recommend you not ignore people or be an ass. It is not going to be helpful. Reads change over the course of a game. If you think somebody is scum and be rude, what happens when you get a stronger scumread and want to convince your initial scumread to vote for your new, stronger scumread? Much better to be polite as far as possible. Rudeness wont get you anywhere.<br><br>I am really conflicted on PurpleLobsta. I want to believe they are scum but if I look at it objectively, it makes no sense for them to antagonize the only person defending them - unless they think that MattP will come to their rescue if they lash out at the guy attacking him. However, they change their mind - again and read me as town which negates any benefit they would get by buddying with MattP. <br><br>I find it hard to buy the \"reaction test.\" I don't believe that a player would ask another for meta to generate reactions because they got <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no</span> reactions initially that they could use. I doubt they expected Fonz to pick up on that and FOS them hard for it.<br><br>I felt that PL's posts looked genuine because their emotions felt very real to me. Even when I thought their logic didn't make sense, they gave off a town-vibe. I am not as sure anymore for a few reasons: first why would they be angry at me FOSsing MattP - they are not the ones that are involved. That makes me think they are faking their emotions. Also, I hadn't thought of this before: hydras have space to vent in their hydra PM so I'd expect them to be less emotional. I know for a fact that I rarely put in any emotions when playing as a hydra because the content has all been hashed out in the hydra PM already.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5129897#p5129897\" class=\"postlink\">post 411</a>, PURPLE LOBSTA wrote:</cite>Town read on F16 due to his reaction to Matt, though I don't explicitly agree with them.

I did feel that Zach was summarizing popular opinions - but then he could just be agreeing with the popular opinions as town. Mirari's pre-replacement post was what struck me as townish. I am starting to doubt my implosion read based on this post. I am going to wait for more content to be posted before I figure it out.<br><br>I am suspicious of Wickedest for still posting about stuff from the first few pages. I don't see the relevance. I think I made it fairly obvious that I don't believe Tammy to be scum and I find it suspicious that he keeps demanding justification for reads that I have changed as opposed to making me justify my current reads for instance - which would be a lot more productive. <br><br>Yabba hasn't done anything to make me think he might be town. Mostly, he has been very passive and useless but the little content that he did provide doesn't look townish either. For instance, my back and forth with MattP, Yabba might as well have shown up to snore. There was no real interaction with the content of any of our posts. And that was the biggest difference I saw between him and others who were online then - like implosion who actually went through the content and tried to gain affiliation depending information from it. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Slumber</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Yabbaguy</span>"}

I feel like I should know though.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br><br>I've been thinking quite a bit about RedCoyote and still can't commit one way or the other. The warm fuzzy feelings I feel from the idea of lynching him have lessened a fair bit though.<br><br>PURPLE LOBSTA is the name that should be between everybody's vote tags right now though. Purple is a really nice colour and all, and the fusion of their eyes in combination with the shape of their head even makes me want to ignore the pincers and attack them with an over-enthusiastic cuddle. However, the pincers do exist and must not be ignored!!!<br><br>I suspect that in Purple Lobsta's case, lying has been much like softclaiming and potato chips in that once they start, they just can't stop! There seems to be a complete lack of anything genuine in their posts.<br><br>Firstly, we have the famous 'asking for Tammy's meta' in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5111455#p5111455\">90</a>. This is slightly scummy and a decent appetizer, but for those wanting the main course, look at Purple Lobsta's next few posts, a couple of which (152 and 155) indicate that Zoid has been looking at the thread. Now, if he was really reaction testing Tammy, as is later claimed, why doesn't he just say so here? The cute lobsta should be feeling so clever that at the mere mention of the reaction test, his response would be something along the lines of 'Oh but it was a reaction test!!! HA!\" As much as it may not sound like it, I am being completely serious. Players tend to be eager to show off their reaction tests after ~the reaction~ and I don't see any reason why Zoid wouldn't explain it when it was mentioned. So, I think it was an excuse for it made up later.<br><br>Next, going over my previous points, I still think that the argument about Fonz's scummy not meaning anything to them (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5116427#p5116427\">179</a>) because they don't know what it's for is fabricated. It's pretty likely from even a newbie's point of view that he's an established player, so I think they're just trying too hard to defend themselves to the point where they have to lie.<br><br>The reason for the read on F-16 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5128267#p5128267\">385</a> does not feel genuine and so I think it was decided beforehand. This is because there is nothing about the reason given that could indicate town more than scum.<br><br>There is other stuff too, but these are the main things that stick out as I read through Purple Lobsta's ISO and my own previous posts. So yeah, I'd love a Purple Lobsta lynch/wagon/whatever happens to be cool these days.<br><br>Also, my second choice right now would probably be Yabba."}

It was made by a townie, and he inadvertently managed to pinpoint both scum in it; they were at the bottom of the list (smitster and maluski_cop). <br><br>In other words, \"we will get information out of X's lynch\" is just a bad way to think about things insofar as it doesn't lead to scum. Obviously this is just one example, but etc. <br><br>Something about DV's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5134258#p5134258\">485</a> feels somewhat slimy. It's a combination of the way that he jokes in it feeling fabricated, his response to Tammy feeling slightly off, and the fact that he gives a second choice at the end feeling like it makes sense for him as scum regardless of PL's alignment (either he's giving himself an \"out\" for when PL flips town, or he's giving himself another option in case not-bussing becomes a better possibility)."}

I can see the scum motivation in trying to get me and Tammy arguing about the first few pages where we each believe we were right. This would be advantageous to the mafia: if townies town-read each other, mafia would have an uphill battle. So, turning the town against each other is essential. <br><br>If Wicked was genuinely interested in figuring out my affiliation, there is plenty of current analysis to go by: for instance why I believe Yabba to be scum, why RedCoyote town, etc. There is just so much motivation to dig into which is actually current and can advance the game forward. <br><br>The dubious town motivation and clear scum motivation for his posts makes me think it is more likely to come from scum."}

What is the motivation for Fonzscum to call your obvRVS vote a serious vote?<br>3) I find it strange that you went from calling three people 'so obviously scum it isn't funny' to voting someone, not among the three, fifty posts later.

The problem is, with a player like MattP, it all boils down to WIFOM. He may act like a jerk specifically because town might think the above and then read him as town. In cases like that, I feel it best to look for effects rather than motivation. If that player is doing something that is hurting the town, I will FOS them and attempt to lynch them. If they are helping the town, that's great. It wouldn't apply to all players but some. MattP, from what I gather makes it a point to be antagonistic on purpose. There is no reason to tolerate the behavior as something scum wouldn't do because he could do it precisely because we would think that. On the other hand, most times that you have antagonized players, I read you as town because it seemed like a spontaneous reaction that you couldn't help yourself with as opposed to something deliberate and planned. <br><br>Elaborate on what you mean by you are not going to play like me?<br><br>____<br><br>Also, Fonz reads as town from his later posts."}

But that's not my argument with regard to Red himself.  There's all the difference in the world between attacking a new/annoying/bad at writing player because they're dropping scum tells, and attacking them solely because they're new etc.  You LITERALLY suggested that ZZZX was scum on the basis of his writing style.  A similar argument applies to wickedestjr.  He attacks Mirari for making a 'weak' argument.  Let's not consider whether it's a weak argument that scum would benefit from making or anything.  Oh no, he's clearly scum because he's bad at logic.  (Also some misrepresentation there: Mirari didn't say he changed his mind on implosion because implosion changed his vote.

Asking me to explain why you're scummy isn't going to convince you to vote for yourself, and it doesn't seem to me that anyone has been convinced by your defences, so I don't have to bother refuting them.  Then again, I'm bored and nothing else new has happened overnight.<br><br>I do not like that instead of responding to my analysis of your behaviour around your yabba vote, you spent multiple pages making a ton of noise about how I was talking about your random SlumberParty vote, which clearly made no sense.  You also misrepresented me as saying you returned to your random stage vote, which I never said.  So for starters, I don't like that.<br><br>Another thing I don't like is how, after admitting I was talking about the yabba vote, you then misrepresent THAT vote.  I actually said \"Don't care that it was unexplained at the time.\"  What bothers me is that when you next posted, it was your boondoggle Tammy meta post.  You didn't mention yabba.  You didn't say 'More Yabba votes!'  You didn't respond to wickedestjr voting Yabba.  You didn't tell anyone that yabba was scummier than their current vote.  And no, you didn't give a reason that anyone else could get behind.  You only explain when pressed on it by others, IE to defend, not to rally support for a Yabba wagon.  Oh sure, you kept him on a 'scumlist'.  Along with the players who'd attacked you, who were of much more concern to you.  Tammy's #184 is a good example of what it looks like when people are trying to get their suspects lynched.<br><br>You claim that your Tammy vote was some kind of reaction test.  Yet, as I note, you drew no inference from it in the thread until yesterday (RL).  After F16 and I had been asking you for days on end what you had learned, and you'd been throwing out these ideas like \"Well maybe it wasn't Tammy's reaction we were after.\"  This smacks of changing your story, because if that had been your reaction all along, why didn't you say that instead of obfuscating?  Who else's reaction did you find noteworthy?  Why, the one guy who voted for you, of course.  And lo and behold, you happened to think the reaction of 'voting for you' fell under 'scummy.'<br><br>I do agree that Implosion calling you not a scum-read is weird given the strength of his push.  But then, he also lists you as the scummiest player in the game.  I'm filing that under 'odd' rather than scummy for now, though.  Maybe he was just getting frustrated with you."}

Way too much posting for a Cop, it's really poor strategy if in fact the claim ends up true.

They're acting weird ever since they've laid the claim down. They're trying to respond to these \"abNormal\" and \"uncreative\" accusations as if they should care - whereas if I were genuinely Cop having to claim, I'd say \"well, I'm Cop, so that's unfortunate because there's nothing more to it\". I'm a different person, but I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation.<br><br>BUT!<br><br>PURPLE LOBSTA could still be useful regardless of alignment. If they're scum, we're still gonna ask them for investigation results. Although Mafia could work on a \"one-behind\" principle and kill any Innocent results, we might still have some utility from using even a fake Cop to point out the less-than-obvious Townreads (or we lynch if we think they're sabotaging the duty at any point). If they're genuinely a Town Cop, then the Mafia now have to grapple with the fact that they're going to be dishing reads out left and right, and then THEY have to off PURPLE LOBSTA or risk the gig being up if they investigate too many players.<br><br>So in summary, I don't believe them, but we may not even have to make up our minds just yet.

The cop role in general is much less inserted into games now than it used to be and Empire strikes me as a creative person.<br><br>2) I'll echo yabba's point in 575. PURPLE pretty much demonstrated how not to play the role of cop. Active, stubborn, aggressive, unreasonable. <br><br>3) Seems convenient, especially considering points 2 and 4. <br><br>4) The slot is still very suspicious, the claim doesn't change that. <br>-The meta reaction test thing is still complete BS. I've been around for a while and I don't think I've ever seen someone get flak for asking for someone's meta. In my experience comments like that are insignificant and never discussed. I seriously doubt that PURPLE actually thought 'well maybe this will help us', considering they made the post in the midst of a long distracting Tammy/Falcon exchange (hmm Tammy and Falcon are getting in a serious argument right now but I think I'll throw in a meta request to get the game into serious mode). If it was a reaction test, then it was the worst reaction test in the history of reaction tests.<br><br>-Their suspicion of Fonz for portraying their obvious random vote as a serious one is one that has not been well thought out. Why would any experienced player, as scum, deliberately exhibit such a blatant and easily refutable misrep? Hint: nobody would. Their half-day focus on Fonz's use of the word 'initial' was a waste of time and imo resembles fake scumhunting.   <br><br>-Suspicion of yabba is just awkward. I'd have to reread to tell you exactly what their reasons are even though they've apparently been suspicious of yabba the entire game. Also worth noting that PURPLE LOBSTA pretty much ignored yabba after voting him- they made no effort to determine his allignment afaics. <br><br>-implosion vote is also bad. <br><br>-In general, a significant percentage of the comments they make feel ingenuine. e.g:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Purple wrote:</cite>I'm perfectly calm.

I get what you are saying here. It's something to be considered. I especially don't like the fact that PL is just a \"cop\" and not an x-shot \"cop\". That being said, this is Empire's first forum mafia game, as far as I know, so we're really just speculating here. I don't particularly like plain cop roles either, but I have used them before. On a game that Vi helped me review no less (just like this game and Vi is notorious for not liking cops).<br><br>So, in the end, I say it's a moot point unless you can show me creditable proof to back this up.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>yabba 575 wrote:</cite>1. Way too much posting for a Cop, it's really poor strategy if in fact the claim ends up true. They've been so frequent and verbose in their posts that I had them on a Vanilla-or-Mafia read, because posting a lot tends to land you into the obvTown or obvscum categories way too quickly - which tends to lead to your death; bad news for a PR.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed, but my counterpoint is to consider PL's experience. Would they be aware of this? Maybe they say to themselves \"okay, we're a powerful PR, that means we need to really influence this town\"? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>yabba 575 wrote:</cite>2. They're acting weird ever since they've laid the claim down. They're trying to respond to these \"abNormal\" and \"uncreative\" accusations as if they should care - whereas if I were genuinely Cop having to claim, I'd say \"well, I'm Cop, so that's unfortunate because there's nothing more to it\".</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, playing devil's advocate, but are they just trying to save their skin? Additionally, implosion is their number one scumread, so they have a vested interest in debating every point he makes anyway.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion 577 wrote:</cite>Ostensibly, it's a risk vs reward situation; lynching PL is higher risk.

There's going to be no new information from PL. What are you waiting for to make your decision? <br><br>Even if I grant you the initial kneejerk reaction of, \"okay, hmmm, cop claim, not sure if I believe or not, let me think for now... could go either way\", by the time you made this post, you should've made your mind up. I'm not saying that you should pick something and stick with it for life, but you should've definitively stated by the time you made this post that you are either inclined to agree with them or inclined to lynch them. I am just so tired of your inability to stand on your own two feet. This is just yet another example, and probably the most telling one yet.<br><br>---<br><br>Okay, I must admit that I am really agreeable towards <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5142082#p5142082\" class=\"postlink\">post 582</a>.

To paint the case against you as weaker than it was?   Your argument implies that you wouldn't misrepresent me because it wasn't relevant to your scumhunting, but I don't think what you were doing there was scumhunting at all.

I think it's silly to get hung up on one word over the sentence as a whole making sense, and it frustrated the hell out of me that you kept pushing this once it was pointed out to you.

You get to explain away any inconsistency between beliefs and actions by stating they were made by different heads.  And your implosion vote doesn't feel like genuine scumhunting to me. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wasn't interested in getting Yabba lynched at that point, it was too early in the game.

You try to get other people to vote them, and put them under as much pressure as possible. But this part of the discussion seems likely to turn into a game theory cul-de-sac I'd rather avoid.  <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You claim that your Tammy vote was some kind of reaction test.  Yet, as I note, you drew no inference from it in the thread until yesterday (RL).  After F16 and I had been asking you for days on end what you had learned, and you'd been throwing out these ideas like \"Well maybe it wasn't Tammy's reaction we were after.\"  This smacks of changing your story, because if that had been your reaction all along, why didn't you say that instead of obfuscating?  Who else's reaction did you find noteworthy?  Why, the one guy who voted for you, of course.  And lo and behold, you happened to think the reaction of 'voting for you' fell under 'scummy.'</div></blockquote><br>No, our vote on Tammy was not a reaction test, but what was was Zoid asking Tammy for her Meta. This is actually the question Zoid has to answer, and I agree that I'm not exactly happy with the answer he has given in thread. What I did though, was give a jist of what he really thought. He has those reactions, and what it means and to him though there are quite a few that he doesn't really know what to do with just yet. This point isn't something that I can really answer[/quote]<br><br>Yeah, please don't harp on my misstatement here.  I didn't mean vote.  I was clearly referring to the Tammy meta question.  And yes, Zoid's answers aren't satisfactory.  That's what makes me think 'scum.'<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I do agree that Implosion calling you not a scum-read is weird given the strength of his push.  But then, he also lists you as the scummiest player in the game.  I'm filing that under 'odd' rather than scummy for now, though.  Maybe he was just getting frustrated with you.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>isn't it similar to what you called us out on?</div></blockquote><br><br>How?  I don't see it.</div></div></div><br><br>So, thoughts.  I'm conflicted on the claim.<br><br>1.  Some of their play makes much more sense for PR than Vanilla.  I don't buy the 'overposting' argument AT ALL.  How much people post should have little relation to which (town) role they have.  Making a noticeable change to your posting rate as PR is obviously a bad idea.  The Lobsta's play has been very omgussy, and I've seen that kind of paranoia from town PRs who aren't particularly great players before - they get into this mindset where anyone who attacks them is scum trying to out them.<br>2.  That said, not a word of my case against them is retracted.<br>3.  I don't like the 9/10 argument.  Small sample sizes ftl (ten games is what, less than a month's worth of games?).  As Deas notes, if mods are getting 'creative' than any given role is going to be unlikely, plus there's only so many roles available to normal mods.  Or maybe Empire decided to zig where others zag.  That a role has been claimed is evidence that it is more likely to exist than your priors might suggest (Bayesian conspiracy ftw).  Though I also dislike the Lobsta trying to bring in 'why would we claim that' WIFOM.<br>4.  The value of a town cop is greater than that of a scumbag who now is forced to target players in keeping with his 'suspicions.'  Plus, we may have other ways to prove they're lying.<br><br>I think I'm willing to give them one night.  If they come up with something really scumvenient, I'll hop back on the wagon.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: wickedestjr</span>  He's my top suspect other than PL, I don't really want to lynch RC any more, and no-one else has &gt;1 vote.   His recent posts have seemed kinda scummy, he's lurkish, and if PL is somehow town, he looks like a good bet for scum on the wagon.  Library is closing now and I don't have time for a full case or to re-read anyone else.  I do suggest those proposing alternative lynches vote ASAP so we can see who's viable."}

I don't want to lynch RC. The problem is that I also don't want to lynch yabba, or wicked. The only person with any other votes that I'd accept a lynch on at this juncture is ZZZX. And I vastly prefer a PL lynch.<br><br>Fonz: Yes, 10 may be a small sample size, but it also means that those games are the most recent, and therefore the most relevant; the issue is, if Empire as a moderator had the idea to \"zig where others zag\" I don't think the first thought would be to put in a cop. I think the first thought would be to do something else that's more interesting. I used to be of the opinion that it's universally better to wait on PR claims, but I've recently changed my view on that (see Maxous's lynch in HxHxMafia). At this point, I am much, much more confident that PL is scum than I am of anyone else in the game. I could be wrong, yes, but I really don't think I am. I just feel like them being scum explains the gamestate much better than them being town does. <br><br>Also, another thing comes to mind: PL (and I'm sure they know this if they're scum, as a pre-emptive response to 'stop giving scum advice, implosion') can just claim roleblocked if they are scum. Even if they're town, they damn well could just wind up roleblocked for the rest of the game. I know setups with cops are much more likely to have a roleblocker to balance them (zoidberg's game appears to be an exception to this rule, as it had only one other town PR in a jailkeeper). <br><br>People may use the above as a way to say \"well, lets just leave them alive for a day to see if they claim roleblocked, what harm could there be...\" Well, there's first off the harm that we'll be rushing a different lynch, and second off the harm that if they are a scum power role that they can act tonight."}

Not gonna happen.  There are no words to describe how exhausted I am after moving more than half my apartment halfway across the state to get ready for my cross country move in a couple weeks followed by a going away party and trek back home /whining.<br><br>If I wake up early enough in the morning, I will get to this before work, if not I definitely will when I get home from work tomorrow night.<br><br>Still though please don't lynch until I have a chance to get caught up from the last couple days.  I doubt I'll get targetted for a kill, as there are better people to target and I never get targetted here night one, but still please don't lynch.  I'll be around and won't let the game go to no lynch, just don't get itchy please.<br><br>I'm going to ramble about some of my current thoughts until I can't stay awake any longer:<br><br>I am having current doubts about red coyote being scum, but I keep feeling like I did in the wire when I was convinced that Jason was scum and pushed for it, but then the majority of the game decided he was town and I second guessed myself only to lurker lynch him on day five and have him flip scum.  He still doesn't feel right.  He's saying all the right things, but still doesn't feel right to me.  But if he is town, this is going to be empires message to me after the game...\"red coyote was obvtown day one FYI\".  I'm not going to keep pushing it today with all the pushback from people, but I swear to iomedae if he ever flips scum you better plug your ears because the \"I told you so\" will be heard around the world.<br><br>Mm - I have serious doubts about your claim that every game you've been in has had a cop.  Open 501 didn't nor did nightless.  I was going to look through your games to see how accurate your statement is, but exhaustion trumps that.  I did like you mentioning that ou normally don't care though, I was looking for something along those lines.  Oh yeah, you said that my post where I told zoid to look for himself rang townish because of lack of being compliant, but what do you make of me saying I would have responded that way even as scum?  Also, you just got done playing in a game with me where I was scum where I don't know that I would be classified as compliant.  (I know you qualified that as especially early game, but I'm still interested in your take)<br><br>I still don't like RC's original jump on pl, but can't remember why.<br><br>I didn't like the claim stalling but I don't know what to make of that.<br><br>I need to read through wickets case on pl, but I'm more of the mind that you don't lynch a claimed power role day one if there's some reason to believe it, and I tend to be very suspect of claims at l-1 and the past few games I've been in/read mafia has fake claimed cop day one.  I feel like with as much as I talk to empire/hydra with him that I would have a better idea of what roles he would typically put in a game, but I don't.  And I'm not about to outguess the mod on what I think he might or might not put in the game as that has just ended badly almost every time I've seen someone do that.  <br><br>Oh yeah mm cops are not needed to win games, games can be won on day play alone.  I understand the points brought up about role locking and liens about it.  I've as a scum roleblocker blocked the tracker every single night until endgame.  Then as scum once I claimed to be roleblocked every single night and somehow was believed.  I don't know I'm kinda of the mind that this discussion should be tabled until tomorrow.  I'll read through wickets case and everyone else's thoughts tomorrow though and see if I can make sense of it with a working brain.<br><br>I didn't know that Sottyrulez was v/la this weekend, but still his contribution is meh, and I am still concerned about a bus on rc if he is scum.  Zach said he would catch up and contribute Friday morning but never posted again.  Zach doesn't really like being scum and tends to lurk and be less engaged, and his replace into this game is far more reminiscent of his replace into castle zar where he was scum than it is yoloville where he was town.  Juries still out on that and I guess we'll see what he brings tomorrow.<br><br>Have a town read on implosion and falcon still.<br><br>Think that fonz sounds good and reasonable for the most part.  I think he's town but worry he's scum.  I feel the same way about the party bois.<br><br>Yabba is suspicious.  Dgb said in a game once that she advised her partner to write out his posts and then rearrange the sentences so his posts wouldn't make sense, and that way people wouldn't read them and would leave him alone.  That's the vibe I get from some of his posts because I have no idea what he's trying to say.  I don't agree with him that people shouldn't give out their town reads unasked.  Some people just do it, and like implosion said scum are smart enough to know who the obvtownn are.<br><br>I'm suspicious of deasvail but can't remember why.  I'll try to work that out tomorrow.<br><br>Okay I think that's all the things I was tossing around during my drive home today and I'm going to hopefully pass out now."}

But I thought I'd defend myself from those of you finding me suspicious and possibly thinking I might be a feasible lynch since there are lurking suspicions and LOBSTA's less-than-believable claim is threatening to divert the bandwagon onto me.<br><br>Let's review people's cases on me:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>F-16, Post 448 wrote:</cite>Yabba hasn't done anything to make me think he might be town. Mostly, he has been very passive and useless but the little content that he did provide doesn't look townish either. For instance, my back and forth with MattP, Yabba might as well have shown up to snore. There was no real interaction with the content of any of our posts. And that was the biggest difference I saw between him and others who were online then - like implosion who actually went through the content and tried to gain affiliation depending information from it. </div></blockquote><br><br>Note that F-16 is likely Town, but he's tinting his lens by suggesting that I have to play the game the way he does. If I'm playing a bad game, so be it, and to be frank I am cross with myself for constantly running into brick walls with my votes to start this Day out. But that just means I'm guilty of a bad game.<br><br>Why I needed to weigh in on their conversation is beyond me, if F-16 finds it fascinating, congratulations, but I don't. It's a silly point.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>F-16, Post 549 wrote:</cite>Just look at Yabba's ISO starting from post 100 (ISO #5). It's full of scum. For instance 281, he votes pandashnoo for a completely null tell. There is absolutely no reason why town wouldn't say that they would meta-read someone. It is similar to saying \"I'll ISO this player and come to a decision.\" Yet Yabba makes it out to be scumtell. <br><br>His 370 by itself isn't terrible. When you compare it to 281, it is inconsistent. He tells me \"There are Town who will say \"voting me is obvscum, thanks\" and mean it in jest. I'm saying it's null for Matt to do that.\" However, he doesn't wonder whether Pandashnoo is town and is simply saying that she will meta players because she wants to do so.</div></blockquote><br><br>I've gone over this point already, explaining that I thought the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">way</span> that she was announcing her intentions sounded scummy to me. Again, weak read, but not null when I said it because I thought it was her pretending to scumhunt instead of actually scumhunting. There was a difference, there was no inconsistency, simple as that. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5142208#p5142208\" class=\"postlink\">post 585</a>, F-16_Fighting_Falcon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5123170#p5123170\" class=\"postlink\">post 281</a>, yabbaguy wrote:</cite>The more important objective for me is to get someone lynched where it's most informative one way or another. pandashnoo flipping scum would almost assuredly clear RedCoyote given the way they slinked onto the wagon:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I am therefore going to vote RC to move us possibly closer to lynching scum</div></blockquote><br><br>Also might shed light on that implosion read which was weak for them and seems to be a controversial one for everyone, and anyone else who might hop on this bandwagon in case they're Town.

I could vote there.  The only thing holding me back is moraris replace out post, but I think this slot has a really good chance to flip scum.  Regardless, on the off chance I don't make it through the night, look at zach's posting.  From what I understand sotty is good at scum, but zach tends to lurk.  If he's doing the majority of the posting and is engaged, they have a decent chance at being town, if not, they have a decent chance at being scum.<br><br>I don't like that DV commented on me not remembering why I was suspicious of him and didn't actually engage with me about what I said about zach's replace in.  Dv was in both of the games I referenced, and was scum in both, and partnered with zach in one.  His feedback would have been nice.<br><br>DV is suspicious to me mostly because he just feels staged.  Like his posts are designed to be \"look at how town I am!\"  Rather than be his town self.  He just seems too sure of himself.  I'm not the greatest reader of DV and usually have empire to bounce my thoughts off of regarding DV so I don't feel super confident in myself here, but I don't think he's town.<br><br>I am suspicious of the lobster but I don't think they're a good lynch today.  I don't know how much of the issue is actual playstyle and how much is scum.  I think that they both are easy lynches in games I've read and tend to arouse suspicion.  Although Mara was decidedly more protown and easier to read as town in open 501 as pinksmoke, but as I was scum there that's harder for me to tell.  I do know I was able to twist some of what she said to make her look scummy pretty easily though.  I'm also stuck on the downgrading of the town read on me based on just being fooled by me.  I don't know what to think of them opposing the rc wagon as it would be their most  viable though.  I thnk that superficially looks townish, but ive been fooled by scum taking that tactic before so.  I don't know, they overall look pretty scummy and I won't cry if they're lynched, but I also don't think it would hurt us to wait a day.  But if we do lynch and they flip scum, don't discount sottyrulez as a partner bussing right now.<br><br>I don't get RC's super town read on wicked or the reasoning, and I'm going to hate myself for saying it, but its part of my lingering suspicion of him.  (And I hate myself for saying that because of the flak I've taken over townreads sometimes as that's what I work more from.). I think wicked looks okay, but the reasoning rc gave for town reading him so strongly is on stuff that can easily be faked, so my tinfoil hat was he's picking an unpopular read to promote.  I think the thing that I felt best about was him actually looking at the last ten games, though I don't agree that just because they're not there they are likely to not be here.<br><br>I like yabbas recent posting and don't necessarily buy the meta information from falcon about how he recently didn't defend from a day one lynch.  But I do find it interesting that yabba didn't respond or comment on that.  I'd have to see how yabba reacted in more than one game though to see if its a thing.<br><br>I think that's about all I wanted to say."}

I think I'm pretty keen to engage and look pro-town when I am scum.<br><br>There's nothing I can say about the staged part except that I'm town, but I've been trying to improve my town play and be (or at least appear) more confident in recent games. I feel like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=27393\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1445</a> could be an example of this, as I was trying to do the same there with my scumread on Bacde, and you probably know that people have commented on my lack of confidence and meekness many times, so I hope it would make sense that I'd try to change this.<br>You also know from YOLOville that I'm comfortable replicating the lack of confidence as scum.<br><br>I don't appreciate people using my unvote of Lobsta against me because I think the stance I took is pretty reasonable.<br><br>And for those of you who are just loving my self-analysis, I've got more!! <a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/50/H/ULwcM2WS5Wv\" class=\"postlink\">This</a> is the mafia QT to a marathon game (during the most recent period) where I bussed one of my buddies and they got really angry with me. I think anyone that knows me reasonably well would know that I probably wouldn't bus a buddy so hard here after that. (I was one of the few voting for PL for a while and up until their cop claim I've been consistently calling them scum). And I really think Purple Lobsta is likely to be scum, so if I am lynched please don't think they're town without good reason.<br><br>I'm not really in a position to choose, who, if anyone gets to be the lynch instead of me, but I don't like RedCoyote's decision to pursue me after deciding that Purple Lobsta was likely enough scum (following wicked's argument) to risk lynching a town cop, which is a really powerful role. So *hint *hint I guess.<br><br>Other stuff is that I don't trust the Bois at all, I feel that their (well kanye's) attitude to the game the last few days has been surprisingly lackluster and I also don't think Implosion is as town as I did, but they may still be a weak townread."}

I think a lot of their play is scummy but there are those tiny things I've mentioned that make me doubt, but not enough to try to save them.

But if you, rc, and yabba are town, then I've gone wrong somewhere on people I've considered town or haven't paid much attention to and need to figure that out.  But that's just par for the day one course for me.  (I still don't feel good about rc though.)<br><br>I do think that panda sounds like overwhelmed town, but its frustrating how little she does.  Zzzx does sound like newbtown but doesn't give enough to feel confident one way or the other, and is super frustrating how little input he gives on the larger wagons.<br><br>I thought that if the people that I seem to have been wrong about on being suspicious aren't then maybe I was wrong about implosion being town.  I read through aia today, as falcons games for meta were rather old, and I replaced into that game so it's a meta I feel better about, and meh I don't know.  I guess I saw some reasoning to doubt myself on that versus some of the recent town games I've had with him but then he posted 728 and that sounds so genuine and just as frustrated as I feel and I'm back to feeling good about implosion.<br><br>I read through empires meta case on falcon from dv's game, and unless he read that and made sure to really change some of his meta, I still think he's town.  He's probably the town read I feel best about.  His meta research on implosion just was so detailed, and not what I would expect from scum.  I mean I meat when I'm scum too sometimes to look town, but the level of detail in that suggests more of a town read than scum.  And he really had no reason to change his earlier implosion scum read to town based on his meta research is he was scum.  The only reason why I could see that if he were scum were if they were partners and he was trying to make it look like they weren't.  I don't believe this though, and think it would just have been easier for him to continue his implosion scum read especially when several people started calling him suspicious as well.<br><br>I think what that leaves me with is fonz and the boiz.  They're both people that I want to think are town, but I have a nagging feeling in the back of my head that is eating at me.<br><br>Oh wait there's still sottyrulez.  I still don't feel good about them."}

I don't want to lynch RC. The problem is that I also don't want to lynch yabba, or wicked. The only person with any other votes that I'd accept a lynch on at this juncture is ZZZX. And I vastly prefer a PL lynch.<br><br>Fonz: Yes, 10 may be a small sample size, but it also means that those games are the most recent, and therefore the most relevant; the issue is, if Empire as a moderator had the idea to \"zig where others zag\" I don't think the first thought would be to put in a cop. I think the first thought would be to do something else that's more interesting. I used to be of the opinion that it's universally better to wait on PR claims, but I've recently changed my view on that (see Maxous's lynch in HxHxMafia). At this point, I am much, much more confident that PL is scum than I am of anyone else in the game. I could be wrong, yes, but I really don't think I am. I just feel like them being scum explains the gamestate much better than them being town does. <br><br>Also, another thing comes to mind: PL (and I'm sure they know this if they're scum, as a pre-emptive response to 'stop giving scum advice, implosion') can just claim roleblocked if they are scum. Even if they're town, they damn well could just wind up roleblocked for the rest of the game. I know setups with cops are much more likely to have a roleblocker to balance them (zoidberg's game appears to be an exception to this rule, as it had only one other town PR in a jailkeeper). <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">People may use the above as a way to say \"well, lets just leave them alive for a day to see if they claim roleblocked, what harm could there be...\" Well, there's first off the harm that we'll be rushing a different lynch, and second off the harm that if they are a scum power role that they can act tonight.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Also importantly absent from this post is a willingness to lynch Deasvail at that point, which goes further toward indicating that the read came out of convenience."}

Why are you afraid of the label?  It's an accurate description of your actions.<br>Also, evasiveness is obviously beneficial to scum (they are trying to hide their true thought process) and harmful to town (who should want their actions to be transparent, some edge cases involving PRs aside).  It might be explained away by meta, but it IS prima facie suspicious.  I'd also quite like to know why one member of a hydra being away is a good excuse for dissonance, when it seems like the opposite (if only one head is playing, it should function like a single player).<br><br>Anyway, I think the bois case is stronger than you're giving it credit for.  It's not scummy for them to assert their town-ness or to have some fluff, if it's in combination with some good scumhunting.  I can live with them being annoying, that's probably just playstyle.  But they've made pretty much zero impact on the game, they almost totally ignored the LOBSTA wagon.  Like, seriously.  Look for anything they say in relation to it.  They call you (Implosion) out for your tone in responding to Ms M saying she didn't want to claim, and push the DV counterwagon.  <br><br>Also, the fake accusations.  It is possible ZZZX's entire mafia-playing career to this point was a setup so that we'd mistake him for a town derp in this game, but it's REALLY, REALLY fucking unlikely.  You know what looks much more fake?  ZZZX is not THAT hard to spell.  Three Zs and and X.  They've spelt it Zyxxy, Zoxyx, Zyzzy.  Despite getting it right the first time they mention him.  That looks like they're deliberately trying to create a 'don't give a shit' vibe around themselves in order to look like lazy town.  Also, their response to ZZZX's townslip reads like a scum who is afraid of too many players becoming obvtown because they'll run out of mislynches. <br><br>So... currently going after obvtown newbie with contrived 'faking' case, and pushed the counterwagon without being willing to directly defend PL.  Yeah, that's plenty for a wagon.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: SlumberPartyBois</span><br><br>My suspicion of Wicked has abated somewhat given the Lobsta scum flip.  Still don't like the 'list five players as scum with no analysis and no differentiation between the scumminess of those players,' but obviously once the 'nefarious plot to get rid of powerful town PR' explanation is disproved, then 'good-faith effort to work out how likely a cop is, but doing it wrong' is the most likely scenario by far in terms of his tortured statistics.<br><br>Panda, like... if it weren't for other people suspecting her, I wouldn't remember she's in the game.  The only post I can really recall is the one when she got annoyed at being misgendered (which is fair enough, but shouldn't be the most memorable thing anyone's done).<br><br>On Sottyrulez... had Mirari as town, liked their last post (wish they'd quote less, though).  They became more active at the end of yesterday and early on today.  I think I'm going to file the earlier prod-dodging off as being busy.  Fits with Zach feelings the need to bring Sotty into the game.<br><br>I haven't got a fucking clue with Yabba.  He just... feels dishonest.  But I seem to recall getting a similar vibe last time we played together (do you remember that, Yabba?  Came down to endgame, we voted each other, the other guy was the scum)."}

I was rereading through zach's iOS in mafia raptured to refresh my memory on how he reacted to tierce suspecting him and me starting to doubt my town read on him in that game, because it seemed odd to me that he didn't address me about it and I came across his suspicion of Matt in that game.

I would've felt much better about that slot had she not made that post. SBP holding on to the DV wagon isn't great, but he wasn't really around when it swung back to PL. Of the living people who weren't on that wagon, panda probably is the most conspicuous.<br><br>Where would the scum have gotten on?

Now, look, I know this is hypocritical of me to attack yabba on. yabba, you get to use that against me. I have no defense of jumping off PL when I did. I did so because I really, really dislike lynching claimed PRs on D1 and I was greatly torn about it. It's quite possible that yabba was thinking the same things, but I have reason to doubt him. He was seemingly pretty intent on getting PL lynched post-claim. He goes through Wicked's post and rebuts his points and gives PL the scum stamp of approval in the read list.<br><br>With sotty, I don't like the passivity. I haven't like it since they started playing, and their vote on PL is just lacking of character. That the claim doesn't have anything to do with their read of PL is disconcerting. Why not? Why not address those that may be concerned with the claim?

I said that your misspelling looked much more likely to be fake than ZZZX's behaviour, you know the stuff that is completely consistent with how he acted in the other site meta he gave us?

There is obvious scum motive in refusing to accept the validity of a strong towntell when it looks like you might well need to mislynch that player to win. <br><br>How about you address the actual substance of the case, IE that you appeared to go out of your way to avoid saying pretty much anything about PL while pushing the Red Coyote and then Deas Vail wagons which were the alternatives to it?  And that your case on ZZZX fucking blows?<br><br>Everyone else should note the similarities between this response and PL's attempts to turn my case into an argument about which post I meant.  Their spelling is a really minor point (if anyone here's fake, it's them) used to highlight a much bigger and more important point (accusing ZZZX of being fake is really bad and scummy).  They're focusing on a small detail that they think they can use to make me look stupid, rather than engaging with the substance of the case.<br>______________________________________________________________________________________<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Implosion:</span> So your defence of the Bois feels very meta.  It seems to me that you're essentially saying that their tone and the arguments they're using sound like the sort of things they'd do as town.  To me, this seems to miss the point: no half-decent scum player will adopt a completely different tone or use totally different arguments than as town.  Hence, I don't really give two shits about their tone, even if it does sound kinda forced to me.  If they'd declared themselves SUPA-town while wagoning the fuck out of PL, they'd be a town read.  But they didn't.  <br><br>I guess what I'm saying is: what have they done that you think they'd have difficulty faking as scum?  I will meta them myself as well, but probably don't have time tonight."}

FTR, when i said dissonance, i meant hydra dissonance. You're listing all of these very broad, generic scumtells without considering context. In fact, for both rolefishing and fluffposting, you admit that they aren't necessarily scummy; saying that they're anti-town at best means that they are not necessarily scummy in all instances. That is, there can be instances where they're merely antitown instead of scummy.

I like how she goes back and forth on some of her thoughts/accusations. It reads as genuine and I think it'd be a lot of unneccessary effort for her if she's scum. I especially like how she is uncertain in her Fonz read- it would be really easy to just read him as town because he heavily attacked PL.    <br><br>implosion town read is almost just as strong. I've read/played in two of his past games, one where he was scum and one where he was town, and I think there's a significant distinction between his scum and town play. His play here resembles what I recall to be his town meta. Sure, he could have a good understanding of his meta and know how to fake it, but I don't get that impression. He's been very active and really put himself 'out there' in a way that I doubt scum would. It's a little strange how cautious he has been with his reads, but it doesn't appear to me like he actually cares what people think about him. Finally, I'm... inclined to say that Purple vs. implosion wasn't bussing. <br><br>RedCoyote town read is mostly gut. A lot of the comments he made seem to have a town mindset behind them. Maybe I'm biased, but I also don't see the scum motivation for him to town read me so strongly either. Some players seem to think his back and forth on PL near the end of yesterday was a town tell, but it is actually the one thing giving me doubts about him. Part of me says it was just for show, especially considering I can't remember him being so open with his thoughts on any other occasions (I'll have to check later). <br><br>DeasVail's play here seems different from #YOLOville where he was scum in that I've actually gotten the impression that he is trying to get scum lynched here. He's paying attention, seems to believe in his reads, and he's made some good points. My only issue (and the reason why he's in 'leaning town' rather than 'probably town') is that sometimes I feel that he's trying to appear pro-town. <br><br>Originally I thought pandashnoo was town for her 'replace out' suggestion, but I've come to realize that this is the only reason why I townread the slot. DeasVail raised a good point in 688 and there could very easily be another explanation I'm not seeing for pandashnooscum. I probably need to reread the slot, think it over some more, or wait for something from Nacho before I can really tell for sure.  <br><br>The Fonz was in my bottom five yesterday mostly due to POE. I hadn't seen anything from him that I thought he couldn't have faked as scum. Even the PL scumflip doesn't have me convinced- I could very easily envision a scenario where Fonz bussed PL- it might partially explain PL's irritating stubbornness. I do, however, really like his attack on SlumberPartyBois, so he's almost leaning town. <br><br>I still think Mirari's vote for Fonz was off, but post 421 was not what I was expecting from Mirariscum. I agree that 421 was townish. Zach's now replaced in and I actually think his accusations towards SlumberPartyBois somewhat resemble genuine interest in determining who scum are. <br>  <br>I explained why I suspected yabbaguy yesterday and the reasoning hasn't changed. New thought; there was almost definitely a scum on the PL lynch bandwagon yesterday and yabbaguy is the most likely to be it. <br><br>SlumberPartyBois has shown significantly more interest in appearing town than hunting scum. I like Fonz's point that they are trying to create a 'don't give a shit' vibe- worth noting that kanye's posting style improved slightly, after Fonz pointed that out. Secondly, they keep calling their selves obvtown.

He gives no reason for preferring the RC vote in this post. Note also that he decided to change his vote but still didn't vote PL.

He does make it clear that he is suspicious of PL though- it feels like preparation for a PL lynch. <br><br>The second post from ZZZX that I dislike is the post which several players view as the 'townslip'.

It started right from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112522#p5112522\">96</a> (with no votes on Purple Lobsta) and continued right until the end of the day. I know there was a period during the day where I was the only one other than The Fonz that was interested in lynching Purple Lobsta, so it would make much more sense for Fonz as scum to be open to not lynching Purple Lobsta in a situation like that. Also, the fact that I completely agreed with The Fonz and was similarly consistent with my Purple Lobsta scumread makes it quite plausible. So, I'm not too worried about him having such a persistent scumread only because he was bussing.<br><br>If someone knows of The Fonz being a super keen busser, then let me know and I probably won't consider this as a towntell anymore.<br><br>I think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5120457#p5120457\">238</a> is a pretty town post. I get the sense that he is really trying to convince others that Purple Lobsta is scum. There is more reasoning than is necessary, everything is clearly explained and the points are good. Scum are less likely to care so much about convincing the town of their read. The fact that it's about Purple Lobsta elevates it from slightly town to very town.<br><br>The worst thing I can find about him is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5145755#p5145755\">648</a> where he acknowledges that Wicked would look better with Lobsta Scum. I felt that we shared very similar opinions on Purple Lobsta and their claim and if I thought someone was more likely to be town with Lobsta Scum, then I probably would have been less interested in lynching them. Even when I took my vote off Purple Lobsta, I still thought it was very likely they were scum, and I think The Fonz should have as well. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5165466#p5165466\">770</a> supports this point.<br><br>Despite this, and the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Fonz's post toward the end of Day 1 either, most of his posting I find to be pretty town and the points that I made are pretty big for me. I hadn't realised the bad things before now though.<br><br>~~<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5172700#p5172700\">805</a> is pretty alarming to me.

I just don't see it that way. You've got good company on the wagon though. <br><br>Everyone is saying a lot. We're going in too many different directions, but I don't want to encourage either the ZZZX or SBP wagons. Frankly, I don't want them lynched. Wicked, DV is right. ZZZX has offsite meta of acting this way pretty evenly. I really don't think he's playing a card here. Your pointing out post 586 is good though. The fact that ZZZX was never on PL is not something that is in his favor. Do you think his vote of F-16 was concocted? It really looks genuine to me. If it was faked, did someone advise him to do it (suggesting a scum mastermind that I don't think anyone here is really capable of... maybe Fonz, but Fonz is super town), or did he come up with it on the fly? No, man, ZZZX is town. <br><br>What's the other alternative? Nacho? Man, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel to vote Nacho on the back of, let's face it, one or two bad posts from panda. The \"I would've hammered\" is slimy, but there's no pattern of slime. If anything it fits her pattern of being a day late and a dollar short. Additionally, I liked at least one of her posts that I pointed out earlier. Nacho deserves a chance to build that slot from scratch. That's a neutral read for me. Good balances with the bad. <br><br>Don't get me wrong, sotty is a solid lynch today. I just would like to push an alternative. I don't support any of the three others on the table right now. I'm going to ask again for more support on yabba at this time. In your weighing of yabba's guilt or innocence, ask yourself three questions: 1) If you could pick one scum bussing PL yesterday, who was it? 2) Without going back and looking through the game, what's something memorable you would say about yabba's activity this game? 3) Who is the most likely person to have killed F-16?"}

I just don't see it that way. You've got good company on the wagon though. <br><br>Everyone is saying a lot. We're going in too many different directions, but I don't want to encourage either the ZZZX or SBP wagons. Frankly, I don't want them lynched. Wicked, DV is right. ZZZX has offsite meta of acting this way pretty evenly. I really don't think he's playing a card here. Your pointing out post 586 is good though. The fact that ZZZX was never on PL is not something that is in his favor. Do you think his vote of F-16 was concocted? It really looks genuine to me. If it was faked, did someone advise him to do it (suggesting a scum mastermind that I don't think anyone here is really capable of... maybe Fonz, but Fonz is super town), or did he come up with it on the fly? No, man, ZZZX is town. <br><br>What's the other alternative? Nacho? Man, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel to vote Nacho on the back of, let's face it, one or two bad posts from panda. The \"I would've hammered\" is slimy, but there's no pattern of slime. If anything it fits her pattern of being a day late and a dollar short. Additionally, I liked at least one of her posts that I pointed out earlier. Nacho deserves a chance to build that slot from scratch. That's a neutral read for me. Good balances with the bad. <br><br>Don't get me wrong, sotty is a solid lynch today. I just would like to push an alternative. I don't support any of the three others on the table right now. I'm going to ask again for more support on yabba at this time. In your weighing of yabba's guilt or innocence, ask yourself three questions: 1) If you could pick one scum bussing PL yesterday, who was it? 2) Without going back and looking through the game, what's something memorable you would say about yabba's activity this game? 3) Who is the most likely person to have killed F-16?</div></blockquote><br><br><br>PLEASE PROMISE ME TO READ MY WHOLE POST<br>MY POST WHAT ABOUT IMP BUDDYING TAMMY AND NOT SBP<br>ALSO I SAID IT IS NOT NECESSARLY A SCUM TELL <br><br>PLEASE READ MY WHOLE POST K TY<br><br>pheeew i dont like it when people have wrong assuming about my posts"}

Pretending the 'look fake' point is a major part of the accusations against them when it's a sub-point of 'their ZZZX push is scummy' (EVEN IF ZZZX is projecting a persona, a) he does is consistently across all games therefore it's equivalent to voting Fate for having capsrage and b) they look to me to be doing the same thing thus it's hypocritical) which is in itself a less important point than their behaviour around PL.  So you're taking something minor, making out it's something it isn't, and giving what is a REALLY FUCKING VAGUE defence of the major allegation (think it can be explained by how they look at a game).  I want to know how you think they look at a game, how you think you know that, and how you think that relates specifically to their behaviour around the Red, Deas, and PL wagons.  That's the information that might make me see them in a different light.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5175697#p5175697\" class=\"postlink\">post 840</a>, DeasVail wrote:</cite><span style=\"font-style: italic\">The Fonz Townread:</span><br><br>The worst thing I can find about him is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5145755#p5145755\">648</a> where he acknowledges that Wicked would look better with Lobsta Scum. I felt that we shared very similar opinions on Purple Lobsta and their claim and if I thought someone was more likely to be town with Lobsta Scum, then I probably would have been less interested in lynching them. Even when I took my vote off Purple Lobsta, I still thought it was very likely they were scum, and I think The Fonz should have as well. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5165466#p5165466\">770</a> supports this point.<br><br>Despite this, and the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Fonz's post toward the end of Day 1 either, most of his posting I find to be pretty town and the points that I made are pretty big for me.

I *DO* find them more town now that Lobsta is dead scum.  It's perfectly plausible for two players to be highly scummy in incompatible ways.  If I'm confident enough in Lobsta scum for it to have the bearing you think it should on my other reads, then the correct move is the lobsta vote.  If I'm not, then I vote the next scummiest.  It seemed really really unlikely to me that neither was scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5177548#p5177548\" class=\"postlink\">post 857</a>, Tammy wrote:</cite>Fonz - how did you know that zzzxy wasn't a native speaker?</div></blockquote><br><br>Someone mentione it in the signup thread.

Please explain; <br>1) How was asking for meta from Tammy supposed to generate reactions? You were asked this question already but seemed to avoid answering. Until you can explain how Tammy's response could be telling, I'm calling BS on this. <br>2) It seems pretty obvious that Fonz is referring to your vote on yabbaguy. It bothers me that you still believe otherwise (179). Please, tell me. What is the motivation for Fonzscum to call your obvRVS vote a serious vote?<br>3) I find it strange that you went from calling three people 'so obviously scum it isn't funny' to voting someone, not among the three, fifty posts later. Please, explain.</div></blockquote><br><br>*Twitch*</div></blockquote><br>TL;DR- I didn't explain my PAGE 3 vote for yabbaguy and I said that PURPLE LOBSTA is irritating. That's it. There's a reason I never made any mention of yabba's page 1/2 play when I called him scum at the end of yesterday- that's because I didn't have any solid points against him by that point, I would have mentioned them if I did. And my irritation was for good reason."}

You are trying to underhandedly throw suspicion on me for something that had not occurred instead of honestly interacting with me to figure me out.  You did a similar thing with me and falcon and yes I still think you were being manipulative and you were selectively scumhunting with the way you were treating me and the lobster.

So why wouldn't your question be something along those lines?  \"Did you miss yabbas posts\" in a comment on that particular post, not a comment on me getting paranoid about the bois and trying to get Matt to post here and do something that would make me feel better about their alignment.<br><br>So here's the answer to the question that should have been asked.  I didn't read yabbas posts that day because they had a lot of numbers in them.  That takes me way more time to understand and I only had a few minutes that day.  I still don't understand the balance debate.  And now that I've actually read and thought about everything that has happened, I still don't know what to think.  But even if I had read his posts, I might not have commented on it, some times it helps to observe how things play out.<br><br>And you want to know why the bolded is super slimy red?  I haven't shown any reluctance to talk about anyone this entire game.  I've talked a lot about yabba since the game started, so the bolded is just you trying to make something that runs counter to actual game evidence look like something it's not.

If Zach is scum and RC is his partner, then there's an extraordinarily large chance that that scumteam is going to crumble after a single day so your current argument with RC (sorting him out, all that) is essentially useless. I currently think that he's town because he seems agonized by your push on him in the same way that you seem to be antagonized by his slimy nasty attacks on you even though there is literally no reason for him to attack you when there's no way in hell that he's going to get you lynched.

I expected to be celebrating back to back scum lynches with a Redcoyote guilty result. Hell I actually declined to take Roflcopter's slot because I was that sure the slot was scum when I was observing the game from the outside.<br><br>It's a very different game when you're looking at the situation of how you explain your result in a way that keeps you from giving your role away.</div></blockquote><br><br>This actually doesn't make sense.

That there were some interactions you initially didn't like between him and me and implosion but on a second look they weren't that bad.  So before your investigation, you were already softening your stance on red.  So it makes no sense that you wouldn't know how to explain your stance after an investigation when you had already set the stage for a change of stance before that investigation.</div></blockquote><br><br>In fact I was looking for things that would reinforce the scum read I had from Rofl's replace out.

It's more 'What scum role with an active ability could there be, given what we know?'  I've been away for a while, but the most common scum PRs other than RBs seem to be various godfathers, secret voters, or the ninja, none of which would be trackable.

I left it there for a little while, as I didn't want to cause a no-lynch by unvoting then disappearing.  That doesn't imply that I had him as a strong suspect.  I had him as basically null, as my posts at the time showed.  I still have no great town vibe on him, he remains middle-of-the-pack, but being the counterwagon to scum counts for something.

I did think ninja was on it. (Wiki check: it's neither explicitly normal nor explicitly not, thought strongman which works similarly is explicitly normal).  But the point wasn't 'Well, they could be a ninja' which wouldn't be nearly enough reason to override the claimed tracking.  It's more 'What scum role with an active ability could there be, given what we know?'  I've been away for a while, but the most common scum PRs other than RBs seem to be various godfathers, secret voters, or the ninja, none of which would be trackable.  If there's a strongman, then it's not SPB, but that's not strong evidence for their innocence either since that role would be doing the killing.  Then you're getting into scum watcher or jailkeeper, which are really rare.<br><br>I don't think 'Scum needs a PR given town power' is that reasonable a belief.  I mean, we've seen no evidence of a full cop, doc or vig thus far.  If both Zach and yabba are telling the truth, AND the secret role yabba apparently knows about is strong, THEN that might be enough to deter my SPB suspicion.</div></blockquote><br><br>Ninja might be on the list in the wiki, but I went back and read the list of possible roles that empire has in the first page and its not listed there.  But there is a note of there possibly being one role that isn't listed but is basically normal, so I suppose there could still be a ninja.  I remember in zach's large normal moi arguing that the existence of a tracker implies a ninja, so I guess it is normal, although ces argued that it would just be mean, so who knows.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fonz wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Really loving how zach showed up today and started towning himself.<br></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>What does 'towning himself' mean?  <br><br>Also, the identity theft thing could be true and them be scum.  It just makes it a bit dickish to use inactivity as an argument.  Either way, confirmable power claim.<br><br>[\\quote]<br><br>Towning himself = making himself look town.  I think that zach is one of those players that when town really looks town, or at least I've seen him in several games and even though I have suspected him a little when he was town before, I've been able to read him as town properly.  I kept hoping that if he was town, he'd do something that would look really town and I could feel better about him instead of constructing paranoid theories of how he could still be scum even if we do have a second kill tonight.<br><br>And the identity theft thing could be true and him be scum.  Bad things happen even when you're scum.  I had a death in the family while scum once and had to tell the game about it because I was going to be gone for two game days (shorter days), but it was very matter of fact when I explained why I was going to be absent.  What makes that look more likely town to me is that he mentioned that he's struggling not to just replace out and he's not going to be playing again for the foreseeable future.  That is what I think would be kinda cheap coming from scum, but nacho says I'm easy to manipulate so don't pay to much attention to me."}

In one game, she was calling someone scum but then said she didn't like that persons votes or questions on her other scum read who was her partner.  Which kinda feels like the way she was pushing zzzx but then saying she didn't like yabbas vote on zzzx.  She also made sure to comment on panda calling her active lurkish and not really posting anything of worth.  She also pushed fonz and implosion, but implosion remains the town read I feel best about and though I'm worried about my fonz read I think he's less likely than the others.<br><br>There could be a scum tracker, but I did like some of his posts yesterday and end day, and I just read wicked's read from the neighborhood so there's that.

There is some reason to think there might be a scum power role - there usually is.  However, what is a reasonable assumption is that this game is somewhere close to the usual mafiascum idea of a balanced game.  If that is the case, then that makes a scum PR seem unlikely in the event that Zach flips scum (which I put in the high nineties percentage wise, the remaining probability space being taken up by the possibility that he had an enormous brain fart and somehow thought offing the next-best claimed PR was the best move for town, and that simultaneously the scum thought offing the same role was the best move for scum in a world where Zach holds a *better* PR).  And it makes the scenario where there are only two town PRs, a tracker and a neighborizer (neither of which is that good) AND a scum PR seem really, really, fucking REALLY unlikely to be the case in the eyes of any reasonable person, because that would be stupidly unbalanced.<br><br>So the question for me is, do you really think this game is super unbalanced?  If not, either your \"Scum PR = likely\" or \"Nacho - not virtually certain to be town\" belief has to be discarded."}

Lil' preview - I'm still concerned about mostly everyone.<br><br>We have a confirmed town tracker and a confirmed town neighborizer, a town bodyguard would  make sense for the tracker.  So, I think that nacho is more likely to be town.  There's some paranoia there, but I think it's a bit unnecessary.  Him being alive is odd, but I just would imagine there being some type of protective role.  I'm easy to manipulate though, just ask him, so there's that.<br><br>I still think that Red Coyote's push on me the day before yesterday in linking me to Yabba looked more townish than not.  The only two things I'm concerned about with him is the earlier selective scumhunting on day one and on day two using the falcon kill against Yabba, and him pushing for yabba instead of sotty on day two.  But, that could also come from town who just suspected yabba more.  <br><br>But I called that sotty shit day one!  Go me!  Just pretend that I didn't start second-guessing myself, okay?  See that's what happens when you people make me wait too long...it gives doubt time to settle in.<br><br>Okay, deasvail's defense of sotty day two is bothering me.  His post to me about thinking that mirari was town and for me to explain how that isn't a problem for  me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5160476#p5160476\">Post 750</a> is worrying me.  However, Nacho thinks that he can read Deasvail and as they both can't be scum together there is that.  Also, I guess there could be something to the thing that Kanye pointed out.<br><br>I know that the bois were tracked to going nowhere but sometimes they just don't feel right.  I don't really have a case to make but something just feels off.<br><br>Okay that's all the time I have for paraphrasing my thoughts.  If I get another few minutes tonight, I'll finish and give the wicked thoughts.  It might be tomorrow night though."}

(That is what the chainsaw thing is right?  I'm not big on buzzwords and tend to skip over them, but yeah.)  The only reason I could see that is if they were all going for distancing hard, but unless they went decided to enter a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uEBuqkkQRk\" class=\"postlink\">bizarre love triangle</a> I'm less inclined to believe it right now.  But, need to re-read how day one went down and won't have time to do that until the weekend.  I did have a flash of a scum read on Fonz during the lynch of day one, but not real sure on this one right now.<br><br>But Wicked thought that Fonz was the last scum but didn't want to show his suspicion because he didn't want scum to know he suspected Fonz if Fonz was town.  He basically suspected him due to PoE, need to look back at day one as he thought that fonz was the one who questioned his scum read on her day one, thinks day one was a bus, and thinks that the falcon kill made sense for a fonz/zach team who left alive the popular town reads so it wouldn't look weird that fonz was still alive.  He thought that was kinda a wifomy point.  Anyway, I know those are paraphrased thoughts second hand, so take that as you will but those are the only thoughts he left in the neighborhood when he got back from v/la.<br><br>I do need to reevaluate implosion.  I still feel relatively good about implosion.  Well it's day four so you know me.  Anyway, Fonz and Implosion are the only two left that the lobster attacked, and I'm having a hard time she ignored or called her partners town.  I just looked and there's no interaction with mirari or sotty, really there's no mention of either of them in their iso.  I need to re-read through zach though.  I think i remember him attacking implosion, and from what I understand he tends to distance.  Don't know that for super sure, just what's been talked about it games.  I'll have to look back at Castle Zar and see how he treated his partners when he replaced in.  Yabba was convinced before he died that Red Coyote was scum with Sotty but idk.  I thought at the time it was a bus, and still think the inno read is wifomy, but his push on red coyote kinda fits in tone with his push against the dgb/nacho slot in castle zar.<br><br>oh yeah, while yabba was alive wicked's other suspect was nacho, but he didn't mention that to me this morning.  but before he got the track results his suspect was the bois.<br><br>oh wait, one thing that bugs me about fonz is the day two issue.  He didn't go after sotty but instead joined zach on the bois for some lame reasons.  Particularly the thing about the bois not buying the townsliip from zzzx because he was scum who didn't want too many obvtown running around.  I think I said that already.  I need sleep."}

The word until is supposed to be in there.  Until sotty became a thing you didn't pay much attention and then had that really weird thing with Nacho.  I doubt I'd lynch you before the fonz because of the track, and sotty attacked you right away on day two, and fonz gave those really weak townreads to mirari and sotty while throwing lame crap at you guys  (however, your push on wicked was for pretty lame reasons too, so I'm going back and forth) but I think I suspect fonz more especially because I've just been more suspicious of him overall since late day one."}

The two more scummy scum are gone and there's bound to be one that looks town at least for a while.<br><br>~~<br><br>If someone could do something to make me less paranoid of implosion and RC, that would be amazing.<br><br>Assuming that that happens and it's a decision between Fonz and SPB (I have faith in you guys), I am unsure. The Bois have strange vote targets, and going after ZZZX for so long in particular was a little weird to me. Ignoring PL Day 1 is pretty conspicuous too, but there are posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5180070#p5180070\">897</a> where Matt connects Nacho to sotty, which is weird for experienced scum to do because they will realise that it doesn't help them, but is used as a scumtell.<br><br>Despite finding him generally townish and the bus on PL seeming unlikely, I think I'm leaning toward voting for The Fonz because since Day 1 he hasn't been all that impressive, and dismissing my self-meta as just calling myself obvtown (when there was actually logic to it) seems quite convenient. To add to The Bois' point, there are actually 5 people that PL mentions in their post as possible scum, where The Fonz is the only unflipped player. The strong PL attack and how it just led PL to get shiftier and shiftier is still annoying me though. So, although if I had to vote now, I'd choose The Fonz, I am still open to both options and will even consider others if I'm not satisfied with others' reads on RC and implosion.<br><br>I'll have another look at things later too. <br><br><br><br>Bois, what was you read of me Day 2?"}

But that's not my argument with regard to Red himself.  There's all the difference in the world between attacking a new/annoying/bad at writing player because they're dropping scum tells, and attacking them solely because they're new etc.  You LITERALLY suggested that ZZZX was scum on the basis of his writing style.  A similar argument applies to wickedestjr.  He attacks Mirari for making a 'weak' argument.  Let's not consider whether it's a weak argument that scum would benefit from making or anything.  Oh no, he's clearly scum because he's bad at logic.  (Also some misrepresentation there: Mirari didn't say he changed his mind on implosion because implosion changed his vote.

To add to The Bois' point, there are actually 5 people that PL mentions in their post as possible scum, where The Fonz is the only unflipped player. The strong PL attack and how it just led PL to get shiftier and shiftier is still annoying me though. So, although if I had to vote now, I'd choose The Fonz, I am still open to both options and will even consider others if I'm not satisfied with others' reads on RC and implosion. </div></blockquote><br><br>Deas: your selfmeta is invalid.  Anyone who is aware of their meta can deliberately follow it as scum.  I don't think I have ever accepted a pre-emptive self-meta justification in my career.  You can think this is scummy if you want, but I'm not ever going to change on that front.  I don't think it's 'convenient' to not buy every argument you bring for your own towniness, especially when I do other analysis which points the other way.<br><br>I am really unsure how I have at any point in this game been less impressive than any other point, whatever that means.  My day two play was broadly similar to D1: push my top suspect hard. (I also defended my strong town read hard).  The main difference is that people weren't buying.  As to the accusation that I basically  \"skipped\" day two, notice that I do not post at all between the 29th and the first, then my posting picks up massively from Sunday 4th.  This was not a coincidence - the week which finished on the 2nd July was my last week of placement before breaking up for summer, and things were hella hectic (I had an all-day engagement on the Saturday).  Hence, one real post between monday night and Sunday.   This was the period when Zach was getting run up.  But, even so, I didn't and still don't see what Tammy thought was so bad about Zach's posting.  I felt his spb case was much better than it was being given credit for.   The first thing he did which really pinged my scumdar was the 'hope there's no rb' thing, which seemed like a pre-emptive attempt to explain away no second kill, but even then, confirmable claim.  So I just didn't buy the Zach case, and wouldn't have if I were here.  I'd probably have actively defended him, actually.  The 'disconfirming' thing is something I've seen scum do, and seemed to make sense for scum given there already seemed to be a large pool of strongly town-looking players running around after the lobsta lynch.  Hard to see any route to a scum victory which didn't involve lynching ZZZX at some point.<br><br>@Tammy: look at the sequence of posts between 703 and 712 please.  Note how, under time pressure, I am torn.  Look how easy it would have been, given your not getting back to me and my massive aversion to lynching claimed cops day one, to justify the Deas wagon as a fait accompli or merely disappear without changing my vote.  Instead, I try to co-ordinate with you to force through a Lobsta lynch which looks like kinda an outside bet.<br><br>@Everyone: please at least do me the favour of taking a look at the Deas wagon D1, because I think this is something that's being overlooked that is important evidence.  I'll do that myself next post, if i'm not dead by then.  If I am, note that SPB is trying to pre-emptively create a narrative for when I flip town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">~Quote tags fixed.</span></span></span>"}

In fact I'm there saying that its possible you were trying to mimic your town behavior.  I'm preeeetty sure if I was trying to suck someone's ass it would look different than that.  And you know what else?  Sucking someone's ass isn't even a part of my scum play, so sorry you don't get a gold star.  In fact, guess what I find while looking through my iso?  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5113944#p5113944\" class=\"postlink\">me sucking your ass?</a>. I don't know, we can let the rest of the class decide.  And in greater fact, what's this I find?  Omg this is such a good example of me sucking your ass.  [url=http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5113944#p5113944] oh nope, I was kidding.  That was you reaching out to me, sorry for leading you on. [/quote]. I know that your fantasy sounded good and all sorry for killing it.<br><br>Also, I'm not scared as scum.  I hate being scum because I hate lying but I don't fear being scum.  You don't even have to take my word for it.  Nachos seen me as scum three times, red coyotes seen me as scum, fonz modded a game where I was scum.  I really doubt any of them will say that fear is a big part of my scum game.  I expect to get investigated and lynched as scum because I think my scum game is obvious and poor, but I don't fear it.  Nor do I fear getting tunneled as scum. That you're actually patting yourself on the back thinking I'd be afraid of you guys as scum is so laughable I don't know what to say.  Yes, in Kanyes game you caught me as scum.  Congratulations.  I was so obvious that game I don't know how I wasn't lynched day one.  I also didn't care about that game much.  It was the second scum game that I replaced into that trollie had replaced out of for one, and the game was frustrating for two.  I didn't even care when you were tunneling me, and you caught me but you're reasons for catching me were wrong.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Matt wrote:</cite>You say you have NO townreads yesterday which means you're either on meth or you literally haven't been reading the game</div></blockquote><br><br>So.  I never said I have NO town reads. Implosion has been a consistent strong town read for me.  He's someone I'm reevaluating as I'm looking back at flipped scum.  Yesterday I also made an argument for why red coyote was more likely town.  I looked to nacho for reassurance on my weak town read on deasvail, and had a town read on nacho.<br><br>What I said was that I don't have a strong town base I feel good about because there are always things that are popping up to make me doubt.  Is there paranoia, sure?  Maybe some of its silly, but to actually accuse me of saying something I didn't say and that I haven't been reading the game means you're on meth.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Matt wrote:</cite>Your push on RC was terrible and I assumed you were just biasing</div></blockquote><br><br>So.  Are you going to say all of your reads are right in mafia?  Always.  Were you right about zzzx?  How about this idiotic push you're making on me?<br><br>[quote\"Matt\"]<br>You responded irrationally to my most recent posts by saying \"wtf?\" and asking for a ridiculous explanation from me which make no sense from your general character and feels completely awkward. Your general play this game has been lackluster and has involved over paranoia and ridiculous pushes based on memory. I haven't looked over your push on Sotty or PL but I will, but before you act like an indignant princess realize if we are both town, my reads were better than yours, I made better decisions on Sotty and RC (I was not even here for PL) and you've been apparently unable to town hunt or use any semblance of critical thinking[/quote]<br><br>How is that irrational?  You ignored nacho's question when you made a similar statement previously, and then you make another.  I want to know what you mean, because to me it just looks like you're trying to throw out bs and give yourself an out if fonz flips town.  If scum are lining up mislynches or setting up a 1v1, who is the scum doing that.  It shouldn't be hard to answer, and the fact that you went into the tirades of insulting my intelligence and going omg town read gone boohooohioohhooohojhihihihihiihl just reads insane and scummy.<br><br>Um you're actually calling my play lackluster?  I think it's been pretty strong actually.  And it's especially strong considering the life changes I went through this month, unless you want to consider moving across the country and starting a new job something silly that wouldn't have an effect on play.<br><br>Maybe I have been a little over paranoid, but who cares.  Sometimes I get overly paranoid when town.  And my pushes haven't been bad.  I was most likely wrong on my red coyote push day one, but during that time I was also pushing on the lobster.  I followed you on deasvail because he was scum he was scum he was scum, and I changed my mind based on how he reacted and then correctly chose the lobster. Also also at the end of day one, I was trying to get the lynch moved to sotty because even though I originally had a townread on mirari, once zach came in I started scum reading him.  No one bit day one, so I pushed it day two, and I would have gotten my scum flip if it weren't for that claim.  Did his ate make me doubt that my scum read was right, yes, because I just didn't think he'd use that as scum, but when he didn't act like town again the next day I pushed him again.<br><br>Did you literally say my reads were better than yours.  Matt please never ever sign up for a game I'm in ever.  The way you're behaving is clearly out of line and insulting, and I don't want to so with you,<br><br>I'm done dealing with you.  I hope you're scum I really do."}

It kills town cred a lot because framing your target as an easy lynch implies that you don't find them as important to the scum team AND it means that he could be simultaneously defending by giving them an easy avenue to be defended. A *tiny* little bit of digging (sorry Empire, I'm not wasting my time with a full dive) suggests that Fonz frames his distancing pretty strongly: In inbetweeners mafia, when Fonz voted Ree he only did so when he could build a substantial case and when he was already coming under fire (AKA when distancing is actually necessary), meaning it doesn't look like he's a turbobusser. It's also inconsistent with any sort of logical scum strategy to turbo bus one partner and then weakly defend the other who made a dead man walking claim (which is ignoring my personal opinion that defending stall-claims is usually a town tell, considering a good stall claim will probably let your partner live until the next day by the merits of the claim itself while defending your scumpartner will always gain you heat from someone somewhere since you're defending scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\" class=\"postlink\">post 101</a>, The Fonz wrote:</cite>OK fine.<br><br>1.

I agree with him that you posting to say you have no read isn't valuable to the town and is just filler.  You seem to think that a mafia game is built on 'normal talking' then scumhunting at some arbitrary point when you have 'enough information.'  His point is that he believes there was enough information to start scumhunting, and yet you continued with 'normal talking.'  He's right and you're wrong.  However, the real question is not who's right, it's whether it's reasonable to think you scum for it.  I say no.<br>G) Your reaction to his post three is a Barnum statement (maybe one thing, or maybe the other).  It's of no value.<br>H) There are some grounds for accusing him of hypocrisy.

It was a push that never really gained much traction from my understanding of it, and was a push that Purple kept up until the last minute DV wagon (and even the vote there took some serious pushing). Meanwhile, Implosion spent most of his time on RedCoyote AND DeasVail, but didn't actually end up dancing with PL for that long despite their incredibly convinced and irrational push on them (contrast this with Fonz, who stuck on PL the entire day and stepped up his conviction with the \"Fonz is framing me\" or whatever the hell the case was).<br><br>Next, my use of nightkill analysis is usually very limited and based on things that are very subtle; it's usually easy to rule out people as scum or town based on the nightkills they make. For example, I will never kill someone for a \"no information nightkill\" as scum because those are fucking stupid. F-16's nightkill looked ridiculously strange to me, not because he's a bad player or anything but because there were so many other pertinent threats hanging out all over the place. His reads also weren't that good (he thought PL and mirari were both town for a while), and he was easily mislynchable. He certainly wasn't a meta threat to a lot of players here who have a few meta threats (DeasVail wouldn't want to kill him, Tammy wouldn't want to kill him, SPB wouldn't want to kill him). Odd hiccup comes here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5127692#p5127692\" class=\"postlink\">post 377</a>, F-16_Fighting_Falcon wrote:</cite>Another thought, I can't help but feel Yabba and implosion are scum.

It's not a bad kill to eliminate someone who isn't drinking the koolaid, though."}

Note that this is Mirari's second vote after an RVS on Wicked. There are two questions that I'm asking myself: First of all, would Mirari bus Fonz with such a specific point, and continue the bus throughout the day? Second, would Mirari frame a bus with the \"who can tell me why\" thing? <br><br>I think the fact that it was a very specific point (and that it's the only point mirari ever gave against Fonz) would make a little more sense as a bus. I don't think it'd be natural for scum to tunnel a townie on something that they know can be so easily (and accurately, since they are town) refuted by said townie. It would make more sense to use against scum because either they'll be able to easily counteract it, or it's the kind of vote that mirari would later be able to easily drop (since it's only on one point) in favor of pursuing some other wagon, yet still get towncred in the eventuality that Fonz flips scum. <br><br>The second question, idk. I really want to think that it's a tell one way or the other, but it's probably just a personality thing. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5113571#p5113571\" class=\"postlink\">post 137</a>, PURPLE LOBSTA wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5112604#p5112604\" class=\"postlink\">post 101</a>, The Fonz wrote:</cite>1.

I really can't put myself into a town frame of mind, irrespective of experience level, where Implosion's post makes sense.  To me this reads like scum stretching for reasons post-RVS.<br><br>We're going back and forth in our QT about it, more later.</div></blockquote><br>This is a bigger point, and is also underscored by this other quote that I missed at first, which is the first time PL seriously refer to Fonz:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Fonz completely misreps our voting patterns, and makes our first vote sound like it was serious, if he missed the votes me and zoidy made on the first page then it's fine but he actually talked about the vote I placed on Matt/Kanye meaning he has seen them. </div></blockquote><br>The point is to make a comparison between the way PL treats me and the way they treat Fonz. It feels like they almost went out of their way to never explicitly call Fonz scum - they constantly maraud his case as being wrong, fabricated, and illiterate. Yet, they never call him scum. Purple Lobsta makes points of Fonz's push on them being bad and my jump onto Fonz's push being bad; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">they then downplay the first point and up-play the second.</span> In other words, they're trying to jump on me for sheeping Fonz's terribad reasoning while simultaneously never actually pushing Fonz for coming up with that reasoning in the first place.

Maybe I misread something. Hold that thought, I'll get back to you on this. <br><br>The reason that The Fonz's point is horrible is simple. It's hypocritical. The Fonz calls out Purple Lobsta for trying to look town (illusion of content) where they ask Tammy for her games. In that very same post, The Fonz questions whether or not the players are a \"hydra\" or a single player. To me that information is just as easily found as old games. This point is also reinforced by the fact that The Fonz has been on this site for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">6</span> years. I am sure he knows how to find out if a player is a hydra or not. It takes a little digging. <br><br>I agree with the scum reads on Implosion.

I really don't care if you tell me I'm being a bitch in a game though; I'll probably agree with you.  I wasn't calling you scum but you were talking about things that didn't make sense to me and I couldn't follow you.  You said that scum were trying to line up mislynches if fonz was town and then that they were trying to make it a 1v1 but that doesn't match what's in the thread, so it struck me as off.  I realize that I did talk about it being between you and fond but i didn't say it was definite and I think by me saying that I wanted to go back through the thread made it obvious that I hadn't narrowed it down for sure.  Also, anyone who's played with me more than once knows that I'm always reevaluating things and I tend to give my thoughts in the moment but they are never set in stone.  I was trying to get your thoughts beyond your random postings about things that didn't add up.  I wasn't telling you you have to post 50 times a day but you should be able to answer for your thoughts.  Where you got me the hardest and I felt most insulted was when you started insulting my intelligence, which you did in mafia.raptrued too, and then started accusing me of being a bad scumhunter and a bad player.  Yes, I tend to get paranoid and I know that, this game is nothing different, but I do think I've done pretty well up to this point and I really didn't appreciate the taunting, but I accept your apology for being a jerk.<br><br>There are some things I want to think about though so, sorry to put this off til tomorrow, but tomorrow."}

I also think that 'Defends vs ignores vs distances' in terms of associative tells is a circle of wifom (see Ether's infamous joke scumtell list on which all of those things are scummy).  I don't like this hiding behind not having meta thing (I don't know if Fonz...) because you can either do the fucking meta (it's not like you haven't had time- correct me if i'm wrong), or look at whether you think the specific action in the specific case benefits scum.

There are major problems, as Nacho notes, with claiming that the scum are setting up this 1v1 and at the same time being unwilling to risk pointing out which of these players he's been calling out is the potential scum he thinks might be responsible - at a point where he needs those players' votes to lynch me over him.<br><br>Also, I'm finding it hard to believe that Implosion is more likely scum than RC or Deas.  I think this is a particularly important issue in this game, given that in the situation where spb somehow is town, then the remaining scum has to be there.

It's not cool anymore.<br>Seriously though, what is your problem with the townreads on me?</div></blockquote><br><br>The problem is that there are similar town reads on implosion until the last page or two, and on RC (with the exception of Tammy).  If I'm wrong on SPB - and I don't think I am (but more to the point I'm reasonably happy that if I'm lynched, I'm pretty confident y'all will lynch them tomorrow) then it is likely to come down to you three.  I think it is therefore important to see which of the three of you is the most town and the most scummy.  Additionally, I think a lot of the Implosion stuff is coming from a different branch of the same WIFOMy tree as me - it is similarly trivially easy to make a 'scum would have distanced' 'scum would have ignored' and 'scum would have supported' argument with regard to any player who was not under severe pressure at the time.  There is little real cost to scum to do any of those things, it's basically second-guessing how the town will weight those things.  <br><br>Therefore, while I will obviously support an Imp lynch over a me-lynch if there are no other options, it is not clear, if the alternative to me can't be SPB (and I still don't see why it should be) that the next best option is Implosion and not Red or you, so I need to make my mind up on that.  I also believe that should I be unfortunate enough to be mislynched today, then that analysis has value in endgame once i'm flipped.  (Given that I'm currently weighting the probability something like 50-60% last scum is SPB, 35-45% it's in that group of three, and 5% something really weird is happening and it's Tammy running a super-bus strategy or the setup is bizarre).<br><br>Anyway, now to do that analysis.  Won't be posting until it's ready."}

I've been finding it really hard to feel great about anyone being town this game.  I townread falcon partly based on that and partly based on the meta case empire wrote on a scum falcon in deas' game.  Implosion isn't based on him sounding like he does as town.  His is partly gut based and part overcompensation from scum reading him when he was town not too long ago.  I didn't feel really great about deas until today when it became clear that nacho and him couldn't be on a scum team together and I still have bits of paranoia on that.  I did change my mind when he was run up day one because I've seen him run up as scum three times and he reacted more like I've seen him run up as town.  Nacho I had paranoia about until it became pretty clear that for him to be scum, the setup doesn't make sense.  I'm leaving alone the rc thing because of two reasons.  The push to try to tie me to yabba fell apart when yabba flipped town, though I still don't like a lot of his day one play.  But pretty much the entire town has basically told me I'm stupid for suspecting him and as they can't be scum with him, those town reads are real and either the entire town is wrong and I'm right, or I'm just wrong.<br><br>As far as spb goes I haven't and still don't have a town read on them.  I've flip flopped on them like crazy.<br><br>If that paranoia of me is real, thank you.  I think I have a really poor scum game but have been told its not as bad as I think it is.  But I really don't see it coming from team mafia as I was a replacement that game and. Large part of the town read you guys had on me was based on my predecessor.  Even after I \"accidentally\" hammered iam, which I sill feel bad about btw, he was using oms actions for why I was town and shouldn't be lynched.  The only thing I really did was not dispel any of the good feelings you guys already had about my slot.  I think I'd probably be a little more understanding if you used American revolution or something.  At least there I got caught in more than one lie and still managed to have people town read me and win the game.  I realize you were the mod there so it's less personal, but I'm just trying to understand if its real or not.  I had you as basically town day one, but something struck me at a gut level when we were talking at the end of day one as being off.  But I knew it could just be paranoia and is why I was getting others to explain their town reads on you.  I realize I've never played with you before so haven't been fooled, but I did follow along with the inbetweeners in which you were competent as scum.  <br><br>So while I might not be looking at your play and going \"this is a town tell\", and tbf I do want to give you town credit for the way you handled the lobster but I do consider the possibility of doing that as scum especially as I just did something similar, but I am looking at flipped scums behavior with you and think some of that makes you look townish.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fonz wrote:</cite><br>Also, I would like a response to my point that it seems incredibly hard to imagine a route to a scum win that doesn't involve a ZZZX lynch somewhere along the line.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't really get the point.

In fact, his anger is something he's good at faking when scum.  The major AtE he did in mafia.raptured that I was arguing was fake, I was wrong about, he probably wouldn't be able or wouldn't fake that leverl of AtE, but the hostility, yes.  I can totally see him doing that.  But, I did go back to War is Hell and read the way he treated Tierce when she was scum reading him and he was just as hostile but he was actually being productive during the game while being angry, so don't know what to make of that there.<br><br>Anyway, I just finished reading up to the beginning of this day, and I'm at a loss.  I don't know what to do right now, but I'm so super tired, I'm gonna sleep on it and then I'll ramble about what I thought while reading today to.  Basically at the moment I can come up with little reasons for why everyone is scum or town and I'm at the point where I'm just going to go cry in the corner for a bit or sleep and hope that I receive a grand epiphany over night."}

I feel good about RC town for various reasons, and I feel goodish about DV town - there's just some paranoia there on that one.  Even though I think that a lot of spb's posts come off scummy, Mara voted him in RVS and I just feel like that's something that she wouldn't do.  I don't feel really strongly about that but I think it's something she'd try to avoid.

This is interesting to me for a few reasons:<br><br>1) The Lobsta jumps on the counterwagon late, while still stating she thinks DV is town.  Vibe of expecting a DV townflip here.  Seems more likely, if they're both scum and it's one or the other, it's better to get the towncred for pushing DV. <br>2) Zach reacts similarly, expressing the willingness to do it over NL, but bewilderment at how it got to that level.  This seems less strong evidence of Deas' innocence, seeing as how if Deas is the buddy, he's in a tough spot tomorrow if he endorses this wagon whichever way the lynch ends up going, but it does still kinda seem 'hope it goes through without him.'<br>3) Implosion and Deas are both early adopters of the PL wagon.  Implosion, I think, adds much more, whereas DV largely just parrots me.  OTOH, Deas sticks to this wagon, whereas Implosion jumps off to vote RC.<br>4)  Zach pushes RC in preference to PL, but then jumps off, putting PL in the 'staring down a barrel' position.  This is a crucial vote in making PL and not RC the one who is run up to claim.  It seems like bad play to swing the momentum in favour of a buddy lynch like this, otoh sparing a good buddy over a terrible one makes sense.<br>5) Slumber sits on Deas pretty much all of day one, ignoring the lobster.<br>6) Red and Implosion are both key votes on the Deas counterwagon.<br>7) Implosion switches back to PL once I have done so.  Could be a degree of seeing the tide turning, idk, this seems like a pretty important vote in the context of things.  Takes it from 6-3 Deas to 5-4, then Deas' own vote puts it at 5-5.<br><br>I'm thinking of the three, I'm leaning Coyotescum over Implosionscum or Deas-scum.  SPB who I know has the strongest claimed Coyote-town read (although also claims town reads on the other two, or has done) I'd like a response to this analysis.<br><br>@Tammy, Nacho, and Deas: relative scumminess rankings of SPB, Red, and Implosion, if you wouldn't mind.  I'm convinced I don't want to lynch Deas until endgame.  I'm pretty sure Imp is the worst lynch of those three though, and will only support it to save my own life."}

The LOBSTA found themselves under a mountain of suspicion pretty quickly and, even though they did a good job of trying to shake it off, they ultimately couldn't. A lot of the players that looked like they could be mislynched given the game state ended up being PRs that had to be killed off. The Fonz did some amazing work in this game, especially with his Day 1 bus, but I felt PoE ultimately caught up to him in the end and his unfortunate V/LA towards the end crippled his opportunity to really turn his wagon around.<br><br>The town definitely deserves massive props here for great work pretty much all throughout the game. I thought them pushing through a LOBSTA lynch despite the cop claim was particularly noteworthy, as I think most other towns would have balked at the idea of possibly lynching such a strong PR. A lot of people were on to the scum team early on, despite a lot of the playstyle/personality clashes that occurred throughout. I really want to give a special shout out to Wickedestjr, who played his role excellently and nailed the entire scum team with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5140784#p5140784\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and drove home that The Fonz was the last scum in his final Neighborhood post. I think if he were a bit more active, he'd have been even more of a driving force than he was in the game.<br><br>As far as the setup goes, I want to do something simple and basic to get my feet wet as this was my first modded game. I basically went with the investigative PR/protective PR duo but wanted to make sure that they weren't too overpowered (hence the BG and tracker). I threw in a Neighborizer simply because of games like The Wire - having been part of a Neighborhood in that game that I felt was really effective, I wanted to put that to the test here. It would have been interesting to see the behind-the-scenes work Wickedestjr and yabbaguy would have done had they not been run up to claim on Day 2.<br><br>Seeing as this was my first time modding, I think I did ok. I wish I could have been more on top of the game after the Bar exam, but real life got in the way of things. I tried my best to keep up and in the end I'm pretty satisfied with how the game turned out.<br><br>Thanks a lot to all of the replacements for stepping up to the plate and joining this game. Really couldn't have been a game without you guys. And of course, many thanks to all the friends I bugged to join and play this.<br><br>Any comments/suggestions/etc about the setup or my modding are definitely encouraged. I really want to make sure all my future games are the best they can be.<br><br>For anyone who's interested, my next game is going to be a Large Normal. I'm actually taking pre-ins for it now if anyone's interested!"}

Mods can simply reword the rule to read \"once you are out of the game by death <span class=\"noboldsig\">or replacement</span>, you may not talk in thread\". Basically, Mirari disengaged from her win con, then with no game-motive, decided to just jam in a post just for the sake of being derpy. It's a minor point in the scheme of things, but I'm not a fan of it.<br><br>@Tammy: The more you play, the more courage you'll get when you vote. I think the key thing for any Townie in the middle of a sluggish game is to try to grasp the plot - who needs to be posting right now or making a decision in order to move the game along? If it's me, do I need to ask more questions, or do I essentially know I'm ready to commit to my choice? You don't categorically need every second on the clock, like we always say in Duplicate Bridge about making final decisions - if you know, go.<br><br>Good job on catching on that I was Neighborized. Thank goodness you weren't scum. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"><br><br>@Wicked: Sorry I didn't talk more in the Neighbor thread. Thanks for trusting me straightaway when I claimed in there. <br><br>@Empire: If it was writer's block, I'd say just relax and let the flavor flow where it will. When I'm thinking #SWAGTOWN, I was almost expecting the flavor to be kind of derpy and rambunctious, or less than 140 characters <span style=\"font-style: italic\">*shrug*</span>. But I enjoyed this game, it was really cool that you gave Town 3 powers and yet a 3-Goon armada was still balanced.<br><br>It's an interesting thought about scum play, because Fonz's super-aggro bus on PURPLE LOBSTA blew up because his second buddy got lynched on Day 3. My takeaway - bussing credit isn't magic, there's still a lot to navigate through even if you gain that momentary invincibility shield for a few Days. The Mirari/sottyrulez (okay, Zachrulez <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) slot I think may have started okay but then dwindled away in activity too much - and I think I've learned that watching to see how your non-bussed partner in situations like this is the key part to any early Day bus. With my all-seeing 20/20 hindsight, I think Fonz's correct move would've been to try and escape the PL wagon at some point once his second buddy started becoming more and more suspicious.<br><br>I prolifically posted in the Dead QT, so read there for my of my thoughts - I really like discussing with alive players who see what I've said after the game ends, but I think it was basically a great victory for Town."}

The dasterdly fiend they made me out to be would've gotten a noose wrapped around my neck before I could say stop. I actually agree with them and didn't think I played particularly well with the exception of going for Fonz there at the end. I didn't even get to vote Zach/sotty like I wanted to on D3 and was worried that that would be used against me. But, whatever, that's townRC for you. I'm just glad that I had SBP, Nacho, and implosion around to protect me. &lt;3 yabba, I love that line \"lost the plot\". I've heard it once or twice before. I want to start using that for myself. <br><br>I think the town really played well here though. We all seemed to compliment each other well with minimal speed bumps along the way. It's almost like we all had townreads on different players and kind of just went like, \"well, if you say s/he's town, then okay, I'll go with it\". Had implosion and Fonz not been around to talk down scumNacho, I think very much I could've been convinced on that one. So that was nice. Me and Tammy butted heads, but ultimately I never really had a solid scumread on her. I don't know if it was in spite or because of the hostility though. Working with townNacho is always so great. He really helps me focus and I think we can read each other pretty well. When reading through the dead/neighbor QT, it was like yabba and Wicked were kind of different players. I wish, wish, wish they'd have defended each other a little more strongly. Wicked especially shocked me at how solid his reads were when you see what he has to say in the QTs. If only ZZZX hadn't turned so many people off. There was another person that agreed with me (implosion?) that that was just such an abysmal lynch. But that's what is cool about Mafia is that people can interpret things so much differently. I'm totally going to use the \"ZZZX tell\" going forward though, lol. <br><br>The scum and town MVP was Fonz, lmao. It's almost not a joke though. He effectively made the decision to lynch PL. Although he focused hard on SBP during D2, he did end up helping get sotty lynched on D3. And he was just unfortunately not really persuasive enough to defend himself and convince enough people on D4. Whether he realizes it or not, he helped keep me from going after Nacho, DV, and implosion harder at various points in the game. I mean, who knows what would've happened had he come out swinging for any of those three, but I just know that his dismissing of those players are potential scum targets was certainly a factor in me not being as vicious against them. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Empire 1592 wrote:</cite>Any comments/suggestions/etc about the setup or my modding are definitely encouraged.

Fonz told me in the QT later that I should have hammered the wagon when I had the chance, but looking back on it I don't think it would have changed much and I thought the wagon would go through without me anyway.

You had my OP updated whenever I went to it, which, unfortunately, a good chunk of Mods forget to do. You answered questions promptly.

I was going to do some goofy twitter-like stuff for each of the players as they got lynched/nightkilled. Writer's block was definitely a part of it but it was mostly just IRL coming at me in full force (it's why I'm limiting myself to two games at a time and why I don't post as prolifically as I used to).

I especially enjoyed playing with you, and I didn't really expect someone I didn't know to play along with what I was doing in the way that you did. We did make a few mistakes that could have changed the outcome if they weren't made otherwise but that kind of stuff happen<br><br>like, I should have claimed Weak-cop instead of hinting that I could have had that modifier and hoped that town picked it up<br><br>and Zack definitely could have handled that D1 bus better but overall, I don't really have anything to bad to say about you guys.
