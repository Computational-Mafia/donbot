The community was a calm, but tight one and people didn't mind helping each other. When the parents went to work, the elders of the village would look after their children. When disaster struck and someone broke a leg, people would help him or her out in their daily work. During the usually sunny weekends, the center of the town was full of people talking and children playing. Even if it did happen to be bad weather, this wouldn't stop them from going over to someone elses place to enjoy the weekend together.<br>\n<br>\nThis all changed when on a sunday morning, a man was found in front of the church. He had been shot. Distrust spread through the town, but they decided they wouldn't need outside help now. Like always, they would solve it themselves.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rules</div> (original by Flameaxe)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">General:</div><br>\n<br>\n1) Have a jolly good time.<br>\n2) The mod is always right. Deal with it.<br>\n3) If you have a problem with something regarding the game, please PM me, try to keep it out of the thread.<br>\n4) Vote in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Flinter</div>. Unvoting before voting is cool, but if you forget, don't worry about it.<br>\n5) Do not quote role PMs or any other form of communication with me. Failure to comply will result in a modkill.<br>\n6) Keep the game in the game. Don't discuss the game outside of the game unless your role says you can. I will find out. I have people. Those people have people.<br>\n7) When you are dead, get out of my thread. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> I rhymed! No \"bah\" posts.<br>\n8) Please do not use small/invisible text, steganography or advanced forms of coding/cryptography. Breadcrumbing is an acceptable form of basic coding.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Deadlines and Activity:</div><br>\n<br>\n9) Each game day will have deadlines as I see fit. If the day seems to be dragging, I will announce a deadline. Any deadline will be at least seven days from the issuing.<br>\n10) If no majority is reached at the deadline, no-lynch will be achieved and lynched like the scumbag he/she/it is!<br>\n11) I am would like all of you to be active. If a player goes without a post for 48 hours, they will receive a prod. If no reply IN THREAD is made 48 hours after the prod was given, i will begin searching for a replacement. If you post during the period between searching for a replacement and finding a replacement, you are welcome to stay, but do not expect me to be as lenient after that situation.<br>\n12) If you plan on being away from modern civilization for more than 48 hours, let me know via PM.<br>\n13) Night phase will have a deadline of no more than 4 days (give or take a few hours if I am not around). No submission, no action. Four days should be plenty of time.<br>\n14) This game is a closed setup with a day start.<br>\n15) A lynch will require a majority of players voting to be successful. However, a no lynch only requires 50% of the alive players to go through. For example, with 24 people alive, it will take 13 to lynch, but only 12 to no lynch.<br>\n16) If any of these rules are broken, and a modkill is performed, the player will automatically lose no matter the outcome.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">example vanilla role pm;</div><br>\n<br>\nyou are a vanilla town.

Any chemistry between us in this topic is of a non-existing nature.

Not following through on his accusations. He accuses, or attempts to accuse, don johnson of bandwagoning or he accuses us of teaming together, not sure which one he means. But that is irrelevant. The issue is that he outs an accusation towards someone and then follows it by a phrase that makes his accusation seem less serious. This is leaving himself some wiggling room, something he did somewhere else as well:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>raud wrote:</cite>I fail to see anything that would make you [MME] think I'm scum in those posts. I don't think that you're [MME] scum yet, but I'm keeping an eye on you [MME].</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n2. Egging on someone else while he is being put in the spotlight. <br>\nDon't get me wrong, I do not think someone under pressure should not out suspicions towards someone else. But it's more the way that it's done. And by that I mean:<br>\na. the wording is off: \"it may be nothing\".

You also said that his posting, not his vote, was unoriginal in #49. That's interesting because his RVS vote was not really unoriginal neither is his #2 and #3.

I'm not ready to vote for him, but his behavior has been duly noted.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ lobster notices the argument and comments, but fails to \"do anything\". its called active lurking. ifg he had his vote on a suspect at the time, then this is perfectly acceptable behavior. but he doesn't. he's riding his random, unoriginal vote instead of applying pressure to one side of this argument or the other. he also fails to comment on anything else. he may as well not have posted at all.<br>\n<br>\ni move my rvs to serious for this.<br>\n<br>\nkrew acts similarly here. not sure why the MS vote remains. also, i don't think krew should be given a pass for his claim. the more i think about it, the more it occurs to me that caught scum on day 1 are generally going to claim doctor. i don't see any breadcrumbs in his posting. but whatever.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>spad wrote:</cite>MME found someone scummy and interrogated it. Please give me a reason why would he keep his RVS when someone else is doing scummy things?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\ni don't think raud did anything scummy enough to warrant the switch. the questions? sure, but there was no need to switch votes, especially with the excuse of \"let's pick up the pace\". a 2 vote bandwagon on page 1 is plenty of \"pace\". moving off of it actually slows the game down. so to me, it was an odd post all around when you really look at it. but whatever.<br>\n<br>\nnote: spad jumps the lobster wagon.<br>\n<br>\nredtail's 53 is actually a non-sequitur directed at me. he takes two unrelated posts of mine and tries to tie them together. me pointing out that raud looks bad, has no real effect on why i think lobster is scum at that point because rt is ignoring the context of my posts. i later explain my feelings on the raud/mme fiasco, but when i reread this, i can't help but wonder why these statements are tied together.<br>\n<br>\nlobster 54 is another useless post. it voices support for what could become the leading bandwagon, and provides no analysis.<br>\n<br>\nmme 55 should be paid attention to.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>I did what you are accusing lobster of not doing and now you say this? Sense it makes none.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nand again, i point it out because mme jumped off the wagon for something that imo, was not scummy. he also did so with the words \"let's pick up the pace,\" when in reality, his actions slowed the game and removed pressure from a player. but whatever. mme should not be worried that i say something like this <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">unless</div> he is lobster's scum partner, which further strengthens said theory of why mme jumped off the lobster wagon in the first place.<br>\n<br>\npost 57: redtail agrees with dj. the lobster wagon is growing.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>redtail: yes. raud still looks bad, but it is more about his response to pressure and the \"dogpile\" approach mme applied. so its more like i think he's being made out to look bad, than actually being scummy. his inability to do anything is odd.<br>\n<br>\nsleepykrew is reading like lurkerscum. we'll have to wait and see.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ more explanations of dj's thought process. please note, krew is the next post. can anyone say \"beetlejuice\"?<br>\n<br>\npost 61: mme explains himself.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>My point was that you're accusing lobster of not putting his vote where his mouth was on raud, but leaving it on his random vote. While I did the opposite, which you found interesting to note as well. Which in turn I find interesting to note.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ this is non-sequitur. what one has to do with the other i have no idea. again, i think this is a difference of opinion. i don't think mme switched for all together valid reasons. and again, i see no reason for mme to be \"concerned\" with what i said <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">unless</div> he is actually lobster's partner.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>mme: whatever. I don't like lobsters play so far. I don't think your initial reason for leaving him was all that legitimate. Though rauds reaction was suspect, your reasoning for voting him in the first place was not much better than an rvs vote. But that's just my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nKrew: it has nothing to do with you being online, its the content of your post that leads me to my opinion. I can break it down for you if you like?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ again, more explanations from dj.<br>\n<br>\nspad notices it in 68. agrees with dj. again.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>I don't think he's making a big deal out of it, I think there's a misinterpretation of what happened. Is the misinterpretation on purpose or not? I'm not sure at this stage.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ here, mme agrees with me that i am not \"making a big deal\" out of the issue that krew is accusing me of. don't you guys find it odd that so many of you were agreeing with so many things i posted early on, but now i am at L-1? oh well.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>Tell me again. Why lobster and not raud?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ kind of irrelevant and repetitive seeing as how i already explained this. i think the major issue is our different interpretations of raud and lobsters rvs votes. lobster copied a post on page 1 to supply his rvs vote. i didn't find rauds to be \"suspect\". further, i felt that raud was \"dogpiled\" in a way, and the next few spad posts detail that well. go check them out.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>Honestly, voting someone for an rvs vote is not a case. The case was made afterwards and wiggling room became my main point. As said multiple times in this post. But you are right, it's not the reason I voted for him. But it is the reason why I am keeping my vote on him though. A nuance that has to be made.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nin other words, mme and i are playing similarly. we voted someone we thought suspicious, and then kept the vote due to what occurred next. so again, no real reason for mme to be concerned with me unless he is actually lobsters scum buddy. <br>\n<br>\nthen the krew downard spiral begins.<br>\n<br>\nlobster 89 is YET ANOTHER ENTIRELY USELESS POST.<br>\n<br>\nkrew votes lobster. lobster wagon has steam.<br>\n<br>\nspad votes krew? generally speaking, when players ask to be lynched, its a good idea to lynch them. i think is common site wide knowledge. its not always the case, and krews vote is quick and on a growing wagon, but whatever. mme questions the vote as well. all part of the krew spiral.<br>\n<br>\nlobster 97. reactive. no analysis. no content. solely posting defensively.<br>\n<br>\nkrew 98 is a good statement.<br>\n<br>\nMS votes krew for \"defensiveness\"? hm. this is an interesting wild card.

That's not really the first thing that comes to most peoples minds when playing low-player games like this.

He was serious.  <br>\n<br>\nSerious enough to try and get others to counter claim- but that was more 'after' I had posted last in this thread, so maybe that garners a mention from me now, but really, it's already been talked about, not necessarily to death, but still.; with no one bothered about it.<br>\n<br>\nWhich kind of bothers me... a little.  But!  I can kind of rest easy, knowing that if there is an actual doctor out there, and he/she not being Sleep, he/she is keeping their big mouth shut- which is smart, because, again, like it's been mentioned before I think,, if Sleep isn't the real doctor- he's more then possibly dead by next night phase anyways. <br>\n<br>\nSoo, that's kind of the rub down right there.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, yeah.  I kind of still feel 'eh' about the whole him being an actual doctor, but do you want to risk him actually turning up one this day phase if he were to be lynched?

I do not understand your type of differentiation you're making. I'm pretty sure that if any dead townie should still have an impact on this game, it should be IS. My opinion is that IS was killed for a reason, while dj was killed by at least 3 townies. You didn't want to listen to him at the time of the lynch, what did his death change about the case he was making? Pretty sure IS' death is more significant in the light of his case than dj's death in the light of his case.<br>\n<br>\nSo, shortened: why should we \"follow dj\" and not IS?", "time": "Wed May 25, 2011 11:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17378&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "17378"}

His push on Lobster was bad, he has been quite defensive throughout this game, and of course he would claim doctor if he was scum, that is pretty much the standard scum response to being pushed to claim. If there is no doctor, there would be no CC of course, and he would be able to use this to get a free ride. So it is either out the doctor or the town probably thinks that he is the doctor. Obvious play by scum is obvious. And I think that is exactly what he did here. If the scum have day talk, or even if they were allowed to talk pre-game, he could have easily have been coached to leave that crumb behind the way he did. And the last reason why I think SK is scum is setup speculation. What I know of my own role makes it rather improbable IMO that there would be a doctor in this setup. Consider my vote on SK, but I dont want this day to end quite so soon so I am not going to put him at L-1.<br>\n<br>\nIn other news, MME was looking good up until day 2 started. Then he basically \"followed the dead guy\" and suddenly out of the blue this slot becomes suspect #1, with no real suspicion cast this way previously. On top of that, his defense of SK is bad as well. Since there probably are only 2 scum in this setup, MME didnt like the idea of having to go to LYLO by himself, and threw all his support behind his buddy. Obviously this would be risky, but LYLO would come much sooner with both of them alive, and from what I can tell this is the option he went with.", "time": "Thu May 26, 2011 11:37 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17378&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "17378"}
