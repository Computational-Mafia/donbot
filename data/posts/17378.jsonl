The community was a calm, but tight one and people didn't mind helping each other. When the parents went to work, the elders of the village would look after their children. When disaster struck and someone broke a leg, people would help him or her out in their daily work. During the usually sunny weekends, the center of the town was full of people talking and children playing. Even if it did happen to be bad weather, this wouldn't stop them from going over to someone elses place to enjoy the weekend together.<br><br>This all changed when on a sunday morning, a man was found in front of the church. He had been shot. Distrust spread through the town, but they decided they wouldn't need outside help now. Like always, they would solve it themselves.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rules</span> (original by Flameaxe)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General:</span><br><br>1) Have a jolly good time.<br>2) The mod is always right. Deal with it.<br>3) If you have a problem with something regarding the game, please PM me, try to keep it out of the thread.<br>4) Vote in the format <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Flinter</span>. Unvoting before voting is cool, but if you forget, don't worry about it.<br>5) Do not quote role PMs or any other form of communication with me. Failure to comply will result in a modkill.<br>6) Keep the game in the game. Don't discuss the game outside of the game unless your role says you can. I will find out. I have people. Those people have people.<br>7) When you are dead, get out of my thread. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> I rhymed! No \"bah\" posts.<br>8) Please do not use small/invisible text, steganography or advanced forms of coding/cryptography. Breadcrumbing is an acceptable form of basic coding.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadlines and Activity:</span><br><br>9) Each game day will have deadlines as I see fit. If the day seems to be dragging, I will announce a deadline. Any deadline will be at least seven days from the issuing.<br>10) If no majority is reached at the deadline, no-lynch will be achieved and lynched like the scumbag he/she/it is!<br>11) I am would like all of you to be active. If a player goes without a post for 48 hours, they will receive a prod. If no reply IN THREAD is made 48 hours after the prod was given, i will begin searching for a replacement. If you post during the period between searching for a replacement and finding a replacement, you are welcome to stay, but do not expect me to be as lenient after that situation.<br>12) If you plan on being away from modern civilization for more than 48 hours, let me know via PM.<br>13) Night phase will have a deadline of no more than 4 days (give or take a few hours if I am not around). No submission, no action. Four days should be plenty of time.<br>14) This game is a closed setup with a day start.<br>15) A lynch will require a majority of players voting to be successful. However, a no lynch only requires 50% of the alive players to go through. For example, with 24 people alive, it will take 13 to lynch, but only 12 to no lynch.<br>16) If any of these rules are broken, and a modkill is performed, the player will automatically lose no matter the outcome.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">example vanilla role pm;</span><br><br>you are a vanilla town.

Though I don't see that he's doing this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>MME(Yeah I can call you that ^^) wrote:</cite>1. Deflective about giving your opinion about someone.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>I do not see him accusing don and myself of having \"some chemistry\". Any chemistry between us in this topic is of a non-existing nature. Outside the topic, it's a mad man-love festival.<br><br>Joking aside, this was not why I went on raud for not giving his opinion about people. Let me demonstrate what I mean, by providing you with quotes.<br><blockquote><div><cite>raud wrote:</cite>It wasn't a question that he was answering to, it was acting as if he had been voted when no reference to him had been made at all. Odd. Scummy though? Does redtail make a habit of taking a RVS vote towards someone as a threat no matter his alliance? I haven't a breeze.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>raud wrote:</cite>Also, it may be nothing but don_johnson following you immediately? Is there some sort of meta here?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>raud wrote:</cite>I've made 5 posts, and you think I'm scum already? Interesting to say the least, especially considering how not everyone has posted since the game has officially started.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>raud wrote:</cite>I don't think that you're scum yet, but I'm keeping an eye on you.</div></blockquote><br>Read below for elaboration:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>spadille wrote:</cite>@Raud<br><blockquote><div><cite>Raud wrote:</cite>Also, it may be nothing but don_johnson following you immediately? Is there some sort of meta here?</div></blockquote><br>This is you assuming that they are scumteam, no?</div></blockquote><br>No, this is him doing two of the things I'm accusing him of.<br>1. Not following through on his accusations. He accuses, or attempts to accuse, don johnson of bandwagoning or he accuses us of teaming together, not sure which one he means. But that is irrelevant. The issue is that he outs an accusation towards someone and then follows it by a phrase that makes his accusation seem less serious. This is leaving himself some wiggling room, something he did somewhere else as well:<br><blockquote><div><cite>raud wrote:</cite>I fail to see anything that would make you [MME] think I'm scum in those posts. I don't think that you're [MME] scum yet, but I'm keeping an eye on you [MME].</div></blockquote><br><br>2. Egging on someone else while he is being put in the spotlight. <br>Don't get me wrong, I do not think someone under pressure should not out suspicions towards someone else. But it's more the way that it's done. And by that I mean:<br>a. the wording is off: \"it may be nothing\". That wiggling room again.<br>b. it's not the only time that he did it, making it a pattern. Yes, I'm calling 2 out of 6 posts a pattern. Guess what else is becoming a pattern?"}

I skimmed his iso's in both games and his playstyle varied a lot in between them. In the one where he was more aggressive, he was scum and in the one where he was town, he was lurking like in this game.

Because 2 games don't make a real meta. Because meta as the only argument to not vote someone is meh. And because well, my gut says he's scum.<br>And why am I not voting lobster?

Please give me a reason why would he keep his RVS when someone else is doing scummy things?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>i don't think raud did anything scummy enough to warrant the switch. the questions? sure, but there was no need to switch votes, especially with the excuse of \"let's pick up the pace\". a 2 vote bandwagon on page 1 is plenty of \"pace\". moving off of it actually slows the game down. so to me, it was an odd post all around when you really look at it. but whatever.<br><br>note: spad jumps the lobster wagon.<br><br>redtail's 53 is actually a non-sequitur directed at me. he takes two unrelated posts of mine and tries to tie them together. me pointing out that raud looks bad, has no real effect on why i think lobster is scum at that point because rt is ignoring the context of my posts. i later explain my feelings on the raud/mme fiasco, but when i reread this, i can't help but wonder why these statements are tied together.<br><br>lobster 54 is another useless post. it voices support for what could become the leading bandwagon, and provides no analysis.<br><br>mme 55 should be paid attention to.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>I did what you are accusing lobster of not doing and now you say this? Sense it makes none.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>and again, i point it out because mme jumped off the wagon for something that imo, was not scummy. he also did so with the words \"let's pick up the pace,\" when in reality, his actions slowed the game and removed pressure from a player. but whatever. mme should not be worried that i say something like this <span style=\"font-style: italic\">unless</span> he is lobster's scum partner, which further strengthens said theory of why mme jumped off the lobster wagon in the first place.<br><br>post 57: redtail agrees with dj. the lobster wagon is growing.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>redtail: yes. raud still looks bad, but it is more about his response to pressure and the \"dogpile\" approach mme applied. so its more like i think he's being made out to look bad, than actually being scummy. his inability to do anything is odd.<br><br>sleepykrew is reading like lurkerscum. we'll have to wait and see.</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ more explanations of dj's thought process. please note, krew is the next post. can anyone say \"beetlejuice\"?<br><br>post 61: mme explains himself.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>My point was that you're accusing lobster of not putting his vote where his mouth was on raud, but leaving it on his random vote.

I don't like lobsters play so far. I don't think your initial reason for leaving him was all that legitimate. Though rauds reaction was suspect, your reasoning for voting him in the first place was not much better than an rvs vote. But that's just my opinion.<br><br>Krew: it has nothing to do with you being online, its the content of your post that leads me to my opinion. I can break it down for you if you like?</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ again, more explanations from dj.<br><br>spad notices it in 68. agrees with dj. again.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>I don't think he's making a big deal out of it, I think there's a misinterpretation of what happened. Is the misinterpretation on purpose or not? I'm not sure at this stage.</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ here, mme agrees with me that i am not \"making a big deal\" out of the issue that krew is accusing me of. don't you guys find it odd that so many of you were agreeing with so many things i posted early on, but now i am at L-1? oh well.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>Tell me again. Why lobster and not raud?</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ kind of irrelevant and repetitive seeing as how i already explained this. i think the major issue is our different interpretations of raud and lobsters rvs votes. lobster copied a post on page 1 to supply his rvs vote. i didn't find rauds to be \"suspect\". further, i felt that raud was \"dogpiled\" in a way, and the next few spad posts detail that well. go check them out.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mme wrote:</cite>Honestly, voting someone for an rvs vote is not a case. The case was made afterwards and wiggling room became my main point. As said multiple times in this post. But you are right, it's not the reason I voted for him.

It is literally burried in between tens of accusations against redtail. I read through IS' iso just now and I do not even recall seeing that quote (yes, I know it's there, no need to point it out). Why are you voting sleepy? And why are you pulling IS' quote out of context to either justify or strengthen your vote when it is actually diminishing the point you're making?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@spadille</span><br>I'm also very interested in why you chose to \"follow dj\" and not IS (or your own thoughts for what they're worth). I do not understand your type of differentiation you're making. I'm pretty sure that if any dead townie should still have an impact on this game, it should be IS. My opinion is that IS was killed for a reason, while dj was killed by at least 3 townies. You didn't want to listen to him at the time of the lynch, what did his death change about the case he was making? Pretty sure IS' death is more significant in the light of his case than dj's death in the light of his case.<br><br>So, shortened: why should we \"follow dj\" and not IS?"}

I think SleepyKrew is scum. His push on Lobster was bad, he has been quite defensive throughout this game, and of course he would claim doctor if he was scum, that is pretty much the standard scum response to being pushed to claim. If there is no doctor, there would be no CC of course, and he would be able to use this to get a free ride. So it is either out the doctor or the town probably thinks that he is the doctor. Obvious play by scum is obvious. And I think that is exactly what he did here. If the scum have day talk, or even if they were allowed to talk pre-game, he could have easily have been coached to leave that crumb behind the way he did. And the last reason why I think SK is scum is setup speculation. What I know of my own role makes it rather improbable IMO that there would be a doctor in this setup. Consider my vote on SK, but I dont want this day to end quite so soon so I am not going to put him at L-1.<br><br>In other news, MME was looking good up until day 2 started. Then he basically \"followed the dead guy\" and suddenly out of the blue this slot becomes suspect #1, with no real suspicion cast this way previously. On top of that, his defense of SK is bad as well. Since there probably are only 2 scum in this setup, MME didnt like the idea of having to go to LYLO by himself, and threw all his support behind his buddy. Obviously this would be risky, but LYLO would come much sooner with both of them alive, and from what I can tell this is the option he went with."}

When you are not in a game where you know what the roles are going to be (open) or what they are probably going to be (newbie), you need to think of what roles are likely to go together in a given setup. I think it is terribly unlikely that my role and a doc would go together. Combine that with Sleepy's scummy-as-hell play, evasiveness, and refusal to answer my questions, and that leads me to believe that Sleepy is scum. You said that this is your first foray into non-newbie games. In newbie games, you are told what roles are likely to be given in the game. That isnt the case in closed normals, where setup speculation plays a large part. And in my opinion, Sleepy is obvscum.<br><br>Your vote is bad Spadille.

The simple fact is though that he buddied with MME far before he could have had an innocent on him if he is a night cop, which IMO is a scumtell. He never denied buddying him either, and he said that he only did because he had MME as a confirmed innocent. And look at how desperate he was to QL me today directly after his \"guilty\" on me, without any kind of discussion or without seeing how my \"buddies\" would react to a \"guilty\" on me."}
