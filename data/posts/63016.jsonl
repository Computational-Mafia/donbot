The answer you will get when asking is likely to be more informative, as i also then have whatever clues, I can get from your question about what was missing from the original that I assumed was in your head but wasn't. For instance if you don't get GROK, and haven't read the chapter of GEB about record players, this text may fall on deaf ears.<br>\nDo note I spent 10 years reading and rereading GEB before I groked what i do of it.

This is a pretty basic scum-tell, and cognizance of such goes hand-in-hand with reading the game through the lens of scum-mindset vs. town-mindset. it's pretty easy to spot, if you know what you're looking for. which I do.<br>\n<br>\n- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152292#p7152292\">115</a> being more concerned about regulating others' behavior than finding scum.<br>\n<br>\n- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152292#p7152292\">115</a> using \"it's just gut\" as a reason for thinking someone's town.<br>\n<br>\n- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152292#p7152292\">115</a> using filler like \"it's nothing that will stop the presses, but for the time being\" which is something scum do when trying to pad out their posts to make them longer (EVEN though he's been quite vocal at this point about wanting to cut down on \"unmanageable\"-ness in the game thread)<br>\n<br>\n- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152311#p7152311\">119</a> being more concerned with making a connection with singer, than with being transparent and useful about his intentions. It's also pretty cryptic, which is the \"hey let's share a secret\" factor.

It's fairly obvious by now that notscience either has an EXTREME napoleon complex (my definition being the same as wikipedia: \"characterized by overly-aggressive or domineering social behavior, and carries the implication that such behaviour is compensatory\"), or, far more simply, is scum and is trying to throw his weight around to make sure things happen like he wants, while at the same time, patting townies who are his site-friends on the back and trying to use them to accomplish his ends.<br>\n<br>\n- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152502#p7152502\">135</a> and #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153634#p7153634\">142</a> asking Axle questions about being ESL and about VCA.

Zakk witness me fight against a really stubborn town for one of my scumreads, but at least they seemed to believe LLD's outbursts were town driven and could explain that to me. I can understand why Zakk can't just take our word for it.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I honestly couldn't really explain what I think is ~so town~ from Notty.

Like at all. You've set up a scenario where my answer to this one question will determine your vote, proven by what you said when you unvoted me. Putting aside the fact that you don't seem to have anything to say about my play besides your one stretched assumption, if you were actually trying to figure out my alignment, you wouldn't have asked this question. You already know the answer, I bolded it.<br>\n<br>\nYour unvote was an attempt to look towny while you waited for my answer.

I'm actuallly pretty decent at reading Sonic outside of him being in a hydra. I already explained why I was townreading him in the beginning and how I don't have much merit in my townread because it was based off meta which sonic can easily exploit. I have seen him be like this as both alignments tbh, but lately he's more active as scum and less active as town.

(my hiding in the bleechers stuff)<br>\nI am currently looking for a least bad end to the day, if I cant get Zakk to fly/swing.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEither that or we PL people <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7155753#p7155753\">196</a>.  In fact I dont, mind the idea of a proper forum PLing people. I don't like that getting subverted, for actual discrediting such as BBT did in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152160#p7152160\">104</a> contradicting <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152066#p7152066\">102</a>. So in practice for while I have been against scum abusing the PL process. I also would prefer PLing voluntary choice driven behaviors, rather than simply PLing people for who they are. That seems BAD, not just scummy, but actually BAD, the kind that doesnt wash off when the game ends. So for it seems to be a dangerous slope to play on.", "time": "Sat Aug 22, 2015 12:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63016&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "63016"}

Hops hops his way from the doorstep to the front yard, where the other frogs have gathered in a circle around two trees.<br>\n<br>\nThere they all stand, butts facing the center of the circle doing their customary booty dance, invented by the frog with the largest ass ever, Barry Ponds (AKA - Beep). The booty dance gets faster and faster, and the frogs start all croaking and ribbiting in unison. Vanilla (bean), vanilla (milkshake), (bad) vanilla, and vanilla (turkey) then form a frog tower, one standing on top of the other.<br>\n<br>\nHops hands Skip the drawstring. Skip skips his way up the frog tower, secures the drawstring to one branch of the right-most tree, and sets the noose.<br>\n<br>\nThen the frogs disband their sacred booty dance, rush into the house, and surround the victim. The victim is excited to see the frogs, for that is what he lives for. Unfortunately for him, little does he realize they will also be the death of him.<br>\n<br>\nThe frogs smother their victim and force him outside, just like the victim has done to them many times over.<br>\n<br>\nWith all their collective frog strength, they hoist him up into the noose, then let go.<br>\n<br>\nThe puppeteer is no more.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Flip</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#40FF40\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MaxwellPuckett was Fro99er<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aTZnO7K.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\n</div></div></div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:Red\"><div style=\"font-size: 250%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">a Mafia Encryptor</div></div></div></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#40FF40\">Please PM me with any night actions!

You said, literally, right there... that you were TOWNREADING zakk. So why is it strange that I would be townreading him???? <br>\n<br>\nYou had a slight townread from me before because I remember liking one of your few posts, but your conclusion here is just ridiculous. I'm kind of baffled that no one but Axle brought up this post, and even then he didn't really seem to have a problem with it.<br>\n<br>\nZakk is probably town, and besides that, I was getting kind of pissed at him being called a VI, or his posting style being called bad or useless, when that wasn't what I was seeing in his later play. It's kind of a thing for me, I don't like seeing people get insulted.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing that gives me pause is that you unvoted to hear me out, but your original question breaks down if you look at it critically. Like at all. You've set up a scenario where my answer to this one question will determine your vote, proven by what you said when you unvoted me. Putting aside the fact that you don't seem to have anything to say about my play besides your one stretched assumption, if you were actually trying to figure out my alignment, you wouldn't have asked this question. You already know the answer, I bolded it.<br>\n<br>\nYour unvote was an attempt to look towny while you waited for my answer. I'm sure, after this, you will say, 'okay, I was right, bringing Max up to L-1'.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Shiro</span><br>\n<br>\nVeeGee isn't priority, considering his play's usually like this. Backburner I guess, and I don't like leaving players like this to late-game, but.. eh.<br>\n<br>\nMetal Sonic is a better lynch, I'm still waiting for him to weigh in on.. everything. A better lynch than Sonic, but a worse lynch than Shiro, is Malakittens. I'm also liking BBT less as the day goes on. AxleGreaser is very probably town, as is zakk. Singersigner remains one of the few people on my wagon whose vote actually feels legitimate, so I'm forced to reevaluate how I was reading her.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally:<br>\nI'm a VT.<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT: While writing this, I saw that Shiro actually, *gasp* posted something about me that isn't this post. I'll check it out.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHonestly scum is between {BBT, Sonic, Ika &amp; Shadowez}.<br>\n<br>\nScum usually put their buddies between the middle section, one on the higher read of the scale and one towards the middle.<br>\n<br>\nif I had to pick it would be Sonic &lt; Ika &lt; Shadowez &lt; BBT<br>\n<br>\nShiro is definitely town. Scorpi is probably town due to the number slip, if he was scum he'd know how many scum there were exactly. Singer is my strongest townread, followed by notty. Veegee is probably town due to the CW (granted this is my weakest townread). <br>\n<br>\nI'd vote Ika, but IDK where he stands in the VC. I'm also really wanting a Sonic lynch. Mainly because of the way <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>A better lynch than Sonic, but a worse lynch than Shiro, is Malakittens.</div></blockquote>.<br>\nThis post bothered me then and it bothers me now.

It feels like she's faking emotional outbursts for no apparent reason, and regarding Ika's reason for townreading her, she was hardly scumreading him. And I understand your point that her post to max seems unlikely scum/scum but if she'd done that to other players to and not them that would be a pretty big smoking gun.", "time": "Wed Aug 26, 2015 6:12 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63016&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "63016"}

So why is it strange that I would be townreading him???? <br>\n<br>\nYou had a slight townread from me before because I remember liking one of your few posts, but your conclusion here is just ridiculous. I'm kind of baffled that no one but Axle brought up this post, and even then he didn't really seem to have a problem with it.<br>\n<br>\nZakk is probably town, and besides that, I was getting kind of pissed at him being called a VI, or his posting style being called bad or useless, when that wasn't what I was seeing in his later play. It's kind of a thing for me, I don't like seeing people get insulted.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing that gives me pause is that you unvoted to hear me out, but your original question breaks down if you look at it critically. Like at all. You've set up a scenario where my answer to this one question will determine your vote, proven by what you said when you unvoted me. Putting aside the fact that you don't seem to have anything to say about my play besides your one stretched assumption, if you were actually trying to figure out my alignment, you wouldn't have asked this question. You already know the answer, I bolded it.<br>\n<br>\nYour unvote was an attempt to look towny while you waited for my answer.

A better lynch than Sonic, but a worse lynch than Shiro, is Malakittens. I'm also liking BBT less as the day goes on. AxleGreaser is very probably town, as is zakk.

I'm also noticing that a lot of Shiro's posts are based on either meta or associative tells, which unless you know the alignment of one (or more) of those involved are purely WIFOM.

{"number": 1425, "id": "7210569", "user": "zakk", "user_id": "22459", "content": "Okay, this will be the best post of the game. Guaranteed.<br>\n<br>\nHere's how I see things.<br>\n<br>\nN1: Mala would have to have either jailed scum, or jailed who scum tried to kill. assuming scum tried to kill you, that's fair, seeing as you more or less led the lynch on Nosferatu/Maxwell. also, it strains rational thought to believe scum would begin a no-kill gambit on N1 in a normal. even though they lost their encryptor (which I doubt is their only power role, seeing as we appear to have a JK, a rolecop, and a backup rolecop).<br>\n<br>\nN2: Mala said she jailed BBT, who heavily suspected scorpious. she also pre-hinted that BBT would be jailed. i think it's likely that scorpious could have not caught that (as I didn't either). it is really likely Scorpious would have targeted BBT, as BBT was one of the largest proponents of his lynch. And as the last scum player alive after Shiro was lynched D2, he had to play survivalistically. Which he's been doing again, today, voting Mala (only way she'll die, because he can't kill her if she blocks him again, and it's a good bet she will/would if we don't/didn't lynch one of them) or voting me (the only other remote possibility, given Mala's \"freaken hate\" for me, and given AxleGreaser's pigheadedness (sorry, lol). So everything is consistent with Scorpious being scum and making all the choices he needs to, to survive.<br>\n<br>\nN3: Mala said she jailed Scorpious. There was no kill. This is entirely consistent with Scorpious being scum and just not catching the \"you're next BBT\" soft by Mala. Scorpious as scum would probably try to kill Mala as a claimed JK. And by probably, I mean definitely.<br>\n<br>\nSo really, all signs point to Scorpious. As ridiculous as Mala is being, especially since she's supposed to KNOW she's a JK and there should be no doubt in her mind of other shenaniganery going down... again, it really strains the mind to think that scum got blocked on D1, and then was SO confident that they thought they could hang Mala out to dry, as well as everyone she blocked. I would think scum would keep trying to kill. I know I would. Again, just because it's POSSIBLE does not mean it is PROBABLE.<br>\n<br>\nI assume Scorpious tried as a last ditch effort to kill Mala last night, and got blocked.<br>\n<br>\nSo really, we've been handed the game on a silver platter. And a lot of it's just blind luck on Mala's part. Haha<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Scorpious</span> -- I'm final.

Checking the wiki shows that godfathers will appear as godfathers to rolecops in normal games.<br>\n<br>\nAfter we know results we cross reference them all, and do Process of Elimination.<br>\n<br>\nWhoever is left, gets thrown in a pool. We agree who's the scummiest, and lynch them. My claim is partially corroborated by us having a crapload of power roles to role cop. My claim is also partially corroborated by metal Sonic's claim. It doesn't make sense to have a town backup rolecop get powers from lynching a scum full rolecop unless scum would possibly get something enabled from a town flip as well. Having a JK, Ascetic Cop, Rolecop, and Backup Rolecop is really powerful for town, and scum don't have a roleblocker unless it's Scorpius and the JK resolves first or cancels out. Therefore, the only thing that would make sense for scum to even CLOSE to match town's power, would be Encryptor AND godfather. And Scorpius' VT claim is entirely in line with that.<br>\n<br>\nPersonally I think Scorpius is a godfather, and I was right in this post:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7210569#p7210569\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7210569#p7210569\" data-post-id=\"7210569\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1425</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22459\">zakk</a> wrote:</cite>Okay, this will be the best post of the game. Guaranteed.<br>\n<br>\nHere's how I see things.<br>\n<br>\nN1: Mala would have to have either jailed scum, or jailed who scum tried to kill. assuming scum tried to kill you, that's fair, seeing as you more or less led the lynch on Nosferatu/Maxwell. also, it strains rational thought to believe scum would begin a no-kill gambit on N1 in a normal. even though they lost their encryptor (which I doubt is their only power role, seeing as we appear to have a JK, a rolecop, and a backup rolecop).<br>\n<br>\nN2: Mala said she jailed BBT, who heavily suspected scorpious. she also pre-hinted that BBT would be jailed. i think it's likely that scorpious could have not caught that (as I didn't either). it is really likely Scorpious would have targeted BBT, as BBT was one of the largest proponents of his lynch. And as the last scum player alive after Shiro was lynched D2, he had to play survivalistically. Which he's been doing again, today, voting Mala (only way she'll die, because he can't kill her if she blocks him again, and it's a good bet she will/would if we don't/didn't lynch one of them) or voting me (the only other remote possibility, given Mala's \"freaken hate\" for me, and given AxleGreaser's pigheadedness (sorry, lol). So everything is consistent with Scorpious being scum and making all the choices he needs to, to survive.<br>\n<br>\nN3: Mala said she jailed Scorpious. There was no kill. This is entirely consistent with Scorpious being scum and just not catching the \"you're next BBT\" soft by Mala. Scorpious as scum would probably try to kill Mala as a claimed JK. And by probably, I mean definitely.<br>\n<br>\nSo really, all signs point to Scorpious. As ridiculous as Mala is being, especially since she's supposed to KNOW she's a JK and there should be no doubt in her mind of other shenaniganery going down... again, it really strains the mind to think that scum got blocked on D1, and then was SO confident that they thought they could hang Mala out to dry, as well as everyone she blocked. I would think scum would keep trying to kill. I know I would. Again, just because it's POSSIBLE does not mean it is PROBABLE.<br>\n<br>\nI assume Scorpious tried as a last ditch effort to kill Mala last night, and got blocked.<br>\n<br>\nSo really, we've been handed the game on a silver platter. And a lot of it's just blind luck on Mala's part. Haha<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Scorpious</span> -- I'm final.

Jail - followed by death. This ensures Croaker never creates this mess again.<br>\n<br>\nAfter jailing Croaker, peace and harmony returns to the frog army.
