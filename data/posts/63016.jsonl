Not in any normal sense. I grew up speaking English, and my parents were measurably excellent at the English language.(top few %)<br>Strangely however when I was about 23 I found out my native language was C++. (or basically any computer language, except for some reason prolog.)<br>So that might explain some of it.<br>Also we are playing game, where who understands what, and why they do, is important.<br><br>I have a very different set of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability\" class=\"postlink\">priors</a> to most everybody, hence I am in fact translating from how I think and the background knowledge I have and can assume, and having to work out or guess which bits need saying and which bits don't. If you read chapter in book called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach\" class=\"postlink\">GEB</a>, about record players, and <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grok\" class=\"postlink\">GROK</a> it. You will realise that  significant part of the music/(idea conveyed) is not in the words/music but is in the device used to play it.  Thus when i am unsure of which bits inside my head that i am entirely  used to are also inside yours it makes it hard. That its hard is also a distinguishing feature between those trying to understand me and those trying to lynch me. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> In game recently where i was scum I suggested that if people didn't understand something and wanted to they should ask. The answer you will get when asking is likely to be more informative, as i also then have whatever clues, I can get from your question about what was missing from the original that I assumed was in your head but wasn't. For instance if you don't get GROK, and haven't read the chapter of GEB about record players, this text may fall on deaf ears.<br>Do note I spent 10 years reading and rereading GEB before I groked what i do of it. So reading that chapter right now may not help.<br><br>Still look like ESL?</div></div></div>"}

This is a pretty basic scum-tell, and cognizance of such goes hand-in-hand with reading the game through the lens of scum-mindset vs. town-mindset. it's pretty easy to spot, if you know what you're looking for. which I do.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152292#p7152292\">115</a> being more concerned about regulating others' behavior than finding scum.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152292#p7152292\">115</a> using \"it's just gut\" as a reason for thinking someone's town.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152292#p7152292\">115</a> using filler like \"it's nothing that will stop the presses, but for the time being\" which is something scum do when trying to pad out their posts to make them longer (EVEN though he's been quite vocal at this point about wanting to cut down on \"unmanageable\"-ness in the game thread)<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152311#p7152311\">119</a> being more concerned with making a connection with singer, than with being transparent and useful about his intentions. It's also pretty cryptic, which is the \"hey let's share a secret\" factor. Bonus: This interaction also only makes sense if notscience KNOWS singer is town, 100%, than with any other case of alignments (both town, or SS-scum/NS-town). Please tell me you're noticing these things, before you call notscience town.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152415#p7152415\">129</a> and #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152476#p7152476\">132</a> being nothing but trying to control someone else's interactions with the game through threats. It's fairly obvious by now that notscience either has an EXTREME napoleon complex (my definition being the same as wikipedia: \"characterized by overly-aggressive or domineering social behavior, and carries the implication that such behaviour is compensatory\"), or, far more simply, is scum and is trying to throw his weight around to make sure things happen like he wants, while at the same time, patting townies who are his site-friends on the back and trying to use them to accomplish his ends.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7152502#p7152502\">135</a> and #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153634#p7153634\">142</a> asking Axle questions about being ESL and about VCA. In other words, things that are pretty irrelevant to the game and give notscience something to talk about which is, again, alignment-unindicative.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153739#p7153739\">148</a> distancing from \"things I do as scum\" (another relatively basic scum tell, which anyone here should spot easily enough).<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7154229#p7154229\">158</a> being another example of the napoleon complex present, whether it's real or simply a tool used to accomplish more nefarious ends. I mean... \"MS do I need to warn you too?\" lolwut, he's not the moderator, you get zero credit for wearing the biggest pair of pants. you get credit for having something worth wearing big pants FOR, which clearly he does not. therefore any such threats are useless.<br><br>- notscience's #<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7154232#p7154232\">160</a> devolving the game to the point of baiting, joking around instead of scumhunting. (in other words, filling up the thread with yet more posts which have nothing to do with the alignments of the players therein. obligatory: by the way,... etc.)<br><br><br>Mala, you think you know notscience so well? Good.<br><br>I'm highly interested to know your opinions of these things. Thanks."}

Announcing that it's not something he (and his confidence that he can make that happen stems from know I feel the same way and will be stubborn about it) will tolerate isn't anti-town because it's warning you ahead of time what he will be watching out for. I've taken to the same practice and advocate for policy lynches (more so in larges, but D1 PLs in minis aren't terrible either).<br><br>The fact is, we both feel that scum can hide in spam, whether town does it, or scum do it so much they hide their BS.

Here he has a much more earnest kind of play, in a way that can look sloppy when it comes to judgements that are based on emotion rather than logic.<br><br>Granted, I don't think he's necessarily driven on emotion rather than logic, it's just that's the feeling I'm getting from his posts.<br><br>@BBT...where are you? You usually dominate games I've seen you in. What're your reads?"}

Which posts in particular do you feel are generic? Right now I want to sort those out whom I know to get their thoughts etc so I can work out the newer players. I never said I was a shining beacon of town, but I wasn't sure what I am doing that is so scummy though either. :\\<br><br>I ahven't really seen you tried to sort me out either.

So in practice for while I have been against scum abusing the PL process. I also would prefer PLing voluntary choice driven behaviors, rather than simply PLing people for who they are. That seems BAD, not just scummy, but actually BAD, the kind that doesnt wash off when the game ends. So for it seems to be a dangerous slope to play on."}

I get what you're saying about Max coming in and seeming curious, etc, but replacements are inherently town-sided because they see things the original players didn't. I think someone who's not a shit player can take advantage of that as scum and assess what they need to assess since they're given the time to do so as a replacement.

Is there some sort of role (town or scum) that would cause some sort of post restriction (such as \"Queen Singer\" being in x number of posts)?<br><br>VeeGee has also done absolutely nothing this game, and my case against him from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7156844#p7156844\">245</a> is even more apparent now.

I'm kind of baffled that no one but Axle brought up this post, and even then he didn't really seem to have a problem with it.<br><br>Zakk is probably town, and besides that, I was getting kind of pissed at him being called a VI, or his posting style being called bad or useless, when that wasn't what I was seeing in his later play. It's kind of a thing for me, I don't like seeing people get insulted.<br><br>The only thing that gives me pause is that you unvoted to hear me out, but your original question breaks down if you look at it critically. Like at all. You've set up a scenario where my answer to this one question will determine your vote, proven by what you said when you unvoted me. Putting aside the fact that you don't seem to have anything to say about my play besides your one stretched assumption, if you were actually trying to figure out my alignment, you wouldn't have asked this question. You already know the answer, I bolded it.<br><br>Your unvote was an attempt to look towny while you waited for my answer.

A better lynch than Sonic, but a worse lynch than Shiro, is Malakittens. I'm also liking BBT less as the day goes on. AxleGreaser is very probably town, as is zakk.

I was just reviewing my post, and realized I just left off at the end of my blurb about her, because I initially had a vote in there, then deleted that to vote VeeGee and never replaced it with any sort of read or review.  I'm also noticing that a lot of Shiro's posts are based on either meta or associative tells, which unless you know the alignment of one (or more) of those involved are purely WIFOM.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7155146#p7155146\">166</a> you address Mala about NS, she replies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7155468#p7155468\">173</a>, no more from you.

Guaranteed.<br><br>Here's how I see things.<br><br>N1: Mala would have to have either jailed scum, or jailed who scum tried to kill. assuming scum tried to kill you, that's fair, seeing as you more or less led the lynch on Nosferatu/Maxwell. also, it strains rational thought to believe scum would begin a no-kill gambit on N1 in a normal. even though they lost their encryptor (which I doubt is their only power role, seeing as we appear to have a JK, a rolecop, and a backup rolecop).<br><br>N2: Mala said she jailed BBT, who heavily suspected scorpious. she also pre-hinted that BBT would be jailed. i think it's likely that scorpious could have not caught that (as I didn't either). it is really likely Scorpious would have targeted BBT, as BBT was one of the largest proponents of his lynch. And as the last scum player alive after Shiro was lynched D2, he had to play survivalistically. Which he's been doing again, today, voting Mala (only way she'll die, because he can't kill her if she blocks him again, and it's a good bet she will/would if we don't/didn't lynch one of them) or voting me (the only other remote possibility, given Mala's \"freaken hate\" for me, and given AxleGreaser's pigheadedness (sorry, lol). So everything is consistent with Scorpious being scum and making all the choices he needs to, to survive.<br><br>N3: Mala said she jailed Scorpious. There was no kill. This is entirely consistent with Scorpious being scum and just not catching the \"you're next BBT\" soft by Mala. Scorpious as scum would probably try to kill Mala as a claimed JK. And by probably, I mean definitely.<br><br>So really, all signs point to Scorpious. As ridiculous as Mala is being, especially since she's supposed to KNOW she's a JK and there should be no doubt in her mind of other shenaniganery going down... again, it really strains the mind to think that scum got blocked on D1, and then was SO confident that they thought they could hang Mala out to dry, as well as everyone she blocked. I would think scum would keep trying to kill. I know I would. Again, just because it's POSSIBLE does not mean it is PROBABLE.<br><br>I assume Scorpious tried as a last ditch effort to kill Mala last night, and got blocked.<br><br>So really, we've been handed the game on a silver platter. And a lot of it's just blind luck on Mala's part. Haha<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Scorpious</span> -- I'm final.

Checking the wiki shows that godfathers will appear as godfathers to rolecops in normal games.<br><br>After we know results we cross reference them all, and do Process of Elimination.<br><br>Whoever is left, gets thrown in a pool. We agree who's the scummiest, and lynch them. My claim is partially corroborated by us having a crapload of power roles to role cop. My claim is also partially corroborated by metal Sonic's claim. It doesn't make sense to have a town backup rolecop get powers from lynching a scum full rolecop unless scum would possibly get something enabled from a town flip as well. Having a JK, Ascetic Cop, Rolecop, and Backup Rolecop is really powerful for town, and scum don't have a roleblocker unless it's Scorpius and the JK resolves first or cancels out. Therefore, the only thing that would make sense for scum to even CLOSE to match town's power, would be Encryptor AND godfather. And Scorpius' VT claim is entirely in line with that.<br><br>Personally I think Scorpius is a godfather, and I was right in this post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7210569#p7210569\" class=\"postlink\">post 1425</a>, zakk wrote:</cite>Okay, this will be the best post of the game. Guaranteed.<br><br>Here's how I see things.<br><br>N1: Mala would have to have either jailed scum, or jailed who scum tried to kill. assuming scum tried to kill you, that's fair, seeing as you more or less led the lynch on Nosferatu/Maxwell. also, it strains rational thought to believe scum would begin a no-kill gambit on N1 in a normal. even though they lost their encryptor (which I doubt is their only power role, seeing as we appear to have a JK, a rolecop, and a backup rolecop).<br><br>N2: Mala said she jailed BBT, who heavily suspected scorpious. she also pre-hinted that BBT would be jailed. i think it's likely that scorpious could have not caught that (as I didn't either). it is really likely Scorpious would have targeted BBT, as BBT was one of the largest proponents of his lynch. And as the last scum player alive after Shiro was lynched D2, he had to play survivalistically. Which he's been doing again, today, voting Mala (only way she'll die, because he can't kill her if she blocks him again, and it's a good bet she will/would if we don't/didn't lynch one of them) or voting me (the only other remote possibility, given Mala's \"freaken hate\" for me, and given AxleGreaser's pigheadedness (sorry, lol). So everything is consistent with Scorpious being scum and making all the choices he needs to, to survive.<br><br>N3: Mala said she jailed Scorpious. There was no kill. This is entirely consistent with Scorpious being scum and just not catching the \"you're next BBT\" soft by Mala. Scorpious as scum would probably try to kill Mala as a claimed JK. And by probably, I mean definitely.<br><br>So really, all signs point to Scorpious. As ridiculous as Mala is being, especially since she's supposed to KNOW she's a JK and there should be no doubt in her mind of other shenaniganery going down... again, it really strains the mind to think that scum got blocked on D1, and then was SO confident that they thought they could hang Mala out to dry, as well as everyone she blocked. I would think scum would keep trying to kill. I know I would. Again, just because it's POSSIBLE does not mean it is PROBABLE.<br><br>I assume Scorpious tried as a last ditch effort to kill Mala last night, and got blocked.<br><br>So really, we've been handed the game on a silver platter. And a lot of it's just blind luck on Mala's part. Haha<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Scorpious</span> -- I'm final.

Town has been batting like 25% in 2015. People's perceptions of what's townsided and what's scumsided is really off.

I don't know if they come out slightly better or slightly worse than a solo cop in practice, but a solo cop isn't enough to carry a game on its own anyway, so gaoler seemed like a good bet.
