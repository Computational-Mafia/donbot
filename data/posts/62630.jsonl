Dominator says it thinks Nether and eventi are scum together. Nether and eventi were attacking each other hard at this point. Of course two players fighting each other doesn't rule out the possibility of them being scum partners, but it's not a very intuitive assumption - it's unlikely that a townie will suspect two fighting players of being distancing scum without a compelling reason to suspect them both. Dominator's compelling reason is \"bandwagon\".<br>\n<br>\nFinally, at 244, Dominator offers its own lynch today for Nether's lynch tomorrow. Townies who use this sort of rhetoric only do so when they're confident the player is scum, not when they're just bandwagoning. But what really makes me believe this isn't genuine is that Dominator only had two votes at this time, while Nether had three. If your town and your top suspect has more votes than you, you're not gonna tell people to lynch you instead, that'd be ridiculous.

What post are you even referring to? If you are talking about me switching my vote to eventi, it was to secure a lynch. <br>\nIf you are talking about me question TheDominator, I was second one on his train, so if you are implying I was trying to bury someone who was under pressure (he wasn't even the leading train) that doesn't make any sense either.<br>\n<br>\nSo I have to assume you are talking about eventi. In either case it makes no sense. I clearly stated they were my scum reads very early on, and I thought there was a scum between them. I thought TheDominator was more likely to be scum, so I put my vote on him first, but the train didn't grow and we were close to deadline, so I switched to eventi because I wanted a lynch. You finding that scummy is fairly interesting. I do not mind you putting up another possible scum world, because I was actually considering that as well, but if this is a TvT, I honestly want to go for someone like dave or perhaps even you.<br>\n<br>\nLet me elaborate. You are trying to force another possible world so much right now (by putting scum on me and thesp) that you can push that world tomorrow. This means if eventi is town, I think you are trying to get town credit, and then tomorrow you can push a lynch on one of us. Thesp could be scum, his reads align with mine though, so I tend to believe he is not. I know I am town though.<br>\n<br>\nBut meh. I still believe there is a scum between eventi and TheDominator. I can switch to TheDominator if people will actually join that train this time.", "time": "Fri Jul 24, 2015 5:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62630&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "62630"}

I want you to stop tunneling on people, and revaluate all of your reads.<br>\n<br>\nThere is most likely a mafia between you, Alchemist and RC. I need you to understand this. It is fine if you don't agree, but just live in the world for a moment.<br>\n<br>\nI want to lynch the mafia between you and if you are town you need to help me find the scum and stop refusing to work with me. <br>\nYou stating that all of you are most likely town does sound like a mafia being pinned up trying to align himself with the other townies getting 'pressured'. To me it sounds like you simply refuse to believe in a world where one of you is mafia, and that is a red flag to me. Just consider the world a possibility.

I thought it was towny at first but now I know he does it every time. In his next post, he calls one of my remarks interesting, but doesn't elaborate on why it's interesting--I think that's a null tell, I can understand why people think it's scummy but he probably wanted to see what I'd say first.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7051704#p7051704\">102</a> he tells Sword Master and PMysterious to post more, then he argues with RadiantCowbells. But the interesting thing about that post is he says he'll either put a vote on a lurker or someone in some other parameter he'll mention later. But we never got to find out the other category...I remember being curious when I read that post, and then I forgot about it until now.<br>\n<br>\nThen he continues to argue with RadiantCowbells, I agree with his interpretation of events in that particular interaction. Finally he casts his first vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7055087#p7055087\">133</a>, a post or perish vote on Sword Master. I don't object to that, he had made one really stupid post and needed some pressure. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7055872#p7055872\">139</a> he explains why he doesn't want to lynch RC. His reasoning was that RC has been genuine and contributed to the game even though they disagree and on Day 1 he'd rather bring more people into the conversation.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7057890#p7057890\">181</a> he hifives Nethersprite for moving his vote to Eventi even though Thesp was not yet voting eventi. I'm mildly confused by that but I don't think it's scummy. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7060930#p7060930\">222</a> he scum-reads eventi, Dominator, and Sword Master. He unvotes davesaz for talking immediately after replacing Sword Master, which was consistent with earlier posts because his vote on Sword Master was to get him to talk more.<br>\n<br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063902#p7063902\">259</a> bothers me, because he voted Eventi with no reasoning. He could have at least posted a quote or noted a post that Eventi made that was scummy. He had previously been praising the eventi wagon but didn't say why earlier either. His other scumreads are Dominator and PMysterious. Then switches to Dominator when that wagon builds up steam, but he had said earlier that he was okay with switching to any of his scum-reads. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7075093#p7075093\">347</a> he didn't want to lynch Nethersprite. In the next post he responds to a few things Firebringer said.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7075438#p7075438\">354</a> is the first place he mentions anything specifically scummy eventi has done, which was going from seeing Dominator as a clown to wanting to lynch him. In the next post, he calls attention to the deadline and asks people to switch to wagons. He responds to questions from Dominator and davesaz. Then votes eventi again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7080863#p7080863\">422</a>.<br>\n<br>\nGives \"negative points\" to Persivul in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7084889#p7084889\">479</a> for cop/doc directing, which I agree with. On day 2, he says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7098534#p7098534\">762</a> he thinks Dominator is more likely to be town after the Eventi kill, I think it's because a lot of his read was associative tells between Dominator and Eventi but I'm not actually sure because he never talked about that. Then he asks people questions to follow up with the activity he had missed. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7100871#p7100871\">776</a> he says All Alone is trying too hard but then votes Alchemist because he said he had the feeling that Alchemist voted for Dominator because he wanted an excuse to vote instead of hunting scum. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101337#p7101337\">803</a> he explains why he thinks Dominator shifted after claiming the gambit.<br>\n<br>\nHis reaction to the duppin cop thing seemed very genuine with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101337#p7101337\">803</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101356#p7101356\">805</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101363#p7101363\">807</a>. Then he continues to argue with Alchemist about Dominator and calls Alch out for backtracking. In the next few posts he asks and answers questions, until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7117018#p7117018\">940</a> where he votes Persivul, on the grounds that Persivul feels off and there's weird resistance to his wagon.<br>\n<br>\nLast few posts: He really wants an All Alone wagon but doesn't think we have time to push it. He thinks Dominator is town but wants him to get his act together regardless. Wants to ensure a list, and warms up more to lynching All Alone back when we thought Persivul might get modkilled. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7133252#p7133252\">1036</a> he unvotes Persivul because of lynch confusion, but he votes his replacement in the next post because of NM's entrance. Is willing to shamelessly move his vote between All Alone, Not Mafia, and davesaz to secure a lynch. He said why he thought All Alone and NM/Pers were scummy, but why davesaz? Is it just because there's a wagon and a lynch is better than none?</div></div></div> <br>\n<br>\nIn summary:<br>\n<br>\nI like the way Thesp questions people and makes them follow up the things they say. But what I don't like is how he himself doesn't elaborate. For example, in the beginning of the game, saying he'd either place a vote on a lurker or someone in a \"different parameter\" that he would talk about later but hasn't yet. And how he never elaborated on a scumread for Eventi, just started pushing his wagon before he was even on it. And I'm seeing a lighter version of that with how Thesp is interacting with Davesaz.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still weakly town-reading him. I like his line of questioning and how he interacts. He never seems defensive or like he has anything to hide. He wants to bring more people into the conversation and pick everything apart.", "time": "Mon Aug 10, 2015 9:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62630&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "62630"}

Davesaz enters and catches up. He answers the questions Thesp posted at the beginning of the game. Agrees with Alchemist that it is scummy for RC to be trying really hard to paint Thesp as scummy. I agree with his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063409#p7063409\">249</a>, that's also why I don't think it was scummy for Thesp to say something is interesting (even though there are other things that he needs to follow up on.)<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063809#p7063809\">254</a> he makes a note that the interaction between RC and Fire is weird and he wants to look at it later because it might be scum trying to be seen as a TvT squabble. Now we know Fire is town, so that wasn't the case. I like that he made a note of it though, in case he needed to come back to it later.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063822#p7063822\">255</a> he says \"You might want to explain to town why you find someone scummy, but telling your scumread how to become town isn't good\" What's the difference? It's a balancing act. If you tell town why you're scumreading someone, then the potential scum knows what to avoid doing. But if you don't tell town why they're scummy, then you have a really weak case and people are less likely to join the wagon. So it sounds like he was just rearranging words in that post. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063936#p7063936\">261</a> he's done catching up, and his reads match Thesp's.

Asks people questions but doesn't place a vote yet. After more pressure, votes eventi for not answering any of his questions.

In that post, he says there are consequences to calling him a liar even though nobody at that point had called him a liar--what? He notices Nethersprite's odd use of quotes.<br>\n<br>\nVotes Thesp in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7105846#p7105846\">832</a> because the activity is more superficial than he remembered. Calls out RC's vote as weird after RC says the high activity players are likely to be scum and then votes davesaz (one of the high activity players.) Wants to know why Dom is voting Thesp and scumreading Alch, wants to know Alch's reads. Argues with both Dominator and Alchemist. Around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7118484#p7118484\">955</a> I notice that he hasn't really posted reads aside from votes.

I don't believe this is very useful though, since there's no evidence either way of whether the wagon vanishing was scum-motivated or not.<br>\n<br>\n#279 and #363 is really interesting. It's likely there's minimum one scum on the eventi wagon {Netherspite, RadiantCowbells, Thesp, <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">TheDominator37</div>). The conftown switches to the Netherspite wagon, RadiantCowbells to Firebringer as the only voter, and Thesp to Dominator. Netherspite is the only one of the wagon that remains on eventi. Mental note to look back at what happened between these two vote counts as this could be extraordinarily telling.<br>\n<br>\nAlso mental note that if Alchemist flips town, Netherspite should be a #1 scum candidate due to all-town wagon + eventi wagon blowing up immediately afterwards, with davesaz and Thesp being secondary scum candidates for being the unconfirmed on the eventi wagon afterwards. In this scenario, I'd place minimum two scum in those three names.<br>\n<br>\nThat's about all that's useful about day one.<br>\n<br>\nNote that I still hate the early day 2 Dominator wagon. The two unconfirmed on that wagon (Alchemist21 and Netherspite) don't have a very stellar voting pattern afterwards either. Alchemist parks as the only vote on All Alone for a while, then ends up on the Persivul-slot. Netherspite goes V/LA and just keeps the vote unvoted for the rest of the day. I'd be surprised if there wasn't at least one scum here.<br>\n<br>\nIf Thesp flips town at some point, those who are playing off those two wagons rise in the scum ranks. {Alchemist21, RadiantCowbells, Netherspite (although less likely)} It's difficult to analyze the Thesp vs Persivul wagons since the only difference is that Thesp has one single conftown on his wagon that isn't the other person being wagoned.<br>\n<br>\nAs noted before, the davesaz day 3 wagon bugs me too. The biggest thing that bugs me is that Netherspite and Alchemist21 are both the first two people pushing that wagon, just like the Dominator wagon on day 2.", "time": "Tue Aug 18, 2015 9:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62630&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "62630"}

I'm not feeling pistachi0n for scum (and I'm really uncomfortable following All Alone there). So if I'm forced to move to one of (Ankamius, Alchemist21, pistachi0n), it will be Alchemist21 (which follows up on some latent suspicions from earlier in the game, but is still probably my third or fourth preferred lynchee at best).

There is no reason for him to attempt to put <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">davesaz</div> in this list together with him and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheDominator37</div> because he is defending himself rather than <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">davesaz</div>. The scumslippy thing here is that he chooses <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheDominator37</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">davesaz</div> to fill his list of 'scum-driven mislynch wagons' together with his wagon in attempt to look townier. I can understand why does he put <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheDominator37</div> here: he's confirmed town. But <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">davesaz</div> can be confirmed town only for the scum and thus if he uses him as a filler for his 'town list' he knows something we don't and thus he's scum.<br>\n2. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ankamius</div>'s scumslip becomes even worse when you look at how he responds to me pointing it out. The most obvious answer I'd expect from the town in his position is \"I strongly townread <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">davesaz</div> and that's why I included him in the list\". <br>\nWhat do we see instead? First he attempts to turn the world upside down and accuse _me_ in scumslipping(!) because I included him in that list while I never did. I find it useless to discuss whether he should be included in the list or not because in his scumslip he obviously includes himself in that list, it was the aim of his whole argument: to put himself in the list of townies to look townier. He is there regardless of anything, he'll be there no matter who else he will include in the list. Thus, I never said or implied he's town.<br>\n3. After that he is now attempts to turn it upside down in another way: that he meant that it's the wagons looking scum-driven make targets of these wagons town. However, that's stupid argument as well. First of all, if you scumread 2 players you will obviously call the wagons they have started scum-driven. However, it does not mean these 2 players are any more scummy because you called these wagons scummy. That's \"A means B, B means A is worse\" argument and it does not make any sense. Second, considering your wagon scum-driven is understandable, however there is no reason to build a whole list of 'scum-driven wagons' to support your argument. The only reason to include more wagons in that list is to build a 'list of townies who those evil scum guys attempted to mislynch' and subtly make yourself more townier by including yourself in that list. <br>\n<br>\nThus, both of his excuses for his scumslip are not making sense and are only making it worse.<br>\nGenuine town would respond like I wrote above.

In the 24 posts <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">immediately</div> preceding your Friday post, Ankamius and Netherspite have 13 of them, and nearly all of them are attacking each other. The posts that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">aren't</div> from Ankamius and Netherspite are all from the mod, or are nearly all making comments about Ankamius v.

I enjoy the camradarie, and it's subtly pushing people towards things I like, which is always good for my game.

The Firebringer kill still seems weird to me. It makes sense from a RadiantCowbells-scum perspective. I'm also reminded of something Day 1, where I had the nagging feeling that RadiantCowbells was drawing too much attention, then deliberately retreated to the background to avoid blowback. (This was with the \"RQS\" attacks nonsense.) I'm leaning towards a RadiantCowbells/Ankamius/(All Alone or possibly pistachi0n but probably All Alone) team at this moment. IT's the one making the most sense from a game narrative point of view. There may be things I'm forgetting from not re-reading, but this makes sense to me. (The only thing giving me pause on this is that both RadiantCowbells and Ankamius are the only ones advocating a doc claim now, which seems odd as scum pairs, but perhaps they're appealing/buddying to Fluminator's suggestion of such.
