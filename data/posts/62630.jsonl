As to why not RadiantCowbells, I feel like the recent couple of posts from him feel genuine, and in part I'm not terribly interested in an early Day 1 lynch on someone who has contributed as much as he has, and in part a number of the votes on RadiantCowbells feel sketchy (esp. eventi). I'm voting someone who has a single post in the game because <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7049243#p7049243\" class=\"postlink\">that post</a> was absolute crap and I want them pulled into the game. (No way when they come back should they be allowed to make a post like that, and I want to make that perfectly clear.) I think it's very important on Day 1 to pull as many people into the conversation as possible, and I have zero problems using a lynch to make that happen if need be. I don't want scum skating by, I want plenty of reasonable chances to catch them."}

Dominator says it thinks Nether and eventi are scum together. Nether and eventi were attacking each other hard at this point. Of course two players fighting each other doesn't rule out the possibility of them being scum partners, but it's not a very intuitive assumption - it's unlikely that a townie will suspect two fighting players of being distancing scum without a compelling reason to suspect them both. Dominator's compelling reason is \"bandwagon\".<br><br>Finally, at 244, Dominator offers its own lynch today for Nether's lynch tomorrow. Townies who use this sort of rhetoric only do so when they're confident the player is scum, not when they're just bandwagoning. But what really makes me believe this isn't genuine is that Dominator only had two votes at this time, while Nether had three. If your town and your top suspect has more votes than you, you're not gonna tell people to lynch you instead, that'd be ridiculous. I think Dominator only said this to try to get town cred."}

The only progress made by post 17 was in your mind, RC. All Alone repeats his RVS vote - could indicate he's not really reading the game, just trying to appear to be scum hunting. Firebringer: you only put the number in the Post tags, not thw word post. Your links all go to the first post. duppin to RC: \"I think your read on Thesp makes sense\" Why? RC: you don't get to unilaterally declare that RVS is over. Deal with it."}

Netherspite wagon: Quaroath, TheDominator37, eventi...yuk. All Alone 241...seriously?

I thought TheDominator was more likely to be scum, so I put my vote on him first, but the train didn't grow and we were close to deadline, so I switched to eventi because I wanted a lynch. You finding that scummy is fairly interesting. I do not mind you putting up another possible scum world, because I was actually considering that as well, but if this is a TvT, I honestly want to go for someone like dave or perhaps even you.<br><br>Let me elaborate. You are trying to force another possible world so much right now (by putting scum on me and thesp) that you can push that world tomorrow. This means if eventi is town, I think you are trying to get town credit, and then tomorrow you can push a lynch on one of us. Thesp could be scum, his reads align with mine though, so I tend to believe he is not. I know I am town though.<br><br>But meh. I still believe there is a scum between eventi and TheDominator. I can switch to TheDominator if people will actually join that train this time."}

I'm mildly confused by that but I don't think it's scummy. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7060930#p7060930\">222</a> he scum-reads eventi, Dominator, and Sword Master. He unvotes davesaz for talking immediately after replacing Sword Master, which was consistent with earlier posts because his vote on Sword Master was to get him to talk more.<br><br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063902#p7063902\">259</a> bothers me, because he voted Eventi with no reasoning. He could have at least posted a quote or noted a post that Eventi made that was scummy. He had previously been praising the eventi wagon but didn't say why earlier either. His other scumreads are Dominator and PMysterious. Then switches to Dominator when that wagon builds up steam, but he had said earlier that he was okay with switching to any of his scum-reads. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7075093#p7075093\">347</a> he didn't want to lynch Nethersprite. In the next post he responds to a few things Firebringer said.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7075438#p7075438\">354</a> is the first place he mentions anything specifically scummy eventi has done, which was going from seeing Dominator as a clown to wanting to lynch him. In the next post, he calls attention to the deadline and asks people to switch to wagons. He responds to questions from Dominator and davesaz. Then votes eventi again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7080863#p7080863\">422</a>.<br><br>Gives \"negative points\" to Persivul in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7084889#p7084889\">479</a> for cop/doc directing, which I agree with. On day 2, he says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7098534#p7098534\">762</a> he thinks Dominator is more likely to be town after the Eventi kill, I think it's because a lot of his read was associative tells between Dominator and Eventi but I'm not actually sure because he never talked about that. Then he asks people questions to follow up with the activity he had missed. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7100871#p7100871\">776</a> he says All Alone is trying too hard but then votes Alchemist because he said he had the feeling that Alchemist voted for Dominator because he wanted an excuse to vote instead of hunting scum. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101337#p7101337\">803</a> he explains why he thinks Dominator shifted after claiming the gambit.<br><br>His reaction to the duppin cop thing seemed very genuine with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101337#p7101337\">803</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101356#p7101356\">805</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7101363#p7101363\">807</a>. Then he continues to argue with Alchemist about Dominator and calls Alch out for backtracking. In the next few posts he asks and answers questions, until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7117018#p7117018\">940</a> where he votes Persivul, on the grounds that Persivul feels off and there's weird resistance to his wagon.<br><br>Last few posts: He really wants an All Alone wagon but doesn't think we have time to push it. He thinks Dominator is town but wants him to get his act together regardless. Wants to ensure a list, and warms up more to lynching All Alone back when we thought Persivul might get modkilled. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7133252#p7133252\">1036</a> he unvotes Persivul because of lynch confusion, but he votes his replacement in the next post because of NM's entrance. Is willing to shamelessly move his vote between All Alone, Not Mafia, and davesaz to secure a lynch. He said why he thought All Alone and NM/Pers were scummy, but why davesaz? Is it just because there's a wagon and a lynch is better than none?</div></div></div> <br><br>In summary:<br><br>I like the way Thesp questions people and makes them follow up the things they say. But what I don't like is how he himself doesn't elaborate. For example, in the beginning of the game, saying he'd either place a vote on a lurker or someone in a \"different parameter\" that he would talk about later but hasn't yet. And how he never elaborated on a scumread for Eventi, just started pushing his wagon before he was even on it. And I'm seeing a lighter version of that with how Thesp is interacting with Davesaz.<br><br>I'm still weakly town-reading him. I like his line of questioning and how he interacts. He never seems defensive or like he has anything to hide. He wants to bring more people into the conversation and pick everything apart."}

Now we know Fire is town, so that wasn't the case. I like that he made a note of it though, in case he needed to come back to it later.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063822#p7063822\">255</a> he says \"You might want to explain to town why you find someone scummy, but telling your scumread how to become town isn't good\" What's the difference? It's a balancing act. If you tell town why you're scumreading someone, then the potential scum knows what to avoid doing. But if you don't tell town why they're scummy, then you have a really weak case and people are less likely to join the wagon. So it sounds like he was just rearranging words in that post. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063936#p7063936\">261</a> he's done catching up, and his reads match Thesp's.

Calls out RC's vote as weird after RC says the high activity players are likely to be scum and then votes davesaz (one of the high activity players.) Wants to know why Dom is voting Thesp and scumreading Alch, wants to know Alch's reads. Argues with both Dominator and Alchemist. Around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7118484#p7118484\">955</a> I notice that he hasn't really posted reads aside from votes.

Whe I first thought about scum probably weren't bussing, I figured there was a triangle between pistachion, Dave, and Alone, where a pistachion scumflip would have cleared the other 2 and given us a gamesolve, and a Townflip from anynof those 3 gave us 50/50 odds for a scum lynch the next phase.  Then I looked and saw AA and Thesp cross-voted, so then when I took that into consideration and listed out the teams I think are possible, your name was in all 3 possibilities.

Yes,  he probably shouldn't have outed the cop like that, but scum with a PR read is going to keep their mouth shut and just NK them, not speak up to stop a wagon on someone who, in all honesty, was total lynchbait.  The only way scumRC makes sense in this scenario is if they were scum with Dominator, but Duppin knew we were going on the assumption there was a cop innocent on Dom that he could have easily denied without even claiming cop by saying \"I do not have an innocent result on Dominator,\" so it's safe to assume both Dom and RC are Town."}

I don't believe this is very useful though, since there's no evidence either way of whether the wagon vanishing was scum-motivated or not.<br><br>#279 and #363 is really interesting. It's likely there's minimum one scum on the eventi wagon {Netherspite, RadiantCowbells, Thesp, <strike>TheDominator37</strike>). The conftown switches to the Netherspite wagon, RadiantCowbells to Firebringer as the only voter, and Thesp to Dominator. Netherspite is the only one of the wagon that remains on eventi. Mental note to look back at what happened between these two vote counts as this could be extraordinarily telling.<br><br>Also mental note that if Alchemist flips town, Netherspite should be a #1 scum candidate due to all-town wagon + eventi wagon blowing up immediately afterwards, with davesaz and Thesp being secondary scum candidates for being the unconfirmed on the eventi wagon afterwards. In this scenario, I'd place minimum two scum in those three names.<br><br>That's about all that's useful about day one.<br><br>Note that I still hate the early day 2 Dominator wagon. The two unconfirmed on that wagon (Alchemist21 and Netherspite) don't have a very stellar voting pattern afterwards either. Alchemist parks as the only vote on All Alone for a while, then ends up on the Persivul-slot. Netherspite goes V/LA and just keeps the vote unvoted for the rest of the day. I'd be surprised if there wasn't at least one scum here.<br><br>If Thesp flips town at some point, those who are playing off those two wagons rise in the scum ranks. {Alchemist21, RadiantCowbells, Netherspite (although less likely)} It's difficult to analyze the Thesp vs Persivul wagons since the only difference is that Thesp has one single conftown on his wagon that isn't the other person being wagoned.<br><br>As noted before, the davesaz day 3 wagon bugs me too.

I'm not feeling pistachi0n for scum (and I'm really uncomfortable following All Alone there). So if I'm forced to move to one of (Ankamius, Alchemist21, pistachi0n), it will be Alchemist21 (which follows up on some latent suspicions from earlier in the game, but is still probably my third or fourth preferred lynchee at best).

There is no reason for him to attempt to put <span class=\"noboldsig\">davesaz</span> in this list together with him and <span class=\"noboldsig\">TheDominator37</span> because he is defending himself rather than <span class=\"noboldsig\">davesaz</span>. The scumslippy thing here is that he chooses <span class=\"noboldsig\">TheDominator37</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">davesaz</span> to fill his list of 'scum-driven mislynch wagons' together with his wagon in attempt to look townier. I can understand why does he put <span class=\"noboldsig\">TheDominator37</span> here: he's confirmed town. But <span class=\"noboldsig\">davesaz</span> can be confirmed town only for the scum and thus if he uses him as a filler for his 'town list' he knows something we don't and thus he's scum.<br>2. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ankamius</span>'s scumslip becomes even worse when you look at how he responds to me pointing it out. The most obvious answer I'd expect from the town in his position is \"I strongly townread <span class=\"noboldsig\">davesaz</span> and that's why I included him in the list\". <br>What do we see instead? First he attempts to turn the world upside down and accuse _me_ in scumslipping(!) because I included him in that list while I never did. I find it useless to discuss whether he should be included in the list or not because in his scumslip he obviously includes himself in that list, it was the aim of his whole argument: to put himself in the list of townies to look townier. He is there regardless of anything, he'll be there no matter who else he will include in the list. Thus, I never said or implied he's town.<br>3. After that he is now attempts to turn it upside down in another way: that he meant that it's the wagons looking scum-driven make targets of these wagons town. However, that's stupid argument as well. First of all, if you scumread 2 players you will obviously call the wagons they have started scum-driven. However, it does not mean these 2 players are any more scummy because you called these wagons scummy. That's \"A means B, B means A is worse\" argument and it does not make any sense. Second, considering your wagon scum-driven is understandable, however there is no reason to build a whole list of 'scum-driven wagons' to support your argument. The only reason to include more wagons in that list is to build a 'list of townies who those evil scum guys attempted to mislynch' and subtly make yourself more townier by including yourself in that list. <br><br>Thus, both of his excuses for his scumslip are not making sense and are only making it worse.<br>Genuine town would respond like I wrote above. His response does not look like town at all."}

I generally think davesaz is scum as is All Alone (and I can see them together), but I need to see if a third person works with that pair.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: davesaz</span><br><br>The resistance to his wagon is too much for me to overlook."}

It had very little chance of ever going through without them either since:<br><br>a. It requires 3 more votes and the people off that list and not on the wagon (and Netherspite himself) already amounted to a grand total of three people.<br>b. Two slots were being replaced; one on the wagon and one off. Even if it was lucky that both of the replacements would support the wagon, that would still only amount to five votes.<br>c. Eventi was on other things and while he wasn't townreading Nether, all scum could count on was him deciding to compromise on him if it got enough support.<br>d. Netherspite was obviously never going to vote himself. The last slot in the list mentioned in the (a) point is duppin, who was townreading Netherspite.<br><br>So it's obvious that scum weren't counting on the wagon going through without them. For some reason, scum were just straight up wanting to avoid the Netherspite wagon like the plague, which is what I can't figure out.

The lack of scum pile-on isn't necessarily proof that it's not TvT, as a three-scum quickwagon can be hard to coordinate and scum might not be willing to risk it, but it should at the very least be ringing some alarm bells - especially if she was already suspicious of him.

With 7 alive, I don't see a lack of movement on a single vote as all that interesting. (At the time, I was also willing to lose if I was wrong about you, as I didn't have any doubts about you. This changes with #1475 (read on).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7203745#p7203745\" class=\"postlink\">post 1475</a>, davesaz wrote:</cite><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7098534#p7098534\">762</a> - RC comes across as worse after eventi flip.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">This post looks town</span><br>...<br>I'm really conflicted after this part of the review.

I enjoy the camradarie, and it's subtly pushing people towards things I like, which is always good for my game. I have once had to go through and find games where I do that as town because someone thought I only did that as scum. I imagine I do it regardless of alignment.<br><br>This post of yours did two things for me - it made me second-guess my read on you (as this doesn't feel like a scum-saz post, when I appear to be possibly lynchable), and it reminded me of my post #762. The Firebringer kill still seems weird to me. It makes sense from a RadiantCowbells-scum perspective. I'm also reminded of something Day 1, where I had the nagging feeling that RadiantCowbells was drawing too much attention, then deliberately retreated to the background to avoid blowback. (This was with the \"RQS\" attacks nonsense.) I'm leaning towards a RadiantCowbells/Ankamius/(All Alone or possibly pistachi0n but probably All Alone) team at this moment. IT's the one making the most sense from a game narrative point of view. There may be things I'm forgetting from not re-reading, but this makes sense to me. (The only thing giving me pause on this is that both RadiantCowbells and Ankamius are the only ones advocating a doc claim now, which seems odd as scum pairs, but perhaps they're appealing/buddying to Fluminator's suggestion of such. Hmm.)<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:70%\"></div><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7165766#p7165766\" class=\"postlink\">post 1244</a>, RadiantCowbells wrote:</cite>Thesp, if you have any confidence whatsoever in my scumhunting ability, do not touch the Ankamius wagon.
