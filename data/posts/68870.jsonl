I think?) and is just an active player as both alignments and... hmm, this is hard to explain.<br>\n<br>\nI said \"logical\" as opposed to my initial gut reaction which was leanscum if anything. The more I think it through the more I realize I'm probably wrong about it being scummy or null but I'm stubborn and I have to sit here glaring at my hands and willing them to tap the keys admitting that I might be wrong as I agonize over being shown up by frickin' JaeReed with their frickin' jae reads", "time": "Mon Oct 24, 2016 3:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68870&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "68870"}

The more I think it through the more I realize I'm probably wrong about it being scummy or null but I'm stubborn and I have to sit here glaring at my hands and willing them to tap the keys admitting that I might be wrong as I agonize over being shown up by frickin' JaeReed with their frickin' jae reads</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8452753#p8452753\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8452753#p8452753\" data-post-id=\"8452753\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 528</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27553\">Impoetic</a> wrote:</cite>you're saying like everything I'm thinking.

I don't read into derphammers that much because literally anyone can do it. he didn't seem overly invested in the game so the mistake was made. that's about it.<br>\n<br>\ntrans is a scary mofo as town. I'd fearkill him every time (sorry transcend). I might reconsider if he got frustrated with being fearkilled but I haven't seen anything of the sort so far so I'd just go for it.<br>\nIf trans were scum with me I'd go for Io because it puts him in a better standing. Io scumreads me and I don't consider her a weak player, and Transcend pocketed her in that situation (trans maf/io town) so no one would think he'd let that kill go through because it's literally killing off your townbeard and that's not ideal. Plus with my interactions with transcend it'd pre much clear him after my flip. I suppose I would only go that way as a goon though because it's relying on me being lynched after to put my buddy in a good position.<br>\nIf trans/io were both scum or i was a pr with trans scum i'd go for you because you're the next scary dude if town.<br>\n<br>\nso there's an argument for me being maf but both yourself and trans would have to be maf with me and I would have to be a pr to make the kill on gerry.<br>\n<br>\nThat said.. that's all assuming I had any say over the nightkill, so it could easily be that I was overruled, I guess. I'd hope that no one would overrule me on a transcend or smith kill tho.

Which is funny because you were trying to do it in your first newbie iirc. Coaching is when someone tells you how to respond to a post. If anything what myself and Impo were doing by your definition would be (really bad) distancing. If we wanted to distance we wouldn't cozy up to each other on account of being friends.<br>\nYou didn't look at the post in context with how Impo was pushing me. Her saying I don't dumbtell then leaning towards saying that was what I was doing was scummy for her. She knows, I know, and she retracted so it's all good. I've played a lot with her recently on epicmafia and she knows every glaring hole in my scum game because we've discussed it. Her pushing me when she should know I'm town is scummy. She's not even retracting in the manner she does as town, but I'm giving her benefit of the doubt being that chat mafia is slightly different.<br>\n<br>\nI wouldn't have killed gerry, he was doing jack sweet shit, doesn't like playing town, and very obviously to me didn't have a power role to make him want to play the game.<br>\nI don't fencesit as scum because I know it's easy to change a read. Town does it all the time so there's no reason why I as scum should need to fencesit. I'm being cautious here because I know I'm prone to omgus and my hardest townread has you as his hardest townread and I generally trust his judgement. He's proven time and again to be a good player as town. I'm also aware that sometimes strong players can be wrong. So yea, I'm fencesitting on those currently voting me because my kneejerk reaction is to omgus and that's never good play regardless of alignment. If I were scum I'd have a stance on you and stick to it because going against you could potentially put me at odds with Transcend.<br>\n<br>\nI can't explain more than it rubs me the wrong way because it's tonal. I like tonal and gut reads. Another point against you is you're not sounding like you did in Donner Party, and I feel like you should know roughly that I operate on tone and gut based off that game as well. At least, you didn't tunnel me there, so that's a large part of my \"what gives?\" reaction here too.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, did you forget you were already voting me, or was that supposed to be for emphasis? -.-<br>\n<br>\nMy current reads? I kinda thought they were obvious, but ok. I also kind of think you're going to hard tunnel me regardless of whether I give them or not.<br>\n<br>\nYou could be scum, not sure. I don't think you even realize what you're doing, but if you're not scum then you're being extremely stupid right now and I actually have a high opinion of your intelligence, so there's that. I am also aware people can just have a crap game. My individual read on you right now is nullscum but I'm painfully aware that I'm very likely just omgusing and shouldn't actually trust that read right now.<br>\n<br>\nTranscend is my hard town read. I don't know why you would even bother asking about this.<br>\n<br>\nImpo is either nullscum or townlean depending on if she wants to push me and make herself obvious scum. So far she's being a good kitty and as such is town.<br>\n<br>\nCCC is a scum read flat out but holding back on that because smith might be town and if so his opinion is valued.<br>\n<br>\nrb defended lil in a manner I didn't like d1 because I didn't think there was that much to defend him on. I went over this already. I said I wanted to tr him for the paranoia over Impo but knew it wasn't really something to tr him over because it was a post that could easily be made by scum. Then he voted CCC for that terribad push on me and so I'm not sure anymore. Could be attempted buddying and if so it's working to make me rethink and consider rereading. For the time being he's still a scumread but not as strong. If CCC is town then I think there's the chance he's whiteknighting me. If CCC is scum then I don't think that read as a bus, honestly. I mean I could be wrong it's just my take on that.<br>\n<br>\nNow, why did you ask my opinion of those people in particular? I feel like my stances on them are pretty laid out in the thread already. It's obvious I was rethinking my rb scumread by my unvote. It's obvious I'm attempting to not just omgus you and actually sort whether you're scum or bad. It's obvious my townread on Transcend hasn't changed a lick. I'll give you that it's possibly not as obvious that Impo is a read that is practically a coin flip at this stage, and that CCC is a hard scum read that I'm questioning only because of smith. I don't get why you brought up the rest.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, me and Impo joking around was just that. I don't understand why you think that has anything to do with how I should be reading her. I can joke around with someone and still like/dislike their tone/content with others.

Knowing that LUV is town, clearly he wasn't trying to save a buddy, so do you think his defense was dishonest or needlessly half-hearted or anything else that would be particularly suspicious?  \"He didn't have much to defend him for\" is a relatively weak line of attack unless there's more that I'm not seeing.

One of those is flipped town, one is my best townread and the other is also a fairly strong townread. I doubt scum!Jae and scum!Hermie would strategically L-4 and L-3 the lynch. I think the fast wagon was just due to not having a VC. I truthfully only think that there's at most (and probably) one scum that was on this mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nSo let's take a look at each individual member on the wagon individually.<br>\n<br>\nSmith: The first vote, but I think he voted him because I did, or he agreed with my reasoning on him, while I was changing my vote as often as I change my underwear. His vote doesn't appear tactical like \"hey I can get this guy mislynched\". I think he genuinely agreed with me that Lil Uzi was scum or, at least, that his content was bad. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Lean-Town.</div><br>\n<br>\nJaeReed: This guy has been up my ass all game. I hate being buddied truthfully even though that's hypocritical since I tend to buddy a lot myself. Anyways he basically made me the town doublevoter that day everywhere I voted he voted. Is this scummy? Kinda. Does that make me fos him? Not really, but it does make me want to put him on close watch, even though I really liked his reactions to a few things. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFF00\">Null.</div><br>\n<br>\nHermie: His vote was on me for the longest of time, and the reasons for it were bad, but not exactly scummy. I don't know why though when he doubted his read on me he immediately decided to sheep me. That's putting a lot of trust in someone he formerly thought was scum. I can understand the likes of mhsmith and Jae sheeping me, but Hermie? I truthfully think that this was the scum on the wagon. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Lean Scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nIo: She's been my hardest townread all game. I'm gonna disclose right now that we aren't actually masons, it was only banter. I'm sure most of you knew, but there are some people that genuinely question it. I saw Io play scum in my Fire n Ice game and her scum game is insanely different from her town game. Her reactions have been fairly genuine and her tone is really towny. Scum CAN fake it, but this is definitely Town!Io here. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Town.</div><br>\n<br>\nImpoetic: I might need to re-ISO her since she's a controversial player, but I've played thousands of games with her off site. I'm bad at reading her in chat mafia but I'm pretty good at reading her in the long drawn-out games. However that's not always. I don't think her vote was tactical, rather, just voting someone she thought was scum, or scummy. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Null-Town.</div><br>\n<br>\nNON-UZI WAGONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\n<br>\n(L-6) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">gerryoat </div> - <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Lil Uzi Vert</div> &lt;-------------------------- lol<br>\n<br>\nAs for the rest, I do hold a read of which yields 2 scum in the bloc of {rb, Burger, CCC}. All 3 of them defended Uzi and I feel for 2 of them it was defense on a scummy town slot for them to get another mislynch and save Uzi for another day. In their defense: there was a lolhammer, and if they wanted to properly defend Uzi, they couldn't exactly do such.<br>\n<br>\n(L-6) VWXYZ - rb<br>\n(L-6) Cloudkicker - Burgerking <br>\nNot Voting: VWXYZ, CCC, CloudKicker<br>\n<br>\nV and Cloud are town I'm pretty sure. I may need to reread both ISOs, but I'm not concerned about either of them right now.<br>\n<br>\nrb: I think most of his votes have been fairly inconsistent. IIRC, he had a fos on someone (Cloud???) but then RVS'd VWXYZ, and parked his vote there for quite some time due to his \"explosion\". While his explosion was bad, he agreed with me that he was better off being vigged rather than lynched, yet his vote was parked on V for quite a long time, without pursuing his vote on another slot. His day 1 was pretty bad and inconsistent. And I didn't like his defense on Uzi. He was right, but scum do know who's town and who isn't, and I feel like he used that information to his advantage. rb isn't really interacting with Burger or CCC so I'm pretty sure he's surely scum here. His vote on CCC was really bad, even though it could've been him voting scum. I can see a bus there. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nBurgerking: His entrance was fucking awful. His vote on Io was even worse. He overanalyzed all the mshmith-Io interactions. Then just shadethrew the rest of D1. His D2 hasn't been much better. His vote on CCC looked pretty tactical. Then I unvote and he unvotes because he was \"building pressure\". I don't think those were his intentions. CCC didn't even react to his vote, or any other vote by the time he had unvoted so that was clearly not his intention. There is a chance though that he's just really awful town, but I'm leaning heavily towards no. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Lean Scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nCCC: His reads this game are awful, and his \"one of Trans/Uzi is scum\" thing was really bad. But I gave him benefit of the doubt because Uzi was just horrible and I didn't think he'd associate with Uzi if he were mafia the way he did. Now that Uzi has flipped town, he hasn't done anything to pressure me at all. He's been more focused on Jae. Like there's even been a forming bandwagon on me and he still doesn't pressure me when I'm \"poe scum\" to him. However, the votes from rb and Burgerking on him were awful. Right now, I'm gonna agree with Smith here and say he's scummy but that there's a lot of scummier people.

One of those is flipped town, one is my best townread and the other is also a fairly strong townread. I doubt scum!Jae and scum!Hermie would strategically L-4 and L-3 the lynch. I think the fast wagon was just due to not having a VC. I truthfully only think that there's at most (and probably) one scum that was on this mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nSo let's take a look at each individual member on the wagon individually.<br>\n<br>\nSmith: The first vote, but I think he voted him because I did, or he agreed with my reasoning on him, while I was changing my vote as often as I change my underwear. His vote doesn't appear tactical like \"hey I can get this guy mislynched\". I think he genuinely agreed with me that Lil Uzi was scum or, at least, that his content was bad. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Lean-Town.</div><br>\n<br>\nJaeReed: This guy has been up my ass all game. I hate being buddied truthfully even though that's hypocritical since I tend to buddy a lot myself. Anyways he basically made me the town doublevoter that day everywhere I voted he voted. Is this scummy? Kinda. Does that make me fos him? Not really, but it does make me want to put him on close watch, even though I really liked his reactions to a few things. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFF00\">Null.</div><br>\n<br>\nHermie: His vote was on me for the longest of time, and the reasons for it were bad, but not exactly scummy. I don't know why though when he doubted his read on me he immediately decided to sheep me. That's putting a lot of trust in someone he formerly thought was scum. I can understand the likes of mhsmith and Jae sheeping me, but Hermie? I truthfully think that this was the scum on the wagon. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Lean Scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nIo: She's been my hardest townread all game. I'm gonna disclose right now that we aren't actually masons, it was only banter. I'm sure most of you knew, but there are some people that genuinely question it. I saw Io play scum in my Fire n Ice game and her scum game is insanely different from her town game. Her reactions have been fairly genuine and her tone is really towny. Scum CAN fake it, but this is definitely Town!Io here. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Town.</div><br>\n<br>\nImpoetic: I might need to re-ISO her since she's a controversial player, but I've played thousands of games with her off site. I'm bad at reading her in chat mafia but I'm pretty good at reading her in the long drawn-out games. However that's not always. I don't think her vote was tactical, rather, just voting someone she thought was scum, or scummy.

All 3 of them defended Uzi and I feel for 2 of them it was defense on a scummy town slot for them to get another mislynch and save Uzi for another day. In their defense: there was a lolhammer, and if they wanted to properly defend Uzi, they couldn't exactly do such.<br>\n<br>\n(L-6) VWXYZ - rb<br>\n(L-6) Cloudkicker - Burgerking <br>\nNot Voting: VWXYZ, CCC, CloudKicker<br>\n<br>\nV and Cloud are town I'm pretty sure. I may need to reread both ISOs, but I'm not concerned about either of them right now.<br>\n<br>\nrb: I think most of his votes have been fairly inconsistent. IIRC, he had a fos on someone (Cloud???) but then RVS'd VWXYZ, and parked his vote there for quite some time due to his \"explosion\". While his explosion was bad, he agreed with me that he was better off being vigged rather than lynched, yet his vote was parked on V for quite a long time, without pursuing his vote on another slot. His day 1 was pretty bad and inconsistent. And I didn't like his defense on Uzi. He was right, but scum do know who's town and who isn't, and I feel like he used that information to his advantage. rb isn't really interacting with Burger or CCC so I'm pretty sure he's surely scum here. His vote on CCC was really bad, even though it could've been him voting scum. I can see a bus there. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nBurgerking: His entrance was fucking awful. His vote on Io was even worse. He overanalyzed all the mshmith-Io interactions. Then just shadethrew the rest of D1. His D2 hasn't been much better. His vote on CCC looked pretty tactical. Then I unvote and he unvotes because he was \"building pressure\". I don't think those were his intentions. CCC didn't even react to his vote, or any other vote by the time he had unvoted so that was clearly not his intention. There is a chance though that he's just really awful town, but I'm leaning heavily towards no. Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Lean Scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nCCC: His reads this game are awful, and his \"one of Trans/Uzi is scum\" thing was really bad. But I gave him benefit of the doubt because Uzi was just horrible and I didn't think he'd associate with Uzi if he were mafia the way he did. Now that Uzi has flipped town, he hasn't done anything to pressure me at all. He's been more focused on Jae. Like there's even been a forming bandwagon on me and he still doesn't pressure me when I'm \"poe scum\" to him. However, the votes from rb and Burgerking on him were awful. Right now, I'm gonna agree with Smith here and say he's scummy but that there's a lot of scummier people.

I don't feel like pulling up his posts to cite specific examples, so let's just talk again about the Trundle thing. He soulreads a guy as a wolf based on one post and has four reasons for it, and he's super proud of himself and patting himself on the back for it. Wolves aren't trying that hard to develop quick reads and they tend to struggle to come up with that level of insight and they aren't good at getting the subtle emotions right. And his whole day was full of things like that. Cron has played several wolf games on this site and his posting was bland and forgettable each time.<br>\n<br>\n&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nI don't have time to adequately respond to that post but one thing I can say quickly is that when I'm talking about emotions, I'm specifically excluding anger. It's the easiest emotion to fake and it's one that is often not alignment-indicative even when it is genuine, unless it can be traced to an origin in something distinctly villagery.<br>\n<br>\nEmotions like pride, paranoia, surprise, suspicion, etc, are more difficult to fake. Wolves often fail to even identify spots in which emotion should be present in their posting, and their efforts at actually displaying more complex emotions are often quite clumsy, for example by stating their supposed feelings rather than displaying them.<br>\n<br>\nBut in the case of Cron, a lot of what was clearing for him was just the sheer depth and breadth of his reads and interactions. It's just hard to fake that much content so quickly and make it sound good. And few wolves are ever going to stalk other players' online statuses in order to catch lurkers.\n</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nTrans already is familiar with this one (since I used it to bash him over the head with him saying he was angry instead of actually being angry in 646 <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":cool:\" title=\"Cool\"> ), but if you're going to make tonal reads:<br>\n<br>\n1) You should have good reason to believe you're good at it (idk if this is a Jae strength or not)<br>\n2) You should be able to explain where your tonal read is coming from.

I don't think she operates that way).<br>\n4) She said she liked me and skimmed my ISO to see the claim. I have 2 pages in my ISO, and a lot of it is petty fights with Io, CCC, and Smith, and earlier on, it was coasting the everliving fuck out of this game and sheeping like mad. Skimming my ISO to see my claim would be pretty impressive for someone who doesn't generally read the thread upon replacing in, for one, since it'd be pretty hard to reach my claim through all the crap going on in it, and then you also have to think about the play that she would have seen in my ISO during it. Considering she has seen my play from a mod perspective (Shadowrun) when I've been town and trying, I really doubt that her conclusion upon skimming my ISO was \"this is a good protect\".

If it was then I fucking commend her for her foresight, because I literally can't see her being scum right now.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I am not 100% on Transcend, VW, and Smith.<br>\nSmith I'm more sure on because of the consistency in his play between days and in the neighbourhood. He would have had to adjust his play specifically for me while still not triggering any flags with everyone else and I really doubt he has the ability to do that with his wolf game (sorry smith).<br>\nVW is my second highest because of the way Cloud was pushing him. The way he reacted to me defending him reminded me of the way alban reacted to RC coming in during Cocktail Party (newbie game) when I was pushing alban hard and RC came in townreading him. Both Cloud and VW with their interactions on D3 made me believe strongly that VW could not possibly be a partner for Cloud.<br>\nSimilarly, Cloud threw a lot of shade on Transcend for being wrong twice in a row where I feel like he could have just let it lie? He also had a lot of early interactions (sheeping votes and interactions that didn't feel forced) that make me lean towards not buddies. But that's a lighter read than the rest and I really hope it doesn't come down to that.

But really she just knows how to appeal to me and it's painfully obvious to me that she does know that, regardless of alignment. Like, it's really messing with me. I think if she's town she wouldn't mind the 1 for 1 trade though also, which is another reason I kinda wanted to lynch in the doc claims, because I trust her to give the correct theory regardless of alignment but also I think she'd value me thinking for myself as well but damnit I really actually want to trust her because everything she says makes me want to sheep. She's like a charmer or something and idunno how much of that is even me just...being me with an idol.

While I wasn't happy with Transcend imploding at the end based on what likely was a town gambit, it feels understandable he thought it was legit based on play. He was a great sport throughout, trying when he felt it was impossible. Although I may seem critical of him in this analysis, he was quite an ideal scum partner doing his best and telling me exactly what he felt and needed. Hopefully he takes this as general tips. Onto the game itself.<br>\n<br>\nTranscend gave me all the claims when starting, which is a very helpful thing to do. JaeReed was correct in that I normally don't read on subbing in. If I was legit a doctor, I would have read the whole thing though. Determining who to heal based off a skim doesn't make too much sense. Yet, at daybreak, my claim depended on what JaeReed did. They did track me. That combined with mhsmith's role forced the doctor claim.<br>\n<br>\nWith all the suspicion on Hermie, I set out on making Hermie look like my buddy rather than explaining why he was awkward town. Hermie would naturally like me too given him being awkward town. That helps in two ways. First, if I won the 1 v 1, we'd win due to my buddy like defense. Second, if I lost the 1 v 1, Transcend was gifted a mislynch in Hermie and we distanced hard.<br>\n<br>\nTranscend's move away from that hurt. That set up a scenario where if JaeReed tracked me again, they had high odds of winning unless I could sell an even night roleblock/strongman. Given mhsmith0 was oddnight, this would rightfully be laughed at.<br>\n<br>\nTranscend was buddying the crap out of JaeReed and so was mhsmith0. Both town and scum do it, but I avoided it as much as possible because I knew they would be paranoid.<br>\n<br>\nGood game.", "time": "Sun Nov 13, 2016 4:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68870&start=1825", "forum": "53", "thread": "68870"}
