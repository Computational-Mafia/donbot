Perhaps he sees a lurker town flip as a safer result for him, as he won't look as bad tomorrow for getting a townie lynched. It looks like he's just trying to find someone he can make things stick on to get the heat off of him. I feel good about a day 1 lynx lynch, and if he were to flip town, then at least we'll have more perspective on me, Beck, and the other lynch advocates come day 2."}

I would expect someone who is actually aggro lurkers to be aggro towards them. The thing is in my experience people look down on people who are aggro towards lurkers because people think it is a cheap lynch, kind of like a policy lynch. When someone goes super hard after a lurker they are viewed in a negative light sometimes. I suspect the reason why lynx isn't all aggro towards lurkers is he is afraid of the negative attention. There is only 1 reason to be afraid of negative attention imo and that's when you are scum<br>7. His reaction to my 1 vote is not what i would expect from someone who is town, he accuses me of trying to criminalize him for simply pointing out that he is playing different than his town meta. That comes off as paranoia/fear<br>8. he really isn't scum hunting, he doesn't seem to have focus, and he doesn't even have a serious vote down.<br>9.

All of his posts on page 13 are things I had already said.  Parroting is bad, and it's even worse when you are generally a lurker with some parroting peppered in. As much as I hate putting a vote onto someone with no votes, I really think Aronis is the scummiest player we have right now.

Stop giving us this junk about how you can't lynch them all at once, so there's no point in trying.

It's going to be pretty hard at this point to talk me out of a Lynx lynch. He's opportunistic at best, and malicious at worst.

As a townie, your primary motive should not be to avoid being perceived as scum, but it shouldn't be completely out of the equation.  If people perceive you(a townie) as scum, then not only does your game get cut short, but it's bad for town.

There are a couple reasons scum might unvote there:  <br>1) Reducing the overall count on the wagon, keeping people from thinking it is attainable.  For instance, someone is much more likely to jump on a wagon (IMO) when we are approaching deadline that is at L-2 than L-3.  <br>2) To express some level of dissatisfaction with the wagon.  This could cause others to re-think and jump off or dissuade non-voters from jumping on<br><br>Either of these could be done in an effort to stop a wagon on scum or to secure a NL.<br><br>The unvote can also be done by town, but it doesn't completely make sense, because no one should really be worried about a quick-lynch at this point in the game.  A quick-lynch would just get the person who hammered lynched, so scum most likely wouldn't do it.  That being said, it did seem somewhat genuine from Bruin, so not sure which camp he falls into ATM."}

If Indigo gets replaced, then we are left with someone who could be scum, but we will have had no day 1 information to work with on them.

Forgive me for not letting someone who claims JK and then admits he fake-claimed and is actually RB live.  What?  Concerning the wagon itself, I think there is actually a chance it was entirely driven by town.  It's shocking to me that Aronis was actually telling the truth (on the second claim at least), and I wouldn't hold it against anyone that voted for him (obviously this statement is partially self-serving, but still).  <br><br>Additionally, if you can't be here most of the time, don't get upset when a hammer comes before your involvement actually comes.  Even if you think I hammered too quickly/the wagon went too fast, it is none of our faults that you couldn't be here/involved. There were only a couple days left until deadline and the general town was pretty clear, so it's a little disingenuous to treat my hammer like grossly premature as you are doing.<br><br>Bruin's resistance to the Aronis wagon looks a little off to me, although <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6350912#p6350912\">616</a> does feel pretty town.  Of the people on the wagon, I think there is a chance Dragonspawn is scum and a possible chance that Belisaurus is scum, but I don't really have strong reads on either.  I am inclined to see Madonna as town, because a lot of the emotion today seems genuine, but her suspicion of the hammer sucks.  I think it is almost definitely misguided town instead of scum.  I think there is a far greater chance of scum being off the wagon than on (which Madonna admittedly is pushing Bruin on). The fact that Lynx wanted to have Pacman lynched is weird, especially since he is (essentially) confirmed town."}

I will agree that an Aronis lynch looked good yesterday, and that you can argue it looked like the consensus. I will disagree that meant all discussion was over and that we should hurry to end the day. I will further point out that you ended the day early and that makes it directly your fault that I could not participate further. A premature end caused by you, and you go, \"Whelp, not my fault!\"?
