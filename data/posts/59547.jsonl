I'm curious why you are playing dumb?<br>\n<br>\n2 people have now said what you are saying isn't true.

Don't like post 45, specifically the part about asking if they can have toshibite properly rvs. If he wanted a proper rvs, he should have just asked for it.

I would expect someone who is actually aggro lurkers to be aggro towards them. The thing is in my experience people look down on people who are aggro towards lurkers because people think it is a cheap lynch, kind of like a policy lynch. When someone goes super hard after a lurker they are viewed in a negative light sometimes. I suspect the reason why lynx isn't all aggro towards lurkers is he is afraid of the negative attention. There is only 1 reason to be afraid of negative attention imo and that's when you are scum<br>\n7. His reaction to my 1 vote is not what i would expect from someone who is town, he accuses me of trying to criminalize him for simply pointing out that he is playing different than his town meta. That comes off as paranoia/fear<br>\n8. he really isn't scum hunting, he doesn't seem to have focus, and he doesn't even have a serious vote down.<br>\n9.

Here is what I am feeling:<br>\n<br>\nDragonspawn is definitely town.  Madonna's reason for thinking he is scummy are no good.  Town often have to slant things to get the reactions we are looking for.  <br>\n<br>\nAronis is probably scum.  He has said approximately nothing.  All of his posts on page 13 are things I had already said.  Parroting is bad, and it's even worse when you are generally a lurker with some parroting peppered in. As much as I hate putting a vote onto someone with no votes, I really think Aronis is the scummiest player we have right now.  Of the players with more than one vote(Bruin/Lynx/Beck), the only one I would feel comfortable voting is Lynx.  But for now, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aronis</span>.<br>\n<br>\nI think Beck is probably town, albeit a bit misguided.  There are pros and cons to his pacman tunneling, but overall it does read like genuine scum-hunting.  <br>\n<br>\nSerra is a null/lean-town to me.  While the votes and such with no context is a playstyle that I personally would never be interested in, this is very similar to the last game I played with him where he was town.<br>\n<br>\nIndigo has provided absolutely nothing to this game and has 5 posts.  Sucks, because it's hard to give a read other than one based on being a lurker, which isn't particularly alignment-indicative.<br>\n<br>\nHuntress: It's weird to me that you would choose to, given an apparent lack of time to read through/post, comment on Indigo.

There are a couple reasons scum might unvote there:  <br>\n1) Reducing the overall count on the wagon, keeping people from thinking it is attainable.  For instance, someone is much more likely to jump on a wagon (IMO) when we are approaching deadline that is at L-2 than L-3.  <br>\n2) To express some level of dissatisfaction with the wagon.  This could cause others to re-think and jump off or dissuade non-voters from jumping on<br>\n<br>\nEither of these could be done in an effort to stop a wagon on scum or to secure a NL.<br>\n<br>\nThe unvote can also be done by town, but it doesn't completely make sense, because no one should really be worried about a quick-lynch at this point in the game.  A quick-lynch would just get the person who hammered lynched, so scum most likely wouldn't do it.

Forgive me for not letting someone who claims JK and then admits he fake-claimed and is actually RB live.  What?  Concerning the wagon itself, I think there is actually a chance it was entirely driven by town.

Even if you think I hammered too quickly/the wagon went too fast, it is none of our faults that you couldn't be here/involved.

Of the people on the wagon, I think there is a chance Dragonspawn is scum and a possible chance that Belisaurus is scum, but I don't really have strong reads on either.  I am inclined to see Madonna as town, because a lot of the emotion today seems genuine, but her suspicion of the hammer sucks.  I think it is almost definitely misguided town instead of scum.  I think there is a far greater chance of scum being off the wagon than on (which Madonna admittedly is pushing Bruin on).

But defense of an informational-lynch on Toshi is bad.  And of course you aren't voting him right now.
