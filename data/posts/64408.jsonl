Really hard.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nYeah I'd lynch you at this point.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThat is page 1, saying he'd be fine actually lynching someone \"at this point\". Wow. Then:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nI would *definitely* lynch you right now.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is page 2. Shortly after he states that he hasn't joked about anything.<br>\n<br>\nTaleh, had I put her to L-1 on page 2 would you have announced intent to hammer? I definitely approve of pressure early on but this is seriously over the top.<br>\n<br>\nI've discussed my thoughts on Taly's Wickan vote, but I haven't said too much about FA's. FA pretty clearly voted for pressure, and Taly's unvote alleviated pressure. I'm having a really hard time suspecting FA for the vote though simply on account of Wickan looking so damn scummy right now, and Taly looking to have a higher likelihood of being a scum buddy. Additionally, I missed the first time around when Johnny actually pointed out to Taly that his vote on Wickan seemed \"too easy\", shortly before Taly's unvote. This strengthens my initial suspicion which has been weakened by other evidence. I think I'm just going to have to shelf that thought for now, because there are more interesting things actually.<br>\n<br>\nSo this interesting tidbit from Titus:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Titus wrote:</cite><br>\nThis Wickan wagon is crap.<br>\n<br>\nRC is voting someone who she has a townread on and didn't move the vote. Wicked points this out and votes RC.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nUm, no. This never actually happened. Wick<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">an</div> hadn't yet pointed this out. In fact, I can't find ANY mention of Wickan saying ANYTHING about Cowbells until well after the vote, and after Titus comes in and states why Wickan voted, despite Wickan not having actually said anything about this.<br>\n<br>\nAm I missing something there? This is triggering some SERIOUS daytalk paranoia. Then Wickan comes in during <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7430386#p7430386\" class=\"postlink\">post 77</a> and states that the things RC did to merit him voting her are \"unhelpful and anti-town\", though no mention of being scummy.<br>\n<br>\nA side note, can we please not have 2 people with the same LoL character avatar, when we already have players who have names that are easy to mix up?", "time": "Mon Nov 30, 2015 12:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64408&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "64408"}

I didn't form solid or accurate reads (I usually don't D1 - but then I tend to go crazy once I see some flips) - I was wagoned, told I had to make reads, and somewhat of a case or die - threw my vote and case on a townie; then got 3v1ed and hammered by scum right before the deadline.<br>\n<br>\nWasn't a pleasant experience.

I definitely approve of pressure early on but this is seriously over the top.<br>\n<br>\nI've discussed my thoughts on Taly's Wickan vote, but I haven't said too much about FA's. FA pretty clearly voted for pressure, and Taly's unvote alleviated pressure. I'm having a really hard time suspecting FA for the vote though simply on account of Wickan looking so damn scummy right now, and Taly looking to have a higher likelihood of being a scum buddy. Additionally, I missed the first time around when Johnny actually pointed out to Taly that his vote on Wickan seemed \"too easy\", shortly before Taly's unvote. This strengthens my initial suspicion which has been weakened by other evidence. I think I'm just going to have to shelf that thought for now, because there are more interesting things actually.<br>\n<br>\nSo this interesting tidbit from Titus:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Titus wrote:</cite><br>\nThis Wickan wagon is crap.<br>\n<br>\nRC is voting someone who she has a townread on and didn't move the vote.

This is triggering some SERIOUS daytalk paranoia. Then Wickan comes in during <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7430386#p7430386\" class=\"postlink\">post 77</a> and states that the things RC did to merit him voting her are \"unhelpful and anti-town\", though no mention of being scummy.<br>\n<br>\nA side note, can we please not have 2 people with the same LoL character avatar, when we already have players who have names that are easy to mix up?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI am confirmed mayor in another game.

I definitely approve of pressure early on but this is seriously over the top.<br>\n<br>\nI've discussed my thoughts on Taly's Wickan vote, but I haven't said too much about FA's. FA pretty clearly voted for pressure, and Taly's unvote alleviated pressure. I'm having a really hard time suspecting FA for the vote though simply on account of Wickan looking so damn scummy right now, and Taly looking to have a higher likelihood of being a scum buddy. Additionally, I missed the first time around when Johnny actually pointed out to Taly that his vote on Wickan seemed \"too easy\", shortly before Taly's unvote. This strengthens my initial suspicion which has been weakened by other evidence. I think I'm just going to have to shelf that thought for now, because there are more interesting things actually.<br>\n<br>\nSo this interesting tidbit from Titus:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Titus wrote:</cite><br>\nThis Wickan wagon is crap.<br>\n<br>\nRC is voting someone who she has a townread on and didn't move the vote.

In fact, I can't find ANY mention of Wickan saying ANYTHING about Cowbells until well after the vote, and after Titus comes in and states why Wickan voted, despite Wickan not having actually said anything about this.<br>\n<br>\nAm I missing something there? This is triggering some SERIOUS daytalk paranoia. Then Wickan comes in during <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7430386#p7430386\" class=\"postlink\">post 77</a> and states that the things RC did to merit him voting her are \"unhelpful and anti-town\", though no mention of being scummy.<br>\n<br>\nA side note, can we please not have 2 people with the same LoL character avatar, when we already have players who have names that are easy to mix up?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI am confirmed mayor in another game.

I need to sleep on this.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nOn ICE - yeah I don't really like his trajectory. He seems to be really amorphous on his reads and I don't think his arguments hold a lot of water. I'm slightly torn on him as a sort-of old-school player archetype, something between CrashTestDummy and Justin Playfair who were both oldschool who I played with before in the same game a while back.<br>\n<br>\nCTD had some thinking and pushes that I didn't agree with - couldn't see the sense in - and I argued with him and thought he was scum.<br>\nJustin had a more reasonable manner and took my thoughts very seriously and agreed with a lot of what I was saying (validating misreads I had at the time... particularly on CTD which is no surprise).<br>\n<br>\nWe ended up winning that game somehow, I can't remember exactly (I probably got nightkilled, I usually do). The moral of the story is I think ICE fits somewhere in between if I overlay the 'spectrum of old-school players' mental template I have. He could be town but I really don't like his push on you, his switchback on me, his reasoning for pushing in general, if that makes sense. He really does seem to have an agenda.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nWickan. The *interest* in the wagon built too quickly if that makes sense.<br>\n<br>\nJust on a heuristic analysis (I read his iso last night before flaking) - I don't think he had much scum-motivation to push of me unless my calmish response to his initial \"big push\" was enough to turn him around (or the subsequent discussion with FA). Sure as scum you might want to come in with a big initial push but then why let it peter off? I can't even remember who he voted instead of me but it's not like I was attacking him for scumreading me. His subsequent interactions haven't involved backing down (I'll state here with the exception of the dropped vote on RC in order to vote you which is why I asked him).<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing I saw was his refusal to bite on FA's \"who would you kill with a dayvig\" question. He just said \"nope\" which I read as town.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nFA you have my opinion on.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nAs far as those three go for lynch options, sure but I'd be hard-pressed to compromise on Wickan except for something like a deadline compromise and fucked if I'm spending 3 weeks deciding on Day 1 unless we all become happy little sprites making this thread a joy to read and post in :P<br>\n<br>\nI'm more interested in getting info from Simple Plan and ABR at this point to try to get a personal sway one way or another.<br>\nI can sort of see where Titus is coming from with ABR gut-wise, but he flaked out of my last game with a few jokey comments as scum.

And I must say I didn't read in depth much of the wallks they'd posted but I felt that Taly was pretty much obvtowning from what I remember of his play.<br>\n(note to self I need to check out Taly's 3rd party play)<br>\nHowever, I can perhaps see that as legitimate attempts to sort Taly since he doesn't have to have the same read as me and obviously won't have the same reasons.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly I didn't like how he switched back on me with an argument like \"well maybe you really WERE after a speedlynch\". I felt it was not thought through and didn't match any of the evidence in the thread, and could have been just a maneuvre to open up another line of suspicion since Frozen was obviously not gaining any support.<br>\nI believe he responded to that though, saying he is going to be constantly checking his reads - which is fine and townish enough. It was the lack of thought in the supposition that irked me, though.<br>\n<br>\nAside from that I have (or had) a general feeling that his reads aren't really becoming clarified. Look I understand that especially as a game goes on sometimes reads *don't* get easier, especially because you're only going to be right in a certain amount of cases, but Day 1 I think optimal lynches should be considered and I don't think your lynch-pool would be getting greyer and greyer. Anyway that point there is mainly feeling. I actually like his most recent post and that's after I'd been doing some reflection on whether his posting was actually coming from a more town perspective. I'm prepared to start thinking about consensus/compromise at this stage.<br>\n<br>\nSorry that's a bit all over the place but I need to get ready for work and I woke up at like 1am and couldn't get back to sleep O.o<br>\nHappy to have your feedback.", "time": "Thu Dec 03, 2015 8:37 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64408&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "64408"}

As in, nobody else is voting you, and I don't see anything scummy enough to vote you either. It's a word I use all the time. I agree with everbody else in this game, that you aren't worth a vote today! What's so hard to interpret about that? It directly parallels the thought of if EVERYBODY scumread a player, I could simply say I disagree, and that I'm not voting for that player. Are you seriously struggling to understand that, or are you just looking ing ANYTHING to use as a case on me? Either way, you need to wake the heck up off of your easy lynch mindset no do some REAL scum hunting.<br>\n<br>\nI saved this a minute and then went back and deleted all the swearing, because this case is really bad, and it's getting me pretty ticked off.

I have three school projects due in the next three days and a butt load of family stuff to deal with.<br>\n<br>\n-I felt ABR would be one of the easier players to get a read on based upon ISO alone. I worked my ass off in Newb 1606, and figured any sort of similarities here in terms of playstyle and attitude toward the game would be indicative moreso of town than a lot of people. I never seem to read RC right, Johnny was an enigma in my last game with him so it's basically square one again, and I've figured out by this point that if I'm town-reading Titus I'm usually wrong, and when I'm scum-reading Titus I don't trust myself because more often than not Titus looks town AF. I haven't played with the other half of the game before.<br>\n<br>\n-I listed several players back on 519. I think my big focus needs to be Wickan, as my counter-wagon, and IceNinja, the player ABR was voting prior to his Wickan vote. I want to see if I find myself reading Ice similarly.

But a few people have already scumread ABR because of his meta this game... yet the games he's linked have also had other players in this game in them.

I put Wickan to L-1, he gets unvoted, I respond to Titus who said that nobody could articulate Wickan-scum, I did - she misrepped me and still hasn't even replied to me on my responses to her 'accusation' and now my wagon is actually going places with really unexplained votes.<br>\n<br>\nThis is all after I think thoroughly on the possibilities of Wickan, SP, and Titus being scum and me saying of how I don't entirely trust the Wickan wagon because it has both scum and townreads I hold on i.<br>\n<br>\nNone of the interactions with me here feel genuine, if anything - it feels like this was planned.<br>\n<br>\nWickans wagon is being unvoted a lot; are you still content on staying there?

I gave ABR some faith in that read, apparently SP thinks the same noted events are worth the same level of faith/gamble I had, minus the sheep. (The ABR sheep I made was on Ice, iirc).<br>\n<br>\nI think that's a scumslip and ask for votes. Johnny and Titus follow me on to the Simple Plan wagon. Titus says she'll support any ABR or talah push. At some point ABR abandons his push on Ice, and joins the Wickan wagon, without much explanation. (I believe I asked him why, don't believe he responded.) Ice wagon evaporates. ABR had been sheeping Titus on Ice originally.<br>\n<br>\nTitus doesn't vote Wickan off the back of ABR's vote, but when ABR votes Taly, she sheeps onto that for some reason instead of pushing back on Ice.<br>\nLike literally any semblance of anyone scumreading Ice disappeared with no reason and I can't even remember why, aside from the reasoning and reassessment I myself made, he was being scumread in the first place. But it seems to revolve around Titus / ABR? I have no fucking idea.<br>\n<br>\nIn the meantime RC is playing a very measured game, not sure if this is scum or town and don't particularly intend to tempt fate by pushing there - but the read on Titus I want to say feels more town than scum just because of its greyness and lack of intent. There's a caution and a gutread and a meta-read, and there have been several strong statements which I don't mind at all. I think the read is wrong.<br>\n<br>\nI also think ABR could be scum.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Simple Plan</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Wickan</span><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">L-....2?</div><br>\n<br>\nSeriously, fuck lynching Taly.

I was expressing suspicion of FA, but greater suspicion of RC.<br>\n<br>\n@Johnny: I'm not \"twisting\" RC's vote at all.

Your vote suggests it is, but your vote is therefore scummy itself. It should not have required prompting to explain that vote.<br>\n<br>\nThe response to ICE is calm and collected, and I think that's fairly pro town, contrary to the rest of the post, and I like the points made about Taly here, though it is potentially setting up a vote for later.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7431566#p7431566\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7431566#p7431566\" data-post-id=\"7431566\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 113</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25949\">Wickan</a> wrote:</cite><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7431439#p7431439\">110</a> is ugly.

Since people are divided on the lynch candidate today, my quick changes are basically trying to get info., be open with people, and pushing for what I think is the best option overall as discussion progresses.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore; I don't really understand your comment of me 'needing to try more' - I've stated reasons, gave possible ideas and theories, pushed people I thought were scum multiple times, even listed some of my uncertainties, and I'm making an effort trying to get people to respond to them.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know what you're asking of me.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><br>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</div><br>\n<br>\nWickan claimed Hider?

Our plan needs to be to have him target one of the most suspicious players, the ones who haven't contributed as much and don't appear to.

Better possibilities, only one death plus two confirmed townies, or even a confirmed scum, and assuming target is town, it creates a tough decision for scum to deal with.<br>\n<br>\nAlternatively, what do we get from the three-player hider pool?

So I'm going to be shamelessly lurking from time to time (and especially at times when I'm either busy IRL, demotivated, or simply as with this game - kind of frustrated that we're talking around in circles and stubborning up rather than trying to compromise on lynches.<br>\n<br>\nWith regard to the hider pool thing.<br>\n<br>\nI don't really care what the pool is unless it's obviously bad. Free-for-all is a bad idea for a hider. A smaller pool is *better* but I also don't necessarily oppose a direct nomination if it has a *purpose*.<br>\n<br>\nI already mentioned I'm fine with being in the pool if ASP is lynched and - LO - look who I'm voting. I guess you can see that as scum-me potentially wanting to get in the pool so my old mate Wickan can claim town on me but frankly I don't actually like the other options being offered.<br>\n<br>\nAside from Simple Plan I would lynch any of Ice, ABR, RC, Frozen before Taly or Titus - and that's saying something considering it's half the playerlist. Read on Taly is familiarity with his style from last game and his basic openness regarding mental processes. I tunneled on him pretty hard in the previous game we played (town and town) - this is a pretty strong read from my end. Read on Titus is mostly gut-based and a culmination of what she's posted so far this game. I will admit there's an element of underlying not-sure with Titus always, but I don't want her to be a Day 1 lynch. I also read her hider-pool suggestion as pro-town with the fairly neutral options for substitution given lynches.<br>\n<br>\nI suppose there could be a possibility that there's some kind of setup with a strongman(?) which would kill a hider but not the hider's target if the target was protected?<br>\nTitus, I think you mentioned this. In that case the pool is better.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand there's also a possibility we have another investigative role like watcher which could directly watch who visited a target.<br>\nIn that case a single target would be better. If that's going to happen I'll put my hand up.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway I'm kind of just waiting to see what happens here because my preferred lynch right now is still ASP.<br>\n<br>\nJohnny, Titus, Taly, if you want to float compromises given other players' stated preferences I'm up for it.<br>\n<br>\nFrozen, Ice, Wickan - I'm interested to know if you're also willing to come to some sort of middle ground here too.<br>\n<br>\nABR I'm not particularly inclined to listen to any more since he's just randomly voting presumably for some kind of reaction.<br>\nRC just wants to tunnel Titus apparently.

But since you all want to play it safe, fine, I'll pretend.<br>\n<br>\nTitus's reasons given for having a 3 man lynch pool are essentially fine, but there are a couple issues with it. There are issues with picking a specific target, and there are issues with letting him go blind. Any strategy is going to have it's ups and downs I suppose. Honestly I don't have a problem with the hider pool being [me, ABR, ASP/talah], it seems as good as any, I just don't like the fact that probscum picked the pool and that everyone just blindly agreed with it.<br>\n<br>\nTaly's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7454825#p7454825\" class=\"postlink\">872</a> made me raise my eyebrow. Taly, despite often being unsure of votes, has never seemed THIS timid about things. This in particular:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Taly wrote:</cite><br>\nI rarely get NKed; but when I do - it's extremely early in game.<br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I get wagoned a lot, especially when I'm town. But a lot of my wagons are scum-led throughout my games...<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nbugs me a lot. It reads like scum trying to get sympathy to not get wagoned, and have a reason to be still alive at lylo. That combined with the back-and-forward on RC looks scummy as hell.<br>\n<br>\nI missed this first time around when asked if he crumbed:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickan wrote:</cite><br>\nI did not. However, I did laugh hysterically when I read FA's 421<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHrm. That would be AWFULLY lucky for scum to have caught and makes me worry if I've been wrong about Wickan all along. I probably would have chuckled if someone said something like that about my role too.<br>\n<br>\nFuck. Time to re-evaluate things.<br>\n<br>\nAnd...yeah this game is a mess.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like this from RC:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>RadiantCowbells wrote:</cite><br>\nI literally could not care less what the hider does. They can stay home for all I care.<br>\n<br>\nI don't need investigative roles to catch scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe only way that he's useful to me is if he checks Titus, which isn't about the investigation it's about proving it to you lot.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't find it scummy but I do find it anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nTaly seems to mirror my frustration with this game in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7454968#p7454968\" class=\"postlink\">905</a>. This comment isn't scum hunting, just reminding you guys that this game fucking sucks and people need to start working together more.<br>\n<br>\nTitus definitely seems to be thinking this whole hider thing through. Either he's town and just being smart about things, or he's scum and has perfectly engineered the hider even to work in scum's favor.<br>\n<br>\nWelp talah self voted, I guess that's where that wagon came from. I can see why it did too, holy shit where did that self vote even come from. The slightest bit of pressure from RC results in a self-vote??<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickan wrote:</cite><br>\nWhat do you think of this?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt makes me feel like I've been giving talah too much of a free pass based on early game stuff. It's been a long time since someone went from learning town to probscum THIS fast. Taly's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7461291#p7461291\" class=\"postlink\">1065</a> checks out too. I don't normally use meta so much, but \"Don't self-vote as town ever, no matter how tempting it might be.\" said as town is pretty definitive.<br>\n<br>\nAnd of course Titus thinks talah is town. Essentially anything I think, Titus thinks the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">exact opposite</div>.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nCan you tell me what was scummy about the self-vote apart from \"WAY TOO\" please. Usually self-votes are scummy because they're inauthentic or because they have some kind of fake appeal to emotion.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nYours was both. You had ONE vote of pressure and you suddenly went all self vote.<br>\n<br>\nI finally agree with Titus on something, talah flipping scum almost certainly makes Taly town.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nSo I decided I'd give him some help with wagonning me. Maybe he'd push a case, maybe I'd become a juicy target. Who knows. But I've done this before as town in at least a couple of games. So I guess my blanket statement about not self-voting is - well circumstantial (as it related to Netherspite in that game) and a bit pie-in-the-sky. Sometimes I just find it quite difficult to keep everything super-optimal and serious especially when games drag out on Day 1 like this. So I take a sidetrack or two.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is one of the most absurd defenses I've ever seen.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nAlso the self-vote was the second vote on the wagon. I literally created the wagon.<br>\nDo you think that doesn't line up with me having some purpose for it?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThe <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">only</div> possible point I can see to doing this is to distract town and throw discussion off even more. Maybe it's because ASP is a scum buddy and you wanted to distract people from the leading wagon?<br>\n<br>\n@RC could you further explain your <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7463081#p7463081\" class=\"postlink\">1092</a>?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nASP I'm going to suggest actually might be town based on the fact there is zero resistance to his lynch - either that or he's simply being bussed at this point because his lynch seemed inevitable. I can vote here but have changed my mind on preference.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis could be relevant information after we have a talah flip.<br>\n<br>\nAlso let's consider these three points in sequence:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nFrozen's vote on my wagon was the most opportunistic<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nTaly's push was pretty bad too<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nICE I mistrust because of his *lack* of suspicion on me, actually<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThe pushes on me are bad, but ICE is mistrusted because he didn't push on me.<br>\n<br>\nHo boy.<br>\n<br>\nTalah is also using a copy-paste where some of the information present was pre-talah wagon, making himself look better than he would if it started after.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah wrote:</cite><br>\nSo I'm not getting into a wall-war with you<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is at the beginning of a wall-war post. I don't really need to add anything to it.<br>\n<br>\nTitus, your <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7463815#p7463815\" class=\"postlink\">1124</a> doesn't track because the reason my name is all over that thing is because I never contributed to it. What you're looking at is a \"this is what wasn't contributed in that list\", of which I contributed nothing.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Titus wrote:</cite><br>\nIce has been almost every wagon only bussing ASP when this pattern became apparent.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is flat out wrong. I've basically voted Wickan 80% of the day, you 15% of the day, and ASP 5% of the day. Where the fuck are you getting this info? Oh that's right, you're going to make sure reality is twisted to suit your agenda, because that's what scum does.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>FA wrote:</cite><br>\nwhat do you think about the inverse list thing talah brought up. no one else has any problems with that? as he wanted to say its people conscious <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\"><br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt's scummy as hell.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ABR wrote:</cite><br>\nAbandon your solo wagons and vote talah.<br>\n<br>\nI'm done.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nFor the record my vote has been on ASP not Titus, as the mod seems to think.<br>\n<br>\nSorry Johnny, not sheeping you on this.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote talah</div>.

Day 1 there were so few people really agreeing en-masse that it was hard to look at one player and say that their reasons for doing stuff was really scummy.<br>\nReally I was looking at your play of just voting whoever seemed weak at the time and thinking to myself... weee-eeell, I think he'd actually try to do that less if he was scum.<br>\n<br>\nHad a bit of a chuckle at the heartfelt emotion coming into Day 2 as well. Nice one, you deserved the win. Ice's play I though was pretty solid too, and Jeane played pretty well (with the exception of the hammer I suppose) and then followed your advice Day 2.<br>\ngg guys.<br>\n<br>\nGuess I ended up with a bad tunnel of my own on Frozen and made a few other questionable plays.<br>\nStill, enjoyed it and thanks to all of you.<br>\nHappy Christmas and all that jazz. :)<br>\n<br>\n(and P.S.
