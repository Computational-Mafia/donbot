No you didn't ISO everyone that's pretty obvious, you're simply trying to make a reason to not scum read Eggman.

No you didn't ISO everyone that's pretty obvious, you're simply trying to make a reason to not scum read Eggman. Furthermore there are 6 players scum reading him means that clearly a lot of townies are scum reading him, why the fuck is that a reason to cancel your scum read?? <br><br>Answer is it isn't. You don't have any reason to stop scum reading him since we both know your first reason is clearly BS.

But like you said before, he could be manipulating us.  Currently, not judging anything but his ISO, I would have him somewhere between townlean and town.

I think the problem we are having is that while many people read just off people's ISO, I believe that we should consider all the possibilities before we make a decision.

When I read his reason for voting egg I found that reason to not be a good one. He's accused egg of doing something I'd expect from any player not trying to get lynched. Defend yourself but keep focusing on the game and trying to find scum. I also added in the fact that smitherines seemed to be pushing harder for an egg lynch yet I felt his posts imply that he is more suspect of creature. Creature was my top scum read also and him insisting that we learn more from an egg lynch over his top scum read was fundamentally wrong imo and I didn't feel good about being on that wagon. I also decided to Iso egg and thought his post 267 wasn't bad. He is giving some reasons and explaining himself and he didn't look frazzled doing it. Plus whether I agree with him or not he comes off as genuine about his \"crumb\" explanation."}

When a player comes off of a game where their initial reads are pretty damn accurate, most players don't decide to change and do something else.

Creature still bothers me because of the blatant lies and shotty reasoning to back off the Eggman wagon so early. His reason was the crumb claim. While it's possible this really swayed him, his logic was completely faulty. That makes me feel like he was hoping for an Eggman lynch to get himself some town cred once egg flipped town. While I think creature is my strongest scumread at the moment, I'm still suspicious of others and I think Robb is right to say we should use more of this day to put pressure on different people and get more ideas on them.

So lets say someone is town right, that means most of the time their actively scum-hunting and trying to win the game for the town. This vibe would be shown early on and you claim its better to show this vibe or to show your VT vibe rather than keep to your self until actual evidence can be used against people, but maybe this is just opinion. But instead of trying to be the person that is tryng to scum-hunt, you denouce your vote on my and hop on the wagon, even though you claimed to vote for me because I voted for you(idk actually why you voted for me). I'm trying to say that its weird that you try to scum-hunt but wait till the wagon is full enough to join without suspicion.

A player who is uninformed is likely to stick to a person who they've discovered is scum with a high degree of confidence.

The point is that a townie doesn't play in that fashion, because it involves a detachment of concern from finding scum. Yes, theoretically it is good play. Town don't do this 'good play,' because it actually doesn't reflect a straight forward pursuit of the town win con. It's more how an emotionless robot would play the game, or a scum with no interest in helping the town. Also, this is what I meant by saying you need to be watched.

I've seen all town neighborhoods before so they are certainly possible. <br><br>Also I don't know if it's just the 2 of us or if there are more. The mod didn't tell us. He basically said we could introduce ourselves. Now he didn't lock the thread during that long pregame and that worried me. I felt whoever else was in the game was probably scum. To go 2 days without even a hello was weird. I made a comment about it and right after the mod made a post that implied to me that the lack of posting wasn't suspicious which resulted in me having a conversation with the mod via pm because I interpreted that as alluding to alignment. He confirmed that he didn't and my concerns were unreasonable. It took a while (working off memory here) after the game started for him to finally post and his excuse wasn't that beliveable to me. <br><br>Now his play during the game didn't bother me much so he was on the null spectrum but after the post from the new replacement (petroleum?) he made some valid points that made me move him back to the null or possibly scummy section. I am not sure if I buy his response to petroleum so where it stands he's a slight scum read and since neither of us are confirmed alignment to each other I figure it doesn't hurt anything revealing we have a neighborhood. <br><br>I assume it's just us 2. <br><br>That's basically where I'm at with him. <br><br>What about you?"}

I will just make a few comments.<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">a.)</span> Robbnva, you seem to be going out of your way to show how 'helpful' and 'engaged' you are, hence my issue with the wording of some of your posts.  In fact, you made fun of Dwlee99 for \"trying so hard\" to look Town (\"ladhst\") while doing the same yourself.  Your reaction to his serious vote on you was \"I'm not scum but... you're on my watch list.\"   You then were apparently so engaged by page 4 of the game that you had to \"calm down.\"  You were <span style=\"font-style: italic\">then</span> so engaged and posting-on-the-fly that upon discovering you \"missed\" Creature's case on Smithereens, instead of simply reading it you said that you'll \"read it later.\"  What I don't like here is that you were actively and constantly posting; you could have just and gone back and read it instead of explaining you were going to do it.  I just see \"look how engaged I am!\"<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">b.)</span> I am not defending atm487, but I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">am</span> attacking the way in which you dealt with atm487.  He is a new player, and your language while speaking to him was rather insulting.  You go so far as to state that he could not be seriously suspicious of you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">now</span> or else he should have mentioned his feelings <span style=\"font-style: italic\">earlier</span>.  <br><br>First, that's not how this game works.  People very  much <span style=\"font-style: italic\">can</span> keep opinions to themselves for multiple reasons.  And newer players in particular can be nervous about attacking players (especially vocal / abrasive ones).<br><br>Second, atm487 <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> mention his suspicion of you (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035548#p8035548\" class=\"postlink\">Post #100</a>). <br><br>Third, while insulting him, you also claimed to have <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8054424#p8054424\" class=\"postlink\">never voted for atm487</a>.  Except you atm487 was your first non-serious vote (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8036220#p8036220\" class=\"postlink\">Post #107</a>), <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> you voted him (without explanation) directly after he expressed suspicion of you.<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">c.)</span> Berating somebody for asking for prods is bad; asking for prods is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">good</span>.<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">d.)</span> Claiming that you will ignore players is also bad.<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">e.)</span> I am unsure of Eggman because I have trouble reading newer players.  I would not consider attempting to crumb a vanilla townie, for example.  And I do not know how I could put myself into a \"newbie mentality\" any more.  While I do not think his play was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">good</span>, I have a hard time deciding if it is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scummy</span>.<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">f.)</span> I can pressure who I want in the order I wish.  Your criticism that I should be pressuring Dragon of the West or Smithereens over yourself are noted."}

Cause I'm not really seeing the scum motivation for his actions</div></blockquote><br><br>To an extent, yes.  I have played with Robbnva once before while he was under a different name, and it was one of the singularly most unpleasant games I have participated in.  I would much rather not interact with him at all, and I would not have offered to replace if I had known.  But I'm here.  Given this backdrop, I actually did take a step back and decide whether I am being influenced by annoyance or suspicion.<br><br>He is trying too hard to make sure we remember how involved he is in the game.  He claims everybody should have an opinion on him but he is dismissive of people whose opinion is suspion (and this contradicts his attempts to say he \"doesn't care\" how he is perceived).  He keeps acting like he has made silver-bullet cases against people (catching them in \"lies\") when at best he has hit on some potential contradictions.<br><br>He has tried to direct investigation targets twice, which is something he should know not to do with his level of experience.  Now he has also outed his Neighborhood, which if Town is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">obviously bad</span>.  If both Robbnva and Dragon of the West are Town, that just gives the scum a much better perspective of what they are dealing with.  The reveal did not even accomplish anything.  So why do it?  It looks to me that it was largely in response to having somebody expressing genuine suspicion of him (i.e., me) and trying to vaguely suggest perhaps we should poke at Dragon of the West instead.<br><br>I have not liked his votes, which have been: vote atm498 afer being called a slight scumlean on page 4; putting Eggman at L-1 on page 17 (i.e., never switching his early vote until it puts somebody near death); switching to Creature after a Creature-Eggman team was discussed; putting crazycrabman at L-2 (while requesting an investigation on Creature); voting for Smithereens while arguing over Eggman-Creature connection; and now voting No Lynch to 'make a point.'  He basically held on to his vote early until he could put a player close to being lynched, then switched while connecting that player to another player, then put a third player close to being lynched, and now he's starting to get erratic after those lynches did not go through.  His two latest votes have essentially involved him putting his fingers in his ears (claiming he should \"ignore\" Smithereens, and voting No Lynch because apparently there's something \"wrong\" with us).<br><br>Players who play \"emotionally\" can still be scum, and you can expect them to act emotional when they are scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.)</span> Infinity 324, can you explain Robbnva's position in your list:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8069343#p8069343\" class=\"postlink\">post 926</a>, Infinity 324 wrote:</cite>From scummiest to towniest, it goes something like this:<br>Derek, Mario, petroleum, dragon, crab, atm, robb, dwlee, eggman, f-oh-ex, smith, creature</div></blockquote><br><br>Robbnva is one of the few players you have actually expressed and explained your suspicion on.

He's spent almost all of his time ivoting crazycrab, although he seems to be active. He then seems to push Eggman primarily while the wagon was the most popular- after it fades away his attention on Eggman vanishes and he goes back to crab. He doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab. I can understand this if he has limited time online but it doesn't seem like he is, and even if he is I've found as scum, when I do have limited time, I focus on mostly my push and trying to validate it without pushing any other cases, rather than trying to generalize and find good cases (which is what I would do as town)- I'm not the same person as Derek but I think it's an instinct many would have. This is a somewhat bad scumread but it's lower than null nevertheless.<br><br>Eggman- \"do you think there are 3 scum in a 13p game\" is bad. I dislike 199, specifically the part where he says \"I wanted to make a post to show that I was reading.\" Town don't really feel like justifying anything, but scum are generally always on the lookout for their own survival- or newer ones are anyhow. In 267 he says he's not aware of how to scumhunt. This is kinda a serious problem and you'd think he'd have figured it out in his three completed games. Sure enough, a quick look at \"Celestial Mafia\" where he is actively trying to scumhunt. He is aware of how to scumhunt. This strangely seems to drop, with Creature coming in with a townread on Eggman with a read that doesn't make sense.<br><br>crazycrab- I can see the scumminess of this slot when I open the ISO but it isn't hard to put into words- I might be seeing something different. crazycrab is commenting on different light reads. Post 173 is especially over the top, with \"feel\" appearing twice, along with its old comrade \"from my experience\". Yet he does make a good point about Eggman- although that isn't hard to fake if Eggman is town. He then follows this up by defending him slightly- this could indicate they are scumbuddies. His #254 is valid, but #173 is still bad. Later on, #515 is bad. If he thought the push was stupid, why didn't he say so instead of just saying that it was probably a SvS and the two most discussed players at the time were his top scumreads, along with those who hadn't posted? <br>\"I think the problem we are having is that while many people read just off people's ISO, I believe that we should consider all the possibilities before we make a decision. I don't know if this is a good strategy because I have only tested it on one game, but it is what seems most fair to me.\"- this means that he has tested this strategy he is apparently using before. He makes the next few posts about his strategy; a musing by Fohex on crab's Dwlee read turns into a criticism on his strategy, and then says that he was \"testing\" a strategy in this game? 1)- you said you'd tested it before? and 2)- what's all this talk about strategy about? This game is a scumhunting game, and just because people thought your explanations weren't good enough doesn't mean you should hide your reasoning so that you can keep reads that are unsatisfying to other people? <br>Y'know, this makes me think- what is he planning to do this game if not explaining his reads? Explaining reads is the way to get your scumreads lynched, and if he's not planning to explain his reads, is he just planning to just state his reads and skate by the whole game?

No one (including myself) thought this was a very good defense of himself. Since pressuring him further he hasn't responded or given a more sound defense. That is why we've still been pressuring and looking for further responses. Ultimately it's a guessing game but Tojam is our best bet.

After this is when I took my vote off as a precautionary measure. If you would actually read through the game rather than quote the little sections that are convenient for your argument you would have realized this. Also if you read on in the game, atm DOES end up derphammering(which turns out to be a scum hammer) and even says he'd take his vote off Tojam because he didn't realize a hammer vote is final, so my fear was somewhat justified. This game, however, I trust most of you realize how the hammering system works and atm has specifically learned"}

And after this, I see practically nothing scummy in the slot. Robb is asking questions, and there's not much leverage for a strong read apart from the strong feeling he's trying to solve the game.<br>Creature- Starts the Eggman wagon. He then tries to meta from 1 game- do you think this is particularly useful Creature? His case on me is that I don't use the same style every game- not that I was using a style at that point. I don't particularly like that at all but it might be bias. So he goes on a crusade against lurkers, and he says it's unlikely scum was claim VT. He calls him a mislynch bait after 1 game in which he was mislynched and he thinks the crumb couldn't be planned- this is bad too.<br>In post 404:<br>\"Let me see:<br>- stelo and Akigoku did absolutely nothing.<br>- MarioManiac4 has just talked about his meta but stopped giving contributions.<br>- It's creepy how much tunneling there were.<br>- We have 7 days.<br>- I still think Eggman will flip town.\"<br>1. And this is scummy, unusual or worth mentioning?<br>2. I was bogged down with irl at that time. I didn't have much time to read through, and most of what I did see seemed null, so I defended myself from wrong accussations. You're trying to make it seem as if I was talking about my meta, rather than reply to your reason for voting me?<br>3. What? People looked at Eggman because he was scummy; I don't particularly think there was much tunnelling?<br>4. Correct, but we don't have to use all of it. That just creates apathy and more time for scum to discuss their nightkill; if the day's over make it over.<br>5. He crumbed VT in an obscure way that he could point to- do you think Eggman couldn't think of that? I think he could.<br><br>His POE list is NAI.<br>Smith asks Creature questions and the results are telling to me. The push on Smith is related to Smith calling Creature a newb, which doesn't really discredit his reads. <br>@1006; I mean, when I looked at the Smith ISO I mostly saw reads and comments; nothing solid to grasp on. A bit like Rob actually.<br>\"I don't think you're trying to comment on the current situation.\"- and that is scummy, how? <br><br>Also, I'm catching up which you might see if you read my posts, instead of me being busy and finding things null for a while being OMGSCUM.

I showed why both of these were not the case, yet you still want to claim that me being \"contradictory\" is the problem. I don't get your line of thinking if I've proven all of your and pj's points to be incorrect. You're only response has been along the lines of \"even having the conversation is scummy, so disregard that we were wrong about everything we said. he's still scum anyway\". It's such a bad vote and push I'm tempted to vote you back just for your complete absence of actual reasoning</div></blockquote><br><br>I never said that you being contradictory was the problem, I said that the contradiction about the crumb was the thing petroleum was pointing out. Stop pretending like I don't have any actual reasons. You overexplained yourself by stating thing that weren't necessary to respond to the point petroleum was trying to make, and you gave a explanation for the unvote of eggman that doesn't look genuine. You seriously didn't consider eggman's crumb as coming from town until creature and I pointed it out? Just sounds like a reason to jump off the eggman wagon as it died down. After that, you made a huge deal about me calling your post scummy and made assumptions about why I did that, which reads as scum desperate to defend themselves."}

MarioManiac4 paints Derek12 as spending all of his time pursuing crazycrabman (\"he doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab\"), while Derek12 has very clearly been poking at other players and asking them questions.  He also states that Derek12 seemed to push the Eggman wagon at it's peak, and that does not appear to be true at all.<br><br>I agree that Eggman seemed much more involved and proactive in Celestia Mafia at a glance (and see below).<br><br>And I do agree that crazycrabman claiming to have a \"strategy\" is concerning in itself (since by and large, only scum really think about \"strategies\" to get through the Day).  But I think this comes down to the use of the word \"strategy\"; I think \"playstyle\" is more accurate for what crazycrabman is describing.<br><br>-&gt; <span class=\"noboldsig\">b.)</span> I also don't understand why Smithereens was included (and then not analyzed) by MarioManiac4.

Oh, only other acceptable time for VT to claim: in \"roleclaim or die\", or LYLO.</div></blockquote><br><br>From the looks of it, Eggman was eventually run up Day One, claimed Townie, and eventually hammered himself in order to help Town achieve a lynch.  On the one hand, given the above quotes, I am less inclined to think Eggman is scum in this game.  But on the other hand, Eggman really <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> much more proactive and helpful in that game than this one.  Eggman, could you please elaborate on your thoughts of claiming Vanilla Townie on Day One?

That scum counter-claimed him.  The game lasted a total of about nine real-time days.  I can definitely see how this game would be comparatively less exciting.

And if you do not think it is acceptable to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">claim</span> Townie on Day One, why do you think it is acceptable to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">crumb</span> Townie on Day One?</div></blockquote><br>My philosophy on when to claim VT hasn't changed: however, if I saw a VT claim coming from someone who was about to be lynched, my first thought about them would be \"lying mafioso\" instead of \"actually a VT\". So, like I've said before, I wanted to back up the claim with something to avoid the D1 mislynch I had predicted.<br>Evidently, it worked. So I'm happy about that, but I probably won't try crumbing in the future."}

MarioManiac4 paints Derek12 as spending all of his time pursuing crazycrabman (\"he doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab\"), while Derek12 has very clearly been poking at other players and asking them questions.  He also states that Derek12 seemed to push the Eggman wagon at it's peak, and that does not appear to be true at all.<br><br>I agree that Eggman seemed much more involved and proactive in Celestia Mafia at a glance (and see below).<br><br>And I do agree that crazycrabman claiming to have a \"strategy\" is concerning in itself (since by and large, only scum really think about \"strategies\" to get through the Day).

Oh, only other acceptable time for VT to claim: in \"roleclaim or die\", or LYLO.</div></blockquote><br><br>From the looks of it, Eggman was eventually run up Day One, claimed Townie, and eventually hammered himself in order to help Town achieve a lynch.  On the one hand, given the above quotes, I am less inclined to think Eggman is scum in this game.  But on the other hand, Eggman really <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> much more proactive and helpful in that game than this one.  Eggman, could you please elaborate on your thoughts of claiming Vanilla Townie on Day One?

Sometimes I just fail to get in, sometimes I chase someone looking to get out of RVS and sometimes I just chill and pick out things that are scummy. I can't really give you only one answer for that.<br>As for scum, I usually pick out someone to tunnel and pick on them actively for the first few days.<br>I think in this game, life has got through, I haven't got a foothold, and my play has been poor as a result.<br>As scum, I've never really been in a position where I were to claim D1 but if I were, I could claim VT or PR depending on the situation. Like, if PRs had already claimed I would claim VT, but if we had safeclaims I'd claim PR. In the majority of games in which it'd be even I would most likely follow my scumbuddies."}

Also, I didn't feel comfortable with it just being robb and I. I was seriously concerned about a possible scum lurker hiding in the neighborhood getting info about our reads and using that to their advantage.

In response, you said that quote made you think MarioManiac4 might be scum with crazycrabman.  Which -- beyond the fact that this suggests you have read that far into the game -- is rather a non sequitur given that crazycrabman has flipped Town.  It does not address at all whether MarioManiac4 would still be scum in the event crazycrabman is Town.  Essentially, you said nothing while dismissing a potential reason for thinking MarioManiac4 might be Town.<br><br>You are acting purposefully obtuse.  <br><br>So what all have you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> read, then?"}

Stop pretending like I don't have any actual reasons. You overexplained yourself by stating thing that weren't necessary to respond to the point petroleum was trying to make, and you gave a explanation for the unvote of eggman that doesn't look genuine. You seriously didn't consider eggman's crumb as coming from town until creature and I pointed it out? Just sounds like a reason to jump off the eggman wagon as it died down.

I have tried to compare his play in this game to some of his posting in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=94&amp;t=64493\" class=\"postlink\">Mini Normal #1744 Mafia Forum</a>.  In that QT where Daytalk was also available, MarioManiac4 seemed to have spurts of posting every few days and seemed fairly aware of in-game events.  His play in the game itself (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=64492\" class=\"postlink\">Mini Normal #1744</a>) generally seemed aggressive and revolved around interactivity (i.e., with a gameplan / coordination).  That seems to be lacking in this game (i.e., he seems more lost / lacking motivation).  Of course he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span> be scum who is similarly disinterested in the game, but the whole picture makes me lean Town on him."}

And I did read that you would shift from Creature to crazycrabman.  Your reasoning seems to boil down to a single quote:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8084494#p8084494\" class=\"postlink\">post 1143</a>, F-oh-ex wrote:</cite>MM4 is somewhat of a townlean to me but that might stem from the fact I strongly scumread Creature and I don't see them as a duo.

Which is not particularly strong reasoning when we were pushed up against a deadline and just need to lynch <span style=\"font-style: italic\">somebody</span>.  The fact that you set yourself up from switching from Creature to crazycrabman does not explain why you were seemingly unwilling to switch to voting for MarioManiac4.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.)</span> <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8147068#p8147068\" class=\"postlink\">post 1543</a>, F-oh-ex wrote:</cite>And yes, I never offered to switch, quite a few people were sitting on the fence and offered to switch while my mind was made up.</div></blockquote><br><br>That actually does not seem terribly accurate with the timeline.  Before you made your post saying that \"somebody has to switch,\" the only person who seemed on the fence enough to switch their vote was Dragon of the West:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8086900#p8086900\" class=\"postlink\">post 1220</a>, Dragon of the West wrote:</cite>Ah crap I didn't even get to check if the server was back up today.

If MM4 / NJAC is scum, it's a mafioso defending their buddy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8148526#p8148526\" class=\"postlink\">post 1556</a>, NJAC wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8147570#p8147570\" class=\"postlink\">post 1549</a>, Eggman wrote:</cite>I'm not sure who the third mafioso could be, but I'm pretty sure on {DGB, NJAC}.</div></blockquote><br>Pretty sure?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> What's your case on DGB that makes you \"pretty sure\" he's scum?</div></blockquote><br>I wrote a small case on Smithereens.

But I think that might have just been him being eager and worried after seeing 2 nightkills. I do, however, worry about how his reads seem to fly in every direction at some point. They feel like they just change on a whim not only about me but about several others as well. This isn't enough for me to force a wagon on him at the moment but I'm very likely to be open to a creature wagon if anything else develops on him during this day. <br>For his thoughts on me: If Infinity is town, I wonder if scum!creature would see infinity as a more viable lynch than myself which is why Creature shifted around his reads on us, especially after you saying that either infinity or myself is probably scum.

A single crosskill is as good as a correct lynch; and a correct lynch followed by a crosskill is even better.  The best part is (for us), is that is also to the scum's advantage to attempt to crosskill.  Having three factions in a game has a way of oddly 'balancing' because each faction has to keep the other factions in check.

Here, Smithereens made a bargain to lynch one player Day One (with presumably no information) in exchange in lynching another player Day Two (based on no information while also promising to essentially ignore information gained during Night One).  In this case, Smithereens offered to lynch Creature in exchange for lynching crazycrabman.  We already know that lynching crazycrabman was not going to work in our favor, and it's possible Creature is Town as well.

Given that crazycrabman was lynched and flipped Town, this reflects rather poorly.  Also of note, the end of Day One was literally the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">first time</span> Smithereens had ever directly mentioned MarioManiac4.

But she's maintained a scumread on NJAC / MM4 since she replaced in, up until NJAC made a post calling out \"boring\"posts. I don't like that sudden read swap very much, as I'd expect someone's scumreads to stay consistent.

That means we have another Vig (very improbable), SK or it's a multiball setup. It's my first game outside Newbie Games here so I'm not sure what makes more sense, multiball or a Serial Killer. Since no one has mentioned multiball so far, I'm going to go with a Serial Killer.<br><br>I'll repeat myself - from what I read on wiki, SKs are often Bulletproof/X-shot Bulletproof. That could explain the missing kills. Another explanation will be that 2 people targetted the same person but it would have to happen twice in a row.<br><br>Now, tactical question: Assuming it's 4v2v1 (I think the general consensus was that we started with 9v3v1), do we want to lynch Mafia or SK?<br><br>1. If we lynch Mafia, we go to 4v1v1 at Night. At this point, the most likely outcomes are 3v1 (which is great, given our current situation) or 2v1v1 (which would be horrible as the game is out of our hands).<br>2. If we lynch SK, we go to 4v2 at Night. Unless we have some kill stopping role, we go to 3v2. And even if we do, we can't count on stopping the kill. This puts at LyLo twice in a row.<br><br>At first glance it seems that lynching Mafia is a high risk high reward scenario but how the game goes depends largely on nightkills. Lynching SK puts us in double LyLo but we know we won't autolose at Night."}

Is it just slow during Summer? Decline of players (and interest) on the site in general? The frustrating thing is that I'm sure this woudn't have happened if my game started closer to when I signed up as a mod. That was fucking February. I also noticed I had a bunch of newbies in my player list. It worried me a little, but I didn't want to judge, so I went ahead. We know how that turned out. Props to Fox for being an exception to this.<br><br>It's also frustrating, because it actually had the same number of replacements as my first game, however, despite that, my first game actually turned out ok I thought. Anyway, thanks to all players who stuck it out til the end (or their end at least). I hope at least some of you had a modicum of fun.<br><br>Also once again my apologies to Robb, Smithereens had to replace out soon after the day start, because he was moving out. He inititally didn't want to use his ability, but I found that strange, I mean, why waste an opportunity to use it, so I casually and openly wondered how his replacement would feel about a potentially wasted shot, though I didn't explicitly wanted to suggest he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">should</span> use it. But it was enough to change his mind, and he shot Robb, someone who was townread by most I believe. That said, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">suspect</span> him shooting Robb had nothing to do with him suspecting him of being mafia, but he's free to comment on that himself if he wants.<br><br>Robb also complained about the fact I didn't explicitly state who his neighbours were. I believe it's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">common</span> to do so, but it's not standardized, I've asked about that during review. With it not being standardized, I was left to make my own decision on that, so I decided the option which suited me best: to not state who the neighbours were. This was both out of principle and because of set-up design. When a player rolls a neighbour role, but is not comfortable with using that ability, I feel that player should have the choice of not using it, but that's impossible when your neighbour already knows your role. The other reason..<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8081218#p8081218\" class=\"postlink\">post 1104</a>, Robbnva wrote:</cite>He asks if it's just us 2<br><br>I reply idk and mod won't tell me (earlier I had asked the mod for names of neighbors and he said they can introduce themselves.

Fox had a chance to absorb the role cop neighbour role, granting him access to the neighbourhoos secretly. I didn't want to force him to communicate with the other neighbour, so it was a conscious decision not to list the active neighbours.<br><br>I also found it a bit strange he just blurted out him and Dragon being neighbours back then.

Just like the mafia thread. I've done this with all my previous games, and it never was a problem since confirmations never lasted that long before. I now see it's not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">ideal</span> and I'll probably leave them closed in future games. That said, it obviously doesn't reveal alignments in any way whatsoever, Robbs problem is that he assumes too much, and I can't help he's reading too much into things. Dragon had not posted yet during confirmations, and that worried Robb. Now, if you go back to page 1, you can actually see Dragon neglected to properly confirm (and on a sidenote, I'm probably going to require 100% confirmations for future games). I was inclined to not interfere, but I thought <span style=\"font-style: italic\">maybe</span>, Dragon isn't aware he's a neighbour (he only confirmed the role cop part), and I thought I'd be doing the game a disservice if I didn't at least remind him of that. Personally I thought it would be hilarious if he continued not being aware of his role, but for the greater good I sent him a PM anyway. Turns out, Dragon was aware, but simply forgot to post. He did so soon after, mentioning he simply forgot. Well this was all suspicious to Robb. Yeah sure, he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could've</span> been a scum who didn't want to post in the neighbourhood thread.. Or he could've been a townie who simply forgot to post there. I'm not responsible for Robb's suspicions."}

It was a joke suggestion, and it wouldn't have served any other purpose than being an example role PM, and showing players what a role PM of a non-vanilla would look like (as an alternative to the 1-shot mafia cop used in the OP currently). That said, if I recall correctly, what I had in mind was a mafia fruit vendor who would kill someone upon death (by lynching). If you've been rereading the review: this is exactly why I wanted to add slashes in role names. And that said, I love to include unexpected joke roles which still serve some purpose.

I don't know how common or uncommon it is for neighbours to claim in the neighbourhood. Anyway, I was obviously fine with the possibility that they wouldn't work together.<br>I'm influenced by..

Any opinions on the setup balance-wise?</div></blockquote><br>Ah come on, you and I both know that's not why it took 3 months.</div></blockquote><br>Reviewers flake fairly often. That review took an exceptionally long time even allowing for the reviewer flakes, though.<br><br>(Part of it is that if the setup is simple I can often determine it to be balanced within 24 hours, but something like this takes a lot longer. It means that the reviewers have a tendency to repeatedly put it off. It also means that I can be far from confident that the setup is balanced even when the review is finished. I don't begrudge that \u2013 it wouldn't do to have all the Mini Normals look the same \u2013 but it's something that can hold things up for a while.)<br><br>As for your alternate setup, I'd be worried that the whole thing can break apart very easily if the vigilante ends up having to claim, and it'd take me hours of staring at it to figure out the balance (which is something that I'm not particularly sure I want to do right now), because of the complexity involving odd/even considerations and trying to work out how quickly the town power roles are likely to die. At a very preliminary guess, I'd guess that it's scumsided unless there's a massclaim, and it's townsided with a partial massclaim in which all roles but protectives claim. (This is a property we don't want more than a small proportion of setups to have; you can prevent people breaking a setup by massclaim simply by relying on the fact that players won't know that the massclaim would help, but if massclaims become useful in enough setups, then people will start doing them D1 as part of site meta. There's theory reasons to want protectives and VTs to claim the same thing if doing a massclaim \"early\", and I've known players to claim \"protective or VT\" for that reason before now.)"}
