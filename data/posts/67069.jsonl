Smart scum notice these things and adapt because the point of the game as scum is to be town read as best as they can. <br>\n<br>\nThat's why some scum like to end Rvs as soon as possible because that's usually considered a town tell and people who prolong it are usually looked at suspicious. <br>\n<br>\nTrying to start an Rvs wagon on somebody is easily the most common way to end Rvs. Now I can't say I've ever used that myself, I have seen scum do it. <br>\n<br>\nPeople always lecture me at \"looking at motives\" and imo those early pushes didn't feel natural to me, they felt forced in an attempt the end Rvs instead of letting it progress naturally.

Most players see actions like being pro-active as a town tell. Smart scum notice these things and adapt because the point of the game as scum is to be town read as best as they can. <br>\n<br>\nThat's why some scum like to end Rvs as soon as possible because that's usually considered a town tell and people who prolong it are usually looked at suspicious. <br>\n<br>\nTrying to start an Rvs wagon on somebody is easily the most common way to end Rvs. Now I can't say I've ever used that myself, I have seen scum do it. <br>\n<br>\nPeople always lecture me at \"looking at motives\" and imo those early pushes didn't feel natural to me, they felt forced in an attempt the end Rvs instead of letting it progress naturally. That's why I don't see those actions as necessary town motivated. I also question people who do because it should be questioned.<br>\n<br>\nNow back to creature. The post he made about not going to vote them for the remainder of the game rubbed me the wrong way. Nobody was accusing him of that and it felt out of place. If he were town I would think he would be more confident in his own opinions and wouldn't be rattled by somebody else's.</div></blockquote>\nOkay I can see where youre coming from, although I disagree on some things regarding whether or not someone can be townread for things (Like the specific way they pushed early can be alignment indicative not necessarily that they pushed)<br>\nOnto creature, though, I think that his post was kind of warranted.  The angle you were taking was that it was \"dangerous\" for creature to be town reading people early which was responded to by creature as it not being a big deal as it wasnt a firm unshakable town read he would have the whole game.<br>\npedit mild suspicion is considered a scum lean which is still a read.

No you didn't ISO everyone that's pretty obvious, you're simply trying to make a reason to not scum read Eggman. Furthermore there are 6 players scum reading him means that clearly a lot of townies are scum reading him, why the fuck is that a reason to cancel your scum read?? <br>\n<br>\nAnswer is it isn't. You don't have any reason to stop scum reading him since we both know your first reason is clearly BS.

But like you said before, he could be manipulating us.  Currently, not judging anything but his ISO, I would have him somewhere between townlean and town.  But I am hesitant to give him that townlean because say Creature flips town and eggman flips town, then out of the options available, i would have him as one of the main people I am watching out for and have him in scumlean.  I think the problem we are having is that while many people read just off people's ISO, I believe that we should consider all the possibilities before we make a decision.

Defend yourself but keep focusing on the game and trying to find scum. I also added in the fact that smitherines seemed to be pushing harder for an egg lynch yet I felt his posts imply that he is more suspect of creature. Creature was my top scum read also and him insisting that we learn more from an egg lynch over his top scum read was fundamentally wrong imo and I didn't feel good about being on that wagon.

When a player comes off of a game where their initial reads are pretty damn accurate, most players don't decide to change and do something else.

Also, his logic-based scumhunting style seems almost too easy--he's very experienced so he should know that town often uses bad logic, perhaps more than scum does.<br>\nSmithereens - null leaning town, for his aggressiveness.

So lets say someone is town right, that means most of the time their actively scum-hunting and trying to win the game for the town. This vibe would be shown early on and you claim its better to show this vibe or to show your VT vibe rather than keep to your self until actual evidence can be used against people, but maybe this is just opinion. But instead of trying to be the person that is tryng to scum-hunt, you denouce your vote on my and hop on the wagon, even though you claimed to vote for me because I voted for you(idk actually why you voted for me).

Even if you aren't lynching that person, the pressure and the threat of it should motivate them to give you more so they don't get lynched. the logical fallacy you just used is called false analogy, just so you know", "time": "Thu Jun 30, 2016 5:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}

A player who is uninformed is likely to stick to a person who they've discovered is scum with a high degree of confidence.

The point is that a townie doesn't play in that fashion, because it involves a detachment of concern from finding scum. Yes, theoretically it is good play. Town don't do this 'good play,' because it actually doesn't reflect a straight forward pursuit of the town win con. It's more how an emotionless robot would play the game, or a scum with no interest in helping the town. Also, this is what I meant by saying you need to be watched.

Not sure if anyone saw it earlier but it's for reasons I didn't really want to go into. At this point I don't really care if I spill the beans. <br>\n<br>\nHe and I are neighbors. Now I personally hate neighbors in games but the one time I played with a neighbor I was scum with 2 townies. I've seen all town neighborhoods before so they are certainly possible. <br>\n<br>\nAlso I don't know if it's just the 2 of us or if there are more. The mod didn't tell us. He basically said we could introduce ourselves. Now he didn't lock the thread during that long pregame and that worried me. I felt whoever else was in the game was probably scum. To go 2 days without even a hello was weird. I made a comment about it and right after the mod made a post that implied to me that the lack of posting wasn't suspicious which resulted in me having a conversation with the mod via pm because I interpreted that as alluding to alignment. He confirmed that he didn't and my concerns were unreasonable. It took a while (working off memory here) after the game started for him to finally post and his excuse wasn't that beliveable to me. <br>\n<br>\nNow his play during the game didn't bother me much so he was on the null spectrum but after the post from the new replacement (petroleum?) he made some valid points that made me move him back to the null or possibly scummy section. I am not sure if I buy his response to petroleum so where it stands he's a slight scum read and since neither of us are confirmed alignment to each other I figure it doesn't hurt anything revealing we have a neighborhood. <br>\n<br>\nI assume it's just us 2. <br>\n<br>\nThat's basically where I'm at with him. <br>\n<br>\nWhat about you?", "time": "Sat Jul 02, 2016 11:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}

I think the meta change is better explained as being newb scum who's either having a hard time faking scum reads, or isn't confident enough in his play to do so. While he'd obviously want to imitate his town game as scum, that's easier said then done especially when you're new. Also, I'm pretty sure someone brought it up before, but crab's reads were pretty accurate in his first game. I don't see much of a reason for someone to start using a new strategy randomly, especially when his old one seemed to have worked perfectly fine.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Dragon, hard to say. I thought his posting early on wasn't the best mostly due to gut. His recent posts seem to have got a lot better though? Honestly at some point before/around when you replaced in, there was suddenly a lot of pages that seemed to me to be filled with a lot of theory.

I think the meta change is better explained as being newb scum who's either having a hard time faking scum reads, or isn't confident enough in his play to do so. While he'd obviously want to imitate his town game as scum, that's easier said then done especially when you're new.

Trying to respond to Robbnva's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8065372#p8065372\" class=\"postlink\">Post #847</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8065407#p8065407\" class=\"postlink\">Post #848</a> feels unwieldy and going line-by-line would likely be confusing. I will just make a few comments.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">a.)</div> Robbnva, you seem to be going out of your way to show how 'helpful' and 'engaged' you are, hence my issue with the wording of some of your posts.  In fact, you made fun of Dwlee99 for \"trying so hard\" to look Town (\"ladhst\") while doing the same yourself.  Your reaction to his serious vote on you was \"I'm not scum but... you're on my watch list.\"   You then were apparently so engaged by page 4 of the game that you had to \"calm down.\"  You were <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">then</div> so engaged and posting-on-the-fly that upon discovering you \"missed\" Creature's case on Smithereens, instead of simply reading it you said that you'll \"read it later.\"  What I don't like here is that you were actively and constantly posting; you could have just and gone back and read it instead of explaining you were going to do it.  I just see \"look how engaged I am!\"<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">b.)</div> I am not defending atm487, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">am</div> attacking the way in which you dealt with atm487.  He is a new player, and your language while speaking to him was rather insulting.  You go so far as to state that he could not be seriously suspicious of you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">now</div> or else he should have mentioned his feelings <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">earlier</div>.  <br>\n<br>\nFirst, that's not how this game works.  People very  much <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can</div> keep opinions to themselves for multiple reasons.  And newer players in particular can be nervous about attacking players (especially vocal / abrasive ones).<br>\n<br>\nSecond, atm487 <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">did</div> mention his suspicion of you (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8035548#p8035548\" class=\"postlink\">Post #100</a>). <br>\n<br>\nThird, while insulting him, you also claimed to have <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8054424#p8054424\" class=\"postlink\">never voted for atm487</a>.  Except you atm487 was your first non-serious vote (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8036220#p8036220\" class=\"postlink\">Post #107</a>), <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> you voted him (without explanation) directly after he expressed suspicion of you.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">c.)</div> Berating somebody for asking for prods is bad; asking for prods is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">good</div>.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">d.)</div> Claiming that you will ignore players is also bad.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">e.)</div> I am unsure of Eggman because I have trouble reading newer players.  I would not consider attempting to crumb a vanilla townie, for example.  And I do not know how I could put myself into a \"newbie mentality\" any more.  While I do not think his play was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">good</div>, I have a hard time deciding if it is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">scummy</div>.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">f.)</div> I can pressure who I want in the order I wish.

I have played with Robbnva once before while he was under a different name, and it was one of the singularly most unpleasant games I have participated in.  I would much rather not interact with him at all, and I would not have offered to replace if I had known.  But I'm here.  Given this backdrop, I actually did take a step back and decide whether I am being influenced by annoyance or suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nHe is trying too hard to make sure we remember how involved he is in the game.  He claims everybody should have an opinion on him but he is dismissive of people whose opinion is suspion (and this contradicts his attempts to say he \"doesn't care\" how he is perceived).  He keeps acting like he has made silver-bullet cases against people (catching them in \"lies\") when at best he has hit on some potential contradictions.<br>\n<br>\nHe has tried to direct investigation targets twice, which is something he should know not to do with his level of experience.  Now he has also outed his Neighborhood, which if Town is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">obviously bad</div>.  If both Robbnva and Dragon of the West are Town, that just gives the scum a much better perspective of what they are dealing with.  The reveal did not even accomplish anything.  So why do it?  It looks to me that it was largely in response to having somebody expressing genuine suspicion of him (i.e., me) and trying to vaguely suggest perhaps we should poke at Dragon of the West instead.<br>\n<br>\nI have not liked his votes, which have been: vote atm498 afer being called a slight scumlean on page 4; putting Eggman at L-1 on page 17 (i.e., never switching his early vote until it puts somebody near death); switching to Creature after a Creature-Eggman team was discussed; putting crazycrabman at L-2 (while requesting an investigation on Creature); voting for Smithereens while arguing over Eggman-Creature connection; and now voting No Lynch to 'make a point.'  He basically held on to his vote early until he could put a player close to being lynched, then switched while connecting that player to another player, then put a third player close to being lynched, and now he's starting to get erratic after those lynches did not go through.  His two latest votes have essentially involved him putting his fingers in his ears (claiming he should \"ignore\" Smithereens, and voting No Lynch because apparently there's something \"wrong\" with us).<br>\n<br>\nPlayers who play \"emotionally\" can still be scum, and you can expect them to act emotional when they are scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.)</div> Infinity 324, can you explain Robbnva's position in your list:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8069343#p8069343\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8069343#p8069343\" data-post-id=\"8069343\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 926</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21297\">Infinity 324</a> wrote:</cite>From scummiest to towniest, it goes something like this:<br>\nDerek, Mario, petroleum, dragon, crab, atm, robb, dwlee, eggman, f-oh-ex, smith, creature</div></blockquote>\n\nRobbnva is one of the few players you have actually expressed and explained your suspicion on.

He's spent almost all of his time voting crazycrab, although he seems to be active. He then seems to push Eggman primarily while the wagon was the most popular- after it fades away his attention on Eggman vanishes and he goes back to crab. He doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab. I can understand this if he has limited time online but it doesn't seem like he is, and even if he is I've found as scum, when I do have limited time, I focus on mostly my push and trying to validate it without pushing any other cases, rather than trying to generalize and find good cases (which is what I would do as town)- I'm not the same person as Derek but I think it's an instinct many would have. This is a somewhat bad scumread but it's lower than null nevertheless.<br>\n<br>\nEggman- \"do you think there are 3 scum in a 13p game\" is bad. I dislike 199, specifically the part where he says \"I wanted to make a post to show that I was reading.\" Town don't really feel like justifying anything, but scum are generally always on the lookout for their own survival- or newer ones are anyhow. In 267 he says he's not aware of how to scumhunt. This is kinda a serious problem and you'd think he'd have figured it out in his three completed games. Sure enough, a quick look at \"Celestial Mafia\" where he is actively trying to scumhunt. He is aware of how to scumhunt. This strangely seems to drop, with Creature coming in with a townread on Eggman with a read that doesn't make sense.<br>\n<br>\ncrazycrab- I can see the scumminess of this slot when I open the ISO but it isn't hard to put into words- I might be seeing something different. crazycrab is commenting on different light reads. Post 173 is especially over the top, with \"feel\" appearing twice, along with its old comrade \"from my experience\". Yet he does make a good point about Eggman- although that isn't hard to fake if Eggman is town. He then follows this up by defending him slightly- this could indicate they are scumbuddies. His #254 is valid, but #173 is still bad. Later on, #515 is bad. If he thought the push was stupid, why didn't he say so instead of just saying that it was probably a SvS and the two most discussed players at the time were his top scumreads, along with those who hadn't posted? <br>\n\"I think the problem we are having is that while many people read just off people's ISO, I believe that we should consider all the possibilities before we make a decision.

He's spent almost all of his time ivoting crazycrab, although he seems to be active. He then seems to push Eggman primarily while the wagon was the most popular- after it fades away his attention on Eggman vanishes and he goes back to crab. He doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab. I can understand this if he has limited time online but it doesn't seem like he is, and even if he is I've found as scum, when I do have limited time, I focus on mostly my push and trying to validate it without pushing any other cases, rather than trying to generalize and find good cases (which is what I would do as town)- I'm not the same person as Derek but I think it's an instinct many would have. This is a somewhat bad scumread but it's lower than null nevertheless.<br>\n<br>\nEggman- \"do you think there are 3 scum in a 13p game\" is bad. I dislike 199, specifically the part where he says \"I wanted to make a post to show that I was reading.\" Town don't really feel like justifying anything, but scum are generally always on the lookout for their own survival- or newer ones are anyhow. In 267 he says he's not aware of how to scumhunt. This is kinda a serious problem and you'd think he'd have figured it out in his three completed games. Sure enough, a quick look at \"Celestial Mafia\" where he is actively trying to scumhunt. He is aware of how to scumhunt. This strangely seems to drop, with Creature coming in with a townread on Eggman with a read that doesn't make sense.<br>\n<br>\ncrazycrab- I can see the scumminess of this slot when I open the ISO but it isn't hard to put into words- I might be seeing something different. crazycrab is commenting on different light reads. Post 173 is especially over the top, with \"feel\" appearing twice, along with its old comrade \"from my experience\". Yet he does make a good point about Eggman- although that isn't hard to fake if Eggman is town. He then follows this up by defending him slightly- this could indicate they are scumbuddies. His #254 is valid, but #173 is still bad. Later on, #515 is bad. If he thought the push was stupid, why didn't he say so instead of just saying that it was probably a SvS and the two most discussed players at the time were his top scumreads, along with those who hadn't posted? <br>\n\"I think the problem we are having is that while many people read just off people's ISO, I believe that we should consider all the possibilities before we make a decision. I don't know if this is a good strategy because I have only tested it on one game, but it is what seems most fair to me.\"- this means that he has tested this strategy he is apparently using before. He makes the next few posts about his strategy; a musing by Fohex on crab's Dwlee read turns into a criticism on his strategy, and then says that he was \"testing\" a strategy in this game? 1)- you said you'd tested it before? and 2)- what's all this talk about strategy about? This game is a scumhunting game, and just because people thought your explanations weren't good enough doesn't mean you should hide your reasoning so that you can keep reads that are unsatisfying to other people? <br>\nY'know, this makes me think- what is he planning to do this game if not explaining his reads?

After this is when I took my vote off as a precautionary measure. If you would actually read through the game rather than quote the little sections that are convenient for your argument you would have realized this. Also if you read on in the game, atm DOES end up derphammering(which turns out to be a scum hammer) and even says he'd take his vote off Tojam because he didn't realize a hammer vote is final, so my fear was somewhat justified.

I just don't have time to organize my thoughts or my post right now very clearly.<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nFrom MarioManiac4's catch-up posts:<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">a.)</div> In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8073811#p8073811\" class=\"postlink\">Post #1002</a> I do not agree with his summarization of Derek12's play.  MarioManiac4 paints Derek12 as spending all of his time pursuing crazycrabman (\"he doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab\"), while Derek12 has very clearly been poking at other players and asking them questions.  He also states that Derek12 seemed to push the Eggman wagon at it's peak, and that does not appear to be true at all.<br>\n<br>\nI agree that Eggman seemed much more involved and proactive in Celestia Mafia at a glance (and see below).<br>\n<br>\nAnd I do agree that crazycrabman claiming to have a \"strategy\" is concerning in itself (since by and large, only scum really think about \"strategies\" to get through the Day).  But I think this comes down to the use of the word \"strategy\"; I think \"playstyle\" is more accurate for what crazycrabman is describing.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">b.)</div> I also don't understand why Smithereens was included (and then not analyzed) by MarioManiac4.

Oh, only other acceptable time for VT to claim: in \"roleclaim or die\", or LYLO.</div></blockquote>\n\nFrom the looks of it, Eggman was eventually run up Day One, claimed Townie, and eventually hammered himself in order to help Town achieve a lynch.  On the one hand, given the above quotes, I am less inclined to think Eggman is scum in this game.  But on the other hand, Eggman really <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> much more proactive and helpful in that game than this one.  Eggman, could you please elaborate on your thoughts of claiming Vanilla Townie on Day One?  And if you do not think it is acceptable to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">claim</div> Townie on Day One, why do you think it is acceptable to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">crumb</div> Townie on Day One?<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, Creature, I noticed you were scum in that game, so I trust you are more familiar with Eggman's play.

I don't know about you guys, but as a mafioso I would never claim VT.</div></blockquote>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nor as a townie, either. The only times I will claim VT are when I'm about to get lynched and in LYLO. Which is exactly what I say in this next quote.</div>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Eggman, Newbie #1703, Post #548 wrote:</cite>I am a Vanilla Townie. Oh, only other acceptable time for VT to claim: in \"roleclaim or die\", or LYLO.</div></blockquote>\n\nFrom the looks of it, Eggman was eventually run up Day One, claimed Townie, and eventually hammered himself in order to help Town achieve a lynch. On the one hand, given the above quotes, I am less inclined to think Eggman is scum in this game.  But on the other hand, Eggman really <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> much more proactive and helpful in that game than this one.  Eggman, could you please elaborate on your thoughts of claiming Vanilla Townie on Day One?  And if you do not think it is acceptable to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">claim</div> Townie on Day One, why do you think it is acceptable to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">crumb</div> Townie on Day One?</div></blockquote>\nMy philosophy on when to claim VT hasn't changed: however, if I saw a VT claim coming from someone who was about to be lynched, my first thought about them would be \"lying mafioso\" instead of \"actually a VT\". So, like I've said before, I wanted to back up the claim with something to avoid the D1 mislynch I had predicted.<br>\nEvidently, it worked. So I'm happy about that, but I probably won't try crumbing in the future.", "time": "Thu Jul 07, 2016 1:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}

MarioManiac4 paints Derek12 as spending all of his time pursuing crazycrabman (\"he doesn't seem to be posting about anyone but crab\"), while Derek12 has very clearly been poking at other players and asking them questions.  He also states that Derek12 seemed to push the Eggman wagon at it's peak, and that does not appear to be true at all.<br>\n<br>\nI agree that Eggman seemed much more involved and proactive in Celestia Mafia at a glance (and see below).<br>\n<br>\nAnd I do agree that crazycrabman claiming to have a \"strategy\" is concerning in itself (since by and large, only scum really think about \"strategies\" to get through the Day).  But I think this comes down to the use of the word \"strategy\"; I think \"playstyle\" is more accurate for what crazycrabman is describing.<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">b.)</div> I also don't understand why Smithereens was included (and then not analyzed) by MarioManiac4.

Oh, only other acceptable time for VT to claim: in \"roleclaim or die\", or LYLO.</div></blockquote>\n\nFrom the looks of it, Eggman was eventually run up Day One, claimed Townie, and eventually hammered himself in order to help Town achieve a lynch.  On the one hand, given the above quotes, I am less inclined to think Eggman is scum in this game.  But on the other hand, Eggman really <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> much more proactive and helpful in that game than this one.  Eggman, could you please elaborate on your thoughts of claiming Vanilla Townie on Day One?  And if you do not think it is acceptable to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">claim</div> Townie on Day One, why do you think it is acceptable to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">crumb</div> Townie on Day One?<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, Creature, I noticed you were scum in that game, so I trust you are more familiar with Eggman's play.

MYLO means \"mislynch and lose.\"  This is different from LYLO (\"lynch or lose\") in that MYLO does not <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">require</div> a correct lynch; No-Lynching may theoretically be the best option.  There are some issues with your statement:<br>\n<br>\nFirst, in the situation where there is a Serial Killer, you are assuming the opposing scumgroup is three people.  It is very possible it is two people.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, you are assuming in the case of a mislynch today that there will be two town deaths, as opposed to potential crosskills, prevented kills, or a double-kill.<br>\n<br>\nThird, you started Day Two with a vote for atm487, but then chastised F-oh-ex for placing the first vote on you because we are \"literally in MYLO.\"  There are all sorts of issues with this:<br>\n<br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">a.)</div> It takes six votes to reach a majority today.  Why are you so concerned about a single vote on yourself?  Even if we were in LYLO (which to be clear is much worse than MYLO), we would still be safe having two votes on a single player since even a scumgroup of three players could not force through a lynch.  <br>\n-&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">b.)</div> If you're so concerned with single votes, I would think you would not also start off the day with a vote (especially before you are done 'gamesolving').

Now that he's replaced out, I'm going to keep that impression until DGB posts more content. I haven't seen much of substance since the replacement.<br>\nTo answer your question about the neighborhood, it's because robb seemed disinterested in discussing anything with me after that first conversation. Also, I didn't feel comfortable with it just being robb and I. I was seriously concerned about a possible scum lurker hiding in the neighborhood getting info about our reads and using that to their advantage.

Stop pretending like I don't have any actual reasons. You overexplained yourself by stating thing that weren't necessary to respond to the point petroleum was trying to make, and you gave a explanation for the unvote of eggman that doesn't look genuine. You seriously didn't consider eggman's crumb as coming from town until creature and I pointed it out? Just sounds like a reason to jump off the eggman wagon as it died down. After that, you made a huge deal about me calling your post scummy and made assumptions about why I did that, which reads as scum desperate to defend themselves.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Mon Jul 18, 2016 3:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=1475", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}

That is incredibly unlikely.  Instead, we need to bank on the natural balance of the game, which in effect relies on scum nightkilling each other.  A single crosskill is as good as a correct lynch; and a correct lynch followed by a crosskill is even better.  The best part is (for us), is that is also to the scum's advantage to attempt to crosskill.  Having three factions in a game has a way of oddly 'balancing' because each faction has to keep the other factions in check.  Having more nightkills definitely takes things out of our hands to an extent, but it actually increases our chances of winning on the whole.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.)</div> <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8171310#p8171310\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8171310#p8171310\" data-post-id=\"8171310\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1695</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27871\">F-oh-ex</a> wrote:</cite>I don't see how \"setting up lynches\" is as horrible as you make it out to be.</div></blockquote>\nSetting up lynches is quite bad when there is not information to support it.

Also, why did we keep on the daytalk \"scumslip\" - I admit I skimmed around that part, but it just seems now that Titus was trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, since daytalk is in the OP.<br>\n<br>\nDGB is very erratic. But she's maintained a scumread on NJAC / MM4 since she replaced in, up until NJAC made a post calling out \"boring\"posts. I don't like that sudden read swap very much, as I'd expect someone's scumreads to stay consistent. Feels to me like a flimsy way to get off NJAC's wagon while keeping her current meta of erratic posting.

That means we have another Vig (very improbable), SK or it's a multiball setup. It's my first game outside Newbie Games here so I'm not sure what makes more sense, multiball or a Serial Killer. Since no one has mentioned multiball so far, I'm going to go with a Serial Killer.<br>\n<br>\nI'll repeat myself - from what I read on wiki, SKs are often Bulletproof/X-shot Bulletproof. That could explain the missing kills. Another explanation will be that 2 people targetted the same person but it would have to happen twice in a row.<br>\n<br>\nNow, tactical question: Assuming it's 4v2v1 (I think the general consensus was that we started with 9v3v1), do we want to lynch Mafia or SK?<br>\n<br>\n1. If we lynch Mafia, we go to 4v1v1 at Night. At this point, the most likely outcomes are 3v1 (which is great, given our current situation) or 2v1v1 (which would be horrible as the game is out of our hands).<br>\n2. If we lynch SK, we go to 4v2 at Night. Unless we have some kill stopping role, we go to 3v2. And even if we do, we can't count on stopping the kill. This puts at LyLo twice in a row.<br>\n<br>\nAt first glance it seems that lynching Mafia is a high risk high reward scenario but how the game goes depends largely on nightkills. Lynching SK puts us in double LyLo but we know we won't autolose at Night.", "time": "Thu Aug 11, 2016 12:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=1850", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}

Is it just slow during Summer? Decline of players (and interest) on the site in general? The frustrating thing is that I'm sure this woudn't have happened if my game started closer to when I signed up as a mod. That was fucking February. I also noticed I had a bunch of newbies in my player list. It worried me a little, but I didn't want to judge, so I went ahead. We know how that turned out. Props to Fox for being an exception to this.<br>\n<br>\nIt's also frustrating, because it actually had the same number of replacements as my first game, however, despite that, my first game actually turned out ok I thought. Anyway, thanks to all players who stuck it out til the end (or their end at least). I hope at least some of you had a modicum of fun.<br>\n<br>\nAlso once again my apologies to Robb, Smithereens had to replace out soon after the day start, because he was moving out. He inititally didn't want to use his ability, but I found that strange, I mean, why waste an opportunity to use it, so I casually and openly wondered how his replacement would feel about a potentially wasted shot, though I didn't explicitly wanted to suggest he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">should</div> use it. But it was enough to change his mind, and he shot Robb, someone who was townread by most I believe. That said, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">suspect</div> him shooting Robb had nothing to do with him suspecting him of being mafia, but he's free to comment on that himself if he wants.<br>\n<br>\nRobb also complained about the fact I didn't explicitly state who his neighbours were. I believe it's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">common</div> to do so, but it's not standardized, I've asked about that during review. With it not being standardized, I was left to make my own decision on that, so I decided the option which suited me best: to not state who the neighbours were. This was both out of principle and because of set-up design. When a player rolls a neighbour role, but is not comfortable with using that ability, I feel that player should have the choice of not using it, but that's impossible when your neighbour already knows your role.

Fox had a chance to absorb the role cop neighbour role, granting him access to the neighbourhoos secretly. I didn't want to force him to communicate with the other neighbour, so it was a conscious decision not to list the active neighbours.<br>\n<br>\nI also found it a bit strange he just blurted out him and Dragon being neighbours back then.

Just like the mafia thread. I've done this with all my previous games, and it never was a problem since confirmations never lasted that long before. I now see it's not <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">ideal</div> and I'll probably leave them closed in future games. That said, it obviously doesn't reveal alignments in any way whatsoever, Robbs problem is that he assumes too much, and I can't help he's reading too much into things. Dragon had not posted yet during confirmations, and that worried Robb. Now, if you go back to page 1, you can actually see Dragon neglected to properly confirm (and on a sidenote, I'm probably going to require 100% confirmations for future games). I was inclined to not interfere, but I thought <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">maybe</div>, Dragon isn't aware he's a neighbour (he only confirmed the role cop part), and I thought I'd be doing the game a disservice if I didn't at least remind him of that. Personally I thought it would be hilarious if he continued not being aware of his role, but for the greater good I sent him a PM anyway. Turns out, Dragon was aware, but simply forgot to post. He did so soon after, mentioning he simply forgot. Well this was all suspicious to Robb. Yeah sure, he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could've</div> been a scum who didn't want to post in the neighbourhood thread.. Or he could've been a townie who simply forgot to post there. I'm not responsible for Robb's suspicions.", "time": "Mon Aug 22, 2016 12:06 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=2000", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}

It was a joke suggestion, and it wouldn't have served any other purpose than being an example role PM, and showing players what a role PM of a non-vanilla would look like (as an alternative to the 1-shot mafia cop used in the OP currently). That said, if I recall correctly, what I had in mind was a mafia fruit vendor who would kill someone upon death (by lynching). If you've been rereading the review: this is exactly why I wanted to add slashes in role names. And that said, I love to include unexpected joke roles which still serve some purpose.

That review took an exceptionally long time even allowing for the reviewer flakes, though.<br>\n<br>\n(Part of it is that if the setup is simple I can often determine it to be balanced within 24 hours, but something like this takes a lot longer. It means that the reviewers have a tendency to repeatedly put it off. It also means that I can be far from confident that the setup is balanced even when the review is finished. I don't begrudge that &#8211; it wouldn't do to have all the Mini Normals look the same &#8211; but it's something that can hold things up for a while.)<br>\n<br>\nAs for your alternate setup, I'd be worried that the whole thing can break apart very easily if the vigilante ends up having to claim, and it'd take me hours of staring at it to figure out the balance (which is something that I'm not particularly sure I want to do right now), because of the complexity involving odd/even considerations and trying to work out how quickly the town power roles are likely to die. At a very preliminary guess, I'd guess that it's scumsided unless there's a massclaim, and it's townsided with a partial massclaim in which all roles but protectives claim. (This is a property we don't want more than a small proportion of setups to have; you can prevent people breaking a setup by massclaim simply by relying on the fact that players won't know that the massclaim would help, but if massclaims become useful in enough setups, then people will start doing them D1 as part of site meta. There's theory reasons to want protectives and VTs to claim the same thing if doing a massclaim \"early\", and I've known players to claim \"protective or VT\" for that reason before now.)", "time": "Mon Aug 22, 2016 8:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67069&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "67069"}
