Even without a given reason, a vote can be used to pressure someone.  In fact, that's the entire basis of the random stage:  vote without real reasons to pressure and gauge reactions.

Basically, it sounds to me like your reasoning is explaining why it was scummy that I voted without a reason, not why I'm scummy independent of that.  Based on your casting of a vote after I explained why a reasonless vote is better than no vote, you seem to agree that a vote without reason isn't actually that bad.

The latter is suspicious and if you're claiming it's not, then you're not being objective about it. <br>\n<br>\nWhat I find a little strange is that you seem to blame your lack of attention here to being busy in your other two games that were near lylo, but then you tack on that you hadn't bookmarked this game. You then return to the 2 other games excuse with pappums rat in post 86. What I'm bothered by is not that either of these aren't reasonable excuses (they are), but I would think bookmarking the game would actually be the bigger issue. How is being busy in your other two games even relevant when you had forgotten about this game altogether? I find that strange and a bit like you're overcompensating in your excuses.

So you're saying you'll take any lynch, town or scum, to save your ass. Which you follow up by saying you're only voting people that are acting scummy. My point is that you're doing the former only, and no, I don't think that's a protown action. When you're town, your only goal is to lynch scum, not take whatever lynch is available to save your skin. Yes, your mislynch if you're town is bad, but it's no worse that mislynching someone else. When you're town and being wagoned wrongfully, you explain why your wagon is wrong and who you think is ACTUAL scum.

His point was a starting block, sure, but unlike your sheeping I'm actually doing some work by myself. In terms of verification, it was unnecessary at that immediate juncture. I did check later, but if Gud was scum and silly enough to lie about something like that it wouldn't take long to out him.

It was after my pointing this out that lots of other people came in and criticized his vote, yourself included.

While it's true that scum would like to hide behind \"but we caught him lying, so we had to vote him,\" townies could also use this reason to vote someone while scum just sit by and watch.

There's some protown fluff. He says that there is a \"major inconsistency\" in the RossWilliam's, I saw dizzle online argument, but never says what that inconsistency is.

I also don't like the mutual unvote between Rob and Mute.<br>\n<br>\npappums rat: I don't like how he got on to the Mute wagon at the start of the game.

In fact, I was actively questioning VP about this suggestion. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> You are confused. I am not saying this. I am saying YOU are using \"the suggestion of scum responsibility\" to protect Jerbs. Clear?</div></div></blockquote>\n\nFinally, I said to be suspicious of Rob/Zdenek if I died last night.

This is an incredibly convenient change of heart over a wagon that he was pushing. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">agar flipped town. this can lead one to come to these sorts of conclusions based upon interactions with other players. its not like he started pushing jerbs harder. agar was gone, so there was only one viable lynch at the time.</div><br>\n<br>\nSecondly, I never said that scum were responsible for the daykill, and when I called Llama out on this, he ignored me, and continued to try to line up my lynch for today. If he didn't read my post, he's scummy for not trying to figure out players alignments and if he read it but ignored it, he's scummy for not being honest about the arguments he's using. <br>\n<br>\nFinally he makes it clear that he wants Jerbs to claim, asking him to in two posts in a row, I see this as possibly in game communication between scum buddies. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">or he wanted jerbs to claim? what kind of communication could go on between them from jerbs claiming?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote LlamaGod</div></div></blockquote>", "time": "Mon Jan 17, 2011 5:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15934&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "15934"}

He was only a primary lynch candidate after Agar was killed. Moreover there wasn't much to comment on. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Three was the second most. Agar only had one vote at the time of your post, so Jerbs was most certainly a primary lynch candidate with a growing wagon. I had also just called for a Pappums/Agar/Jerbs lynch and requested comments on the 3. Jerbs had also made some pretty scumjuicy posts and several players had made cases on him. </div><br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>LG wrote:</cite>\nAll he says during the Jerbs wagon-&gt;lynch is essentially that \"if the scum made the daykill then Jerbs is probably town.\"\n</div></blockquote>\nI was asking VP about his reasoning about the Agar kill, which I found completely bizarre, and that statement is taken out of context. Note I never suggested that scum made the day-kill. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> You did not suggest scum made the daykill, but you did essentially make the statement \"If you think scum made the daykill then you should think Jerbs is town.\" You did not give your own opinion on whether Jerbs was scum or on his claim other than to say you found him unremarkable </div>.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as the discussion about my first post is concerned. I said that I am going with null on the incident <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">in general</div>, meaning that independent of the details, I don't think such and incident says anything about the player's alignments; however, I think some of the particular details are important though. I was concerned about Ross because of his lack of interaction with Agar, who was pushing for his lynch. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Oh really? Then why didn't you mention this \"lack of interaction\" then? Saying players of either alignment could be voting Ross and that Ross may or may not have been sincere isn't useful if you're going to go into specifics later.</div></div></blockquote>\n\nI am concerned about RW.

It's a good way to look like you're scumhunting while lurking.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, Rob has plenty to say about the Jerbs wagon, about Agar, about Drizzle/Zdenek.   He mentions other people.
