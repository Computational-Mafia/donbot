Yeah, actually I did think you were trying to get people to give good reasons why they were town, which would of started discussion just fine. But you didn't do that.

Even without a given reason, a vote can be used to pressure someone.  In fact, that's the entire basis of the random stage:  vote without real reasons to pressure and gauge reactions.

Basically, it sounds to me like your reasoning is explaining why it was scummy that I voted without a reason, not why I'm scummy independent of that.  Based on your casting of a vote after I explained why a reasonless vote is better than no vote, you seem to agree that a vote without reason isn't actually that bad.  If you think I'm scummy for my vote, explain what exactly about my vote makes it scummy.<br><br>I also find it strange that you seemed to be implying (or outright stating, perhaps) in your last couple of posts that you didn't have strong reads, yet you feel the need to defend Tasky in your most recent post.

A gut feeling that someone seems nervous is impossible to argue logically with. There is no way anyone can say to you \"Sorry VV, your gut is wrong.\" I feel like if you truly believe Tasky is scum, you could have found something more. He's already done alot more in this game than make posts with 2 exclamation points, but thats your only draw on him? If you are town, than your grasping at straws, and if your scum, you've placed a vote that can't be challenged. No one is going to argue against gut.

Out of that whole thing, I just got that they were really talking past each other and didn't care about the other's alignment so much as being right. Meh to that whole mess. <br><br>Not sure if I believe Rob's story, but I hope he is telling the truth. In terms of:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>VP - you realize I could have showed up tomorrow and you could easily say the same thing to me, doesn;t mean it is any true now than it would be tomorrow. I had just got home and was looking over my threads, I wasn't even going to post before I did all my stuff but I had a few minutes. and 2ndly would it have really been better for me to not say anything at all? When I am able to be on a computer and can get on MS I am going to play the game, you can look at my history, I do like to post alot when I am able to.</div></blockquote><br>Well, no, that's not true at all actually. It wouldn't have been the same thing if you were too busy to post and couldn't make it until the next day. At least that looks like you're actually busy and not actively avoiding the thread. From my perspective, you got called out and then *poof* magically appeared to defend your lurking. The latter is suspicious and if you're claiming it's not, then you're not being objective about it. <br><br>What I find a little strange is that you seem to blame your lack of attention here to being busy in your other two games that were near lylo, but then you tack on that you hadn't bookmarked this game. You then return to the 2 other games excuse with pappums rat in post 86. What I'm bothered by is not that either of these aren't reasonable excuses (they are), but I would think bookmarking the game would actually be the bigger issue. How is being busy in your other two games even relevant when you had forgotten about this game altogether? I find that strange and a bit like you're overcompensating in your excuses. Even though you didn't bookmark this game, were you checking it still?<br><br>@ Ross - join date aside, how much mafia have you played and do you have an alt?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>LlamaGod wrote:</cite>The Mute wagon shrank really fast. I think it had scum relieved to get RVS votes off a buddy.</div></blockquote><br>On what basis is scum and why do you think Mute's buddies (both of them, really?) would RV him?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Guderian wrote:</cite>Notice who just switched votes. Notice who this comment is directed at. Notice who my vote is on.<br><br>Correct, You have correctly deduced I want Dizzle lynched.</div></blockquote><br>heh, you're my favorite for this game so far. <br><br>Mute looks like poo that isn't paying attention to anything people are saying. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>It definitely seemed like you were trying to allow mafia to come in with a quick hammer and your reason is horrible</div></blockquote><br>^Imma buss my buddy. <br><br>Rob + Mute + ???? = Scum Forever<br><br>That being said:<br><blockquote><div><cite>VV wrote:</cite>I'm not really a fan of the Mute wagon here. I've been getting the feeling that his suspicions are genuine, even if it's just a gut feeling. </div></blockquote><br>What? You don't get why people are voting for someone that hurriedly pushed someone to L-1 for incomprehensible reasons and then OMGUSed someone else for something that isn't even true? I'm not really a fan of your Mute defense here, even if it's just a gut feeling. Maybe Rob is town that just plays terribly....<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mute wrote:</cite>I do not like how Guder is being so inconsistent. So, my voting for him stays.</div></blockquote><br>ARE YOU READING THIS GAME? *ahem*<br><br>The fact that Mute has posted twice now and not moved his vote is scummy. I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that you were skimming, but now you're intentionally not understanding. Here's a big hint: you're wrong. <br><br>Jerbs needs to comment on things that are actually happening recently. Things like Mute and Rob Capone come to mind. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>so if you were being voted, you would just give up and be lynched?</div></blockquote><br>Considering I said nothing of the sort, no. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>You imply that I am scum and I want to take whatever lynch is available, however would somebody who is town not do the same thing? I am town and I don't want to be lynched so I am voting for the people who are actually doing things that are scummy.</div></blockquote><br>Whole lot dissonance up in here. So you're saying you'll take any lynch, town or scum, to save your ass. Which you follow up by saying you're only voting people that are acting scummy. My point is that you're doing the former only, and no, I don't think that's a protown action. When you're town, your only goal is to lynch scum, not take whatever lynch is available to save your skin. Yes, your mislynch if you're town is bad, but it's no worse that mislynching someone else. When you're town and being wagoned wrongfully, you explain why your wagon is wrong and who you think is ACTUAL scum. So which is it, are you hunting scum here or trying not to get lynched?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>Agar's vote was scummy<br>Mute putting somebody at L-1 is scummy</div></blockquote><br>I don't really disagree, but then again you are just sheeping people to save yourself, right? I've yet to really see an original point from you that I thought was even halfway useful for finding scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>What I do notice that both times mute's wagon gets a decent size you come in and divert attention, I won't draw any conclusions from that just yet but if mute does flip scum, I'll be sure to bring it back up.</div></blockquote><br>wtf are you talking about?  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>you don't like the way I play? fair enough but come at me with something more tangible than a gut feeling or because I wasn't into this game as much as others I have been playing for a couple of weeks, those are really weak reasons for a bandwagon.</div></blockquote><br>I never said anything about gut. The second reason is very valid. You downplaying it doesn't change that fact. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>My votes outside of RVS come with real reasons, you don't like them? tell me why they are wrong.</div></blockquote><br>You sheep people to save your skin. That's notsogood. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>Tell me why Agar coming back from V/LA and jumps on the biggest bandwagon without really looking like she caught up is not scummy</div></blockquote><br>Hint: I pointed this out first. Pay attention.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rob wrote:</cite>Tell me why mute putting somebody at L-1 without annoucing they are at L-1 is not scummy? I can tell you I can't recall a single game I have been in when the person putting a person at L-1 hasn't annouced it, so I don't know if it is a scum tell or not but not saying they are at L-1 does make for an accidental (or purposeful but claim to be accidental) hammer happen.<br><br>If Mute would have apologized and said she didn't realize I would not have had such an issue with it, but she didn't apologize for it.</div></blockquote><br>Also, not your reasoning. ALSO, I never said I didn't think it was scummy. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gud wrote:</cite>I think the fact that the rosswilliam wagon has gone from 0--------&gt; 6 ----------&gt; 2 votes goes a long way in confirming the fact he is town. The lucidity of that wagon was astounding.</div></blockquote><br>Possibly. My gut agrees, but you never know."}

His point was a starting block, sure, but unlike your sheeping I'm actually doing some work by myself. In terms of verification, it was unnecessary at that immediate juncture. I did check later, but if Gud was scum and silly enough to lie about something like that it wouldn't take long to out him. Therefore, I had no imperative to track it down before my vote because in reality all I wanted to do was pressure you there and see how you squirmed. <br><br>re: the AGar vote -  My post highlights how self-evidently nonsensical his vote was. It was after my pointing this out that lots of other people came in and criticized his vote, yourself included. I dont' think your accusation of it being opportunistic is entirely the same in that I never used those words, but I was pretty clearly saying that the vote was crap and poorly justified.

I agree that it is unlikely that someone would lie about seeing another person online, so I am going to say that either he made a mistake or is telling the truth. I think neither of these options tells us anything about his alignment. While it's true that scum would like to hide behind \"but we caught him lying, so we had to vote him,\" townies could also use this reason to vote someone while scum just sit by and watch. Anyway, I'm going with null on the incident in general.<br><br>If there is anything else anyone wouldd like me to comment on, please ask.<br><br>Here are some people who caught my eye.<br><br>Agar: puts Mute at L-2 for quoting an IC, and in this post there is a bit of spaghetti flinging (accusing Mute of pseudo IC'ing and a scumbag freaking out, I think that since Mute is fairly new, his \"mute is over reacting because he is aware of the sincerity of the pressure on him\" argument is unreasonable). There's some protown fluff. He says that there is a \"major inconsistency\" in the RossWilliam's, I saw dizzle online argument, but never says what that inconsistency is. I think this is him using an incredibly exaggerated argument to cast doubt on Ross's argument.<br><br>Ellibereth: I don't like the no vote at the start of the game. I see it as avoiding conflict. He presents a false dilemma and points it out. He also posts a lot of fluff.<br><br>I think Mute's been pretty scummy because of the no lynch vote at the start of the game, unvoting under pressure, pro-town banter, the L-1 vote. I also don't like the mutual unvote between Rob and Mute.<br><br>pappums rat: I don't like how he got on to the Mute wagon at the start of the game. I can't see how he couldn't have considered getting on the wagon, so the way he chose not to and then changed his mind at the request of Tasky feels unnatural. I don't like the unvote of Mute when rain enters the game. <br><br>RobCapone: He's been guilty of \"showing up when his name is called,\" he's made some pro-town banter. However, his attacks on Agar and Ellibereth show active scum hunting.<br><br>RossWilliam: Fluff posting at the start of the game and what felt like playing dumb. I think the fact that he unvoted Dizzle makes his attack on Dizzle seem insincere.<br><br>At the moment, I don't think Ellibereth, Pappums Rat or Rob is scummy enough to be lynched, but I wouldn't object to lynching mute. I'd be surprised if there wasn't one scum in RossWilliams and Agar, and I think Agar is scummier.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Agar</span>"}

This is what I mean when I say Agar looks like a counterwagon; I created a situation where it was extremely likely one of two players would be lynched, one of whom was scum. This heavily incentivized the Jerbsbuddies to get on the other wagon. This is a primary reason I find it extremely likely one or both of Rob/Zdenek is scum.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zachrulez wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">11th vote count of day 1:</span><br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">AGar - 4 (VP Baltar, Zdenek, Jerbs, Robcapone)<br>Jerbs - 3 (Tasky, Rain, Llamagod)<br>Zdenek - 2 (Guderian, Ellibereth)<br>Rosswilliam - 2 (AGar, Pappums rat)<br>Pappums rat - 1 (Vigilante Ventrioquist)<br><br>Not voting: 1 (Rosswilliam)<br><br>With 13 alive it's 7 to lynch<br><br></span></span></div></blockquote><br><br><br>Zdenek's case against me appears to be that I did pro town stuff I do whenever the situation calls for it, noticed the situation above, and said the following (Now presented for your viewing pleasure With More Context!!)<br><blockquote><div><cite>LlamaGod wrote:</cite>Starting to feel a Jerbs/Agar/?? scumteam. <br>Explanation:<br>The following looks like lining up an RW mislynch for after a Dizzle mislynch.<br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite>Another note - I'm not liking the whole RW \"I saw Dizzle online!\" thing right now. It feels like there's a major inconsistency here, and it's pushing me towards a scummier read on RossWilliams, more solidified if Dizzle is to flip town.</div></blockquote><br></div></blockquote><br>I thought Agar was more likely to be scum because he was trying to say one player's town flip would make another scummier, which is an ideal way for scum to line up two mislynches.<br><br>I also read that post you made, and I'll quote it here for you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>VP Baltar wrote:</cite>If the scum had an ability to kill the leading wagon and thought it would end the day.</div></blockquote><br>Under the assumption that this was a scum killing, which I think is unlikely in the first place, I think it is much more likely that scum killed Agar to ensure a Jerbs' lynch (since he was the competing wagon at the time), than the scum didn't understand their role and killed Agar to try to save Jerbs. <span class=\"noboldsig\"> So you say if scum were responsible for Agar's killing then Jerbs is probably not scum. Therefore you are using VP's reasoning to protect Jerbs, which is what I said.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>LlamaGod wrote:</cite>Zdenek is looking rather obviously like Jerbsbuddy #1.<br>He didn't mention Jerbs when catching up despite Jerbs being more important than most topics.<br>He was on Agar's wagon, which looked like a counterwagon to protect Jerbs.<br>Now he and Jerbs are both trying to use the pretty much ridiculous suggestion that scum were responsible for the daykill to protect Jerbs.<br></div></blockquote><br>I didn't mention everything in my catchup post. In my read through, I didn't find too much remarkable about Jerbs. I have in my notes that he made a useless post and a post that seemed too logical.<br><br>I have never suggested that scum used the day-kill to protect Jerbs. In fact, I was actively questioning VP about this suggestion. <span class=\"noboldsig\"> You are confused. I am not saying this. I am saying YOU are using \"the suggestion of scum responsibility\" to protect Jerbs. Clear?</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Finally, I said to be suspicious of Rob/Zdenek if I died last night. I suppose it's planning future lynches, but it's because I think Jerbscum makes Zdenek or Rob very likely to be scum and I wanted to make sure people knew my insights in case I died. That was my motivation.<br><br>Lots of reading to do given the two flips before I update scumreads. Expect that tomorrow or Tuesday."}

It is \"basically the same thing\" is basically my point. LlamaGod was trying to act townish by letting everyone know what the vote count was at, and he did it twice in a row. This is an easy thing to do and it is non-confrontational. Not every pro-town thing has these qualities, so these two things are not basically the same. I think that \"trying to act townie\" is a fairly reasonable scum tell, and I think that it is unreasonable to suggest that any two ways of acting townie are basically the same.<br><br>2. Here is my point:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Bussing a scum buddy, while pushing a townie lynch is a common scum tactic.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>3. Go back and read LlamaGod's post, and show me where he qualified his prediction. Hint: he didn't. This is hardly the main point.<br><br>4. I disagree. I think statements like:<br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums wrote:</cite>agar flipped town. this can lead one to come to these sorts of conclusions based upon interactions with other players.<br></div></blockquote><br>is fluff because you are stating something that is obviously true."}

While it's true that scum would like to hide behind \"but we caught him lying, so we had to vote him,\" townies could also use this reason to vote someone while scum just sit by and watch.

There's some protown fluff. He says that there is a \"major inconsistency\" in the RossWilliam's, I saw dizzle online argument, but never says what that inconsistency is.

Zdenek's attack on you I thought was misplaced, but I didn't read it as being inherently scum-driven, I just thought he'd tried to apply a tell (that scum copy the stances of other scum) and had failed to read his evidence through properly before he made the case.

I certainly don't post idle thoughts on topics where my reads haven't developed much yet. If you don't like the way I approach the game, there's not a lot I can do about that; I play at my own pace and I comment on things that I think are relevant to finding scum. I joined the game and my overwhelming impressions were that everyone wanted to lynch Zdenek, and that I didn't really understand why Tasky and Rob were voting for him. I asked Tasky and Rob some questions to try to establish their position. If it helps you to understand, I've played with Tasky before as town and he was making cases all over the place, not posting one-liners, so his play seems very different. As for my time for the game, it varies depending on the rest of my schedule. Tonight I'm at home and I have some spare time, hence I read back and decided I found Rob was scummier than Tasky in the light of Zdenek's flip."}

He's actually said very little on the slot. <br><br>My thinking on that list VV put together is that he didn't really know what to make of Zdenek. He didn't particularly agree with what he was saying, but he didn't find anything that scummy in his posts either, so he came up with an incredibly wishy-washy stance on him. I can't really say why VV was so non-committal about the slot all the way through the game, but I can only guess that he was having a hard time getting a definitive read. I know I was pretty undecided on Zdenek during the brief time I was in the game with him. <br><br>It's better for the town that I end today alive because I'm getting into the game, I've got a decent grip on it now, I'm going to provide my own insights and opinions that will help town find the remaining scum and, quite frankly, there are better candidates for lynch who are more likely to be Jerbs/Zdenek's buddy."}

One of his responses to the cop claim is also wishy-washy to the point of being scummy:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>well in the games I have played on this site I think I have seem cop claimed day 1 and once was scum and once was really cop, neither got lynched day 1 but both of them played like they should have been a cop.<br><br>typically I am not a fan of lynching a power role day 1, but we already are down a person and it isn't even the end of day 1.<br><br>It comes down to do you believe the claim or not and I can't tell that until we hear from him</div></blockquote><br><br>During this situation, I feel like he's trying to refrain from making a firm decision for as long as possible in the hope that Jerbs is going to dig himself out of trouble by fleshing out his claim. To add to these, neither Jerbs nor Dizzle/Zdenek makes any kind of attack on Rob that would make me think he isn't scum; in fact, Jerbs' lame FOS on Rob when he tries to encourage him to post just reinforces my read.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote; Vote: RobCapone</span><br><br>With Tasky, it's more the case that there is so little to analyse and so few links to be drawn. He votes for Jerbs early enough that it's hard to tell much about his alignment from it. His Zdenek vote is backed up about as much as the rest of his votes and after Zdenek has already garnered 3 votes to become the leading wagon, so it's hard to say whether that is a likely bus. I'll expound on my thoughts on the hammer more once Tasky tells us whether it was deliberately fake.<br><br>GreyICE: are you serious? I've been in the game for 3 days and made 5 (now 6) posts. How you can construe my contribution as tunneling Tasky is beyond me, but perhaps more to the point, how the hell does it make me the most likely candidate for scum?</div></blockquote><br>Locke, I think all the points you have pointed out against me have already been made and I explained but I will try again<br><br>1. I FOSd Dizzle because of the whole Ross accusation because if he was indeed lurking I would totally vote him cause I despise lurkers<br>2. I FOSd Jerbs because that comment he made read scummy to me because he said he was willing to lynch one of many, I went back to my earlier vote on Agar because of how he came out of nowhere and put an opportunistic vote on the largest wagon and it seemed he didn't even read the game throughly yet<br>3.  You want to put that I am cautious of lynching a claimed cop day 1 as a scumtell, go right ahead but as a townie I would never want to lynch the claimed cop especially because I didn't see the case on him to begin with. I FOSd him earlier for 1 comment but I FOS lots of people but don't automatically think they are scum.<br>4. your little tidbit about tasky is plenty of reason to vote him alone, his lurking is scummy play. I have been asked why I am not voting tasky but clearly I have picked up on something that nobody else seems to have picked up on.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why be so tentative? I understand the supposed rationale behind all these things, but the way you approached these slots seemed to me to be at odds with the way you've approached others. You never seemed so hesitant to vote Agar, or Pappums. Also, on Jerbs, what about this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>yes that is very much a possibility of what happened VP and <span class=\"noboldsig\">I admit that Jerbs play has been very iffy at best, I think he has said he would vote for half of the players in this game so he definitly gets some scum points</span>, but this goes back to the point I tried to make about speculation, it is a slippery slope and there could be any number of other possibilities of what triggered the kill and the motivation behind it.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Obviously you suspected him for more than just that 1 comment."}

Mute implies that he's starting to find AGar scummy. VV is non-committal due to lack of content.<br>-Mute says Guderian is annoying him, but VV is reading Guderian as town. Mute is annoyed by Guderian's inconsistency and about-turn to attack him. He finds RW town but wants him lynched or replaced due to inability to contribute. Says Jerbs, Tasky &amp; Pappums are avoiding attention.<br>-VV points out a misunderstanding in Mute's reading of Guderian's post - that Gud wanted to lynch Dizzle, not Ross. Mute still won't unvote until he stops being unclear (I think, this bit is a little fuzzy on the details).<br>-Rain enters with the following reads: Agar/Rob as town; Tasky as uncertain; Jerbs/Ellibereth as scum.<br>-VV is again wishy-washy and says he was reading Pappums, Jerbs and Ross as scum but now he's not so sure. He doesn't want to lynch Tasky.<br>-Rain asks VV's thoughts on AGar. VV thinks he's a mason. <br>-Rain guesses that LlamaGod will die that night, and that Zdenek/Rob will be easy to frame if they're not scum. VV agrees that Llama could be dangerous for scum and starts to wonder about Ross' 334 - he thinks it might make Ross townier, but that it's weird no matter which way you look at it.
