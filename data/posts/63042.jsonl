Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action ranging from a warning to being force-replaced or modkilled.<br><br>i) This is a game so try and have fun! Don't be mean to other users by flaming, trolling or calling names. Remember the general site rules apply at all times!<br>ii) No trickery: No invisible, encrypted, or small text in thread.<br>iii) You may not edit or delete any posts, if you have the power to do so.<br>iv) Don't discuss this game outside of the main thread, unless your role specifies you have the permission to do so.<br>v) Do not quote role PMs or any information said in PTs/QTs outside the related threads. Paraphrasing is allowed, but I would recommend you run it through me first before you do so.<br>vi) Do not impersonate the mod in-thread. Do not use my mod colour, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #804000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">#804000</span></span></span>.<br>vii) Faking a violation will give you the same penalty as actually committing it.<br>-----------------------------------------<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #804000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Game Mechanics</span></span></span><br>The information below describes how the game works. Some of these modified from various other people.<br><br>i) Votes must be bolded, or made using the vote tags. Either Vote: Cheetory6 or VOTE: Cheetory6 is acceptable. On the other hand, if it looks vaguely like a vote, I'll count it.<br>ii) Lynches require a majority of votes. If a majority is not reached by deadline no lynch occurs.<br>iii) Once a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight and players may continue to talk in thread until the death scene has been posted. No votes/unvotes will be counted during this period.<br>iv) Once you're dead, you're dead. No more talking. No 'Bah' posts.<br>v) All actions will be resolved using the Natural Action Resolution system.<br>vi) Each Day will have a two week (14 day) deadline. Deadline extensions don't happen unless on extraordinary circumstances.<br>vii) Each Night will have a 48 hour (2 day) deadline. All night actions must be submitted to me (Cheetory6) by PM during that time.<br>viii) If you're going to be V/LA, please notify me in thread (preferably bolded with @mod or @Cheetory).<br>ix) Players must post every 48 hours or they will be prodded. Three total prods during the game will result in a replacement. If a player fails to pick up on their prod and post in-game within 24 hours, they will be replaced also.<br>x) All flavour is provided purely for entertainment purposes only and has no bearing or relation to the game.<br>xi) Please review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> guidelines.<br>xii) This game will have three mafia and ten town.<br>-----------------------------------------<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #804000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Role PM</span></span></span><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">At least one player has received a 'vanilla town' PM like the one below:</span><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome to the Mafia Caf\u00e9 <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #603000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Cheetory6!</span></span></span><br> -----------------------------------------<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #603000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>:<br> -----------------------------------------<br>--<span style=\"color: #BFBFBF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">(</span></span>---    i) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla</span>: You can post, vote, die and that's about it!  <br>---<span style=\"color: #BFBFBF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">)</span></span>--    ii) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Townie</span>: You are aligned with the Town and win when all threats to the town have been removed and at least one member of town remains.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">c[<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #603000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">\u25a0</span></span></span>]</span>-<br> -----------------------------------------</fieldset>"}

The way I see it is that he asked you nonsense questions like \" Why do you laugh at your conversation? Because I told you to react? \" or \" Why do you RV at the RVS \". You could have simply said \" I don't know, I just found it funny \" and moved on, but for me your post sounds like \" an unnecessary defence \".<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: A Simple Plan</span>"}

However, I didn't really see it as \"defensive.\" I thought the specific reason he provided -- that he was leaving within his own ISO a note about a possible player relationship -- was kind of bizarre. Nervous/lying doesn't sound right to me Johnny, because like Optilex said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7151378#p7151378\">32</a>, he could easily have told us it was banter-y bullshit and moved on. If Simple really posted the way he did for the reason he says he did, AND he was willing to be completely transparent about it immediately after posting, why bother phrasing it the way he did? Why not tell us, \"I'm noting possible distancing between MoSa and Johnny\" right off the bat? It would benefit his ISO the same way, and it would have spared him the negative attention. I don't know, I just got this impression that Simple wasn't afraid of the negative attention, which is vaguely, slightly, just-a-bit town-ish? He's not reading as scummy to me yet, at the very least. <br><br>Ugliest posts so far have been Davsto's &amp; Jester's, but perhaps that's only because (like JakeFSF) I don't think you can characterize Simple's posts thus far as \"defensive.\" Yes, that's a weirdly robust rationale for an LOL+RVS post, but if he was ever defensive it was the \"Do you have a problem with that?\" response to Jester, and not in his original response to Johnny. I guess my RVS Cowbells vote is a moot point now, so here.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Davsto</span>.<br><br>Not only does it seem like you're capitalizing on this \"defensiveness\" b/s, you snagged the least pingy wagon slot, you know, the one that lets you warn everyone it's L-2, without being accused of setting up a quickhammer, etc. <br><br>@Jester, what do you think of Johnny's general aggressiveness so far?"}

I just think you were too cavalier with your vote. It may just boil down to playstyle, but I think if you cast a vote (apart from RVS) you should be willing to accept a lynch. Having a vote pattern that involves constant changes allows people to float from wagon to wagon to see which one gains traction and I think that's good cover for scum. I know you haven't changed your vote yet, but your equivocating about it looks like you might be setting up for it later.

Me accurately saying a player wasn't being defensive has no bearing at all on my relationship with said player. I just stated facts and the only people who would try to suggest that we are linked somehow would only come from scum pushing an agenda. Town using logic would not(or should not) be so narrow minded.

Theoretically, anyone to whom that possibility presented itself can and should present it to the town, which is what I did. It's the opposite of narrow-mindedness - I'm being open to another way of understanding the scenario, not closing myself off to one, like you seem to be implying we all should be doing."}

Why do you think they are weird?</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay so I think I'm being misinterpreted here. I'm not saying it's \"weird\" to be defensive. I no longer care whether or not ASP was defensive originally, and I don't care that Jake defended ASP on the grounds that he categorically was not acting defensive. If you look back, I actually agreed with Jake about that. The weirdness I was pointing out was that Jake answered a question directed toward another player, and then when asked why he did it, he flatly responded that he hadn't at all. Here's the entire interchange so you can see what I'm talking about. (note: I eliminated a little of Jester's response in 37 for clarity.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7151404#p7151404\" class=\"postlink\">post 33</a>, The_Jester wrote:</cite>@ASP, why are you acting so defensive?</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7151446#p7151446\" class=\"postlink\">post 34</a>, Jake from State Farm wrote:</cite>I don't see him being defensive. why do you think he is? even if he was defensive, what does it matter? being defensive isn't scummy</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7151627#p7151627\" class=\"postlink\">post 37</a>, The_Jester wrote:</cite>Why are you answering for him?</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7151632#p7151632\" class=\"postlink\">post 38</a>, Jake from State Farm wrote:</cite>I didn't answer for him</div></blockquote><br><br>So the \"weirdness\" I refer to in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7155846#p7155846\">137</a> has very little to do with the content of Jake's answer. It's the simple fact that he answered a question addressed to another player, and then denied doing so. This is scummy behavior. It prevents ASP from providing an original answer, and provides a line of response for ASP that may otherwise not have occurred to him. Basically, we're deprived of any info that we would have gotten from ASP's answer to Jester. And just as a side note, this isn't some kooky radical theory I'm coming up with on my own. The IC in Newbie 1619 reprimanded someone for doing this, and provided a much better explanation than I did above. I will try to find it myself, but if anyone wants to look for it, just read SilverWolf's ISO from that game. It should be there. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7157763#p7157763\" class=\"postlink\">post 194</a>, Jake from State Farm wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7157751#p7157751\" class=\"postlink\">post 191</a>, JohnnyFarrar wrote:</cite>Henry and Bells should explain to me why Jester's a better vote than the two bigger wagons right now</div></blockquote><br>why do they have to do this? trying to steer the focus to the largest wagons is anti-town imo because it narrows the focus.

Rather than let Henry and Bells respond with explanations, he comes steamrolling and makes sure that doesn't happen by answering himself. To me though, this actually, sort-of, maybe restores my town-read on Jake, because* if he's unaware that this is reprehensible-to-scummy behavior, it means the first instance couldn't have been a \"slip,\" and so I'm inclined to say HEY JAKE: Don't answer questions that aren't directed toward you, and leave it at that. <br><br>* Unless of course Jake is a motherfucking genius, realized what I was accusing him of, pretended for 3 pages to misinterpret it, so that he could do it again and seem innocent.

Why?</div></blockquote><br><br>Aside from the wagon on you (Davsto) the only other wagon to speak of was the original one on ASP, and I thought that the opportunism evinced by the slot you grabbed on that wagon, in conjunction with your relatively flimsy reasoning and the way you couldn't even back that vote/read up without undermining it and saying it was only *really* to pressure him was still the scummiest thing I'd seen. So my vote stayed right where it was because after that, we spent pages trying to get Jake to give an inch of ground on anything at all and consequently couldn't climb out of the pissy little hole we'd dug as a town. I found what you did scummy, whereas with Jake I couldn't make up my mind about whether it was scummy or irrelevantly dickish. I don't necessarily like what I've seen from Maganoo, but I need more from him to contextualize it. I'm with Johnny in that I wouldn't lynch a soul till we hear from Optilex again and TheEMC at all. I am getting legitimately paranoid about the two of them both being lurkylurky scum, laughing their asses off on the sidelines while we collectively tunnel on Davsto.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7161749#p7161749\" class=\"postlink\">post 333</a>, Davsto wrote:</cite>Is that L-1? Yay.<br><br>Before someone quickhammers before stating intent, I claim Doctor.</div></blockquote><br><br>So now that this has happened, I'm going to <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span>. I don't really buy it, but here's my reasoning: he's either scum, or truly the doctor. I think we can eliminate the possibility of Dav being VT or anything else town, since as long as he's town-aligned, there's no good reason to fake claim, right? If he's really the doctor, scum will almost definitely night kill him to prevent his ability from otherwise impairing their plans. Basically, since I think almost everyone scumreads Davsto, we should let the scum do our work for us in the event that we're wrong on Dav. If Dav survives N1, we either bought the doctor a night action (and we can tell him who to protect) or we're lynching near-confirmed scum D2. <br><br>Unless I'm missing something (and I'm not saying that isn't possible) I think we learn more as a town by keeping Davsto alive than by killing him. He's almost certainly dying soon, we might as well milk his death for all the info it's worth. That's why I think Monkey is dead on here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7161885#p7161885\" class=\"postlink\">post 340</a>, Monkey Saint wrote:</cite>We should leave this Davsto wagon alone for today and not even speak of it further.

I am just not comfortable with anything that davsto has done or said all game.  I know he's the medic claim, but I really just get an awful feeling from everything hes said all game.  Hes flop flopped, made votes based on not looking stupid rather than actual reads, and ever since he has claimed medic he is just spewing complete crap in what I can only define as a \"ha ha you can't lynch me\" type of attitude, because he feels safe after the claim.<br><br>Jester I'm on the fence about, his self hammer comment is anti-town if he is town, and I don't see why he felt the need to jump to such a big conclusion.  I understand that he doesn't want to have to defend himself constantly based on something that happened early game, but he put himself in that position.  Why should town waste a lynch on him because he just doesn't want to have to defend himself?<br><br>RC is really showed up over the last few pages and I like what he has had to say.  His attitude towards the game at first was less than desirable, but the stuff that he has posted recently I agree with.  His opinion on monkey seems authentic and not a far stretch, and I must admit that until I read what he had to say about monkey I was giving monkey a town lean.<br><br>HCL for me is null. He hasn't done anything to make me read him one way or another right now. I like what he has to say in his posts, but I can't say any of his content is particularly amazing. (not that i have blown peoples minds either)<br><br>The last few posts by Monkey seem to be protecting davsto or distancing himself from davsto. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7165923#p7165923\">Post 421</a> is tossing scum on RC for lynching a very questionable medic claim. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7166116#p7166116\">Post 429</a> he says we if davsto is scum then RC must be the partner because he had his vote on davsto and wasn't scumhuting.  Why would he scum hunt if he has his vote on the person he wants to lynch? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7166814#p7166814\">Post 432</a> reads to me as monkey trying to make an excuse for his partner. Saying that davsto's actions make him look noobish.  Finally <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7166998#p7166998\">Post 434</a> rubs me the wrong way. You are basically saying that you are town without outright saying you are town...its pointless comment.  <br><br>With all of that said <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: davsto</span> because there are just too many questions surrounding him, and its just going to be a huge mess if we let him move on to day two.  If he is the medic and he is left alive after N1 without a save are we going to lynch him day 2 or give him another chance because he could still be the medic and potentially get a save N2?  If we put an end to it D-1, we can go back to interactions after he flips to see who pushed the most or who benefited the most from the mislynch if he is medic or who protected and distanced the most if he is scum. I realize that I would look awful if he flips town based on my focus on him, but he isn't helping solve the game at all.<br><br>I would be willing to vote Monkey if you guys really really really want to give davsto a night, but I just don't think that is the best idea."}

What I was saying was that they're both overall pretty null to me, especially Monkey because whenever he posts, he seems to be working his way out of a hole Cowbells has dug for him, and that's always gonna make someone's tone sound defensive and reachy. I've agreed with Monkey on most of the Davsto claim debate, but I guess since that's mostly theoretical/mechanical, it shouldn't really be a point in either direction. Cowbells comes off as a lot defter at avoiding these kinds of holes, but that's only because he quotes fucking Labyrinth and says shit like this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7160926#p7160926\" class=\"postlink\">post 281</a>, RadiantCowbells wrote:</cite>If you were adequately skilled to judge my play, we wouldn't be having this conversation.</div></blockquote><br><br>In sum, I don't scumread either of them -- not yet, at least -- but when put into comparison with one another, I think RC's stonewalling is being accommodated way too readily as just \"playstyle\" and if the fledgling case against Monkey is mostly tonal, then we should show RC the same kind of attention."}

Not only was I the one to make the initial case against Dav, I feel like I've been more than clear that I would very much like to lynch him. I don't know how many times I can explain this, but I just think we have more to gain as a town by sparing him today, because if in the unlikely event that he IS the doctor, scum will have to decide whether they want to risk leaving him alive and possibly having their NK prevented. <br><br>As for your second question, I like my Jester vote, you're next on my list, and I want to take another look at Jake too, especially since in the wake of his tete-a-tete with Dav, there's been almost complete radio silence there. Pulling a Costanza, Jake? Leaving on a high note? But -- like I've stated before -- if by the end of D1 the only thing we can agree on is the scumminess of Dav's behavior &amp; claim, I'd be fine lynching him. I'll put him at L-1, I'll cast the hammer...whatever. <br><br>And as to the whole \"100 posts old...my recent thought process\" thing: you realize that your rationale for foregoing logic and calling for Davsto's D1 lynch is exactly what Davsto did re: Cowbells, and what Jester did re: Davsto? I'm turning myself into a one-trick pony here, but to me it's quite scummy to preface your vote the way you did: narrate your supposed crisis of faith, then undermine your own case by resting it all on what's essentially policy (\"Well he's anti-town anyway...\").<br><br>I would venture to say that ChOmega's earlier point about Davsto is just as applicable to Maganoo in these circumstances:<br>(I added the bold.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7161140#p7161140\" class=\"postlink\">post 296</a>, ChaosOmega wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>free stool sample wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7161085#p7161085\" class=\"postlink\">post 293</a>, ChaosOmega wrote:</cite>Sigh...well my town read on Davsto is gone.

Jester's self-hammer comment was definitely bad. I understand the approach with the vote on Dav, though I'm not exactly a fan of the willingness to claim responsibility, because if he flips scum (like quite a few think he would), it paints you as the most pro-town of the bunch, though the second paragraph of 443 is basically the handbook of \"how to appear town\".<br><br>Chaos: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7169997#p7169997\">451</a> I've been playing catchup and that question was asked after life went to shit and times got busy.

Still. I like the effort to figure out the game, and the posting here uses a similar approach to mine, making note of things though they say little now, to reference later if new information might mean those posts become more alignment-indicative.

Radiant Cowbells mentioned that it seemed like a genuine expression of emotion, but aren't emotional appeals frowned upon in this game? A precedent has been set now where anyone with pressure on them can say \"Well, I'm tired of this- if someone puts me at L-1 I'm gonna hammer and I'm town\" like a sitcom-level petulant teenager. Jester's vote on Davsto was terrible, he deserved to be called out on it. A lot of you from what I remember have unresolved issues from his vote on the A Simple Plan wagon earlier in the day as well. That's two hot sexy wagons he's jumped on that have drawn a notable amount of suspicion. Are we letting him off the hook too easily?<br><br>I can understand Monkey Saint's objections to the Davsto lynch, but I think he's discounting the possibility of Davsto lying far too much. I don't think he's scummy though, just a nervous little chimp. He mentions in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7148531#p7148531\">487</a> that he thinks the Davsto case is based on emotion. I think that's a misrepresentation. Davsto's play shows a lot of inconsistency and backpedaling. Perhaps some people are tunneling Davsto (I'm willing to grant that), but I still think he's the best lynch right now.<br><br>FSS had a good point about the heat on Monkey Saint (pray for us) and people casting suspicion on him but not voting, but he lost some of his zest when he started misrepresenting quotes. I'm not a fan of that deception to say the least. Why ruin a perfectly good point by being a sneaky pete? It pings on my radar, though. I can see how it would be a subtle way to try and avert the town's attention away from the increasingly imminent Davsto lynch. Now what interest would FSS have in that? He hasn't openly protested the same way Monkey Saint has. He seems to want to maintain his distance from the good doctor. Interesting.<br><br>I found the Marvin Manganoo and HavingFitz posts hopping on the spicy hot Davsto wagon bland and derivative. Neither really added anything new to the discussion and kind of just echoed previously expressed sentiments against Disgraced Doctor Davsto. To me, they gave off the impression of just going with the flow. I understand there was a lot to catch up on and Davsto has provided us with ample reason to string him up, but I was hoping for a little more pizzazz. <br><br>Jake From State Farm's vote on HavingFitz makes no sense at this point in the game. Is it an attempt at humor? Please take the game more seriously, Jake, like the rest of us are.<br><br>So, in concluding, I'm keeping my vote on Davsto but I could be swayed to jump ship to Jester or possibly even FSS. Davsto is still the best lynch for the time being, though."}

Marvin is expanding on his vote now, but I'm having reservations about the fact that he keeps bringing up the possibility that Davsto may be town- I don't like qualifying votes like that. He's also one of those guys that gets bogged down in \"anti-town vs. pro-town\" rhetoric when making a case on someone and I find that McCarthyist and hollow."}

I can outright confirm I was trying to \"defuse\" the wagon -- you can probably quote me several times saying this. I recommended what I think is the best play when there's a Doc claim D1, which is to put that wagon aside for the day. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7162093#p7162093\">343</a>, I quoted MonkeySaint saying exactly this, and the full rationale of my explanation (which I've been forced to rehash repeatedly) is there for you. So feel free to say that after the doc claim, I tried to defuse the wagon. Just don't make it out to be the product of any critical analysis on your part. It's just an account of what happened. <br><br>As for the Jester wagon, I didn't just \"start\" it out of the blue. Jester predicated his Davsto vote on the same rationale Davsto used to justify his vote on Cowbells, which suggested to me (and should suggest to you) that Jester voted Davsto at that particular time because he calculated that it was the safest time and manner of voting Dav, and not because he legitimately believed Davsto was acting like scum. Jester is still the best wagon out there.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Jester</span>.<br><br>As for the Monkey thing, I think you're failing to take into account that at the time, because of what we only now know to be a fakeclaim, I did not think a vote on Davsto was at all tenable, so I began digging into the Davsto wagon to see why some people were so insistent that we lynch the claimed Doc D1 despite the very obvious and very well-established reasons not to, especially when all three seemed to have other, ostensibly valid scumreads (i.e. Monkey). Just as I was described as \"defending\" Davsto, or trying to \"defuse\" his wagon, I think it's pretty easy to see why I might think that the people on the Dav wagon were being unreasonably obsessive about getting it completion. I mean really, if you're gonna figure anything out, you're gonna have to make some accusations and like Johnny pointed out and we all saw, I missed the context while I was rereading you and I readily admitted that when it was brought up. However, on the other hand, we also all saw that for his vote on Dav, Marvin Maganoo had cobbled together some kind of hybrid of Jester's emotional appeal and Davsto's own \"scum-or-at-least-antitown\" argument. Being that those are two completely mincing and parasitic voting strategies, and it was all supported by opportunistic timing, my scumread on Maganoo stands, and although I think Jester is the better vote, Maganoo isn't far behind for me -- I'd be willing to pursue either for D2. <br><br>ChOmega, why are you so willing to give Monkey the benefit of the doubt here (\"town believing their actions are right\") when he has voted for FIVE non-Davsto players &amp; laid off Davsto completely? Wouldn't this type of behavior qualify as the type you're voting me for? (via Davsto, i.e. indirectly).  It seems like you knew how you wanted to answer HCL's question, but not how to justify it."}

First, how can his scumhunting be garbage if he successfully identified scum? You seem to think his confidence in Davsto being scum means he had some other knowledge the rest of the town didn't have. What about the other people who were convinced Davsto was scum (myself included)? You say a lot of the votes were wishy-washy but I don't see it. Second, RC was on the Davsto wagon before it became the hottest thing in town. There was arguably just as much heat on Jester before, and at times, during the Davsto wagon that scum could attach themselves pretty easily to it. Davsto may have played poorly, but I have a hard time believing that his partner would be bussing him at such a nascent stage especially when there were other viable options. <br><br>I think people are too wedded to the bussing thing. We had two lurkers who stayed off the Davsto wagon (TheEMC and A Simple Plan). Why aren't we considering them? Look at the nightkill as well. Jake was one of the most prominent people not voting Davsto. I think it's likely he was killed because he was vocally against the Davsto wagon. As people who weren't on the Davsto wagon get eliminated, it becomes easier to assume that scum were on the wagon. I think it's just as possible that scum were hiding somewhere off of it."}

But anyway, comparing your post with Marvin's...<br><br>- Your post was <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7170242#p7170242\">453</a>. You'll notice this number comes after Marvin's 369. Almost like you took the idea of having other people go after Monkey from someone else...<br>- The tone of these 2 posts are completely different. Marvin's is inquisitive; earlier on that page had RC (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7162338#p7162338\">354</a>), JfSF (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7162952#p7162952\">360</a>), and Davsto (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7162955#p7162955\">361</a>) all post suspicion of Monkey Saint, along with a VC showing no votes for him. Marvin even thought a wagon was forming on Monkey based on these posts...<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7163019#p7163019\" class=\"postlink\">post 367</a>, Marvin Maganoo wrote:</cite>I haven't had much time to run through all the new pages in depth, but this wagon forming on monkey seems sudden and for no other reason that he quickly changed his vote to jester after stool brought up something that he liked. I need to dig deeper because I may have missed something else though.</div></blockquote>His 369 reads more as shock that there were no votes to go along with all the suspicion heaped on Monkey that page.<br>- Also, you'll note Marvin's post doesn't cite quotes totally out of context to push a bullshit agenda and wasn't engineered to dismantle a wagon on now-confirmed scum."}

It does nothing to further the game for people like myself (and I think there's a lot of us) who aren't intimately familiar with the playstyles of other people on this site.

If we're going down this road, give me a minute to say some stuff.<br><br>Marvin / Fitz scum team is highly unlikely, but there's definitely one between the two of them. Marvin's posts in and of themselves read scummier to me, but we shouldn't ignore fitz's almost complete inability to defend himself. All of his decidedly meager town cred comes from sheeping around, and fashioning himself the harmless bro of any Stool-voter whenever he's pressed about anything. Not sure yet what to make of the fact that the wagon on fitz fell apart almost *instantly* -- who fled it and when? -- but just making a note of it here in case I don't get the chance to dig into that.<br><br>Although there's a possibility Johnny is (A) a scum goon who (B) did not perform the kill on Jake, my result from last night is a strong point in favor of the near-universal opinion that Johnny is town. I wish I had something more controversial to spill, since I'll likely be accused of resting a scum-gambit on a safe target, but them's the breaks. I also believe Chaos is town, primarily I guess because his case against me is actually good. I'll admit it. I let myself get preoccupied with this idea of a shadow wagon being primed against Monkey (who I also read as town) which is pretty silly in retrospect. I still think my basic idea of this thing was pretty cool, there's just no way it's actually happening in our game. <br><br>To elaborate on the Monkey thing, I've already said that I think most of the suspicion on him has been manufactured by others, more often than not Cowbells. Forgive me this pretension, but the situation with him is a little Kafkaesque. How many times did this happen: Monkey says something, Someone says \"That's bad,\" and then Monkey is forced to defend himself against an unknown charge which in the simple act of acknowledging the accusation, will always read like an admission of guilt. The points against him are all ciphers in my eyes.<br><br>HCL is probably town, and that last post/fitz-vote supports that in my opinion. Can't say I have a big read on ASP, and Lynx is entering the game inheriting what I consider a decent basis for a scumread of that slot, but I don't recommend putting him on the defensive until he contributes some self-generated analysis. I've been ambivalent about Cowbells for the duration of the game, and this interchange with Titus doesn't really do much to influence that one way or the other, I'm sad to say. Titus is definitely being theatrical, but I don't see how that could be a scum-tell in itself, and RC has demonstrated himself to be nothing if not protean, so I can't completely reject the idea that RC is mining Titus's net-neutral theatrics for some easy town cred - the kind that is awarded for doing nothing but exercising rationality (and is thus, a little suspect). If theEMC had ever said anything at all, I could see Titus's behavior as a way to cover something up and draw attention to their posts over the original slot-holder's, but he didn't.<br><br>In any case, I'm still more or less at status quo, in that the two people I scumread hard enough to advocate lynching are Marvin &amp; Fitz, but I know it's unlikely that the momentum of this day will change significantly enough to avoid my own lynch. This is difficult to articulate, but when I flip green, remember that Chaos's point about the case against me being similar to the one I'm mounting against Marvin is not a bad point. I obviously know that when it comes to me it's misguided, but don't consider my town-flip a refutation of Chaos's logic. Pursue it, cause it's a good lead."}

My main positive read towards you is with Davsto. <br><br>When you were allegedly day vigged, Davsto egregiously threw out this torrent of Johnny praising posts to bolster his image in case you <br><br>flipped town. It was just too obvious to be effective in any manner. Who are you looking at now after leaving Stool with this claim?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Chaos</span><br><br>Your early exchanges with Davos using his meta seems genuine.

Do you not buy this claim either <br><br>though?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Marvin</span><br><br>Marvin has actually taken some decent heat at points during this game, mainly from Monkey. However, I find his play quite frank and consistent. He's <br><br>carried his quiet and hesitant nature throughout. He was one of the earliest votes on Davsto as well. His Stool vote isn't as strong, but it's in a similar <br><br>fashion to the rest of his posts. Marvin's not looking bad in my book. Who's your #2 behind Stool? What about the claim this time?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Henry</span><br><br>Thought you were coasting a bit early on Day 1. On the other hand, I feel you rebounded nicely with your handling of Davsto. Your original placement of the <br><br>vote and subsequent lock in after the claim all work in your favor for me. Further, your Day 2 play has been rational and level-headed. Do you <br><br>really think there is enough content from Titus so far to warrant a vote though? Especially if she hasn't even read the game?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Radiant</span><br><br>I actually liked the dayvig gambit and find it to more likely come from town than scum. Your staunch support of a Davos lynch wasn't particularly clear, but <br><br>the way you seem to capriciously change your votes at times would have allowed you to jump from the stalling Davos wagon without much complaint from <br><br>anybody. These give me positive vibes.<br><br><br><br>Now for more suspicious individuals...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Monkey </span> <br><br>You've been pretty wishwashy with your vote. Notably, you've voted JesterLynx, Jake, JesterLynx again, Marvin, Radiant, and lastly Marvin again. The <br><br>circular fashion of voting for both days while avoiding the two main wagons on Davsto and Stool doesn't look particularly good in my eyes. I don't find  <br><br>Marvin to be the worst vote on either wagon. Like Johnny said, I kind of feel like you're pursuing easy targets.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Stool </span><br><br>Im assuming you're possibly tracker? For me, you're one of the worst Davsto lynchers. To your credit, you were on the wagon the earliest, yet you were <br><br>never really pushing strongly for his lynch. In fact, you never even really mentioned Davsto until he questioned you about it. The fact that you hammered <br><br>after trying to the defuse the wagon is troubling. This is made worse by the fact that if you are a tracker you could have just targeted Davsto at night. In <br><br>that way there is absolutely no reason for someone from your standpoint to kill him even if it was inevitable as you say. Lastly, why target Johnny over <br><br>someone like myself who you were suspicious of during later day 1?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">HavingFitz</span><br><br>Another of the weaker Davsto lynchers. Unlike the others who I mentioned had opportunity to jump ship at little cost, you're vote came at a point where the <br><br>Davsto lynch seemed nearly to be a foregone conclusion. Day 2, you've been pushing and pushing this Stool Wagon and it's disheartening that you've barely <br><br>mentioned anyone else today like at all.

I did find two posts where you expand on where you stand with certain players (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7168727#p7168727\">533</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179557#p7179557\">552</a>. The only person I see you go after with some real substance is Jake From State Farm who is dead now. You tell both Monkey Saint and FSS that you would support their lynch as \"an alternative to Davsto\" based on sentiments already articulated by other players but that's the furthest it goes. Seems to me like a poor attempt to appear like you have reads on players other than Davsto who was at that point the consensus lynch.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Defining Lazy</span>- In order to define lazy, we must first understand lazy. We must analyze lazy and what makes it so ...lazy. Lazy is you voted Davsto after 1 paragraph on your 4th post of the game and sat there while only presenting superficial suspicions. Your first post of today was a vote on FSS (conveniently one of two you would have supported as the alternate lynch to Davsto on day 1 but did nothing about) and you've spent the majority of the day making posts that literally end with \"vote stool\" until it became clear stool wouldn't flush down the toilet so easily.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">\"Hyperbole much?</span>- Well, Chandler, I addressed a lot of my issue with this in my last post. You seem to be trying to silence other posters's legitmate non-stool leads with your \"vote stool\" strategy. It's certainly not scummy to try to win other people over to voting your top scum suspect, but you're doing it in a very scummy way.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Preclaim support of stool wagon</span>- In all honesty, I find this irrelevant. Stool got heat all yesterday for his convoluted Davsto defense. You even hopped on the Stool heat, albeit in a rather passive way. You were setting up going after Stool today, and this is only confirmed by your first-post vote of him with no explanation. Further, it makes sense that you would disbelieve a Stool town power role claim today given the fact that Davsto's doctor claim didn't do him any favors.<br><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7208694#p7208694\" class=\"postlink\">post 753</a>, Monkey Saint wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7205687#p7205687\" class=\"postlink\">post 705</a>, HenryCabotLodge wrote:</cite>You criticized me for not casting a vote right away, now your attacking Marvin for making a vote right away.

If you're town-tracker and worried he's fooling everyone, you might believe he feels safe to perform the kill since he's not suspected.

If he was a full tracker, then yeah, try a hail mary track early, see if you get lucky.<br><br>Like I said before, his claim reads as more genuine to me than Davsto's, and he said he's never been a PR before, so his target of Johnny N1 could be more a case of inexperience than malicious intent.

Firstly, Davsto threw out his bullshit as soon as he touched L-1. Stool waited decently longer to use his role to clear himself. Though, this could mean that he took time to consider and think over which fake claim could serve best. Secondly, the nature of his claimed role forced him to tie himself to a target as well. Granted that Johnny was a pretty safe bet on town purely going from Day 1 at that point. If Johnny just happened to be a PR, then Stool would have been finished. Still haven't like Stool's play before the claim really, but I think there's enough with this claim to look into others today instead.<br><br>Anybody play with a one shot tracker before? <br><br>I really don't like Fitz backing off his Stool vote, only to vote him again in one of his next few posts. Under the scrutiny of several players over his previous claim reaction, it seems like just more of an attempt to remain consistent with his previous Davsto suspicion. Still not a fan of the Fitz here.<br><br>I'm also concerned with how often Stool and Monkey have been paired together with their voting on Jester/Me, Marvin, and now fitz. Along with the few instances I recall where Stool has spoken up for Monkey. I don't think a scum pair would be so overt with collective voting or speaking favorably for each other. I do think their is a reasonable chance that one of the two is scum though.<br><br>As for the Titus/RC back and forth. I have a pretty hard grasp getting a grasp on the situation with to the constant references to other games which I wouldn't personally bother perusing. Mostly due to my reads through Davsto, I tend to favor RC between the two. Didn't like sticking up for Stool from Titus with little explanation either. <br><br>RC, Johnny, Henry, and chaos have all voted or expressed an acceptance of a possible Titus lynch. I just haven't seen enough content from her that would yield an informative lynch. Like I previously mentioned, the mutual tunneling from her and RC haven't revealed much to me other than a shared animosity between the two.<br><br>Still want to hear from Monkey, Fitz, and simple plan before adding anything else."}

Fitz, you straight up buy RC's explanation that he really thought you were a cop? You jump through hoops to differentiate RC's lies from \"scum lies\" but in the end it's mostly ex post facto reasoning that falls back on the same nebulous WIFOM-soup that RC is so good at cooking up. What about the possibility that RC's dayvig gambit could have outed a PR? Basically you're trying to say lying is okay when nothing bad comes of it, which doesn't really address the fact that you think scum are more likely to lie in general at all. You can't maintain your original position while defending RC, it just doesn't work.<br><br>What I think happened with this cop-neighborhood thing is that RC's gambit was intended to establish a firm disconnect between he and fitz. RC had a great track record at that point of being given free passes to play as recklessly and inscrutably as he wanted, so he figured no one would hold the lying against him, and Fitz responding incredulously was basically a given at this point. <br><br>A Monkey lynch would be a really hard sell for me. #1, I think he's town, and (presuming my read of him is correct of course) if we're gonna call for the lynch of a townie I think you guys could get a lot more info by lynching me than Monkey. I've already used my 1-shot ability, so there's that -- plus in my eyes, my townflip would damn Fitz pretty thoroughly. Obviously, I'd prefer we skip that step and go right to lynching Fitz today rather than tomorrow, but with hardly 2 days to go before deadline, I understand if you've gotta go through me to get to him. <br><br>So overall, I'd be onboard with lynching Fitz or RC today. Marvin's disappearance rustles my jimmies, cause if I'm wrong about this connection* between fitz &amp; RC, Marvin is still my outside candidate, and I will add that ASP's recent vote didn't look right to me, but there's not nearly enough time left in the day to pursue that, especially considering what seems to be going on in his life at the moment...<br><br>*Or the belaboring of a non-connection, if you prefer to call it that."}

This would have made 6, but one of those Monkey votes is RC, who parked his vote on Titus before replacing out, so it shouldn't really count. <br><br>So as it stands now, we don't have enough voters for a majority on anyone, but both a Titus wagon and a Monkey wagon would only need one more voter to go through. I guess since I wasn't on either of those two my pledge would give us enough to lynch either. <br><br>So in my mind, it's basically for me to decide between Monkey and Titus -- two people I'd prefer not to vote at all, but for very different reasons. To answer Johnny's question about why I townread Monkey, I'll try to sum it up. Monkey has taken a number of difficult positions - not as in reachy, but as in he maintains a focus on investigation when it would be easier to go the populist route. Recent example is the \"Only an idiot would vote their top suspect all day\" post -- it's scumbaiting for sure, but as a position it also holds up against scrutiny. Most of the time, Monkey seems far more interested in scumhunting and getting info for the town than he does in self-preservation and it's really hard to find that scummy. On the reverse side of the equation, it seems like hardly anyone ever discusses why Monkey's posts are scummy. Everyone just says \"That was gross\" or \"Monkey's post was bad,\" then other people agree, and then that's it. If the case against Monkey is that he's avoided the two major wagons, then I don't think there's much of a case at all. He didn't \"avoid\" Davsto -- like me, he thought it best to give the doctor claim a night on principle. <br><br>In the case of Titus, I really don't like how heavily she leans on the \"If I was scum, why would I [fill in the blank]\" defense, and as others have noted, unvoting RC when he decided to replace out without other provocation really undermines the integrity of that vote in retrospect. Even looking back now, I can't figure out why Titus unvoted. However, RC is one of my top scumreads, and to vote Titus I'd have to vote for the same player as RC which just seems like a mistake to me. After what happened, the possibility that both RC and Titus are scum is so small -- the only thing I can think of is that maybe they legitimately hate each other and each was trying to bus the other? Million to one odds on that though, so basically, for me to vote Titus would be to vote under the pretense that one of my scumreads is wrong. <br><br>TL;DR -- If I voted Titus, I'm voting under the pretense one of my scumreads is wrong, and if I vote Monkey, I'm voting under the pretense one of my townreads is wrong. Statistically, it's objectively more likely that I'm wrong about scum than about town, so although I'd definitely prefer to vote someone else entirely, I have to go with Titus over Monkey. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Titus</span><br><br>Obviously if other people decide to change their vote prospects, I'm not at all married to this vote. This is all based on Lynx's calculations. Plus my own calculations could be off. I don't know, it's very late. Feels like a shitty way to end D2."}

He could have possibly not been the one to send in the night kill, it's just far more probable that he is town.</div></blockquote><br><br>When they say it's against the rules to quote a Mod PM, that means literally using the quoting tool, right? The answer to your question is that I received the former, verbatim. I didn't realize that had implications beyond Johnny not having targeted anyone. You think this specific action result means Chaos jailed me N1? Or are you merely saying it is now a possibility."}

Maybe he's a little gung-ho on sheeping Metal, but that's not out of character if he has such a strong townread.<br><br>ASP seemed to stay away from a hard read on FSS while lightly disliking the wagon. Also, in 125 he listed Jester, Davs, and Johnny as for sure containing a scum withing the three. He then never voted them nor really pushed any suspicions on them. This looks to me like he tossed a scummate's name in with two town in order to give himself some flex room, either to look back and go \"told ya so\" or \"well, I said one of the three\" depending how it went. <br><br>Titus was so sure Stool was obvtown and voted him really begrudgingly. Their push for Chaos was weird as many had her as a strong townread. They then died that night. I could believe Titus was trying to save their last scummate, thus hardpushing that their claim makes them obvtown. That and the potential wine of \"Why would I kill Omega?

And anyone willing to hardbus both of their partners into the grave (which I do not think Magoo/Dierfire did) deserves to last longer in this game than people with questionable actions (or absence of anything helpful) such Johnny who hasn't got anything right the entire game and just likes to lounge about and \"try\" to be witty; and ASP (see Johnny comments minus the \"try\" to be witty bit).<br><br>So much for waiting....<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ASP</span>"}

He just took his almost universal townread and slinked into the shadows.<br>When called out for this by Fitz, rather than defend himself, he took it to a personal level to discredit Fitz.<br><br>His hammer on ASP called back to a D1 read, almost as if to say \"come on guys, I've had this read all game\" as a defense when ASP flipped town.<br><br>D5 in the TvT between Titus and Sonic he sidelined so hard it's actually ridiculous. He just sat back and watched, barely even mentioning anything game related, as if not wanting to interfere in it.<br><br>I see zero town motivation to any of this. This here is our scum.<br><br><br>If we look at Fitz in the VCA, he was late on Davsto and early on FSS, which is possible scum bussing. He does, however, push for FSS' lynch far harder than I would expect any teammate to do. I mean, if you're pushing hard enough to make people think you have a guilty on scum, that's a fucking hard push! Scum tend not to bus like that. They'd rather let someone else start the wagon super hard and sheep early on, but with individual confidence. Which was admittedly what he did on D3, but that didn't feel like a bus to me.<br><br>In days 4 &amp; 5 he was far more of a presence than Johnny was, not just waiting for a wagon to hammer, but making his own stance and sticking to it. He gets huge points for being on Johnny despite the Metal/Titus argument. I wish he'd been there and pushing it a little more, as he did seem to use it to avoid the main conversation, but that's about all I've got against him.<br><br>Johnny has to be the final scum. If not, You've duped me again Fitz.<br>I swore I wouldn't let a repeat of A Game of Pokes happen. If you've done it again, then I really have to get better at sorting you!<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: JohnnyFarrar</span>"}

I'm not upset or anything but it definitely felt like that really shook up the game.
