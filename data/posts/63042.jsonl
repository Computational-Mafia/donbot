Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action ranging from a warning to being force-replaced or modkilled.<br>\n<br>\ni) This is a game so try and have fun! Don't be mean to other users by flaming, trolling or calling names. Remember the general site rules apply at all times!<br>\nii) No trickery: No invisible, encrypted, or small text in thread.<br>\niii) You may not edit or delete any posts, if you have the power to do so.<br>\niv) Don't discuss this game outside of the main thread, unless your role specifies you have the permission to do so.<br>\nv) Do not quote role PMs or any information said in PTs/QTs outside the related threads. Paraphrasing is allowed, but I would recommend you run it through me first before you do so.<br>\nvi) Do not impersonate the mod in-thread. Do not use my mod colour, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#804000\">#804000</div></div>.<br>\nvii) Faking a violation will give you the same penalty as actually committing it.<br>\n-----------------------------------------<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#804000\">Game Mechanics</div></div><br>\nThe information below describes how the game works. Some of these modified from various other people.<br>\n<br>\ni) Votes must be bolded, or made using the vote tags. Either Vote: Cheetory6 or VOTE: Cheetory6 is acceptable. On the other hand, if it looks vaguely like a vote, I'll count it.<br>\nii) Lynches require a majority of votes. If a majority is not reached by deadline no lynch occurs.<br>\niii) Once a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight and players may continue to talk in thread until the death scene has been posted. No votes/unvotes will be counted during this period.<br>\niv) Once you're dead, you're dead. No more talking. No 'Bah' posts.<br>\nv) All actions will be resolved using the Natural Action Resolution system.<br>\nvi) Each Day will have a two week (14 day) deadline. Deadline extensions don't happen unless on extraordinary circumstances.<br>\nvii) Each Night will have a 48 hour (2 day) deadline. All night actions must be submitted to me (Cheetory6) by PM during that time.<br>\nviii) If you're going to be V/LA, please notify me in thread (preferably bolded with @mod or @Cheetory).<br>\nix) Players must post every 48 hours or they will be prodded. Three total prods during the game will result in a replacement. If a player fails to pick up on their prod and post in-game within 24 hours, they will be replaced also.<br>\nx) All flavour is provided purely for entertainment purposes only and has no bearing or relation to the game.<br>\nxi) Please review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> guidelines.<br>\nxii) This game will have three mafia and ten town.<br>\n-----------------------------------------<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#804000\">Sample Role PM</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">At least one player has received a 'vanilla town' PM like the one below:</div><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome to the Mafia Caf&#233; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#603000\">Cheetory6!</div></div><br>\n -----------------------------------------<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#603000\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>:<br>\n -----------------------------------------<br>\n--<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BFBFBF\">(</div>---    i) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla</div>: You can post, vote, die and that's about it!  <br>\n---<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BFBFBF\">)</div>--    ii) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Townie</div>: You are aligned with the Town and win when all threats to the town have been removed and at least one member of town remains.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">c[<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#603000\">&#9632;</div></div>]</div>-<br>\n -----------------------------------------</fieldset>", "time": "Sat Aug 15, 2015 4:39 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

However, I didn't really see it as \"defensive.\" I thought the specific reason he provided -- that he was leaving within his own ISO a note about a possible player relationship -- was kind of bizarre. Nervous/lying doesn't sound right to me Johnny, because like Optilex said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7151378#p7151378\">32</a>, he could easily have told us it was banter-y bullshit and moved on. If Simple really posted the way he did for the reason he says he did, AND he was willing to be completely transparent about it immediately after posting, why bother phrasing it the way he did? Why not tell us, \"I'm noting possible distancing between MoSa and Johnny\" right off the bat? It would benefit his ISO the same way, and it would have spared him the negative attention. I don't know, I just got this impression that Simple wasn't afraid of the negative attention, which is vaguely, slightly, just-a-bit town-ish? He's not reading as scummy to me yet, at the very least. <br>\n<br>\nUgliest posts so far have been Davsto's &amp; Jester's, but perhaps that's only because (like JakeFSF) I don't think you can characterize Simple's posts thus far as \"defensive.\" Yes, that's a weirdly robust rationale for an LOL+RVS post, but if he was ever defensive it was the \"Do you have a problem with that?\" response to Jester, and not in his original response to Johnny.

However for me, that doesn't necessarily excuse him from the opportunism of his timing. <br>\n<br>\n@Johnny, I appreciate the refusal to belabor. Seriously, since nervous/lying vs. bizarre is really a difference in reads of tone. Nothing empirical about it until we get more from ASP. <br>\n<br>\n@HCL: Your long post is a bit stinky. When discussing Jake's comment to Johnny, about pushing to lynch whoever he thinks is scummiest, you say, \"Seems scummy to me to want to push a fast lynch.\" Then, as you softly tiptoe to the border of this Davsto wagon, you say, \"If you really believe he's scum, why would you care about the quickness of the lynch?\" This is a direct contradiction in terms, and although it's definitely not scummy in and of itself to contradict yourself, I do think this instance is a little more suspect in my eyes, because you use both of those lines as means of casting suspicion on Jake and Davsto respectively. What's the answer, Henry? Push the lynch you think is most deserving, no matter the speed; or pressure a player only when it's safe to do so?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYour verbose little treatise misses the point that both of my objections stem from having definitive reads at an embryonic stage of the game. I explained my response to Jake in my last post. My issue with Davsto is that if you're going to say you believe someone is scum enough to cast a vote for a lynch, why would you a. care about hearing from other people that you scumread less than him/her and b. invalidate your vote by saying it's only for the purposes of pressure and not actually for the intended purpose of a lynch? The Davsto case I think highlights my point about early fast lynches being bad because now he's in a position he wouldn't have been in if he had just said \"I'd like to hear more from A Simple Plan about this thing that annoyed me\" rather than voting him based off of two posts.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7153125#p7153125\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7153125#p7153125\" data-post-id=\"7153125\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 105</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26159\">Davsto</a> wrote:</cite>@Henry: Problem is, you're missing a lot of key words in my text.<br>\n<br>\nSingle post, could be a single slip up.

Just because I think he's scum now doesn't mean I'll still think that in four IRL days. Things can change, and some people haven't even said anything yet.

I just disagree with it. Of course scumreads are going to be transient and hearing from other players is valuable especially when we have the time do so. I just think you were too cavalier with your vote. It may just boil down to playstyle, but I think if you cast a vote (apart from RVS) you should be willing to accept a lynch. Having a vote pattern that involves constant changes allows people to float from wagon to wagon to see which one gains traction and I think that's good cover for scum. I know you haven't changed your vote yet, but your equivocating about it looks like you might be setting up for it later. My big gripe, though, is how you can have such a confident read based off of three posts and keep sticking to it in the wake of a lot more substantial posting from other people.", "time": "Mon Aug 17, 2015 1:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

The second reply was also very defensive - maybe more justified, since it came with a vote, but \"do you have a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">problem</div> with that\" just reads weirdly, and not something I'd imagine town saying.<br>\n(B) I don't actually agree that being defensive is a town tell or a scum tell all the time. For the most part, I'd consider it a null tell; both town and scum will defend themselves when attacked. However, sometimes context can make all the difference, and when you're defensive as you were, it reads oddly - being defensive before it's even slightly needed.", "time": "Mon Aug 17, 2015 4:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

If you look back, I actually agreed with Jake about that. The weirdness I was pointing out was that Jake answered a question directed toward another player, and then when asked why he did it, he flatly responded that he hadn't at all.

It's the simple fact that he answered a question addressed to another player, and then denied doing so. This is scummy behavior. It prevents ASP from providing an original answer, and provides a line of response for ASP that may otherwise not have occurred to him. Basically, we're deprived of any info that we would have gotten from ASP's answer to Jester. And just as a side note, this isn't some kooky radical theory I'm coming up with on my own. The IC in Newbie 1619 reprimanded someone for doing this, and provided a much better explanation than I did above. I will try to find it myself, but if anyone wants to look for it, just read SilverWolf's ISO from that game.

For the record, Radiant Cowbell's playstyle is annoying but I don't think it's wise to lynch because of playstyle on day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161201#p7161201\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161201#p7161201\" data-post-id=\"7161201\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 300</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26159\">Davsto</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7160978#p7160978\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7160978#p7160978\" data-post-id=\"7160978\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 288</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19874\">Jake from State Farm</a> wrote:</cite>If he was scum do you honestly think he would be acting irrational and anti-town?</div></blockquote><br>\nIf, in regards to someone, you have to say \"they're so anti-town they must be town\", you should know that something is wrong and that player shouldn't be there to fuck up town.<br>\n<br>\nIf Cowbell is going to act in a way similar to scum, I say we treat him in a way similar to scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161235#p7161235\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161235#p7161235\" data-post-id=\"7161235\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 305</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26159\">Davsto</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161204#p7161204\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161204#p7161204\" data-post-id=\"7161204\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 301</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19874\">Jake from State Farm</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161196#p7161196\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161196#p7161196\" data-post-id=\"7161196\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 299</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26159\">Davsto</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161140#p7161140\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161140#p7161140\" data-post-id=\"7161140\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 296</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7127\">ChaosOmega</a> wrote:</cite>My issue is fencesitting between a policy lynch and a scum read.</div></blockquote><br>\nOkay then, you provide a clear read for Cowbell's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nYeh.<br>\n<br>\nThought not.</div></blockquote><br>\nInability to determine scum or town means he's null. <br>\n<br>\nYou don't Lynch null reads, you investigate or vig  kill them.<br>\n<br>\nYou Lynch scum reads.<br>\n<br>\nThat concludes mafia 101 (checks to make sure we aren't in the newbie forum)</div></blockquote><br>\nBut that's the thing.

So my vote stayed right where it was because after that, we spent pages trying to get Jake to give an inch of ground on anything at all and consequently couldn't climb out of the pissy little hole we'd dug as a town. I found what you did scummy, whereas with Jake I couldn't make up my mind about whether it was scummy or irrelevantly dickish. I don't necessarily like what I've seen from Maganoo, but I need more from him to contextualize it. I'm with Johnny in that I wouldn't lynch a soul till we hear from Optilex again and TheEMC at all.

I think we can eliminate the possibility of Dav being VT or anything else town, since as long as he's town-aligned, there's no good reason to fake claim, right? If he's really the doctor, scum will almost definitely night kill him to prevent his ability from otherwise impairing their plans. Basically, since I think almost everyone scumreads Davsto, we should let the scum do our work for us in the event that we're wrong on Dav.

I am just not comfortable with anything that davsto has done or said all game.  I know he's the medic claim, but I really just get an awful feeling from everything hes said all game.  Hes flop flopped, made votes based on not looking stupid rather than actual reads, and ever since he has claimed medic he is just spewing complete crap in what I can only define as a \"ha ha you can't lynch me\" type of attitude, because he feels safe after the claim.<br>\n<br>\nJester I'm on the fence about, his self hammer comment is anti-town if he is town, and I don't see why he felt the need to jump to such a big conclusion.  I understand that he doesn't want to have to defend himself constantly based on something that happened early game, but he put himself in that position.  Why should town waste a lynch on him because he just doesn't want to have to defend himself?<br>\n<br>\nRC is really showed up over the last few pages and I like what he has had to say.  His attitude towards the game at first was less than desirable, but the stuff that he has posted recently I agree with.  His opinion on monkey seems authentic and not a far stretch, and I must admit that until I read what he had to say about monkey I was giving monkey a town lean.<br>\n<br>\nHCL for me is null. He hasn't done anything to make me read him one way or another right now. I like what he has to say in his posts, but I can't say any of his content is particularly amazing.

Why would he scum hunt if he has his vote on the person he wants to lynch? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7166814#p7166814\">Post 432</a> reads to me as monkey trying to make an excuse for his partner. Saying that davsto's actions make him look noobish.  Finally <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7166998#p7166998\">Post 434</a> rubs me the wrong way. You are basically saying that you are town without outright saying you are town...its pointless comment.  <br>\n<br>\nWith all of that said <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: davsto</span> because there are just too many questions surrounding him, and its just going to be a huge mess if we let him move on to day two.  If he is the medic and he is left alive after N1 without a save are we going to lynch him day 2 or give him another chance because he could still be the medic and potentially get a save N2?  If we put an end to it D-1, we can go back to interactions after he flips to see who pushed the most or who benefited the most from the mislynch if he is medic or who protected and distanced the most if he is scum. I realize that I would look awful if he flips town based on my focus on him, but he isn't helping solve the game at all.<br>\n<br>\nI would be willing to vote Monkey if you guys really really really want to give davsto a night, but I just don't think that is the best idea.", "time": "Sun Aug 23, 2015 9:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

Not only was I the one to make the initial case against Dav, I feel like I've been more than clear that I would very much like to lynch him. I don't know how many times I can explain this, but I just think we have more to gain as a town by sparing him today, because if in the unlikely event that he IS the doctor, scum will have to decide whether they want to risk leaving him alive and possibly having their NK prevented. <br>\n<br>\nAs for your second question, I like my Jester vote, you're next on my list, and I want to take another look at Jake too, especially since in the wake of his tete-a-tete with Dav, there's been almost complete radio silence there. Pulling a Costanza, Jake? Leaving on a high note? But -- like I've stated before -- if by the end of D1 the only thing we can agree on is the scumminess of Dav's behavior &amp; claim, I'd be fine lynching him. I'll put him at L-1, I'll cast the hammer...whatever. <br>\n<br>\nAnd as to the whole \"100 posts old...my recent thought process\" thing: you realize that your rationale for foregoing logic and calling for Davsto's D1 lynch is exactly what Davsto did re: Cowbells, and what Jester did re: Davsto? I'm turning myself into a one-trick pony here, but to me it's quite scummy to preface your vote the way you did: narrate your supposed crisis of faith, then undermine your own case by resting it all on what's essentially policy (\"Well he's anti-town anyway...\").<br>\n<br>\nI would venture to say that ChOmega's earlier point about Davsto is just as applicable to Maganoo in these circumstances:<br>\n(I added the bold.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161140#p7161140\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161140#p7161140\" data-post-id=\"7161140\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 296</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7127\">ChaosOmega</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>free stool sample wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161085#p7161085\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7161085#p7161085\" data-post-id=\"7161085\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 293</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7127\">ChaosOmega</a> wrote:</cite>Sigh...well my town read on Davsto is gone.

Radiant Cowbells mentioned that it seemed like a genuine expression of emotion, but aren't emotional appeals frowned upon in this game? A precedent has been set now where anyone with pressure on them can say \"Well, I'm tired of this- if someone puts me at L-1 I'm gonna hammer and I'm town\" like a sitcom-level petulant teenager. Jester's vote on Davsto was terrible, he deserved to be called out on it. A lot of you from what I remember have unresolved issues from his vote on the A Simple Plan wagon earlier in the day as well. That's two hot sexy wagons he's jumped on that have drawn a notable amount of suspicion. Are we letting him off the hook too easily?<br>\n<br>\nI can understand Monkey Saint's objections to the Davsto lynch, but I think he's discounting the possibility of Davsto lying far too much. I don't think he's scummy though, just a nervous little chimp. He mentions in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7148531#p7148531\">487</a> that he thinks the Davsto case is based on emotion. I think that's a misrepresentation. Davsto's play shows a lot of inconsistency and backpedaling. Perhaps some people are tunneling Davsto (I'm willing to grant that), but I still think he's the best lynch right now.<br>\n<br>\nFSS had a good point about the heat on Monkey Saint (pray for us) and people casting suspicion on him but not voting, but he lost some of his zest when he started misrepresenting quotes. I'm not a fan of that deception to say the least. Why ruin a perfectly good point by being a sneaky pete? It pings on my radar, though. I can see how it would be a subtle way to try and avert the town's attention away from the increasingly imminent Davsto lynch. Now what interest would FSS have in that? He hasn't openly protested the same way Monkey Saint has. He seems to want to maintain his distance from the good doctor. Interesting.<br>\n<br>\nI found the Marvin Manganoo and HavingFitz posts hopping on the spicy hot Davsto wagon bland and derivative. Neither really added anything new to the discussion and kind of just echoed previously expressed sentiments against Disgraced Doctor Davsto. To me, they gave off the impression of just going with the flow. I understand there was a lot to catch up on and Davsto has provided us with ample reason to string him up, but I was hoping for a little more pizzazz. <br>\n<br>\nJake From State Farm's vote on HavingFitz makes no sense at this point in the game. Is it an attempt at humor? Please take the game more seriously, Jake, like the rest of us are.<br>\n<br>\nSo, in concluding, I'm keeping my vote on Davsto but I could be swayed to jump ship to Jester or possibly even FSS.

I can outright confirm I was trying to \"defuse\" the wagon -- you can probably quote me several times saying this. I recommended what I think is the best play when there's a Doc claim D1, which is to put that wagon aside for the day. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7162093#p7162093\">343</a>, I quoted MonkeySaint saying exactly this, and the full rationale of my explanation (which I've been forced to rehash repeatedly) is there for you. So feel free to say that after the doc claim, I tried to defuse the wagon. Just don't make it out to be the product of any critical analysis on your part. It's just an account of what happened. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the Jester wagon, I didn't just \"start\" it out of the blue. Jester predicated his Davsto vote on the same rationale Davsto used to justify his vote on Cowbells, which suggested to me (and should suggest to you) that Jester voted Davsto at that particular time because he calculated that it was the safest time and manner of voting Dav, and not because he legitimately believed Davsto was acting like scum. Jester is still the best wagon out there.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Jester</span>.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the Monkey thing, I think you're failing to take into account that at the time, because of what we only now know to be a fakeclaim, I did not think a vote on Davsto was at all tenable, so I began digging into the Davsto wagon to see why some people were so insistent that we lynch the claimed Doc D1 despite the very obvious and very well-established reasons not to, especially when all three seemed to have other, ostensibly valid scumreads (i.e. Monkey). Just as I was described as \"defending\" Davsto, or trying to \"defuse\" his wagon, I think it's pretty easy to see why I might think that the people on the Dav wagon were being unreasonably obsessive about getting it completion. I mean really, if you're gonna figure anything out, you're gonna have to make some accusations and like Johnny pointed out and we all saw, I missed the context while I was rereading you and I readily admitted that when it was brought up. However, on the other hand, we also all saw that for his vote on Dav, Marvin Maganoo had cobbled together some kind of hybrid of Jester's emotional appeal and Davsto's own \"scum-or-at-least-antitown\" argument. Being that those are two completely mincing and parasitic voting strategies, and it was all supported by opportunistic timing, my scumread on Maganoo stands, and although I think Jester is the better vote, Maganoo isn't far behind for me -- I'd be willing to pursue either for D2. <br>\n<br>\nChOmega, why are you so willing to give Monkey the benefit of the doubt here (\"town believing their actions are right\") when he has voted for FIVE non-Davsto players &amp; laid off Davsto completely? Wouldn't this type of behavior qualify as the type you're voting me for? (via Davsto, i.e. indirectly).

First, how can his scumhunting be garbage if he successfully identified scum? You seem to think his confidence in Davsto being scum means he had some other knowledge the rest of the town didn't have. What about the other people who were convinced Davsto was scum (myself included)? You say a lot of the votes were wishy-washy but I don't see it. Second, RC was on the Davsto wagon before it became the hottest thing in town. There was arguably just as much heat on Jester before, and at times, during the Davsto wagon that scum could attach themselves pretty easily to it. Davsto may have played poorly, but I have a hard time believing that his partner would be bussing him at such a nascent stage especially when there were other viable options. <br>\n<br>\nI think people are too wedded to the bussing thing. We had two lurkers who stayed off the Davsto wagon (TheEMC and A Simple Plan). Why aren't we considering them? Look at the nightkill as well. Jake was one of the most prominent people not voting Davsto. I think it's likely he was killed because he was vocally against the Davsto wagon. As people who weren't on the Davsto wagon get eliminated, it becomes easier to assume that scum were on the wagon. I think it's just as possible that scum were hiding somewhere off of it.", "time": "Mon Aug 31, 2015 3:01 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

I really don't see how anyone can blame me for trying to look into what was happening with the conversation surrounding Monkey and the people who I thought were most invested in it.

If we're going down this road, give me a minute to say some stuff.<br>\n<br>\nMarvin / Fitz scum team is highly unlikely, but there's definitely one between the two of them. Marvin's posts in and of themselves read scummier to me, but we shouldn't ignore fitz's almost complete inability to defend himself. All of his decidedly meager town cred comes from sheeping around, and fashioning himself the harmless bro of any Stool-voter whenever he's pressed about anything. Not sure yet what to make of the fact that the wagon on fitz fell apart almost *instantly* -- who fled it and when? -- but just making a note of it here in case I don't get the chance to dig into that.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough there's a possibility Johnny is (A) a scum goon who (B) did not perform the kill on Jake, my result from last night is a strong point in favor of the near-universal opinion that Johnny is town. I wish I had something more controversial to spill, since I'll likely be accused of resting a scum-gambit on a safe target, but them's the breaks. I also believe Chaos is town, primarily I guess because his case against me is actually good. I'll admit it. I let myself get preoccupied with this idea of a shadow wagon being primed against Monkey (who I also read as town) which is pretty silly in retrospect. I still think my basic idea of this thing was pretty cool, there's just no way it's actually happening in our game. <br>\n<br>\nTo elaborate on the Monkey thing, I've already said that I think most of the suspicion on him has been manufactured by others, more often than not Cowbells. Forgive me this pretension, but the situation with him is a little Kafkaesque. How many times did this happen: Monkey says something, Someone says \"That's bad,\" and then Monkey is forced to defend himself against an unknown charge which in the simple act of acknowledging the accusation, will always read like an admission of guilt. The points against him are all ciphers in my eyes.<br>\n<br>\nHCL is probably town, and that last post/fitz-vote supports that in my opinion. Can't say I have a big read on ASP, and Lynx is entering the game inheriting what I consider a decent basis for a scumread of that slot, but I don't recommend putting him on the defensive until he contributes some self-generated analysis. I've been ambivalent about Cowbells for the duration of the game, and this interchange with Titus doesn't really do much to influence that one way or the other, I'm sad to say. Titus is definitely being theatrical, but I don't see how that could be a scum-tell in itself, and RC has demonstrated himself to be nothing if not protean, so I can't completely reject the idea that RC is mining Titus's net-neutral theatrics for some easy town cred - the kind that is awarded for doing nothing but exercising rationality (and is thus, a little suspect). If theEMC had ever said anything at all, I could see Titus's behavior as a way to cover something up and draw attention to their posts over the original slot-holder's, but he didn't.<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, I'm still more or less at status quo, in that the two people I scumread hard enough to advocate lynching are Marvin &amp; Fitz, but I know it's unlikely that the momentum of this day will change significantly enough to avoid my own lynch. This is difficult to articulate, but when I flip green, remember that Chaos's point about the case against me being similar to the one I'm mounting against Marvin is not a bad point. I obviously know that when it comes to me it's misguided, but don't consider my town-flip a refutation of Chaos's logic.

Lots of interesting turn of events.<br>\n<br>\nInstead of a huge recap or anything, I'm just going to give a quick and general rundown of my feelings on everybody with a possible question or two <br>\n<br>\nattached. Some will get more than other and some won't get questions so don't fret. Feel free to fire away any questions to me as well.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Johnny</div><br>\n<br>\nYou've been active the entire game with some quality, yet concise posts here and there. My main positive read towards you is with Davsto. <br>\n<br>\nWhen you were allegedly day vigged, Davsto egregiously threw out this torrent of Johnny praising posts to bolster his image in case you <br>\n<br>\nflipped town. It was just too obvious to be effective in any manner. Who are you looking at now after leaving Stool with this claim?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Chaos</div><br>\n<br>\nYour early exchanges with Davos using his meta seems genuine. The RC vote by Davos was another terrible attempt to look town. You were pretty stalwart <br>\n<br>\nthroughout Day 1 when the wagon was getting shaky and easy to leave. Like the Day 2 barrage against Stool as well. Do you not buy this claim either <br>\n<br>\nthough?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Marvin</div><br>\n<br>\nMarvin has actually taken some decent heat at points during this game, mainly from Monkey. However, I find his play quite frank and consistent. He's <br>\n<br>\ncarried his quiet and hesitant nature throughout. He was one of the earliest votes on Davsto as well. His Stool vote isn't as strong, but it's in a similar <br>\n<br>\nfashion to the rest of his posts. Marvin's not looking bad in my book. Who's your #2 behind Stool? What about the claim this time?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Henry</div><br>\n<br>\nThought you were coasting a bit early on Day 1. On the other hand, I feel you rebounded nicely with your handling of Davsto. Your original placement of the <br>\n<br>\nvote and subsequent lock in after the claim all work in your favor for me. Further, your Day 2 play has been rational and level-headed. Do you <br>\n<br>\nreally think there is enough content from Titus so far to warrant a vote though? Especially if she hasn't even read the game?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Radiant</div><br>\n<br>\nI actually liked the dayvig gambit and find it to more likely come from town than scum. Your staunch support of a Davos lynch wasn't particularly clear, but <br>\n<br>\nthe way you seem to capriciously change your votes at times would have allowed you to jump from the stalling Davos wagon without much complaint from <br>\n<br>\nanybody. These give me positive vibes.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNow for more suspicious individuals...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Monkey </div> <br>\n<br>\nYou've been pretty wishwashy with your vote. Notably, you've voted JesterLynx, Jake, JesterLynx again, Marvin, Radiant, and lastly Marvin again. The <br>\n<br>\ncircular fashion of voting for both days while avoiding the two main wagons on Davsto and Stool doesn't look particularly good in my eyes. I don't find  <br>\n<br>\nMarvin to be the worst vote on either wagon. Like Johnny said, I kind of feel like you're pursuing easy targets.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Stool </div><br>\n<br>\nIm assuming you're possibly tracker? For me, you're one of the worst Davsto lynchers. To your credit, you were on the wagon the earliest, yet you were <br>\n<br>\nnever really pushing strongly for his lynch. In fact, you never even really mentioned Davsto until he questioned you about it. The fact that you hammered <br>\n<br>\nafter trying to the defuse the wagon is troubling. This is made worse by the fact that if you are a tracker you could have just targeted Davsto at night. In <br>\n<br>\nthat way there is absolutely no reason for someone from your standpoint to kill him even if it was inevitable as you say. Lastly, why target Johnny over <br>\n<br>\nsomeone like myself who you were suspicious of during later day 1?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">HavingFitz</div><br>\n<br>\nAnother of the weaker Davsto lynchers. Unlike the others who I mentioned had opportunity to jump ship at little cost, you're vote came at a point where the <br>\n<br>\nDavsto lynch seemed nearly to be a foregone conclusion. Day 2, you've been pushing and pushing this Stool Wagon and it's disheartening that you've barely <br>\n<br>\nmentioned anyone else today like at all. Your role model, Chaos, has at least mentioned Marvin in his bashing of Stool to pieces. Could you give me another <br>\n<br>\nsuspicious candidate you're feeling?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNull reads following<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Simple Plan</div><br>\n<br>\nThough you were here from the start, I feel like you've been absent during some key events in late Day 1 and earlier Day 2 that have stymied my read on <br>\n<br>\nyou so far. I'm not minding the recent Fitz vote though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Titus</div><br>\n<br>\nYou're new to the game so far just like me so its hard to have a firm grasp on you yet. I'd like to hear some reasoning behind definitely thinking Stool is <br>\n<br>\ntown even now with this claim being put forward.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBetween Stool, Monkey, and Fitz, the people I'm most suspicious about, I'll wait on Stool for the time being to process the claim and other reactions to it. <br>\n<br>\nThis leaves Monkey and Fitz for me as lead suspects. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: MonkeySaint</span><br>\n<br>\nI want to see where Fitz play goes with this recent claim.", "time": "Tue Sep 08, 2015 5:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

I did find two posts where you expand on where you stand with certain players (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7168727#p7168727\">533</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179557#p7179557\">552</a>. The only person I see you go after with some real substance is Jake From State Farm who is dead now. You tell both Monkey Saint and FSS that you would support their lynch as \"an alternative to Davsto\" based on sentiments already articulated by other players but that's the furthest it goes. Seems to me like a poor attempt to appear like you have reads on players other than Davsto who was at that point the consensus lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Defining Lazy</div>- In order to define lazy, we must first understand lazy. We must analyze lazy and what makes it so ...lazy. Lazy is you voted Davsto after 1 paragraph on your 4th post of the game and sat there while only presenting superficial suspicions. Your first post of today was a vote on FSS (conveniently one of two you would have supported as the alternate lynch to Davsto on day 1 but did nothing about) and you've spent the majority of the day making posts that literally end with \"vote stool\" until it became clear stool wouldn't flush down the toilet so easily.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"Hyperbole much?</div>- Well, Chandler, I addressed a lot of my issue with this in my last post. You seem to be trying to silence other posters's legitmate non-stool leads with your \"vote stool\" strategy. It's certainly not scummy to try to win other people over to voting your top scum suspect, but you're doing it in a very scummy way.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Preclaim support of stool wagon</div>- In all honesty, I find this irrelevant. Stool got heat all yesterday for his convoluted Davsto defense. You even hopped on the Stool heat, albeit in a rather passive way. You were setting up going after Stool today, and this is only confirmed by your first-post vote of him with no explanation. Further, it makes sense that you would disbelieve a Stool town power role claim today given the fact that Davsto's doctor claim didn't do him any favors.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7208694#p7208694\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7208694#p7208694\" data-post-id=\"7208694\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 753</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26478\">Monkey Saint</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7205687#p7205687\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7205687#p7205687\" data-post-id=\"7205687\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 705</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25521\">HenryCabotLodge</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nYou criticized me for not casting a vote right away, now your attacking Marvin for making a vote right away.

Granted that Johnny was a pretty safe bet on town purely going from Day 1 at that point. If Johnny just happened to be a PR, then Stool would have been finished.

Under the scrutiny of several players over his previous claim reaction, it seems like just more of an attempt to remain consistent with his previous Davsto suspicion. Still not a fan of the Fitz here.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also concerned with how often Stool and Monkey have been paired together with their voting on Jester/Me, Marvin, and now fitz. Along with the few instances I recall where Stool has spoken up for Monkey. I don't think a scum pair would be so overt with collective voting or speaking favorably for each other. I do think their is a reasonable chance that one of the two is scum though.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the Titus/RC back and forth. I have a pretty hard grasp getting a grasp on the situation with to the constant references to other games which I wouldn't personally bother perusing. Mostly due to my reads through Davsto, I tend to favor RC between the two. Didn't like sticking up for Stool from Titus with little explanation either. <br>\n<br>\nRC, Johnny, Henry, and chaos have all voted or expressed an acceptance of a possible Titus lynch. I just haven't seen enough content from her that would yield an informative lynch. Like I previously mentioned, the mutual tunneling from her and RC haven't revealed much to me other than a shared animosity between the two.<br>\n<br>\nStill want to hear from Monkey, Fitz, and simple plan before adding anything else.", "time": "Thu Sep 10, 2015 9:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

Fitz, you straight up buy RC's explanation that he really thought you were a cop? You jump through hoops to differentiate RC's lies from \"scum lies\" but in the end it's mostly ex post facto reasoning that falls back on the same nebulous WIFOM-soup that RC is so good at cooking up. What about the possibility that RC's dayvig gambit could have outed a PR? Basically you're trying to say lying is okay when nothing bad comes of it, which doesn't really address the fact that you think scum are more likely to lie in general at all. You can't maintain your original position while defending RC, it just doesn't work.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I think happened with this cop-neighborhood thing is that RC's gambit was intended to establish a firm disconnect between he and fitz. RC had a great track record at that point of being given free passes to play as recklessly and inscrutably as he wanted, so he figured no one would hold the lying against him, and Fitz responding incredulously was basically a given at this point. <br>\n<br>\nA Monkey lynch would be a really hard sell for me. #1, I think he's town, and (presuming my read of him is correct of course) if we're gonna call for the lynch of a townie I think you guys could get a lot more info by lynching me than Monkey. I've already used my 1-shot ability, so there's that -- plus in my eyes, my townflip would damn Fitz pretty thoroughly. Obviously, I'd prefer we skip that step and go right to lynching Fitz today rather than tomorrow, but with hardly 2 days to go before deadline, I understand if you've gotta go through me to get to him. <br>\n<br>\nSo overall, I'd be onboard with lynching Fitz or RC today. Marvin's disappearance rustles my jimmies, cause if I'm wrong about this connection* between fitz &amp; RC, Marvin is still my outside candidate, and I will add that ASP's recent vote didn't look right to me, but there's not nearly enough time left in the day to pursue that, especially considering what seems to be going on in his life at the moment...<br>\n<br>\n*Or the belaboring of a non-connection, if you prefer to call it that.", "time": "Fri Sep 11, 2015 5:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

This would have made 6, but one of those Monkey votes is RC, who parked his vote on Titus before replacing out, so it shouldn't really count. <br>\n<br>\nSo as it stands now, we don't have enough voters for a majority on anyone, but both a Titus wagon and a Monkey wagon would only need one more voter to go through. I guess since I wasn't on either of those two my pledge would give us enough to lynch either. <br>\n<br>\nSo in my mind, it's basically for me to decide between Monkey and Titus -- two people I'd prefer not to vote at all, but for very different reasons. To answer Johnny's question about why I townread Monkey, I'll try to sum it up. Monkey has taken a number of difficult positions - not as in reachy, but as in he maintains a focus on investigation when it would be easier to go the populist route. Recent example is the \"Only an idiot would vote their top suspect all day\" post -- it's scumbaiting for sure, but as a position it also holds up against scrutiny. Most of the time, Monkey seems far more interested in scumhunting and getting info for the town than he does in self-preservation and it's really hard to find that scummy. On the reverse side of the equation, it seems like hardly anyone ever discusses why Monkey's posts are scummy. Everyone just says \"That was gross\" or \"Monkey's post was bad,\" then other people agree, and then that's it. If the case against Monkey is that he's avoided the two major wagons, then I don't think there's much of a case at all. He didn't \"avoid\" Davsto -- like me, he thought it best to give the doctor claim a night on principle. <br>\n<br>\nIn the case of Titus, I really don't like how heavily she leans on the \"If I was scum, why would I [fill in the blank]\" defense, and as others have noted, unvoting RC when he decided to replace out without other provocation really undermines the integrity of that vote in retrospect. Even looking back now, I can't figure out why Titus unvoted. However, RC is one of my top scumreads, and to vote Titus I'd have to vote for the same player as RC which just seems like a mistake to me. After what happened, the possibility that both RC and Titus are scum is so small -- the only thing I can think of is that maybe they legitimately hate each other and each was trying to bus the other? Million to one odds on that though, so basically, for me to vote Titus would be to vote under the pretense that one of my scumreads is wrong. <br>\n<br>\nTL;DR -- If I voted Titus, I'm voting under the pretense one of my scumreads is wrong, and if I vote Monkey, I'm voting under the pretense one of my townreads is wrong. Statistically, it's objectively more likely that I'm wrong about scum than about town, so although I'd definitely prefer to vote someone else entirely, I have to go with Titus over Monkey. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Titus</span><br>\n<br>\nObviously if other people decide to change their vote prospects, I'm not at all married to this vote. This is all based on Lynx's calculations. Plus my own calculations could be off. I don't know, it's very late.

Fitz on the otherhand, I am familiar with. My last two games with him, he presented logical cases and was aggressive early on but most of his reads were wrong.

Also, in 125 he listed Jester, Davs, and Johnny as for sure containing a scum withing the three. He then never voted them nor really pushed any suspicions on them. This looks to me like he tossed a scummate's name in with two town in order to give himself some flex room, either to look back and go \"told ya so\" or \"well, I said one of the three\" depending how it went. <br>\n<br>\nTitus was so sure Stool was obvtown and voted him really begrudgingly. Their push for Chaos was weird as many had her as a strong townread. They then died that night. I could believe Titus was trying to save their last scummate, thus hardpushing that their claim makes them obvtown. That and the potential wine of \"Why would I kill Omega? I was scumreading them!\" make me raise an eyebrow. The only thing that has me hesitating is that I know Titus is better than to defend a scummate so overtly.<br>\n<br>\nDirefire hasn't really done anything since replacing in. They asked me a couple times for reads, soft-defended FSS, and tried to push Sonic upon arrival. This is their only vote to date and it happened right in the middle of the FSS wagon. They're the best candidate for scum I can see.<br>\n<br>\nFitz was so anti-Stool I can't see them being scummates. If so, that was some ruthless insistence on their being lynched when it really wasn't necessary. Other than that he's been well rounded in asking questions and thorough with his answers.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I'm going to change my list order: Direfire, ASP, Titus.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Direfire</span>", "time": "Wed Sep 23, 2015 7:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}

He just took his almost universal townread and slinked into the shadows.<br>\nWhen called out for this by Fitz, rather than defend himself, he took it to a personal level to discredit Fitz.<br>\n<br>\nHis hammer on ASP called back to a D1 read, almost as if to say \"come on guys, I've had this read all game\" as a defense when ASP flipped town.<br>\n<br>\nD5 in the TvT between Titus and Sonic he sidelined so hard it's actually ridiculous. He just sat back and watched, barely even mentioning anything game related, as if not wanting to interfere in it.<br>\n<br>\nI see zero town motivation to any of this. This here is our scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf we look at Fitz in the VCA, he was late on Davsto and early on FSS, which is possible scum bussing. He does, however, push for FSS' lynch far harder than I would expect any teammate to do. I mean, if you're pushing hard enough to make people think you have a guilty on scum, that's a fucking hard push! Scum tend not to bus like that. They'd rather let someone else start the wagon super hard and sheep early on, but with individual confidence. Which was admittedly what he did on D3, but that didn't feel like a bus to me.<br>\n<br>\nIn days 4 &amp; 5 he was far more of a presence than Johnny was, not just waiting for a wagon to hammer, but making his own stance and sticking to it. He gets huge points for being on Johnny despite the Metal/Titus argument. I wish he'd been there and pushing it a little more, as he did seem to use it to avoid the main conversation, but that's about all I've got against him.<br>\n<br>\nJohnny has to be the final scum. If not, You've duped me again Fitz.<br>\nI swore I wouldn't let a repeat of A Game of Pokes happen. If you've done it again, then I really have to get better at sorting you!<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: JohnnyFarrar</span>", "time": "Tue Oct 13, 2015 5:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63042&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "63042"}
