Character affects it and it's not necessarily always so because it's such a basic thing to SR people on and scum has a brain too with which to avoid things that are really commonly acknowledged as scumtells, which I think defensiveness is. But it can be scummy, because scum care more about being voted than town. How is my fading in confidence scummy though? I might have been less confident towards the end because everyone seemed to be at odds with me, and I started feeling like I might have been spazzing out with a lot of the things I said, even if I still knew I was town.

I really don't like 459 and don't like that shannon, another person I'm not TRing, gives points for that kind of post later on. 460/463 seem like really FoS-style posts on Rabbit but you never vote him or follow up on it yourself, you just let me and rabbit go at it.

I'm not going to vote someone for obvious shit posting and filler when they claimed they would play serious today. They have yet to deliver though and today at least EST time is basically over so my suspicion has gone up, but I mean other then what I just said, there isn't a case on Iron. My vote is going to remain on Drealm until my questions get answered, someone scums it up more than him in my eyes, or I have to compromise. <br><br>My comments on Fluffy is just a thing I do where I select notes I have taken that I feel are worth putting out there for discussion or potentially the most relevant<br><br>Shannon is just a meta read honestly and rb's silence is a bit worrying. Almost seems like he's laid low to take the heat off him.</div></blockquote><br><br>So that could be true in most of these cases from my notes. Something I didn't really consider when I read before though, but I'm definitely thinking now, is that maybe you're scum looking for a town member who has a pretty good scum case against them, so that you can get onto their wagon. It doesn't change the fact that your vote seemed to just park on drealmerz for ages and you seemed to be okay with putting that off, which is why I waited to reserve judgment, but now you're talking like you never agreed to do that and he's the one avoiding you. My mistake on the Impo vote, you outed suspicion a couple of times and 442 reads to me like you were explaining why your vote was on her, but I see now that it wasn't.<br><br>I get that you know shannon b/c of both of your posts in RVS so that's something that could be passing but I'm not feeling that really. rb is back now but isn't very convincing so he's still fair game in my book.<br><br>Problem with 459 for me is that it's something that shouldn't have to be posted. Town shouldn't be putting a vote on someone who can't respond to it because of V/LA sort of situations. If anything you keep quiet and see how many people are willing to put their votes on him because there's sure to be scum on that kind of wagon if it gets to 3-4 people. Like I said before I also don't like seeing shannon giving you towncred for it later because I don't think it's a post deserving of that. It's thickening a team association between two players that I'm not TRing, which makes them look more suspicious to me as individuals as well.<br><br>I think it's important for you and Drealmerz to talk about that potential misunderstanding from earlier asap. rb's posts have not looked very driven so far, more like he's coasting through. I want to decide between the 2 of you today because I don't think that a shannon lynch right now would be useful if she flipped town. She hasn't really posted enough yet I think. Depending on how iron keeps on he might come back into my lynchpool, but I'm sort of feeling town from him despite his rudeness."}

Does this make sense?</div></blockquote><br>Tbh I don't quite understand this post, especially the part about confirmation bias. I'm curious as to who all you think was outwardly scumreading you and then flipped though just so there's a list of people to look at. I know Transcend, rabbit, LUV and I are on that list as people suspecting you, and I know Trans and I voted you, not sure on others without double-checking.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8562481#p8562481\" class=\"postlink\">post 739</a>, Impoetic wrote:</cite>Like, I can imagine that getting pressure off me helped me not seem hyperdefensive because, well, duh, but there's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">also</span> rabbit's scene, and that seems more concrete than any of the tells you've been describing.

IIRC i have literally no votes on me now. That's like, 5-0. in a short space of time.<br><br>No, not all the flips can be mafia; I just think some of them probably are, and I felt like drone was potentially one of the scummier ones.</div></blockquote><br>This part makes sense. I don't know if I agree on drone yet since I haven't really looked into what everyone was thinking of you specifically, but if you get that list of people that you think flipped I'd be down to go through it and try to find scum motivation in the flips. It seems likely that at least one person voting/suspecting you then flipping would have been scummy, unless scum was just scratching their ass with their votes parked on drealmerz which seems really unlikely that all 3 of them are scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8562496#p8562496\" class=\"postlink\">post 740</a>, Impoetic wrote:</cite>Also not being hyperdefensive because of fewer votes is a chicken/egg scenario, because clearly some of the people who unvoted did not unvote for that, and it seems like most of htem claim not to.<br><br>There's also an odd consensus on the reasons people have been using for why i'm scum/town respectively. Again, no argument i've seen for either side has been substantial enough to make me think \"jeeze, i would connect with this if i didn't have my alignment confirmed to me ahead of time\" and \"it totally makes sense that there's so little conflict on my alignment.\"<br><br>I guess that's it. Lack of conflict. Everyone agrees. That's not what I've seen in the past, and it could jsut be coincidence, but to me it seems the simplest (possibly too simple) conclusion is that some of the votes are not genuine sentiments.</div></blockquote><br>This last bit I agree with, but I don't think the conclusion is too simple. I don't believe in coincidence and it seems highly unlikely that everyone voting/suspecting you was town the whole time<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8562507#p8562507\" class=\"postlink\">post 741</a>, Impoetic wrote:</cite>*not a chicken/egg scenario but you know what i mean<br><br>oh frick i'm quadrupleposting sorry ):<br><br>anyway, i wanted to point out that town can sheep logic/be swayed by popular consensus too, and I understand that is a possible scenario. So yeah okay votes can either be town or scum.<br><br>I'll have to review it i suppose. Or look up VCA, because I don't think improvising completely is a good strategy. Or just stop and look elsewhere.</div></blockquote><br>While town sheeping is possible I again think it would be too unlikely if 5(?) town members read a 6(?)th town member as scum without any scum in the pack. Scum join in the pack against town to give townspeople more of a pack mentality when reading someone who is actually town as scum. When a townsperson sees a lot of votes on someone they TR have to start thinking about the possibility that maybe they're wrong because why are so many people SRing my TR? Scum have too much motivation to SR you if you're town when the suspicion starts to get heavier for them to resist doing it. If you're really town then there are surely scum who flipped off of SRing you."}

He tries to discredit an already weak drealmerz vote, which I think is an overreaction to what is probably a weak SR. He mentions the game being boring and him being disinterested in the game a couple of times in there. I don't do meta reads that are presented to me so idc about the image macro tell that people are talking about, nor have I read any of the example games posted. <br><br>He tells people to vote me on 3 separate occasions, then when he reaches 4 votes on himself he suddenly forgets why he was ever SRing me and switches onto TTTT. Once everyone besides TTTT get off of it he turns to buddying the last person left on his wagon. I think the only reason rb dropped me down his priority lynches is because it seemed unlikely I would be lynched since Transcend TRs me. Not sure if it was before or after the announcing of the \"block\". He still wanted to vote Sesq/Drealmerz&gt;Me&gt;Impo, because the first 2 of us were the ones that flipped off his wagon and Impo was the strongest wagon at the time (at 3 votes). I think him putting my name on that list between his SRs was an attempt to look consistent and still set up to later vote Impo if she dug herself any deeper. He mentions a second time in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8551738#p8551738\">262</a> that he forgot why he was SRing me in the first place, which looks like he's trying to disassociate himself from it.<br><br>I just don't see him flipping town."}

Not sure if it was before or after the announcing of the \"block\". He still wanted to vote Sesq/Drealmerz&gt;Me&gt;Impo, because the first 2 of us were the ones that flipped off his wagon and Impo was the strongest wagon at the time (at 3 votes). I think him putting my name on that list between his SRs was an attempt to look consistent and still set up to later vote Impo if she dug herself any deeper. He mentions a second time in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8551738#p8551738\">262</a> that he forgot why he was SRing me in the first place, which looks like he's trying to disassociate himself from it.<br><br>I just don't see him flipping town.</div></blockquote><br>he wants to hurt you with pointy objects... sheesh!"}

I'm making a read.  You've not been towny all Day, but then you came to L-1 and you're here and playing fine.  BP doesn't play this way.  It's the only way I can read it.  If personal life is making you play anti-town to the point where it is making you leading wagon and you're on your way to lynch but you can't play because of personal life - you sub out."}

I.e. if your softclaim was true it'd be worse for us to lose the JK than for us to miss lynching you as scum on D1.

I don't get (at all) how you thought that claiming your role as a counter to RB could be more useful for town than simply saying you don't believe his claim. Your claim hasn't painted his in any worse light.

Something I pointed out below.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8551957#p8551957\" class=\"postlink\">post 287</a>, ssbm_Kyouko wrote:</cite>His comment on rb not considering that he is a good scum player is implying that rb knows Mr. T is not scum, which implies that rb is scum.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>rb drops off of the map for a while (47 hours, but one of those days is a Sunday) after replying to my 287 and comes back with one of his \"I'm bored\" posts. As I said in 849 at the top of this post I was hoping to see improvement in rb upon his return, but I didn't see that. Post-claim rb looks like he's trying and maybe he's town but I still think the claim is fake and I wish he would have tried sooner than this. If he turns out to be town maybe he's right about Sesq. I SRed Sesq really early on but ended up dropping that a while back. She's not really convincing me she's town but as long as she's on rb when he's lynched and he flips scum she'll be looking a bit better to me.<br><br>Lastly, I think rb is a necessary lynch because of the WIFOM his claim presents to town in LyLo/MyLo. If he is never NKed we're stuck wondering if he was really BP the whole time and that's why he never died, or if he was scum lying about being BP in the first place to cover up for why he was never dying at night. In order to guarantee a flip and see if he was lying he has to be lynched. Alternatively, a cop could check him, but there is no guarantee we even have a cop.

The only problem with his slot (as far as I've noticed while I've been focusing on the LUV/rb/shannon dynamic) is that both he and Kohai lay way too low. If rb flips scum I think LUV is a clear shot that way we can move on to the third scum. I think LUV is probably scum regardless of rb's alignment at this point. It's either whiteknighting and buddying or scum blatantly obstructing the lynch of scum.<br><br>If we have a cop, Transcend or Sesq are probably the best checks in a town!rb scenario. Gerry could be a check too but if he's town he would be hard to defend tomorrow without claiming and that feels like a waste of cop's power. Let Gerry defend himself if he's really been town this whole time, don't sac yourself for him. LUV is pretty much scum in a scum!rb scenario but if the cop doesn't believe that they could check him. I've been pointing at that team since we got out of RVS I feel like, I know the first post in my notes that tips me off is around posts 74-87 from the two of them. People are finally starting to agree now I feel. Once rb is dead we can see what Gerry does as far as scumhunting because he basically replaced into a gamestate where it was him or rb so ofc he would voting rb today. If he stays as low key tomorrow as he/his slot has so far he's probably a good lynch, but tbf Sesq has laid just as low. It just hasn't been as obvious because he's not in TTTT's scumpool from way back when, and he's been voting the players in that pool as well, so he looks more town to me and probably the rest of the townblock because of that.<br><br>If rb flips scum, TTTT and ironstove are probably the best checks. Maybe Drone, I'm not so sure of him. I've mostly taken my eye off him for now because Transcend says he's town and there are much more clear cases available right now. Maybe he's the third in rb/LUV or rb/TTTT but I don't see that yet so this is all speculation on him.<br><br>Also I keep getting D1ed and N1ed so Transcend put me in the dog house tonight I really like this game  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">"}

Its also an assumption about the setup and would point fingers at potential town PRs so I will not discuss this part of my theory until those potential PRs claim naturally. I still stand by the team associations I've been talking about for a while, but I'm not sure if I ever quoted them and I'm also not sure if it was more of a mutual thing or if it was rb trying to make LUV look like LUV was a scum buddy. If it was the latter it would be a ploy to take a town with him but LUVs actions towards the end of the rb wagon look like a panicked scum. I think he ditched the wagon because he thought that one of the counter wagons was going to gain traction, but it never did. I'm surprised he didn't hammer rb to try to gain some points back though. I'm going to be focused on another game first tonight but I may bring up a case on LUV and where he's associated with rb if it's not already in my ISO after that game.<br><br>Gerry's activity is disappointing but in my limited experience this is his town game. I don't tr him though because I don't know his scum game and they may be similar, and his low activity is not pro-town. I also don't place much stock in secondhand meta in general and that's most of my Gerry experience.<br><br>I dislike his scumreads because one of them was pushing a counter wagon to scum on the other yesterday, and the other is one of my own top TRs.

I'd say it's safe to assume in a Normal game that BP can't be roleblocked. when JK jails RB and RB blocks JK in Matrix6, the jailing gets blocked and thus if the RB performs the kill that night it will succeed (unless he targets the 1-shot BP townie).

Strongman seems the most likely but we can't discount the possibility that mafia also have a JOAT to balance out the town JOAT. If so it would be standard for them to have a Ninja 1-shot as well, assuming they used their Strongman last night on Transcend. Also assuming that LUV is not lying about receiving Tracker information it would make sense for Mafia to have some sort of Ninja on their team. This could be in the form of two separate Mafia members (a strongman and a ninja and a goon) or a single JOAT and 2 goons.

So it never got further than three votes because people kept leaving instead of pushing it. <br><br>Second, those of us not on Gerry didn't want to join the wagon. RB I suppose was worried about looking worse for being opportunistic. I was stubbornly on Transcend. Titus's vote I have no idea about. LUV is kinda suspicious in note voting, and so is Impoetic who <span class=\"noboldsig\">never bloody votes</span>. <br><br>So that's it. If there's scum on the Gerry wagon, they're caught between trying to push that wagon and being seen to be on the RB one. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8580880#p8580880\" class=\"postlink\">post 1245</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">VC 1.31</legend>:!: <span class=\"noboldsig\">rb (5)</span>: Transcend, drealmerz7, ssbm_Kyouko, Sesq, gerryoat <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">-- L-2!</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">gerryoat (3)</span>: TTTT, ironstove, Drone<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TTTT (1)</span>: Titus<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Transcend (1)</span>: shannon<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sesq (1)</span>: rb<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT VOTING (2)</span>: Impoetic, Lil Uzi Vert<br><br>With 13 alive it takes 7 to lynch.<br><br>Deadline is in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2016-12-10 12:30:00)</span></span></fieldset><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Impoetic is V/LA until the 4th.</span></span></span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8584126#p8584126\" class=\"postlink\">post 1321</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">VC 1.32</legend>:!: <span class=\"noboldsig\">rb (6)</span>: Transcend, drealmerz7, ssbm_Kyouko, Sesq, gerryoat, ironstove <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">-- L-1!</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">gerryoat (2)</span>: TTTT, Drone<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TTTT (1)</span>: Titus<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Transcend (1)</span>: shannon<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sesq (1)</span>: rb<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT VOTING (2)</span>: Impoetic, Lil Uzi Vert<br><br>With 13 alive it takes 7 to lynch.<br><br>Deadline is in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2016-12-10 12:30:00)</span></span></fieldset><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Someone please bring me coffee.

I really like this observation from him so I'm back to feeling better about his alignment. Titus blatantly lying about Drone and justifying it by saying it's ancient history as if it's Day 4 and not Day 2 makes me think  think the likelihood of the chances of D7 being her partner is very slim. I also don't like the recent little back and forth she had with Sesq. As fun as cat fights can be, I didn't get a town vibe from the questions she asked Sesq. Felt like scum trying to shift the attention away from the bigger picture. So in short, no, I'm not scum reading Impoetic anymore. Could you explain your theory on her being scum again? <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Shannon:</span> Your push on Transcend got fairly drowned out don't you think? Outside of Kyouko's notes, no one was really scum reading you outside of Transcend. I don't remember it ever being a big thing. You also have to remember, my reasoning for TR you was based on meta and that's not always a strong enough reason for a TR a majority of the time. As for why I joined the D7 wagon (interesting to know you started it as most people probably thought I did by how strongly I wanted to lynch him. another example of how under the radar you've been!) is because of my case I gave on him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8551125#p8551125\">180</a>.<br><br>I don't get your Impoetic vote, it seems like you're scum reading Iron more there."}

The fact that iamafluffyrabbit stepped in to question Impoetic and form his own read on her looked really town by both of them, but it could have all been rehearsed and I remember making a mental note about it that if one of them ever started acting scummy it would nullify that initial read of the other and make me more suspicious of them as potential partners"}

If shannon gerry and rb is the team, and rb gets lynched, do you really see gerry performing the NK when he's the #2 suspect behind rb at end of day?

This leaves the possbility that their could be 1 or 0 scum among them. If shannon were scum I'd say gerry is a likely partner but shannon being scum makes LUV town, which makes their claim true. If shannon gerry and rb is the team, and rb gets lynched, do you really see gerry performing the NK when he's the #2 suspect behind rb at end of day? Rhetorical question, the answer is no, shannon would do that kill, but LUV saw her go nowhere. I seriously doubt shannon somehow was a strongman and a ninja in the same night, so I'd say the chances of shannon being the 1 scum here are slim. Assuming LUV is the scum seems like an easy way for scum to push a mislynch off of my suspicions in D1.

This leaves the possbility that their could be 1 or 0 scum among them. If shannon were scum I'd say gerry is a likely partner but shannon being scum makes LUV town, which makes their claim true. If shannon gerry and rb is the team, and rb gets lynched, do you really see gerry performing the NK when he's the #2 suspect behind rb at end of day? Rhetorical question, the answer is no, shannon would do that kill, but LUV saw her go nowhere. I seriously doubt shannon somehow was a strongman and a ninja in the same night, so I'd say the chances of shannon being the 1 scum here are slim. Assuming LUV is the scum seems like an easy way for scum to push a mislynch off of my suspicions in D1. Nobody seems to be listening to what LUV is saying lately, which makes me think his wagon now is scum-driven. Look at Gerry posting about once a day to do nothing other than remind us to lynch LUV.

I think scum are generally more involved than VTs? And have a more urgent motivation to not get lynched by PoE/lurk. It might be antitown for people to lurk overall, hence the ideal world comment, but yeah. I don't see how it's inherent that lurking=scummy, and I feel like that's a really easy way to write off an FoS and not put pressure on yourself for it."}

Then with the appeal that other people want titus so it's good she revotes because she wants proper responses from the slot.<br>Shannon herself never actually asked titus any questions. She didn't go into detail as to what info she wants; i.e. pressuring her. She votes her on the nebulous \"more info\" to sort of sheep, but doesn't have specifics she's interested in... what does shannon want here? Titus at this point has given reads, several directions where she wants to push and somewhat self-consistent VCA even if you hate it. What you do next if you're interested is pick it apart and go into why it's not good and your personal thinking as to why it's scummy. If shannon were interested I think she'd engage titus and ask about each of these but I don't think she genuinely was.<br><br>Titus then claims and shannon unvotes without much comment (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8612650#p8612650\">1646</a>), and asks for more info on the neighbour claims (1713) along with a brief summary as to why titus is being wagoned, though moreso facts than much of shannon's stance or opinion. Before in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8616548#p8616548\">1794</a> finally saying she should be lynched if she's still alive tomorrow...<br>I don't see critical analysis beyond setup stuff or actual scumhunting at any point here, since then just role and future speculation comments via titus/luv.<br><br>What I also don't get too is why shannon lost her townread on the slot here either. If you remember fluffyrabbit day 1 was actually shannon's strongest expressed townread in the game which shannon made a huge deal out of, and shannon made a post recognising that titus replaced her so there is no benefit of the doubt. Unless she is the type of player to completely throw out a read after replacement this townread backtrack looks just like the impoetic one.<br><br>Finally there's the <span class=\"noboldsig\">gerryoat</span> vote which is naked but shannon does talk about him earlier, as to why his wagon didn't go anywhere (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8606069#p8606069\">1575</a>). The thing is the gist of shannon's theory there isn't a case for gerryoat scum, it's an explanation as to why there was no strong counterwagon to rb, and the reasoning was because gerryoat was that counter, scum where already on him and that's why it didn't take off, i.e. gerryoat town. It's not a case for gerryoat scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8607367#p8607367\">1593</a> that becomes a bad thing though for gerry (???) and especially it's weird because shannon herself opposed the rb wagon but didn't go onto gerryoat, so I feel like she herself having a problem with that is odd given she even seems partially responsible.<br>Kyoukyo has his own case and theories regarding association shannon like-sort-of agrees with in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8616530#p8616530\">1793</a> but I highly doubt shannon has any of those same thought processes (uhhhhh) rather than just agreeing for the sake of voting. I might be missing something about this particular read given it's recency though.<br><br>Basically I don't see shannon think in-depth about the game for any read or show critical thinking, and when she does explain things I see inconsistencies and have a lot of trouble trying to understand her point of view. She appears to join wagons based on if they're already gaining traction (except for transcend, where people expliclty asked why she and non-voters in general weren't voting) rather than take any independent action, and doesn't put much effort questioning or engaging her scumreads (transcend, titus). Finally when a previous townread of her becomes a potential wagon that townread isn't mentioned again and seem to sort of disappear."}

Based on kyoukyos theory in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8602432#p8602432\">1531</a> shannon votes titus for being obtuse and \"for info\". Nothing wrong with pressure though this still isn't scumhunting, but follow this read through:<br>she unvotes titus inexplicably to go back to impoetic (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8604201#p8604201\">1557</a>) and in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8607367#p8607367\">1593</a> comments<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>D7 is probably my strongest town read and he wants Titus. LUV has supposedly cleared me, and he wants Titus. SSBM made that interesting point yesterday about the Impoetic/Rabbit(Titus) interactions.

Then with the appeal that other people want titus so it's good she revotes because she wants proper responses from the slot.<br>Shannon herself never actually asked titus any questions. She didn't go into detail as to what info she wants; i.e. pressuring her. She votes her on the nebulous \"more info\" to sort of sheep, but doesn't have specifics she's interested in... what does shannon want here? Titus at this point has given reads, several directions where she wants to push and somewhat self-consistent VCA even if you hate it. What you do next if you're interested is pick it apart and go into why it's not good and your personal thinking as to why it's scummy. If shannon were interested I think she'd engage titus and ask about each of these but I don't think she genuinely was.<br><br>Titus then claims and shannon unvotes without much comment (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8612650#p8612650\">1646</a>), and asks for more info on the neighbour claims (1713) along with a brief summary as to why titus is being wagoned, though moreso facts than much of shannon's stance or opinion. Before in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8616548#p8616548\">1794</a> finally saying she should be lynched if she's still alive tomorrow...<br>I don't see critical analysis beyond setup stuff or actual scumhunting at any point here, since then just role and future speculation comments via titus/luv.<br><br>What I also don't get too is why shannon lost her townread on the slot here either. If you remember fluffyrabbit day 1 was actually shannon's strongest expressed townread in the game which shannon made a huge deal out of, and shannon made a post recognising that titus replaced her so there is no benefit of the doubt. Unless she is the type of player to completely throw out a read after replacement this townread backtrack looks just like the impoetic one.<br><br>Finally there's the <span class=\"noboldsig\">gerryoat</span> vote which is naked but shannon does talk about him earlier, as to why his wagon didn't go anywhere (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8606069#p8606069\">1575</a>). The thing is the gist of shannon's theory there isn't a case for gerryoat scum, it's an explanation as to why there was no strong counterwagon to rb, and the reasoning was because gerryoat was that counter, scum where already on him and that's why it didn't take off, i.e. gerryoat town. It's not a case for gerryoat scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8607367#p8607367\">1593</a> that becomes a bad thing though for gerry (???) and especially it's weird because shannon herself opposed the rb wagon but didn't go onto gerryoat, so I feel like she herself having a problem with that is odd given she even seems partially responsible.<br>Kyoukyo has his own case and theories regarding association shannon like-sort-of agrees with in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8616530#p8616530\">1793</a> but I highly doubt shannon has any of those same thought processes (uhhhhh) rather than just agreeing for the sake of voting. I might be missing something about this particular read given it's recency though.<br><br>Basically I don't see shannon think in-depth about the game for any read or show critical thinking, and when she does explain things I see inconsistencies and have a lot of trouble trying to understand her point of view. She appears to join wagons based on if they're already gaining traction (except for transcend, where people expliclty asked why she and non-voters in general weren't voting) rather than take any independent action, and doesn't put much effort questioning or engaging her scumreads (transcend, titus). Finally when a previous townread of her becomes a potential wagon that townread isn't mentioned again and seem to sort of disappear.</div></blockquote><br>Why? <br>Because Raskolnikov."}

LUV thinks I'm important enough to try to buddy by faking a result on me. Titus is fake claiming for town cred and is going to have to explain why she doesn't die tonight. Titus and LUV agreed on this strategy. <br><br>LUV is town. His result on me is genuine, and he really felt he might be lynched or NKed tonight, so he got it out early. I am scum but wasn't the one who made the kill. Titus made the kill. She's claimed to try to cover her ass, but going to have to explain if she lives tonight. She should have fake claimed something else and didn't have the foresight to do so. <br><br>Can you see how unrealistic these scenarios are? <br><br>My *personal* opinion is that there might be one, or 0, scum among the three of us, and we need to look at who has been slyly working to set up this whole 'group of three' thing. We have all been chasing our tails and trying to point the finger at the other guy, which I think is mistaken. <br><br>What happened to Drone? What happened to Gerry? Was anyone townreading Ironstove yesterday? <br><br>I don't have the answers but someone with more time than me can probably find them."}

Plus it will probably help protect the town that are voting you from NKs because if one of us flips town along with you there will only be 4 players left alive who were voting you, and the town on that wagon would have a very narrowed down pool of candidates"}

I feel like Strongman is usually used to balance out multiple protectives in a game, but I don't know. I could go back and search Strongman on that page and look for how often I see strongman without multiple protectives. I saw very few 1-shot roleblockers if any, most were full roleblockers and there were a couple of 2-shot roleblockers. If Titus is truly UB that inheritied Transcend's JOAT, scum could RB her to make us think she is scum fakeclaiming and cause us to mislynch her. Another explanation for why she wasn't killed is that Transcend d7 and I were obviously townblocking since D1 along with TTTT, although he was voting less in the same vein as us and he is the one I've been most suspicious of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">inside</span> the block.<br><br>B. Strongman seems unlikely for above reasons unless there is a doctor or some other protective out there. If there were and they targeted Transcend night 1 (which they should have since he claimed PR) then Transcend should not have died even if he was roleblocked unless there was a strongman. I think strongman is only likely if there is a doctor or bodyguard, and if there is a strongman there is probably not a roleblocker unless the roleblocker and strongman are a JOAT that has 1 shot of each.<br><br>C.

If we miss scum today and tomorrow I think that if Titus and/or Drone are scum and they live that long they will not win in that situation because the remaining town will be able to judge whether one or both of them are scum with massclaim. <br>I was pushing Titus mostly out of frustration that LUV flipped town and d7 got killed, and that frustration was amplified when she was stubbornly refusing to reveal the info that we had left her alive for yesterday. Now that she's cooperating and I'm settled down a bit I want to step back and look for scum everywhere again, except maybe Sesq. It's D3 now and we have a lot of flips to work with for VCA, and we'll have even more tomorrow. Titus is also a claimed PR and I'm worried about lynching another one of those. I wish LUV would have been honest with his claim from the start because it really looked like he was manipulating his claim to be convenient for his utility to town when he switched from Tracker to Follower. I also looked at setups in the archive and 2 player neighborhoods and UB+JOAT+2-shot Follower does not seem unusual to me, especially if Maf has a role such as strongman or roleblocker."}

I can fit them in to a scum narrative as well as in a town one.

Please give an actual reason as it will give me a better read on you.</div></blockquote>The reason why I haven't voted should be kind of obvious, though. I haven't been here or read much, and anyone who's played with me in any version of mafia -- which certainly includes you -- knows that i'm really bad at making decisions and really bad at... playing the game, honestly. Obviously not normally this bad, but this game it has become worse and worse. D1, it really happened before I could; I came back to a wagon on RB, which I didn't mind, but didn't want to hammer when I knew nothing about the game anymore and Titus (a player I respect) was saying she townread him. That last part of the reason is bogus, but it's what went through my mind, and I'm trying to be honest. <br><br>Day 2, all the wagons were on PR claims and PR reports, and as you know, in normal mafia, it's pretty suboptimal to vote those off early on unless you're sure. I don't know if it's the same here, because again, I don't know much about setups; that's why I kept asking. You'll see that in the last part of my ISO in the few posts i did make. If people answered, I always missed it. As for starting my own, I just didn't have enough information or confidence to really feel like voting/fosing anyone, and I was just being a bad player.<br><br>Today, I have been completely absent. This is the first or second time I've even checked the website.<br><br>I might be a little cheap for playing this card, especially considering it was for slightly different reasons the other time, but you were in the other game I pulled this and I was the clear PR.

Titus is scummy for acting the same way I saw her play before and also all this claim and theory stuff but nvm she's okay (it's not going anywhere, fuck it).<br>D3 - It's complicated and there's a bunch of things you could interpret from this, anything is possible, but it's seems more likely titus is scum here and/or fakeclaiming. Now I personally have no idea, I'm not sure what to make of all this, I'm just putting it out there that we should look at this very closely. Titus is wrong or lying here.<br><br>The read doesn't work start to finish, put yourself in the point of view... first you thinks she's scummy for being obtuse but also just wants a wagon for funsies. Then after she literally was l-1 and had to claim, mmm I'm not sure about these role mechanics let's get all the details here, entirely new theory and speculation approach which kind of throws out what shannon said before, and vague theoretical analysis as opposed to play judgement, finally ending on a gut townread.<br>Now d3 that's gone and she goes heavily into why titus is lying and more likely scum than not although not going as far as to act on it.<br><br>As an overall read there's no consistent basis as to why shannon scumreads titus or talks about her in general, it shifts from one thing to another based on the situation but the result is generally just casting shade. There's not really momentum there or deeper reasoning behind it, even though the information itself and theories are very detailed and complex there isn't one solid continuous thread in it. Even earlier too when she discarded her fluffyrabbit strongest d1 townread when titus subbed in and never spoke of it, which is why that sequence was interesting to me too. There's no common line of thought from start to finish, things earlier just sort of disappear and fade away, never mentioned again, to be replaced by other new things but overall her views stay roughly the same.<br><br>I think shannon wasn't originally intending to continue to scumread titus into today (ended yesterday with a gut townread onto her), but on deciding not to kill her she revived her read to throw some shade onto her and possibly get that lynch. It makes sense as to why the read is so disjointed and doesn't follow from start to finish, from the original push to that townread to today.<br><br>Compare ssbm_kyouko. Kyouko seemed to LEGITIMATELY want to push titus for information based on his titus-impoetic theory, and when I asked more he gave reasoning regarding titus's d1 play around rb and her behaviour in general. Solid reasoning, also given kyouko isn't familiar with titus stylistically (unlike shannon) that's a legitimate view for kyouko. He followed up on that theory/associations later too without being prompted which shows he is genuinely thinking about it. Switch to LUV based on luv's claim, then today he does start on titus and does talk about the role, but he also goes back and references d1 and his train of thought before. It's consistent, it follows, and though he speculates mechanics and theorycrafts it isn't 100% of what he does. There's backbone and a basis behind it if you look at it.<br><br>Compare to TTTT. TTTT didn't say anything about scumreading titus until today and did vote her, but TTTT did not try to make titus look bad in any way. You could argue \"this doesn't look right\" might be casting shade but it's a stretch there. After talking with titus a bit and hearing the target of impoetic he seems okay with it, but at no point do I really see him try to \"make her look bad\" or influence public opinion against her despite his vote there. He's a little reserved and I don't know much about him, but I don't see his stance as malicious.<br><br>Drone as I mentioned voted titus for all of 3 hours before moving to shannon and the titus vote was on logic unrelated to her claim or being alive so it doesn't really fit the motivation either. I don't townread drone but even then that stance wouldn't make sense as the sole scum to take advantage, it's not nearly enough. Drone I've thought about as a shannon partner given his scumread turned into a townread when the wagon on her took off but shannon could just as easily be with any of the many lurker slots too and I scumread her a lot more."}

As scum, there's no way I'd leave a claimed PR alive, I wouldn't be that confident in my ability to mislynch them (especially Titus). We also have to ask why Transcend was killed N1 for having claimed a PR with way less powers than what he actually had, but Titus has been left to live with scum fully knowing what powers she has. To me, it makes sense that Titus is scum. <br><br>My general style isn't coming in with a compromise lynch, at all. The reason I've not voted Titus is because I'm still trying to weigh it up in my head. If she's being truthful, I don't want to lose what seems to be our last PR shot. And as SSBM has said, there's a way in which Titus' result and interpretation makes sense, and I'm still trying to get more information. <br><br>But Titus being alive, plus the 'no result' result, looks really bad to me. Like I said before, it looks like what scum would do to try to get away with the claim. Similarly, if she doesn't trust me, I don't get why she didn't investigate me last night. I also don't get why a 'no result' on Impoetic is being treated as a guilty, and how she's leaping to make the connection to me. It makes no sense unless she starts from the false premise that I'm scum, but if she thought that, why not check me for a gun? Why not jailkeep me and see if there's still a death?<br><br>If I'm focused on public opinion, it's because I've seen it work as a town strategy. I've been in a game that was won because, although some of the Town had scum reads on each other, we collectively agreed to lynch the *one person* everyone agreed on, and that ended up being the right person a few days running. I think that's what's going to be needed here. So yes, I'm trying to feel out whether people are on Impoetic as a compromise, whether it's just a LYLO strategy, etc. I'm not fence sitting, I'm trying not to rush judgment. <br><br>The other thing I've been trying to do is establish a strategy that will allow us to get the maximum information from each night and claim. If we'd not lynched LUV yesterday, he could have followed Titus and we'd have had more info about what really went on. If we'd known that Titus had targeted Impoetic last night, for real, then that would have changed today's whole focus. <br><br>Actually now what I think is a good idea is to look at who was on the LUV lynch and why."}

He and LUV are the only players that ditched the rb wagon when rb claimed BP at L-1 (6 votes). Wagon was Transcend, drealmerz7, Drone, ssbm_Kyouko, Sesq, Lil Uzi Vert.

What's your analysis here?</div></blockquote><br><br>I am starting with this question because it's a relatively simple one, and because I don't think I'm going to get to all of them, frankly.<br><br>The reason I haven't said anything is because the wagon hasn't gone away. I was hoping to see some more voting action. So far, TTTT unvoted Impoetic, Gerry put her back at L-1. SSBM unvoted, then later TTTT put her back at L-1. <br><br>Through this, Titus and Drone have both remained on Impoetic. <br><br>Like lots of other players, I've been focused on Titus and Drone and trying to sort them out. I'm not sure whether this is even possible, TBH. <br><br>I've got two theories in mind at the moment, both of which are potentially ridiculous. So I'll start with reads: SSBM, Impoetic, and you, I think are all town. I'm not sure about Sesq, TTTT, and Gerry, I guess I'm neutral on them. Slightly towny feel about TTTT because of the interaction with NewImpoetic. I think one of Titus and Drone is scum.<br><br>So, the theory part:<br><br>If one of Titus and Drone is scum, I suspect that the strategy will be for the scum one to subtly sheep the other, so that we can't get a clear read on the pair of them and by the time we've lynched it'll be too late. I don't know what, if anything, to do about this.<br><br>The particularly crazy part - <br><br>*If* - and I think it's a big if - Titus and Drone are both shown to be town, then I think the team is SSBM + Someone who has been relatively under the radar. I think SSBM has been directing traffic, so to speak, toward a few candidates all game. Her focus has been on sorting Titus and Drone, sorting me and LUV, and on Impoetic. And while I see this as towny overall, if both Titus and Drone are town, and given a town read on Impoetic, I left with SSBM by POE. (To be clear - I don't think that any combo of just Gerry/TTTT/Sesq makes sense as a scum team)."}

Let's put this down to WIFOM. So, scum is within SSBM, TTTT, Gerry, and Sesq.

We won't be any closer to narrowing down the scum pool. If you lynch Drone, well, maybe we strike it lucky and get the only neighbours (apparently ever?) to have one scum and one town. But more likely, we don't learn anything, and we still don't know squat about Titus. I think we need to look elsewhere."}

Her push on TTTT D1 was an attempt to start a different cw to rb because the Gerry wagon wasn't taking off. If Titus flips scum it's possible Raskol or Drone were the scum trying to counter rb's wagon, or that Gerry is scum and she had to make a completely new wagon to counter all this.

I know you don't like me saying 'what are the chances', but to do this she'd need to target either the killer or the target, which is pretty low odds. And there'd also need *not* to be a strongman, which we were speculating about back on D1 when Transcend died despite activating BP. <br><br>Let's do a hypothetical: <br><br>Titus jails me, and there's still a kill. What does that achieve, in terms of useful info? Nada. The explanations are:<br><br>1) Scum has a strongman<br>2) Titus got it wrong<br>3) Titus is actually scum<br><br>And we have all these explanations available at the moment. <br><br>Now, let's say Titus claims to jail me, and there's *no* kill. Are you betting on Titus being scum, or betting on me being scum? What if we're both town and scum tried to kill me but failed? <br><br>Letting Titus lives gives us 0 information at this point. Given the history of her claim, how it was used as justification for lynching LUV, and the 'no result' fiasco, there's no reason to let her live."}

No neighborizer means that if one of them flips town neighbor or town UB neighbor the other should be cleared, unless mod decided to break all traditions and put 1 mafia neighbor and 1 town neighbor in a 2 player hood this game. A 1-shot Mafia Neighborizer wouldn't be unheard of but in that case, if the neighborizer is \"normal\", it does not change the role flip of the player it neighborizes. This means that one of Titus or Drone would not have \"neighbor\" in their role pm, and both have claimed to have \"neighbor\" in their role PM. There is, therefore, no \"normal\" neighborizer in this game. <br><br>Either 0 or 2 of [Titus, Drone] are scum. If it's 0 there are 2 scum outside of them. If someone can convince me of a very plausible team that doesn't include either those 2 I'll vote elsewhere today in good faith that town will lynch one of them tomorrow if we miss scum today.<br><br>Another benefit to town: Since either 0 or 2 of them are scum,  in the worst case scenario where we lynch one and they flip town, the other will be confirmed town. This means mafia will NK the other one because they're confirmed. This will leave us with 2 scum in [Kyouko, Gerry, TTTT, Sesq, Shannon, Shadonra, Raskolnikov] with a mislynch to spare. Scum can only NK one of Sesq or I in this situation (if we mislynch, again, the worst scenario) so we still end up in 5-way LyLo with 1 very probable town based on rb interactions with myself and Sesq.<br><br>P sure there was never a strongman unless it was a mafia JOAT with Ninja, Roleblocker, Strongman.

I'll have to read back to see whether I remember that right. </span><br><br>PS - <span class=\"noboldsig\">If you lynch me all you'll know is that LUV's result on me was true, which you already know. We won't be any closer to narrowing down the scum pool. If you lynch Drone, well, maybe we strike it lucky and get the only neighbours (apparently ever?) to have one scum and one town. But more likely, we don't learn anything, and we still don't know squat about Titus. I think we need to look elsewhere.</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>I'm having trouble following the reasoning here but it looks like she's forming a POE based on the assumption that Titus and Drone are town because they've claimed neighbors, which is something that isn't and won't be confirmed unless we lynch one of them. Scum won't NK either of them if they're town because if we see a neighbor flip we'll basically confirm the other one.<br><br>Also confused where shannon gets town!impoetic/shadonra from, not that I disagree.<br><br>Too many scumspects anymore, head's going in circles"}

I still stand by the team associations I've been talking about for a while, but I'm not sure if I ever quoted them and I'm also not sure if it was more of a mutual thing or if it was rb trying to make LUV look like LUV was a scum buddy. If it was the latter it would be a ploy to take a town with him but LUVs actions towards the end of the rb wagon look like a panicked scum. I think he ditched the wagon because he thought that one of the counter wagons was going to gain traction, but it never did. I'm surprised he didn't hammer rb to try to gain some points back though.

Titus, do you really think that if I were bussing that I would not have gotten off of the rb wagon when LUV and then Drone did? If I were scum bussing him I could have easily gotten off the wagon at that point; 3 unvotes in a row would have stalled his wagon while a counter was brought about. At that point, Gerry had 3 votes and rb had 4. I could have voted Gerry, the cw to rb (the way Drone did, btw), but I didn't. I stuck to rb with Transcend and d7.<br><br>Looks pretty believable to me Drone was bussing rb and got cold feet when he thought there was a chance the wagon would dissipate. He also voted d7 when he got off the rb wagon following LUV, and for those who don't remember, LUV's top scumreads were Impoetic and d7 on D1. It seems to me that Drone might have been trying to start a counterwagon that LUV, a town player who had shown a willingness to believe rb's claim, might have gone for. This wagon was also on a player who had been consistently voting rb since early D1."}

You're leaving out your own slot and your votes which looked like vanity wagons to me. Shannon was also voting in a useless place at lynch time, pushing Transcend of all people.

Titus, do you really think that if I were bussing that I would not have gotten off of the rb wagon when LUV and then Drone did? If I were scum bussing him I could have easily gotten off the wagon at that point; 3 unvotes in a row would have stalled his wagon while a counter was brought about. At that point, Gerry had 3 votes and rb had 4. I could have voted Gerry, the cw to rb (the way Drone did, btw), but I didn't.

He also voted d7 when he got off the rb wagon following LUV, and for those who don't remember, LUV's top scumreads were Impoetic and d7 on D1. It seems to me that Drone might have been trying to start a counterwagon that LUV, a town player who had shown a willingness to believe rb's claim, might have gone for.

You'd also be tunneling your partner today unnecessarily despite your slot being the one to slow the Impoetic D1 wagon down.<br>Sesq - Strong TR of mine due to the RVS wagon and much improved play today. Started game weaker but has been picking it up lately, not likely to be scum with anyone imo<br>TTTT - Early, consistent TR of mine. Could be a blindspot scum that I've missed but also seems unlikely to be partnered with shad. Makes sense as scum with me or maybe maaaaaaybe Sesq but I highly doubt that. If the 3 of us make it to 5way LyLo I would be suspicious that I was left alive long enough for that to happen and would reconsider the plausibility of that team.<br>Raskol - Could be scum with shad, but I'm getting good vibes from here. This or Drone make the most sense to me as shad partners, partly because of the gerry wagon D1. I doubt scum would be so brash as to lump both of their votes onto the cw to rb.<br>Gerry - Has vote parked on shadonra now, but I get the feeling that gerry is a busser as scum. Heard him brag about not getting lynched as scum so maybe this is the case. Not all that likely, but not out of the realm of reasonable probability.<br>Drone - Been scumreading this slot off and on since D1, wouldn't be surprised to see this as a shad partner but that would mean he's a mafia neighbor with a town UB neighbor in a 2 person hood which is unlikely<br>Shannon - Shadonra is trying to lynch this at deadline. Unlikely partnership, because scum!shad would have a lot easier time voting for one of us leading wagons.<br><br>If shad's scum it makes sense with Rask and there's an outside chance of it making sense with Drone or you, but the hood and your guys' votes complicates that. Shad talking about lynching one of you 2 in 5 way could indicate he is with one of you 2 and will target the other at that point. If shad's scum it's with Rask imo, who is now voting TTTT but has been tunneling shannon since replacing in up until quite recently."}

This leaves the possbility that their could be 1 or 0 scum among them. If shannon were scum I'd say gerry is a likely partner but shannon being scum makes LUV town, which makes their claim true. If shannon gerry and rb is the team, and rb gets lynched, do you really see gerry performing the NK when he's the #2 suspect behind rb at end of day? Rhetorical question, the answer is no, shannon would do that kill, but LUV saw her go nowhere. I seriously doubt shannon somehow was a strongman and a ninja in the same night, so I'd say the chances of shannon being the 1 scum here are slim. Assuming LUV is the scum seems like an easy way for scum to push a mislynch off of my suspicions in D1. Nobody seems to be listening to what LUV is saying lately, which makes me think his wagon now is scum-driven. Look at Gerry posting about once a day to do nothing other than remind us to lynch LUV.

Titus, do you really think that if I were bussing that I would not have gotten off of the rb wagon when LUV and then Drone did? If I were scum bussing him I could have easily gotten off the wagon at that point; 3 unvotes in a row would have stalled his wagon while a counter was brought about. At that point, Gerry had 3 votes and rb had 4. I could have voted Gerry, the cw to rb (the way Drone did, btw), but I didn't. I stuck to rb with Transcend and d7.<br><br>Looks pretty believable to me Drone was bussing rb and got cold feet when he thought there was a chance the wagon would dissipate. He also voted d7 when he got off the rb wagon following LUV, and for those who don't remember, LUV's top scumreads were Impoetic and d7 on D1. It seems to me that Drone might have been trying to start a counterwagon that LUV, a town player who had shown a willingness to believe rb's claim, might have gone for. This wagon was also on a player who had been consistently voting rb since early D1.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>If you don't wanna look at the VCs under the spoiler just know players voting Gerry included TTTT, ironstove(Raskolnikov), iamafluffyrabbit(Titus), and Drone.

Gerry hasn't done anything and his wagon didn't take off D1. If he were the counterwagon to scum rb, and that's your reason for not voting him, then why would you not vote TTTT, who was leading the counterwagon to scum? If he wasn't a counterwagon to scum, why won't you ever vote him? Where did he towntell to you so hard that you've locked him in as town, and how is he not still a potential blindspot to you?

Roleblock shuts down X-shot very hard. According to wiki, x-shot getting roleblocked still consumes the shot permanently and leaves the role with 1 less. With 2-shot follower or the joat the denial seems out of line.<br>2. PR synergy is questionable. UB bringing back a role wouldn't reset shots either and would be potentially useless, i.e. if LUV was killed n2 a UB would inherit 0-shot follower.<br>3. Jailkeep, BP, and full doctor is a ton of safety. UB would be safety on top of that. I could see an x-shot strongman to deal with jailkeep, bp and full doctor but a full strongman seems like it would outright negate them and defeat the purpose... if I'd have to add a counterbalance to the town power, scum investigative could work though?<br>4. Neighbourstuff. This is already a can of worms, but a PR in a neighbourhood would mean something else too. If 2-person neighbourhoods were generally town, town titus as PR would have the option of playing THROUGH her neighbour if she managed to townread before the UB triggered. This is potentially MASSIVE power, as a play by proxy would buy the PR even more extra life especially if doctor was on. Wifom would still keep it rare but all it'd take still would be a townread?"}

The whole thing is supposed to be statistical, show you \"trends\", \"x is slightly or moderately more likely than y\", not to give any hard and fast rules or conclusions, definitely not as a replacement for actual scumhunting. It can be useful to \"suggest\" things and often than not can point you in the right direction to get started, but shouldn't be more than a rough guide.<br><br>The other problem is VCA was mentioned as a substantial tell all the way back in d1, before the first wagon even got through, before 2nd scum got on. Even if it didn't influence that composition (I'm not sure if he cared about VCA vs just bussing for cred), you have to assume by the end of d2 it would've impacted future VCs, with just how often it was getting brought up. To think you could spam VCA VCA out loud in thread and assume scum would either not notice, or see it but just act exactly as usual and not subvert the VCA in any way, is very naive.<br><br>I encourage anyone who plays in future as scum VS anyone bringing up VCA to deliberately do stuff to mess their analysis up so hopefully it just dies altogether from common usage. Even hardcore VCAers probably agree it has to be rare and unexpected to be useful. I could see a decent usage case being, for example, replacing into a game in lylo where it was never mentioned and THEN doing it (but even then watch out)."}

Possibly an oversight, but if this was the basis of the read you'd think she'd reconsider.

Not first brought up by shannon but somewhat adopted- and from shannon scum perspective the view absolutely makes sense: transcend calling out RB that early based on image usage along with shannon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8562907#p8562907\">751</a>. The thing is this wouldn't even be an overly conscious decision, but rather just the truth to her pov, with transcend looking like a legitimately great town player her view actually makes sense if you think about it. It only looks odd because at that time she wouldn't have that much reason to think like that about pretty much her only scumread, and before rb flip you wouldn't necessarily be thinking about how impressive transcend's catch was. I think if shannon's scum she didn't want to vote right here out of a sort of self-conscious fear; I could see why she'd hesitate voting transcend right after he says rb/shannon. Also theorize that around this time she may have already been thinking of transcend in nightkill terms given the \"respect\" view and the (for scum shannon pov) accuracy.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564318#p8564318\">814</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564404#p8564404\">824</a> is an exchange between transcend - shannon.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564328#p8564328\">815</a> is awkward and the treating of transcend doesn't match the read (she said she doesn't want to lynch transcend as she isn't sure on him flipping scum)<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564340#p8564340\">816</a> has, after her townreads, the lone scumread, \"Scum but not lynching for reasons stated: Transcend\" which makes sense in about no situation.<br>Transcend rightfully wonders why shannon doesn't just come at him and her response being it's a read solely on bad vibes and questioning the rb wagon stuff as alignment-indicative.<br>Finally he asks why she doesn't just wagon him for the sake of clarifying the \"bad vibes\" read and says her play is too careful and tactical with the response in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564404#p8564404\">824</a> kind of just mocking it<br>Read altogether shannon's approach regarding her read is absurd and answers to transcend ridiculous. <br>It's even awkward for scum, but I think what happened is shannon didn't expect to be pressed on her read or probed too far into it. Her townreads generally either townread transcend and/or thought he was good and you wouldn't expect any of them to have a problem with that sort of read because of her not-lynching caveat. It's only really transcend himself who could've challenged that and questioned the lack of vote because of how middle of the road it was.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567586#p8567586\">852</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567592#p8567592\">854</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567627#p8567627\">859</a><br>I don't see why as town she wouldn't feel like quoting her scumread and try to back that up but happily does so for a townread. If anything I tend to get the opposite with describing townreads being pretty boring (and tends to get them killed).<br>She casts more shade here for tone and transcend switching styles but holds vote. The logic being that transcend acting seriously to push and justify a wagon isn't the same behaviour as he had in rvs. Around this point the rb wagon is starting to pick up.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8569744#p8569744\">911</a><br>Thing to note here: the \"anti-town\" angle regarding transcend's call for hammer. Good vs bad manners. I agree waiting for a claim d1 is generally correct play, but in that situation if my top scumread did that I would simply find it scummy rather than bad etiquette. It's a subtlety of phrasing but shannon is pushing this moreso that it's improper or anti-town than that its scummy and that transcend is scum for it. There is a sort of shock in the tone, but instead of the town sort of shock that your scumread is acting that scummy, this reads more of a shock that rb could get lynched without claim as the focus rather than transcend himself. <br>The transcend theory after that is actually not so bad and has depth of thought to it, I can see that being a legitimate fear. The only problem being she introduced it as \"Actually, I can see a way that Scum Transcend makes this play:\" which gives the feeling she herself doesn't seem to buy into it; there just isn't quite the conviction behind it.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8571256#p8571256\">1089</a><br>This is after rb and then transcend claim. <br>Shannon says the crumbs were very obvious (kind of) and it was her reasoning for not pushing him. I didn't think much of this at first beyond finding it OTT, but on review I do buy this, it makes perfect sense for her actions. But being true doesn't mean it's town. Either align can definitely pick up crumbs but naturally scum (or PR, but shannon confirms lil's \"didn't visit anywhere\" result) will look a lot harder, and shannon was the only one who made it out as she already knew. On top of that though she said it was incredibly obvious too. I can't personally judge this part that well given almost every crumb looks obvious in hindsight because of, well, hindsight. It is true the JK claim didn't really counterclaim BP so I don't have a problem with that analysis; again though the thing is she's pushing transcend for being wrong or acting anti-town moreso than being scum.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8582116#p8582116\">1278</a><br>Emphasis is on \"case\". At no point does shannon commit to a townread onto rb and in fact barely mentions him. It's the lack of case shannon has a problem with, the process, the urgency. And on transcend the gut/bad vibes, the change of tone (why is he being serious and using actual reasoning?) and the handling of claims as anti-town and bad manners. Nothing about the read, and town shannon would absolutely talk more about her own rb read here instead of focusing on this angle. Generally people don't take that much issue with a lynch of someone they don't townread, even if they're against it's kind of whatever but shannon is adamant about having it dismissed.<br><br>Altogether I think transcend was on the money regarding rb AND shannon, which was part of why shannon gained the notion of him as a very good player here (despite not remembering their game) and also why she wanted to discredit the case on rb without straight up townreading him. Shannon interaction with rb is almost non-existant.</div></div></div>"}

Of note is the later <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567627#p8567627\">859</a> shannon has the early fluffy posts as screaming town to her, the same ones transcend got his early from which were too early. Possibly an oversight, but if this was the basis of the read you'd think she'd reconsider. And minor, but she doesn't revisit that previous game or meta (i.e. go back and read your own game you were a part of) when she later struggles \"reading\" transcend.<br><br>Now around this point transcend started to scumread shannon for a forced post, and then to rb starting that push, with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8562907#p8562907\">751</a> saying [rb] and other scum most likely being shannon and kohai(gerryoat).<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564317#p8564317\">813</a><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My personal thoughts on Transcend lean towards scummy, but I take the word of people earlier in the game who said it's basically impossible to tell D1.

But I don't understand the pickyness when shannon didn't seem to have other scumreads; this prioritization makes sense if you have an alternative scumread that isn't a potentially good town player (you vote that person instead) but not really otherwise.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Interesting about RB's image macros potentially being a tic.

Not first brought up by shannon but somewhat adopted- and from shannon scum perspective the view absolutely makes sense: transcend calling out RB that early based on image usage along with shannon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8562907#p8562907\">751</a>. The thing is this wouldn't even be an overly conscious decision, but rather just the truth to her pov, with transcend looking like a legitimately great town player her view actually makes sense if you think about it. It only looks odd because at that time she wouldn't have that much reason to think like that about pretty much her only scumread, and before rb flip you wouldn't necessarily be thinking about how impressive transcend's catch was. I think if shannon's scum she didn't want to vote right here out of a sort of self-conscious fear; I could see why she'd hesitate voting transcend right after he says rb/shannon. Also theorize that around this time she may have already been thinking of transcend in nightkill terms given the \"respect\" view and the (for scum shannon pov) accuracy.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564318#p8564318\">814</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564404#p8564404\">824</a> is an exchange between transcend - shannon.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564328#p8564328\">815</a> is awkward and the treating of transcend doesn't match the read (she said she doesn't want to lynch transcend as she isn't sure on him flipping scum)<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564340#p8564340\">816</a> has, after her townreads, the lone scumread, \"Scum but not lynching for reasons stated: Transcend\" which makes sense in about no situation.<br>Transcend rightfully wonders why shannon doesn't just come at him and her response being it's a read solely on bad vibes and questioning the rb wagon stuff as alignment-indicative.<br>Finally he asks why she doesn't just wagon him for the sake of clarifying the \"bad vibes\" read and says her play is too careful and tactical with the response in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564404#p8564404\">824</a> kind of just mocking it<br>Read altogether shannon's approach regarding her read is absurd and answers to transcend ridiculous. <br>It's even awkward for scum, but I think what happened is shannon didn't expect to be pressed on her read or probed too far into it. Her townreads generally either townread transcend and/or thought he was good and you wouldn't expect any of them to have a problem with that sort of read because of her not-lynching caveat. It's only really transcend himself who could've challenged that and questioned the lack of vote because of how middle of the road it was.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567586#p8567586\">852</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567592#p8567592\">854</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567627#p8567627\">859</a><br>I don't see why as town she wouldn't feel like quoting her scumread and try to back that up but happily does so for a townread. If anything I tend to get the opposite with describing townreads being pretty boring (and tends to get them killed).<br>She casts more shade here for tone and transcend switching styles but holds vote. The logic being that transcend acting seriously to push and justify a wagon isn't the same behaviour as he had in rvs. Around this point the rb wagon is starting to pick up.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8569744#p8569744\">911</a><br>Thing to note here: the \"anti-town\" angle regarding transcend's call for hammer. Good vs bad manners. I agree waiting for a claim d1 is generally correct play, but in that situation if my top scumread did that I would simply find it scummy rather than bad etiquette. It's a subtlety of phrasing but shannon is pushing this moreso that it's improper or anti-town than that its scummy and that transcend is scum for it. There is a sort of shock in the tone, but instead of the town sort of shock that your scumread is acting that scummy, this reads more of a shock that rb could get lynched without claim as the focus rather than transcend himself. <br>The transcend theory after that is actually not so bad and has depth of thought to it, I can see that being a legitimate fear. The only problem being she introduced it as \"Actually, I can see a way that Scum Transcend makes this play:\" which gives the feeling she herself doesn't seem to buy into it; there just isn't quite the conviction behind it.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8571256#p8571256\">1089</a><br>This is after rb and then transcend claim. <br>Shannon says the crumbs were very obvious (kind of) and it was her reasoning for not pushing him. I didn't think much of this at first beyond finding it OTT, but on review I do buy this, it makes perfect sense for her actions. But being true doesn't mean it's town. Either align can definitely pick up crumbs but naturally scum (or PR, but shannon confirms lil's \"didn't visit anywhere\" result) will look a lot harder, and shannon was the only one who made it out as she already knew. On top of that though she said it was incredibly obvious too. I can't personally judge this part that well given almost every crumb looks obvious in hindsight because of, well, hindsight. It is true the JK claim didn't really counterclaim BP so I don't have a problem with that analysis; again though the thing is she's pushing transcend for being wrong or acting anti-town moreso than being scum.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8582116#p8582116\">1278</a><br>Emphasis is on \"case\". At no point does shannon commit to a townread onto rb and in fact barely mentions him. It's the lack of case shannon has a problem with, the process, the urgency. And on transcend the gut/bad vibes, the change of tone (why is he being serious and using actual reasoning?) and the handling of claims as anti-town and bad manners. Nothing about the read, and town shannon would absolutely talk more about her own rb read here instead of focusing on this angle. Generally people don't take that much issue with a lynch of someone they don't townread, even if they're against it's kind of whatever but shannon is adamant about having it dismissed.<br><br>Altogether I think transcend was on the money regarding rb AND shannon, which was part of why shannon gained the notion of him as a very good player here (despite not remembering their game) and also why she wanted to discredit the case on rb without straight up townreading him. Shannon interaction with rb is almost non-existant.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>Probably a good move.<br><br>If I got the impoetic lynch, I would have been all over you.<br><br>An uncontested scum lynch d1 means bussing scum or lurker/ineffective scum. Lurker scum is eliminated if Shad is town. Thus, hard bus.<br><br>I couldn't really say that with the hammer and driving."}
