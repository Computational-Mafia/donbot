If I see someone insulting someone out of hand, it <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">may</div> result in a modkill. You have been warned.<br>\nc) Don't forget, while you are having fun, that you are expected to play to the best of your ability, and to your wincon.<br>\nd) I am human, I CAN make mistakes (especially seeing as it's my first time modding <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">).

Modkilling may apply to those who don't follow these instructions.<br>\nb) Do not quote your role PM or any moderator related communications.

The crew was weary and exhausted from the trials that the sea put forward, and wanted blood. There had already been disputed among the crew as to who was to be captain in place of the late Corporal. After a very short discussion, Catastrophe was pushed from the mob of angry pirates towards the plank. \"We don't want your kind here!\" bellowed one of the crew. Another shouted, \"Yarr, we'd best sink ye to the bottom of the ocean. Never trust a hydra! It was you who killed our beloved captain!!\" Catastrophe was eventually forced off the plank by the advancing crew. But what was the identity of this scallywag? Pillaging pirate, or masquerading mutineer? Suddenly a bottle dropped from the sky, cracking open upon hitting the deck. A note was inside. Someone read it aloud. \"Yarr, some crew I had.
