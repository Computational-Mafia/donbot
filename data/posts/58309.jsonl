General Stuff</span><br>a) Mafia is a game. Have a bit of fun!<br>b) Personal attacks are a no no. Attack the post, not the poster. If I see someone insulting someone out of hand, it <span class=\"noboldsig\">may</span> result in a modkill. You have been warned.<br>c) Don't forget, while you are having fun, that you are expected to play to the best of your ability, and to your wincon.<br>d) I am human, I CAN make mistakes (especially seeing as it's my first time modding <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">). If I do make a mistake, please tell me.<br>e) Please <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span> notes intended for me.<br>f) Don't post here unless you're on the player list (obviously).<br>g) I reserve the right to change or update any rules.<br>h) I will be using <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> to determine action results at night.<br>i) Any of the roles specified as <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Normal</a> on the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Wiki</a> may be used in the game. In addition, there may be one other role that does not appear on that page. This role will still use normal mechanics.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2. Communication</span><br>a) Don't talk about this game anywhere else other than in this thread, unless you've been specifically told to by me. Modkilling may apply to those who don't follow these instructions.<br>b) Do not quote your role PM or any moderator related communications. Paraphrasing is acceptable, but don't push it.<br>c) If you die, you are allowed one \"bah\" post with no game related content.<br>d) If you die, you will be given access to a private thread with other dead pirates.<br>e) No cryptography or anything that I can't (or anyone else for that matter) read.<br>f) Don't edit or delete posts.<br>g) Mod posts will be in <span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">purple</span></span></span>. Please don't use this colour.<br>h) Flavour does not contribute anything important to the game, other than making it cooler.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3. Voting</span><br>a) Votes must be in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span> or with the [/vote] tags, at the start of a line.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Captain Corporal</span> is good.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Captain Corporal</span> is also good.<br>b) You may unvote the same way, except using [/unvote] tags in place of the [/vote] tags, but this is not required, unless you wish to remove your vote entirely.<br>c) Do not abuse voting to intentionally confuse other players.<br>d) Abbreviations are fine as long as it's easy to see who you're referring to.<br>e) A lynch (or no-lynch) occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1.<br>f) Posting is allowed in twilight (the time between the hammer and when I kill them).<br>g) Once someone has been hammered, voting and unvoting will do nothing, the lynch will still proceed.<br>h) If no majority is reached by the deadline, a no-lynch will occur.<br>i) When someone is replaced, votes by that person are automatically taken off.<br>j) Fake hammers or encrypted votes are illegal.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4. Deadlines and Activity</span><br>a) Day 1 will be 3 weeks. All subsequent days will have deadlines of 2 weeks.<br>b) Night 1 will have a deadline of 72 hours and all subsequent nights will have a deadline of 48 hours.<br>c) You may request a deadline extension, it will require at least half of the majority of living players (minimum 2 players) to agree. Each extension will be no longer than 72 hours.<br>d) Depending on replacements and such, I may extend the deadline.<br>e) If posting is minimal, I may shorten the deadline.<br>f) Actions posted after the night deadline will not be counted, and you will automatically do nothing.<br>g) Please try and post regularly (at LEAST every 48 hours). If you don't post within 72 hours, you will be prodded. If you don't respond to the prod through in-game contact, or PM if the thread is locked, you will be replaced.<br>h) If you get prodded three times, or twice in the same game day, you will be replaced.<br>i) Post all V/LAs in-thread or PM them to me. I will show each V/LA in the votecount.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample role PM:</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hey xxxx, welcome to Mini Normal 1587!<br>You're a <span style=\"color: #00D000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.

The crew was weary and exhausted from the trials that the sea put forward, and wanted blood. There had already been disputed among the crew as to who was to be captain in place of the late Corporal.

Another shouted, \"Yarr, we'd best sink ye to the bottom of the ocean. Never trust a hydra! It was you who killed our beloved captain!!\" Catastrophe was eventually forced off the plank by the advancing crew. But what was the identity of this scallywag? Pillaging pirate, or masquerading mutineer? Suddenly a bottle dropped from the sky, cracking open upon hitting the deck. A note was inside. Someone read it aloud. \"Yarr, some crew I had.

I'm sure he would have at least noticed how many pages we were on. Did he not think there was at least a chance that RVS was over?

The game was on page 2 when I posted, not page 3.  My opening is my opening, I picked the wrong player to start with. In every game up to that game I have done the same thing.  I post my opening and then read what was going on. Since this game, I know am going to check the vote status before opening."}

On the off chance they aren't all on the D1 lynch...who are your top 2 suspects off the D1 lynch?<br> <br>As someone who puts a lot of weight into VCA, I'd like to point out how baseless <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6013623#p6013623\">yours</a> is.  You can't take a D1 quicklynch that was barely (if at all) out of RVS and assign genuine intent to those voting (especially those voting early).  You're using the unusually early quicklynch as an excuse for your own actions and then you have the nerve to hold it against others on the wagon...absurd.<br>  <br>Is there more than likely scum on Catastrophe's wagon?  I would say yes.  But I'd be more suspect of those who continued to pile on and actually sealed the deal.  For myself...I had not interest in lynching anyone that early and had no suspicions worthy a real vote.  <br> <br>My Catastrophe vote was purely RVS and when I came in Monday morning to catch up I was very surprised to see it had progressed to a lynch.  AND THEN you compare that RVS quicklynch to your own wagon (you whom several people think are scum).    <br> <br>If someone does a VCA on D3 or D4 (especially given our D1)...that might be worth considering.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl:dr;</span> your VCA is crap.<br> <br>Why would you call BBT and I your top two suspects and then decide Salamence (who only had one more vote than me) deserved to be forced to claim?  Then a simple VT claim is all it takes to get you off of Salamance and on to me.  (for ~~~VCA?)<br> <br>Basically you think scum are stupid and are all within the group of 3 players who were both on the D1 lynch and who are currently on your wagon.  Brilliant.  Who knew it was that easy? <br> <br>I'm good with my vote on you.  I think your D1 actions can not be ignored.  If you ARE town...there is no way you can be allowed to potentially make it to a LYLO situation.  Best case...you are scum playing the Oops I hammered card.  Worst case...you are town and we've eliminated the player with the most doubt/suspicion tied to them."}

My time on weekends is somewhat limited as is, and then with the game freeze I know it's been a while.  <br><br>I really dislike the quickhammer from SKOT on D1, but regardless of the time stamp issue I'm still not positive he's scum.  I had a bad vibe from Salamence on D1 that I outlined in my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5997087#p5997087\" class=\"postlink\">Post #57</a>, but I'm getting less of a scum read now.  To be perfectly honest, I'm having a hard time getting reads at all this game.  If I'm alive after the flip, I'll go through and do a more detailed runthrough.<br><br>I'd also like to say I'll be posting more (and please don't hate me), but <span class=\"noboldsig\">@MOD</span> I'll be V/LA until 7/20.  I will try my damndest to post at least once a RL day, though I can't promise it."}
