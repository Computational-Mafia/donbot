An announcement is heard that orders everyone to leave the boat immediately. Confused, they listen, following the emergency procedures and leaving their luggage behind. However, upon walking onto the beach, 3 things stand out. The boat does not seem to be in danger whatsoever, there are only 12 of them, and there\u2019s a huge screen in front of them. It turns on, and the image of a man appears, smiling.<br>\u201cWELCOME\u201d he says, and the group wince as the sound blares across the island. \u201cYOU TWELVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS CONTESTANTS OF A CERTAIN GAME. IT IS A GAME OF SURVIVAL. AMONG YOU ARE SEVERAL ASSASSINS I HAVE CHOSEN. THEY HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO KILL ONE PERSON AMONG YOU EACH NIGHT, AND IF THEY OUTNUMBER THE NONASSASSINS AT ANY TIME, THEY WILL KILL ALL PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND. YOUR GOAL IS TO FIND ALL OF THE ASSASSINS AND GET RID OF THEM. ANY PEOPLE THAT SURVIVE WHEN ALL ASSASSINS ARE DEAD WILL RECEIVE 100 MILLION DOLLARS EACH.\u201d<br>The screen turned off. Everyone looked at each other uneasily. Some were fazed by the large amount of money, others looked at everyone else suspiciously, and yet others assumed this was a joke and started walking back towards the ship. However, the screen turned on again and the volume was much more standable. \u201cAnd by the way, in case anyone thinks they can leave with the boat they came in.\u201d He took out a remote and pressed the button. Multiple explosions went off on the ship at once, instantly reducing the ship to scrap which sunk. Several people were blown back, but thankfully no one was hurt.<br>\u201cAnd there you have it, now GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY MURDERING\u201d</span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">6. <strike>chkflip*</strike>hoopsmcgee<br>7. <strike>Antihero* Mindgamer</strike>havingfitz<br>8. <strike>crypto</strike> GreyICE<br><br><br>*=prodded</div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">10.

You may or may not be warned.<br><br>General:<br>- Please adhere to the site rules.<br>- Do not discuss this game of mafia outside of this thread unless your role PM allows you to do so.<br>- Day phases will last 3 weeks maximum.<br>- Night Phases will last 72 hours maximum.<br>- During night phase, no talking may be done in the thread.<br>- Do not quote PM's from the mod at all (real or fabricated). Paraphrasing is acceptable.<br>- If you have any questions about your role, or the game, feel free to PM the mod.<br><br>Voting/Player Actions:<br>- All votes must be in bold format: <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Nexus </span>for example.<br>- Try to unvote before voting. Unvotes must also be in bold.<br>- You may not vote for people that are dead or nonexistent.<br>- You may vote No Lynch.<br>- Voting tricks are not acceptable. If you misspell someone's name intentionally, but I get the gist of it, the vote will count.<br>- A lynch will occur once a majority decision is reached. If no majority is reached by deadline, then no lynch shall occur.<br>- Following a lynch, it is twilight. You may continue to post until I lock the thread and declare it night.<br>- If you are killed, one Bah! type post is permitted. No game related information must be relayed during them, however.<br>- If you have a Night Action, you may submit it during Night 1 and each subsequent Night. No other time.<br><br>Activity:<br>- You are expected to post at least once every 72 hours. If you haven't posted for 72 hours, I shall prod you. If you do not respond to the prod within 48 hours (either in thread if it's Day, or via PM during the Night) then I may replace you.<br>- Similarly, if you require more than three prods, I will force-replace you.<br><br>Mechanics:<br>- <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Red is my colour.</span></span> Please don't use it.<br>- Confirm by how your Role PM tells you to once you are ready to play. Once there are 10 confirms, the game begins.<br>- Do not edit your posts.<br>- No impossible/hard to read text, or cryptography.<br>- The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>- If there is a hydra in the game, you must not post in your normal account. Doing so and then not quoting it as a hydra will invite a warning. Excessive failure to post as a hydra and not quoting it will result in force-replacement.<br>- If you need to get the mod's attention, either PM me, or bold the text you wish to draw to my attention.<br>- I reserve the right to alter/remove/add any rules as I see fit.

You hydras.... Where do I start.... Ok, first of all in some game (Double-Dip...) that I was in, I remember Thomith died by a maf vigilante... This was a while ago, idk what caused the vig to kill Tommyboy but it was something that obviously the maf-aligned vig was against. <br><br>This looks like it could be a good scenario where Thomith is indeed town but says something and doesn't get killed instantly. Thomith I think is probably not going to get killed this time.<br><br>Probably me because I'm an annoying tit but if in any case in this game, I do believe you may be able to trust Thomith. <br><br>I mean... I don't trust anyone except for people who are actually what they appear to be. And sure I'm the kind of guy that goes with the flow but when I see something wrong... That's a different story. <br><br>Secondly, people are capable of lying. Monkey might not even be the cop and Strider might be a townie. Or vice versa. Personally, word choice isn't always accurate and it really isn't what I go for if in doubt. It's the passing of days, actions, and what they said that are alloted to which I dig into and investigate as a vanilla townie.  <br><br>Thirdly, scumbags come in different shapes and forms. Some of them act like townies to blend in, some of them just lurk, and some of them could be emulating/copying another person in hopes that the other person they are lynching (most of the time a townie) will die. <br><br>I'm voting Strider because manipulative people aren't really a good thing when they try to persuade others to lynch a target they don't even know about. As to what some other person said in this thread."}

In which situation do you think more people would be angry? Of course they'd have flaring tempers at both situations because since most of the U.S. is anti-Muslim(n.b. I'm not, but I'm pretty sure everyone has seen that little snippet on the report that there's a gun dealer in Texas that caters to everyone except those that are \"of Middle Eastern ethnicity/color(not sure on which)\" or is \"Muslim\"<br><br>Compare this to Monkey's situation.

If you don't believe there are many of them, especially those who want to avoid lynching claimed PRs on D2(more going for early days, but being specific in this case), you should take a peek back at this game. Especially at some of the more lurkish peeps.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>I really get the feel Hikari's arguing with a player he knows to be town and is trying to myslynch.</div></blockquote>What the hell is this supposed to mean?<br><br>Again people, you can make little insults that people are scum. I have no problem with it, I do it all the time. I don't expect people to reply to them because they know that they can't defend to them. This here? I know this is serious Silverlands conjuring here. To be completely honest, I do really want to believe that Monkey is just stupid coptown. However, I'm letting my logic out here. Not my gut.<br><br>PreEdit(but not really because I'm actually going to rage here. Monkey don't skip because I'm going to rage on you. Everyone else feel free):<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Monkey wrote:</cite>And no, I am not going to respond to his constant swearing/tantrums/ate.</div></blockquote>So, here's a different perspective on this post. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Are you joking?</span> You're not going to respond to my points because of my angered posting style(which unfortunately I usually am not except for these moments)? Fuck off. I don't have the time or patience for people like you. I have a point where I realize I might offend people with my words but I have not come even close to that threshold. There are times where I have hit it and I have arrogantly said that I was in the right. Sure, I was in the wrong but here? No. I'm not even getting <span style=\"font-style: italic\">close</span> to that point. In your next post, if you do not even make a proposition or a little note that you will respond to my points, instead of babying out by saying that I'm out of line, I will cripple any chance of your survival by making a huge case on you. Maybe I'll die. Oh well, the next day will confirm that you'll death.<br><br>Pre-pre--edit: No, actually. I'm going to apply this to Silverlands to, not the whole rage part, but the part where I'll make a case. I think something is fishy there, so stay tuned for that.<br><br>I'll end this with a decent list.<br><br>1. MonkeyMan576: Scum. <br>2. YurikoJasmine: Not sure actually. Very familiar play to Silverlands. Pretty sure is scared to show thoughts. Not sure if that's scum-related or town-related. Would enjoy a good case from her/him.<br>3. Silverlands: Prob. scum. Need to look into it.<br>4. iDanyboy** pappums rat: Prob town, more null though.<br>6. chkflip: Null. I can never read him.<br>7. Antihero*: Should be replaced at this point IMO.<br>8. crypto GreyICE: Town. Greyscum is pretty obvious to me at this point. This isn't Greyscum.<br>9. Strider iStark: Town. Probably my most definite townread.<br>11. Tomith: Needs a prod at this point, methinks."}

It's mainly for the whole Monkey thing someone else brought up. I'll get to it, but for the moment I'd rather just do an ISO. I do them a bit differently as in I pick out the posts that I feel are actually important.<br><br>Actually, there's more than that. It's more individual stuff that I can't guarantee that he/she's town. The best way I think I'm going to get this through is by actual questioning, rather than the usual \"lol you're scum\" tactic.<br><br>1. <blockquote><div><cite>Yuriko wrote:</cite>Can you tell us why you admitted having false-claimed at the first place?</div></blockquote> Can you also get the purpose of these posts? I don't think you're in league with Monkey's \"Lynch all that lie about every single small detail instead of exclusively the ones that point directly toward scum rather than indirectly.\" But let's say Parama said something that would've made it look bad on his part, though his play would've been decent/good in your eyes. Would you have advocated a Parama lynch?<br><br>2. <blockquote><div><cite>Yuriko wrote:</cite>IGMEOY, but I\u2019m willing to wait till D2 and see what happens.</div></blockquote>What happened to this? This is the main problem with your play. You had Monkeyman on your eye, but D2 he's cool. What made the difference, may I ask?<br><br>This post is what really worries me about it as well.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Yuriko wrote:</cite>That why I'm keeping you till tomorrow.</div></blockquote>This is in response to Monkeyman's night results. Whoopte-doo, Monkeyman doesn't have any. So, why does this make him null/town, may I ask? I am aware you FoS'd him, but that's not enough.<br><br>3. This is more of a request. I'd like a vote the next time you get back. Even if it is on me, it'd help me a lot more than no votes being placed out.<br><br>Next, Silverlands. I'm aware this is a hydra. However, that's the problem. It's a hydra. The worst part is that the heads have consistently not noted which head is doing anything.<br><br>So, to even this out, I'm going to request that each head post Head1 or Head2. Or your names. I don't really care. This is more for the sake that we don't confusedly fuck up and lynch you for what another head might say. This is also the main reason I hate hydras. It's still two people with conflicting opinions. I'm going to ramble a bit about Hydras because I'm on a writers steroid today. See, I'm fine with hydras if they mainly have the same opinions/times--basically if they're in conjugation with each other. I also like it when the multiple players decide on a post to send out rather than spontaneously posting their views. I feel it helps their town/scum play considerably even though I am aware that the ability to this is quite unfeasible. I've never been in a hydra though, so I'm not entirely sure if I'm correct. Being outside of a hydra though, I can attest that the current model for hydras is very confusing/annoying/stupid to me.<br><br>Right, so Silverlands.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>oh, and we won't be signing posts as heads. Ty</div></blockquote>Well isn't that wonderful. Can I ask why not? This just seems stupid at this point.<br><br>Again, I'm going by my ISO style that I'll quote stuff that actually is important rather than waste space with every single post in one post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Siverlands wrote:</cite>Voting parama for doing nothing but telling the truth and being genuine is a poor vote.</div></blockquote>This is originally about Monkey, mind you. This is one of the problems I feel from his play. However this is why Silverlands is prob. scum. I can't distinguish which head is which. This isn't bad, technically, but it's really not that much better than decent. It's more scum-oriented than town-oriented. The reason that no one is for a lynch for these points anymore is why I don't like hydras, and need to investigate which games I go into because I have finally realized that I really can't stand hydras if I type this much about them.<br><br>But yeah, note that this is a Silverlands Monkey attack here. I want to see a change quickly.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>However right now there a good few votes better than parama and he still feels town to me</div></blockquote>Problem here?<br><br>It seems that Silverlands is concealing information if there are a few better votes. At least, he hasn't outright said \"X is scummy.\" This might just be me doing something but I believe that if you want to call a scumread out, you do it with the most brevity you can and then pounce down on it.<br><br>I feel as if everyone else has something to the point that they call it out, even if it's a bit early, which I haven't seen Silver do. Small point, but a point alas.<br><br>I do have to say I enjoy his Parama defense though. That's certainly mucho townista.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>We have a qt through which we discuss our posts.</div></blockquote>To be picky, I don't believe this is true.<br><br>ISO 10 is why I'm particularly worried. I'm confident on a town-read on iStark due to his play, but I do realize that Strider has his faults which Silverlands pointed out. I'm hoping for a change later with reasoning but if there isn't I'm going to be pushing on this. Especially since now he's on a wagon with him against me. That's should raise some suspicion.<br><br>He even notes this again in ISO 16. There has to be some Easter miracle on why this doesn't make any sense.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>but I'm happy to give you and GreyIce a somewhat fresh slate, and your questions have been logical from a town perspective so far anyways.</div></blockquote>Woooooah. Really?<br><br>A fresh slate? I'm not entirely sure if this is just bad play or scummy. Crypto I can understand. Everyone here knew he was a troll. Strider? You took him as seriously as everyone else did. This isn't some Easter miracle; this is a fake one. Although, in the end, I'm going to label it as bad play due to a complete distrust in this hydra's abilities, and most probably their players if they let this one get by. I'm almost 100% willing to say that this is the work of one head here, and not the combined hydra. That's why it's mostly bad play rather than scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>certainly better than our strider vote regardless</div></blockquote>You made an actual case on Strider but just said Norman was bad due to his play. How is this possibly better?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>Hikari and sarcasm are often found together</div></blockquote>I feel this hydra is someone I don't especially like either. But this is just me being me point right here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>2) town: fair enough. But lynching him to flip town at D2 or D3 is far better as now we have his investigation results. 2 conf. townies, 2 conf. scum or 1 of each. Far nicer than just lynching him now if he is town.</div></blockquote>You've even said this here.<br><br>I'm pretty sure you put something of that sort as an attack toward me. I was only re-iterating my logic if he was town though. That's not bad this time, that's scummy.<br><br>Finally, did you guys notice something?<br><br>There's barely anything about me here until we got to the end where he votes me! Oh, you didn't notice that? Oh! Right! You noticed the part where he turned Monkey into a probscum/null read into a town read over nothing. Well, hopefully at least.<br><br>Anywho, here's another problem.<br><br>The lack of me and then his attack on me.<br><br>[quote=Silverlands\"]Glad to know we have a potential strider buddy though.[/quote]Remember guys this is all about me. But if iStark is randomly town, wouldn't I now be town? :trollface:<br><br>But kind of seriously, this kind of goes hand-in-hand with your Strider/iStark clean slate thing. That's bad.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Silverlands wrote:</cite>Hiraki also gives me an odd feel. I know he's an aggressive player in all games from my past experience with him, but I feel he's not providing very many solutions here and is all too happy to let the town run round in circles. I guess the norman vote is okay though.<br>Posts from 277 also show some town frustration too. I'm happy fro Hikari to live today. He's 60~70% likely to be town my gut tells me</div></blockquote>Last post he mentions me.<br><br>And then a vote?<br><br>Not sure if this is bad hydraing, or oblivious scum. Either way, I'm ready to get rid of him. Tomorrow.<br><br>Next! iDanny/Paupam's. Again not much to say, but I thought iDanny was town except for one point. I'd ask him about it if he was still here, but I can't.<br><br>So, I'm going to ask Paupam's Rat one thing. Can we have a rundown of the other players?<br><br>Next, chkflip.<br><br>He kind of says obvious stuff. I can't label him as town at the moment. So he's null. Again, I can rarely ever read him so I leave him for when I actually see something horrible. There's nothing horrible there at the moment.<br><br>And that's all folks. Hope you enjoyed my little ramblings."}

In D1, before parama's flip, there's alot of uncertainty with 3 neighbors, but D2, I'm sure that pappums became more worried of GreyIce but couldn't say really say anything that would reveal he's a neighbour as that would expose him, so followed other scumreads.  I can only think of 2 reasons for pappums to out GI.  If he has a strong GI townread, then he could perhaps come out with it to confirm a townie (though even that could be dangerous, i.e. NK target).  And if he has a strong scum suspicion, throw it out there for town to look closer.  He would have additional information to get a read from (the neighbour QT) and the way he phrased his confession as well (\"don't let GI say otherwise\") is really indicative IMO.<br><br>Also, GI went after both neighbours.  On D1, he went with the Norman lynch but the only scum-suspect he had was parama.  Parama gets NK'ed and the next day, this :<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3963774#p3963774\" class=\"postlink\">post 566</a>, GreyICE wrote:</cite>Why are we trying to lynch hiraki?

If my suspicions are correct, GI got rid of both of his neighbours as quickly as possible and his plan would have worked great, had Pappums not outed him on his 2nd last post.<br><br>Next : looking closely at Monkeyman, followed by some VCA."}

Not to say you haven't raised any valid points, even scum can find something scummy about a townie.  But, overall, you give the illusion of a scumhunting townie without really doing much of it through all your posts.  Once you find someone scummy, it would be better to look for other things to back it up and build a proper case on someone, not just keep pushing the same things and say it's already been done.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3967167#p3967167\" class=\"postlink\">post 598</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>You're entitled to your opinion.

He first said he investigated iDanny and got RB'ed, but then claimed to be confused with another game but was also RB'ed investigating chkflip (me).  Beyond his excuse for the mess-up, it could have stayed at that if he had been more convincing D3.  Here, he opened the day with his clearing of Yuriko, who happened to be the NK, but he only \"noticed\" that after Silverlands brought it up.  No RB this time, but a town investigation on the NK.  It's just all very coincidental for his mess-ups and his investigation results to be in no way beneficial to town.  If he is indeed town-cop, he's been the equivalent of a VT with what he's brought to the game and if the only reason he isn't lynched is because he's potentially a town PR, then that's a flimsy excuse to keep him because his PR has not helped me or any other townie find scum.  If someone can convince me he's town or that there are far more likely scum-candidates, I'll vote that way, but to not vote him because he claimed cop isn't enough for me, especially with how he has played thus far.</div></div></div><br>@Rban, beyond relying on set-up speculation, what read do you have on MM.  To clear him because he claimed cop and it makes sense to you given a miller shouldn't be enough to clear him.  If you look at him closely and get a scum-vibe, would you reconsider your faith that there's a cop in this set-up (and that is must be MM)?"}

This is most evident in his change from \"Monkey's 100% a cop; I know this because I'm familiar with the circumstances around it.\" to \"trololol, Monkey's confscum.\" When reading his posts, they appear like efforts to mimic a town player rather than actually being a town player.

What I saw from chkflip combined with hoopsmcgee's recklessness coming into the game gives an overall scummish vibe but not something nearly strong enough to lynch on and my largest regret is not having the capability to see more on this slot to better read it.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:80%\"></div><br><br>By process of elimination, that leaves only two players left as my scumreads: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Silverlands</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">split</span>.

I'm still getting used to MS Mafia, I'm used to a website where I know virtually everyone there and I'm still getting used to the MS rosters and playing style.<br>2 - WIFOM.  Can't explain why mafia does what they do.  Maybe they know the town doesn't trust me and figure they're better off with me alive and active.<br>3 - See #1.<br>4 - I've said I don't believe Grey's claim, and after a previous game I played with Grey I'm highly suspicious of taking what he says at face value.  I've already stated several reasons not to believe Grey's claim.  If Grey *IS* mafia, then I think we can safely derive that Silverland is mafia based on previous interactions, and possibly eventually figure out a third scum as well.  If I had investigated Silverland and I'm wrong, we'd pretty much be back at square one.  I think Grey's GUILTY verdict tells us a lot.   <br><br>Even people that have been attacking me have noted that me not necessarily paying attention as much as should have, makes it more likely that what I am saying is true, because it's easier for someone to lie when they have a firmer grasp of what's going on."}

Making up lies on the spot is not that easy, usually you have to plan in advance or you'll get tripped up at some point.

I know this isn't a plainly obvious situation, and my mistakes haven't helped matters much, but I guess all I can say is I hope the town makes the right one.

I dropped the ball, hard.</div></blockquote><br>I've said it before, I'll say it again.  LyLo is a performance with an audience of one.  You were my target audience.  <br><br>Your wagon, frankly, was more than a bit derp day 2, and I didn't really like it.  I hate being on wagons that are kinda trash, and when you claimed VT that was all I really needed.  The \"VT claim\" tell isn't perfect, but its a fact that scum claim power roles under pressure a lot more often than they claim VT.  The end result I was shooting for was one more chance to out a town power role, and it actually turned out better than I was hoping.<br><br>RBan had the right idea with the mass claim (it really would have outed Monkey as confirmed town) but combining it with a no-lynch was indeed a terrible, awful no good very bad idea.  It also gave me a chance to argue mafia theory!  Hint: I'm almost always right about mafia theory.  This does not change depending on alignment. <br><br>Notes:  <br><br>- Monkey investigated two scum in three nights.  That's actually a phenomenal cop performance.  I have yet to be town in a game with him, but I honestly think his scumminess is overplayed.  Then again, both time it was townies pushing him as scum with scum defending him, so maybe I need to be on the other side to see it.  <br><br>- Crypto is a complete idiot.  Why anyone thought an idiot's behavior changes based on alignment, I dunno.  I just ran that out there day 1 to see who would buy it, and... pretty much half the town did.  Remember - useless gits are unreadable, and make great policy lynches.  Monkey, no matter what else you want to say, plays the game of mafia when he plays.  Crypto trolls the thread.<br><br>- Norman has been banned.  This is awesome.  Seriously, I don't think anyone on the wagon was really convinced that he was scum, but he needed to die for the mental health of the town.  Sometimes these things happen, folks.  If you mislynch on day 1 (and you will at least 2 times in 3), try to mislynch someone who you don't really want alive anyway.  I've slammed through a day 1 lynch on MoI, but it was based on a phenomenally strong read, he replaced simply the scummiest person who ever did scum.  <br><br>- Why did no one call chkflip out?  He was terribly scummy.  The best excuse I saw was 'oh he always plays scummy.'  Well... gee.  In that case wasn't he a really good person for the town cop to investigate? <br><br>- HavingFitz, in sharp contrast, did a great job of being the reasonable townie.  As I said in the scum QT, I nearly submitted a night kill on him because he was way too townie, until he suddenly started posting in my QT.  <br><br>Other than that, I think this game was reasonably balanced (even if I hate the neighborhood with a burning passion) but the town's general refusal to really coordinate at any point doomed them."}

I must say that I was quite impressed with havingfitz as well, since the first hint I had that he was scum was his vote on Monkey in lylo; before that moment I was absolutely convinced he was town."}
