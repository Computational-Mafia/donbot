You do not have to unvote before casting another vote, but it would be appreciated.<br><br>[02] LYNCH: Lynching will require a simple majority of votes. Once a player has reached the necessary majority, any attempts to unvote will be unheeded.<br><br>[03] NO LYNCH: You may <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: no lynch</span> \u2013 unless it is deadline, majority votes of this kind are necessary to end the day without a death.<br><br>[04] DEADLINE: This game will have mandatory deadlines of, at most, 2 weeks. As the game whittles down its living membership deadlines may grow shorter. If I deem it necessary, a player being replaced may necessitate the extension the deadline.<br><br>[05] DEADLINE LYNCH RULES: At deadline, a person will be lynched if they have a majority of voters voting for them. That means you can be lynched with just one vote if only one person is voting. If no one has a majority of the votes cast, it is a no-lynch.<br><br>[06] NIGHT CHOICES: Night choices will be expected within 48 hours. If you do not inform me of a night choice you will forfeit it.<br><br>[07] LURKING AND NOT POSTING: Lurking is not an acceptable strategy in this game. Anyone who goes more than 48 hours without posting, without advance warning, will be prodded. Failure to post in the 48 hours following a prod will result in a player being replaced (Leeway will be given Re: weekends and holidays). Mafia is a social contract. Everyone is expected to give information and comments to be analyzed. If this is uncomfortable for you, consider taking up solitaire instead.<br><br>[08] OUT OF THREAD COMMUNICATION: The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so \u2013 and then only in the manner stated in your role PM. Don\u2019t quote any out-of-thread communications regarding this game in the thread, this includes role PMs.<br><br>[09] BAH POSTS ARE ALLOWED: Once your death scene has been posted, you\u2019re dead. However, since I love Bah posts you may absolutely make one \"Bah\" post. It should be short and should contain absolutely no game related opinion or information.<br><br>[10] TOO CLEVER BY HALF RULE: No small or hidden text or obscure codes. Don\u2019t edit/delete previously submitted posts either. I may retroactively add something to this list, so if you are not sure if something is legal, be safe and ask first. Usually, just use common sense.<br><br>[11] VACATION? LIMITED ACCESS? If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period, please post a notice to that effect in this game thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging.<br><br>[12] FALLIBILITY CLAUSE: Unlike other mods I am fallible. Please point out any mistakes I make gently. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me -- otherwise your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count.<br><br>[13] QUESTIONS: If you have any questions at all, please PM me or post the question in the thread.<br><br>[14] GAMBLERS ANON: No bets, deals, promises, etc are allowed. Depending on the severity of one you may be modkilled or forceably replaced.<br><br>[15] IF IT QUACKS LIKE A DUCK: If you fake breaking a rule, it will result in the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br><br>[16] FUN: Remember, it\u2019s a game and it\u2019s supposed to be fun. Be nice to your fellow players and your mod. I have very low tolerance for abusive posts.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">[17] I've reserved this color for any purposes I might choose.

You enter the game with a no vote that you admit you knew what it meant, but after a minor prod you dropped your \"hey im not voting for anyone till im super serious\" act and voted for the hot wagon.  As Rob stated that was the safest direction a player can take, \"path of least resistance\" I believe he called it.  So this is what I'm reading from you:<br><br>&gt;timid entry to game (read: not sure how to fit in)<br>&gt;gets prodded by a player (PANIC!)<br>&gt;votes quickly to cover up insecurities, votes safest player (hey guiz im fitting in)<br>&gt;called out again, now is all of a sudden confident (super serious i can fit in)<br><br>And with your recent posts you haven't made any mention about the developments about the game except what has been addressed to you.  I take this as you don't know how to make a safe read and post on it, and instead are continuing your passive play and are reacting instead of acting.  So what do you think of qwints and monkey?<br>---<br><br>@four - Oh I am certainly not taking sides in the Twilight episode that is Team qwints and Team Monkey based on one side calling for a policy lynch and the other side basing everything on meta.  I do enjoy the fact that several players are avoiding it like the plague, though.<br><br>PEDIT - my comments to Elleran were sarcastic.  That should have been blatant, four.  You are really reaching here."}

The only thing worth noting is how transparent qwints are about his policy voting and tunneling on Monkey. This read can easily be taken as either townie or scummy, leading me to get a null read on qwints. My gut says scummy, but that's not enough for me to vote.<br>-Monkey has been playing more defensively, which is understandable considering the load of questions being showered on him. Being defensive means less scumhunting which equates to scum, but like I said, he's been busy with all the questions aimed at him. Getting a null read on Monkey also. No gut read.<br>-Hiraki has been active in answering questions and attacking different people. I like this and getting a town read from him.<br>-Carey is going V/LA and no point in saying anything about him. He barely posted anything, so obviously not enough info.<br>-the director has been a little devoid of content, imo. He hasn't been very aggressive and only asked others' opinions on the Monkey vs Qwints issue. Getting a bit of scummy read.<br>-vandetta has posted two times. His second post was good, but definitely not enough to go off of. Leaning town.<br>-mozamis's responses to questions have been weak. However, he makes a valid point against Hiraki in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4719772#p4719772\" class=\"postlink\">post 127</a>. Although Hiraki answered it, the fact that he's asking valid questions is giving me a town read on mozamis.<br>-Rob13 has been playing townie... But for some reason, I'm getting a gut scum read. He's definitely active in asking questions, but many of his questions were directed at theory or hypothetical scenarios. Obviously there hasn't been enough information for concrete discussion yet, but his broad questions make me question his townie style.<br>-FourTrouble (you), I'm getting a town read because of your aggressive questioning and open accusations. OMGUS-ing and counter voting you would be going against my current read.<br>-theunseencamo is attacking Monkey from the very beginning. He makes some points that I agree with and Monkey has been answering them. No solid read on camo as he has been pursuing his initial vote from RVS.<br><br>As you can see, I don't find anyone to be worth voting. There are already enough questions flying around so I don't feel that using my vote to pressure anyone is necessary. I suppose I could place my vote on someone who I have a gut scum read, but what's the point of that? I have no solid case to make."}

He later tried to move his early claims (Monkey doesn't look scummy, I just want to policy lynch) to more popular claims (I used to want to policy, but now here's why I think Monkey is scum) while utilizing zero original ideas. He leeched off what others posted to transition into a more popular reasoning behind his vote. So ObvScum.<br><br>Hiraki - You're town, even if I disagree with you.<br><br>FourTrouble - Early interactions with Monkey were reaching and throwing around buzz-words that didn't apply (OMGUS, mainly) in an attempt to make something stick. That's scummy. He's continued to act questionable since then.<br><br>newearth - NoobTown. Not exactly the most reliable authority on how to find scum.<br><br>Carey - \"RVS\" voted Monkey to L-2 several pages in and unvoted after a claim of VT. Later lolvoted up to L-1 with no rationale. Hasn't contributed anything at all. Scum or VI, probably scum due to the \"RVS\" nonsense and subsequent unvote.<br><br>----<br><br>So why on earth would I want to hop onto a wagon that is so utterly awful, both in reasoning and in membership? This is my reasoning why Monkey is town.<br><br>&lt;3 Qwints-wagon"}

The implications here are 1) I'm scum, and 2) therefore my partners must be players with 1 or 0 posts 12 hours into the game. Monkey doesn't act on his claims though, since if he actually believed I was scum (as implied by his post,) he would have voted for me. Instead, he keeps his vote on vendetta which shows that he neither believes (1) or (2). I called this OMGUS earlier in the game because Monkey was calling me scum. The semantics are irrelevant to the point I was trying to make though, which is that Monkey is calling me scum but not voting for me. Hence, I called it an OMGUS without a vote, which is scummy because scum try to avoid blatant OMGUS but they still want to attack and discredit the people who attack them. Monkey's attack on me is basically a threat to try getting me to stop voting for him. The fact he never votes for me ever shows he never actually believes I'm scum.<br><br>Monkey continues to call me scum but as soon as qwints starts calling for a his lynch too, Monkey starts calling qwints scum too. His reasoning for calling qwints scum never makes much sense, and his reasoning is all over the place constantly shifting as Monkey realizes his attempts to portray qwints as scum are failing. Key point here, Monkey's modus operandi throughout the entire Day has been to simply FOS whoever is voting for him while actually putting/keeping his vote on inactives. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4721371#p4721371\" class=\"postlink\">post 177</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote:<br>Vote: Carey</span><br><br>I'm annoyed with him too.   He obviously has no plan to be productive.   You can't threaten the town with saying your bad play is town meta and expect  to live.</div></blockquote><br><br>This post is bad too. Monkey switches his vote from someone he calls scummy to an inactive perhaps anti-town player. What makes his vote on Carey worse is that Carey says he is V/LA on the weekend, yet Monkey keeps his vote on him. The irony here being that putting your vote on someone who is V/LA for the next few days is completely unproductive itself. Yet Monkey would keep his vote on Carey than vote for the people who he continues to call scum, namely, myself and qwints. To me, it shows that Monkey is putting his vote on the easiest scapegoats for mafia, the inactive players, while continuing to try casting suspicion on the two players who are pushing his wagon more than anyone else.<br><br>His explanation for voting Carey is also absolute crap: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4723108#p4723108\" class=\"postlink\">post 191</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>It's called multitasking.  I'm making it clear they are both suspects.</div></blockquote><br><br>Because Carey was V/LA and his vote was not having any effect whatsoever on Carey at the time. A vote is a tool to use, and Monkey was basically negating the value of his vote for catching scum. I'd like to mention at this point that Monkey never really scumhunts much anyway. At all. He just OMGUS'es and votes for inactive players. This is really bad scumhunting, or the more likely option, completely contrived scumhunting.<br><br>And then you have this, which is the post that fully convinced me of Monkey's guilt:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4724294#p4724294\" class=\"postlink\">post 211</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Four is starting to lean scum to me.  He's attacking perceived poor players and buddying with perceived strong players, rather than attacking based on scumminess.  This is classic scum play, trying to get \"strong players\" on your side to avoid being lynched and trying to get \"weak players\" lynched.</div></blockquote><br><br>Monkey had called me scum earlier in the game yet suddenly he acts like he hasn't called me scum up to this point. He even says: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4724301#p4724301\" class=\"postlink\">post 213</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>I said your reads were bad.   This is different than having actions that are scummy.   I tend to compartmentalize scumminess I guess rather than dump everything into one bucket.</div></blockquote><br><br>Except, this is completely false because more than 100 posts earlier in the game Monkey wrote this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4718276#p4718276\" class=\"postlink\">post 64</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>[b]FOS: FourTrouble[b]</div></blockquote><br><br>The evidence here is basically irrefutable that he was lying and backtracking regarding his reads and inconsistencies. When I pointed out the evidence here, he then says:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4724320#p4724320\" class=\"postlink\">post 216</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Uh...that was quite a leap there four.  I never forgot you were scum.   I said I categorize scumminess in different ways.</div></blockquote><br><br>Which is bullshit because in 213 he explicitly said that he did not think I was scum. He even said that what he was faulting me for, having \"bad reads,\" is \"different than having actions that are scummy.\" I urge Town to go through these posts carefully to notice Monkey's inconsistencies. The fact of the matter is, Monkey has been saying I am scum the entire game, starting in post 50, made explicit in post 64, and then again in 211, where he forgot that he had FOS'ed me earlier in the game. To me, this shows he never really believed in his FOS early in the game, and when I called him out on it, he panicked and ended up constructing an elaborate lie instead of coming clean and admitting he forgot.<br><br>The other problem with 211 is that Monkey is misrepresenting me. He says that I'm buddying strong players and trying to lynch weak players, but this is simply not true. When Monkey made post 211, I had my vote on Elleran and was attacking Elleran's play. When I asked Monkey what he was talking about, however, this is how he responded:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4724726#p4724726\" class=\"postlink\">post 219</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Four thinks Ellaran is \"strong\" and I am \"weak\"(a common misinterpretation).</div></blockquote><br><br>What doesn't make sense is that Monkey would say I perceive Elleran as strong. I was attacking Elleran, and while I said Elleran's reads were good, I clearly stated that I thought Elleran's actions were pro-scum. Monkey here was basically trying to create a false association between myself and Elleran, which is exactly the kind of stuff scum try to do to discredit players and get them off their back.<br><br>I'd also like to draw attention to Monkey's posts regarding his own wagon:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4729061#p4729061\" class=\"postlink\">post 292</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>This is a very poor wagon.   Anyone should be able to see that.  Carey, newearth, qwints, those are all questionable/scummy votes.  I also bet all three scum are on the wagon.</div></blockquote><br><br>He doesn't question my vote or call me scum, which given the running theme of his accusations all game, makes no sense. Suddenly, I'm not scum. Moreover, I highlight Monkey's certainty that there are three scum in the game. This betrays some knowledge that town don't have, especially since this isn't speculation here, he's stating it as fact. We have no basis at this point to say there are three scum in total in this game, which is what Monkey is doing.<br><br>Monkey is basically just trying to get rid of threats without doing any real scumhunting. If people call him town, he does his best to keep those players happy by offering a town read in return."}

I'd put The Director and Rob down as scum, along with Monkey, at this point. Tiger is just misguided as fuck.<br><br>Tiger's case says qwints is scummy because of 106 and 179. In 106, qwints says he got Monkey mislynched in a previous game. 100% null post. Like, there is no scum motivation for admitting you can mislynch the person you pushing for a lynch on. The town motivation? I can imagine a couple. Being open and honest about things, for one. Lynching qwints because of 106 is utterly retarded. As for 179, qwints is saying that, where prior to 179 he was pushing for a policy lynch (ie not having a solid position whether Monkey was scum or not), now he's pushing for a lynch on Monkey because Monkey is actually scummy. This is a perfectly legitimate change given Monkey's reactions to his wagon. qwints was evaluating Monkey's reactions to determine whether Monkey was scum or not, and he was being open about it, too. It is town behavior, nothing scummy. Tiger's case basically radiates crap all the way through. <br><br>The Director though is not just sheeping Tiger, his reasoning itself is scummy as hell.

He's been doing everything he can to save Monkey all game.<br><br>Rob's reasoning is basically no better. He basically repeats the same shit as Tiger, for which the same explanation can be offered. qwints said Monkey is pro-scum regardless of his affiliation so he wanted to policy lynch him. This is straight forward and null at worst, slightly townish at best. As the game progressed, and Monkey reacted to his wagon, qwints changed his read. This is not scummy in the least, if anything it is towny because it reflects that he is evaluating Monkey's reactions, and now that he thinks Monkey is scum, he wants to take responsibility for the lynch. Rob's claim that qwints offered zero original ideas is also false."}

What kind of motive would a townie have in suggesting such a thing? For scum, it'd be easy to suggest something like this because it would allow you to pursue another innocent townie the next day with the defense \"I thought he was scummy before! Look at my post XYZ from D1!\" This isn't scumhunting, it's lining up victims.<br><br>Second, in the quoted content above, you changed your vote from qwints to Carey. Let's do a quick analysis:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4726937#p4726937\" class=\"postlink\">post 258</a>, mozamis wrote:</cite> [......]<br><br>So that leaves me with Four and Qwints.<br>All in all, qwints probably the most likely scum for hopping aboard a wagon that was already being pushed quite hard. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE QWINTS.</span></div></blockquote><br>So according to this post, you voted qwints because you had a reason to believe that qwints was scummy. You <span style=\"font-style: italic\">explicitly</span> stated that qwints' wagon hopping was too opportunistic and thus scummy. However, in your post 412, you changed your vote to Carey with the reason \"Guy's a waste of space.\"<br><br>What does \"Guy's a waste of space\" imply? Let's consider what this statement's syntax and diction choices imply about Carey. It implies that Carey does not belong in this game. It implies that Carey could be replaced by another, more useful player. What does it NOT imply? He has NOT contributed any opinions. He has NOT said anything worth consideration. Do any of these implications make Carey scummy? No -- they make him anti-town or at least a superbly inactive player. Voting a useless but not scummy player is still voting a theoretically townie player. Voting a townie player is scummy.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: mozamis</span><br><br>---<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">PEDIT:</span> The difference between your defense and qwints' defense from when he was at L-1 is that qwints presented a credible case against you and actually attempted to scumhunt when he was pressed. You have been mostly tunneling on the questions directly asked of you and not much else. qwints defended himself minimally and instead gave a case on why there's someone else who's more scummier than himself."}

Let's go through the problems here:<br><br>1. The fact I didn't speak about unseen on D1 doesn't mean I agree with lynching him. On the contrary, the lack of commentary regarding him is a result of the fact that I currently regard him as town.<br><br>2. I've been tunneling on Monkey for most of the game, not Rob. The reason for this is because Monkey has been scummy as fuck, regardless of whatever his actual alignment is or isn't. Rob entered the picture starting D2.<br><br>3. I did not vote Rob for no reason the entire game. I just voted him for the first time as far as I remember starting D2. Hiraki is blatantly misrepresenting my play.<br><br>4. The worst part is that Hiraki assumes I have no reasoning for my vote on Rob when all Hiraki has to do is ASK for reasoning. You don't just assume every vote someone places in a game is based on gut. You ask the player why they're voting. That's what townies do, at least.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote Hiraki</span><br><br>You can call it OMGUS, but really it's not.

He's reaching to make it seem like everything I've done makes sense from a scum perspective even though it obviously doesn't. He's pushing a lynch using the worst set of reasoning I've ever seen, and the CERTAINTY with which he is doing it is something no townie with his level of reasoning could possibly have."}

Shit, the webmaster should throw out the old catch phrase and replace it with monkey's quote above.  A player rates another player as town or scum not based on anything logical, but rather on whether or not a player thinks another player thinks like them.  The logic in their mind being \"whelp I'm town and since that other player is thinking like me they must be town too\".<br><br>In fast moving games on this site it is funny to see people rise and fall in other's eyes solely on whether or not they think like the group.

You don't catch scum by calling people who agree with you town and people who disagree with you scum, which is what Monkey is doing. You hunt for scum by seeing if their position makes sense from a town perspective, given their situation in the game. This means looking at the reasoning and motivation behind their stances, not just what those stances are."}

Moving on:<br><br>108 - says lots of reason to lynch Monkey, then backtracks in the same post to say the tell he has on Monkey is actually null but he wants to lynch him anyway.<br>111 - the first time so far that Hiraki does any scumhunting, directed towards Rob.<br>116 - continues his questioning of Rob, has tinge of towniness to it.<br>121 - kind of deflects Mozamis' question instead of answering it.<br>123 - backs off Rob.<br>128 - finally answers Mozamis' question instead of deflecting again.<br>134 - quotes Monkey, 0 content.<br>174 - asks us to lynch Monkey.<br>181 - gives us ultimatum to lynch Monkey or he will deal with it himself, says it's not a dayvig. Nonetheless, no real scumhunting or attempt to explain why Monkey should be lynched.<br>184 - just tells Monkey what he's doing.<br><br>I want to point out at this time that Hiraki's posts throughout don't seem genuine at any point - as in literally there isn't a single point here where I get the feeling he actually believes Monkey is scum. There is also so far only 1-2 posts that show any sort of actual scumhunting. Moving on:<br><br>193 - doesn't make sense, not sure what this post means.<br>291 - tiger says he doesn't like monkey wagon, Hiraki tells him to kill Monkey anyway.<br>293 - no content.<br>313 - says he's fine with either lynch, basically going along with whatever town decides.<br>331 - calls The Director town even though he's scummy as fuck.<br>390 - asks Carey to explain something, not really a very insightful question.<br>415 - just says newearth's behavior is usual noob stuff, which is just stating the obvious.<br>501 - asks for a vote count.<br>503 - asks for a vote count again.<br>506 - votes mozamis.<br>511 - says Elleran's vote is a \"bit late.\"<br><br>And D1 ends. So far, considering the sheer number of Hiraki's posts, there is almost no content to them and very little attempt to understand anyone's motivations. He just goes along with whatever wagon is popular, basically just active lurking. Now, D2 is where it gets really bad:<br><br>525 - asks how Monkey is town.<br>529 - considers using WROD, whatever that means.<br>554 - asks if anyone can see the kill coming from unseen.<br>560 - votes unseen AFTER tiger votes unseen and gives Hiraki approval for his theory and vote.<br>584 - says unseen is scum because Elleran tunneled unseen (which is <span class=\"noboldsig\">completely false</span> btw, Elleran voted unseen at the start of D1 and then dropped it). So here is the first instance where Hiraki is misrepresenting the way this game has gone. And now:<br><br>591 - this is Hiraki's biggest post in the game content wise and it needs to be scrutinzed closely because it becomes apparent right away that Hiraki is scum. First, Hiraki calls everyone who voted for unseen nubtown. No reasoning here so its null. Then says the people who questioned the unseen wagon stay the same. No reasoning so its null. But his lynchpool leaves out Monkey and The New Earth for no apparent reason. It obviously isn't because they voted for unseen because others voted for unseen. So what's the reasoning there? There is none. It conflicts with Hiraki's insistence that Monkey was scum on D1 + asking how Monkey is town at the start of D2 (which implied he didn't think that was the case). Says he thinks Rob is town, director is town, and therefore scum must be between myself, unseen, and Tajo. Here's where the inconsistencies pop up: next he says he thinks here is an SK plus a two team mafia. Then says he can't see it being 2-2-9. Okay, but why an SK and not a 3 person team mafia. This shows us two things. One, it betrays knowledge that the mafia team is only 2 people. Hiraki is completely certain it is not 3 people, which is something only mafia could know. Second, his theory makes no sense because there was only 1 night kill, so why theorize an SK plus two team mafia instead of a single 3 team mafia? He must KNOW that the mafia is 2 people. Then he votes for me. A terrible vote, not just because I know I'm town, but because for the first time all game he offers some reasoning behind it, and it's fucking awful. Let's analyze his reasoning: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4746064#p4746064\" class=\"postlink\">post 591</a>, Hiraki wrote:</cite>For having a keen defense of unseen while never speaking about him in D1. He's basically been tunneling. Especially on Rob with little to no reasoning and just gut for the entirety of the game.</div></blockquote><br>I've already explained the problem here before but I'll go over it again. There is nothing scummy about defending someone you haven't spoken about. The fact I didn't speak about the guy makes it quite evident I didn't think he was scum. What is worse though is the second part of his reasoning. I was tunneling on Monkey, this is true, but it's also what Hiraki himself was doing for the vast majority of D1. I want this to sink in: he's calling me scummy for what he himself was doing. This is really what gives him away as scum, it's something I myself sometimes do when I'm scum - I call people out for doing what I'm doing. This is a major scum-tell. The final part of his reasoning is also a misrepresentation of the game, because I never tunneled on Rob. In fact, I voted him for the first time on D2 and the claim that I did it with no reason and just on gut for the entire game is completely 100% false. This cannot be ignored.<br><br>If you aren't convinced at this point that Hiraki is scum, then I dunno what to tell you guys. Anyway, moving on:<br><br>594 - His reasoning betrays more knowledge that only scum would have. How? Take a look at the post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4746272#p4746272\" class=\"postlink\">post 594</a>, Hiraki wrote:</cite>Also, if some of you guys need more proof that Monkey/thenewearth/tigerzone are nubtown, just look at how they voted inline.<br><br>Nubscum would be cautious--don't want to die scenario.</div></blockquote><br>He's saying they are all nubtown instead of nubscum but why insist they are \"nub\" to begin with? Newearth is obviously noob but Monkey and Tiger are not. The only explanation I see here, and maybe I'm biased, is that Hiraki KNOWS they aren't mafia so to explain his town-read on them he's creating a false dichotomy between nubtown and nubscum, and excluding the possibility that these three are neither of those. The creation of the false dichotomy is where you see that Hiraki knows something more than he shouldn't since he's beginning with the assumption that they are noobs, and this assumption only makes sense if you make the prior assumption that they are town since their play - at least Monkey and Tiger - does not indicate that they are as nub as Hiraki is painting them as.<br><br>596 - tells Monkey he stands alone.<br>598 - no game content.<br>601 - no game content.<br>603 - says \"LYNCHPOOL\" should clear everything up.<br>607 - quotes Rob to challenge my vote on him.<br><br>611 - this is just priceless. Hiraki says he did a reaction test for town. What is his reaction test? He saw a connection between Elleran and unseen (which I've already pointed out isn't true), voted unseen on this basis, and then everyone who followed he called town. WTF? If it isn't true, then the people who didn't follow (Rob and me in particular) are the people who are actually reading the game carefully instead of just mindlessly joining any wagon. How does Hiraki's so-called \"reaction test\" show that these people are town? It makes literally no sense, which is why it took me so long to finally realize what he was talking about here. Anyway, again a terrible post that makes no sense from a town point of view.<br>613 - here he \"admits\" his reaction test has no guarantee of success, then claims it worked anyway. lolwut? Where's the logic, the reasoning? Or the motivation-seeking? Nowhere because there is none. It makes no sense whatsoever. If anything, his reaction-test is more likely to find scum than town because it just exposes people who don't read the game carefully, who are typically scum.<br>619 - Just says he's sure I'm scum, not sure about anyone else.<br>621 - Tries to explain my towny behavior as something scum would because he says he's done similar as scum \"at the edge of death.\" I want to emphasize this part because: the behavior Hiraki is talking about occurred when I was nowhere near the edge of death. Besides the fact that at this point Hiraki isn't actually supplying any reason to think my behavior is scummy, he's just trying to justify my town-tells as things that could come from scum and he's doing that by just saying its stuff he would do as scum... as if somehow that means everyone would do it or its something that is more likely to come from scum than town.<br>623 - continues trying to push the same idea as in 621. Nothing town motivated about his post, doing everything he can to ignore facing the possibility I am town.<br>642 - Hiraki refuses to answer my questions. I attempted to understand his thought process because to make sure he was scum and not misguided town, and he just refuses to even engage with me at all.<br>653 - tells qwints to explain something.<br><br>656 - this post. Hiraki actually says that he was NOT doing a reaction-test. When I think it is quite clear he was doing a reaction test. Take a look at 611. The reaction-test was 100% premeditated according to the story Hiraki tells in that post. Furthermore, Hiraki says my reaction to the test was good. Huh? His story and posts don't make any sense. There is no consistency to anything he's saying anymore. If my reaction was good, why did he suddenly decide to vote for me AFTER that? Especially when he wasn't voting for me prior to it? What made him vote for me when recent evidence suggested I was town? The narrative he's trying to construct is falling apart right here. He also says I have to die instead of unseen/Tajo because people want me to die. I want this to sink in as well because it is yet another inconsistency in Hiraki's thought process. He says that he's happy with any of those three dying but because people want me to die, that's who he's going for. Which makes no sense because actually, prior to voting for me, there were more votes on unseen, so why switch to me? What caused that? The sole fact I was defending unseen?<br>658 - fluff about twilight<br>667 - makes no sense here because qwints is pointing out what Hiraki is doing and Hiraki is responding with a nonsensical interpretaion of qwints' posts.<br>669 - no content. <br>685 - Hiraki backtracks and says his vote on unseen was a reaction test. He also deflects my questions yet again. Instead of answering them, he just calls me scummy for asking the question in the first place. The most hilarious part about this post is the following part:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4757054#p4757054\" class=\"postlink\">post 685</a>, Hiraki wrote:</cite>My opinion is my own and you are trying to fight against it by fighting me rather than finding actual scum. If you still think I'm scum for giving a vote, according to you, with no evidence, then do you think I am absolute shit at scum?</div></blockquote><br>Hiraki says I'm fighting with him instead of finding actual scum. Except, I'm actually asking Hiraki questions and trying to understand his thought process. What is Hiraki doing? Calling me scum, offering no reasoning for that other than his so-called lynchpool, deflecting my questions, misrepresenting me (since I'm not fighting with him but actually trying to understand his thought process here). The question he asks me at the end here is not only pure WIFOM but also incoherent: he's asking me if I think he's shit at being scum for voting me without a vote, but if he's <span class=\"noboldsig\">actually</span> town, wouldn't that mean I think he's good at being scum since he's playing exactly the same as he plays as town? Think about this because his question, however you spin, comes from a scum point of view. If he were town, he would take the fact I think he is scum as a compliment to his scum play.<br><br>688 - doesn't really provide any content.<br>705 - says if unseen isn't scum, scum is gonna wagon it, which still gives no explanation for why he switched from unseen to me.<br>707 - no content.<br>710 - no content, just buddying with Rob.<br>713 - says The Director is right about things.<br>715 - no content.<br>719 - no content<br>724 - gives his reads, no content behind them.<br><br>And that concludes my analysis of Hiraki's behavior this game. On D1, he actively lurks and joins the most popular wagons with no reasoning provided of his own, and does almost no scumhunting whatsoever. On D2, he votes me for doing what he himself was doing (hypocrisy), but even worse, goes on to misrepresent me.<br><br>And actually, I just noticed that Hiraki's misrepresentation of me, that I gave no reasoning for my reads and was going purely on gut, actually applies to himself much more than it applies to me. If you go through my posts, it's quite clear I've given plenty of reasoning for my reads."}

He didn't admit that he's pushing an easy mislynch. He admitted that MonkeyMan could be easily mislynched.

Give me a motivation for scum-me to switch onto scum-you when I could just as likely stay on someone else who had a strong wagon behind them. It DOESN'T EXIST.<br><br>Why would scum ever want to switch onto their partner and put their partner at L-2, which would cut down on the momentum of Four-wagon and increase the momentum of the Hiraki-wagon? Increasing the momentum of the Hiraki-wagon by jumping on it can lead to only 3 possibilities:<br><br>1) The wagon spontaneously dies. --&gt; Unlikely<br>2) You later have to devise a reason to hop off the wagon, all while trying to look natural. --&gt; Not ideal, can lead to slipping up or scum-telling quite easily.<br>3) You stay on the scum-wagon and let your partner get lynched. --&gt; Not something I'd want to do as scum considering the context of the game. I would get little town-cred for being #3 on that wagon and I would be down a partner, all while I could have just as easily stayed on Four and never gotten myself into the situation at all.<br><br>These two lines of thought are certainly not mutually exclusive or even mildly contradictory. Hiraki, stop being stupid."}
