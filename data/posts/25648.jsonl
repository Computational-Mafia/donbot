{"number": 1, "id": "4713801", "user": "The Mini-Librarian", "user_id": "18482", "content": "<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rules</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Largely stolen from Llama Fluff</div><br>\n<br>\n[01] VOTING METHOD: Votes must be in bold or in vote tags. example: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: LlamaFluff</div> If you do not bold your vote, it will not be counted. You do not have to unvote before casting another vote, but it would be appreciated.<br>\n<br>\n[02] LYNCH: Lynching will require a simple majority of votes. Once a player has reached the necessary majority, any attempts to unvote will be unheeded.<br>\n<br>\n[03] NO LYNCH: You may <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: no lynch</div> &#8211; unless it is deadline, majority votes of this kind are necessary to end the day without a death.<br>\n<br>\n[04] DEADLINE: This game will have mandatory deadlines of, at most, 2 weeks. As the game whittles down its living membership deadlines may grow shorter. If I deem it necessary, a player being replaced may necessitate the extension the deadline.<br>\n<br>\n[05] DEADLINE LYNCH RULES: At deadline, a person will be lynched if they have a majority of voters voting for them. That means you can be lynched with just one vote if only one person is voting. If no one has a majority of the votes cast, it is a no-lynch.<br>\n<br>\n[06] NIGHT CHOICES: Night choices will be expected within 48 hours. If you do not inform me of a night choice you will forfeit it.<br>\n<br>\n[07] LURKING AND NOT POSTING: Lurking is not an acceptable strategy in this game. Anyone who goes more than 48 hours without posting, without advance warning, will be prodded. Failure to post in the 48 hours following a prod will result in a player being replaced (Leeway will be given Re: weekends and holidays). Mafia is a social contract. Everyone is expected to give information and comments to be analyzed. If this is uncomfortable for you, consider taking up solitaire instead.<br>\n<br>\n[08] OUT OF THREAD COMMUNICATION: The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so &#8211; and then only in the manner stated in your role PM. Don&#8217;t quote any out-of-thread communications regarding this game in the thread, this includes role PMs.<br>\n<br>\n[09] BAH POSTS ARE ALLOWED: Once your death scene has been posted, you&#8217;re dead. However, since I love Bah posts you may absolutely make one \"Bah\" post. It should be short and should contain absolutely no game related opinion or information.<br>\n<br>\n[10] TOO CLEVER BY HALF RULE: No small or hidden text or obscure codes. Don&#8217;t edit/delete previously submitted posts either. I may retroactively add something to this list, so if you are not sure if something is legal, be safe and ask first. Usually, just use common sense.<br>\n<br>\n[11] VACATION? LIMITED ACCESS? If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period, please post a notice to that effect in this game thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.<br>\n<br>\n[12] FALLIBILITY CLAUSE: Unlike other mods I am fallible. Please point out any mistakes I make gently. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me -- otherwise your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count.<br>\n<br>\n[13] QUESTIONS: If you have any questions at all, please PM me or post the question in the thread.<br>\n<br>\n[14] GAMBLERS ANON: No bets, deals, promises, etc are allowed. Depending on the severity of one you may be modkilled or forceably replaced.<br>\n<br>\n[15] IF IT QUACKS LIKE A DUCK: If you fake breaking a rule, it will result in the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br>\n<br>\n[16] FUN: Remember, it&#8217;s a game and it&#8217;s supposed to be fun. Be nice to your fellow players and your mod. I have very low tolerance for abusive posts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">[17] I've reserved this color for any purposes I might choose.

You enter the game with a no vote that you admit you knew what it meant, but after a minor prod you dropped your \"hey im not voting for anyone till im super serious\" act and voted for the hot wagon.

So this is what I'm reading from you:<br>\n<br>\n&gt;timid entry to game (read: not sure how to fit in)<br>\n&gt;gets prodded by a player (PANIC!)<br>\n&gt;votes quickly to cover up insecurities, votes safest player (hey guiz im fitting in)<br>\n&gt;called out again, now is all of a sudden confident (super serious i can fit in)<br>\n<br>\nAnd with your recent posts you haven't made any mention about the developments about the game except what has been addressed to you.  I take this as you don't know how to make a safe read and post on it, and instead are continuing your passive play and are reacting instead of acting.  So what do you think of qwints and monkey?<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n@four - Oh I am certainly not taking sides in the Twilight episode that is Team qwints and Team Monkey based on one side calling for a policy lynch and the other side basing everything on meta.

My gut says scummy, but that's not enough for me to vote.<br>\n-Monkey has been playing more defensively, which is understandable considering the load of questions being showered on him. Being defensive means less scumhunting which equates to scum, but like I said, he's been busy with all the questions aimed at him. Getting a null read on Monkey also. No gut read.<br>\n-Hiraki has been active in answering questions and attacking different people. I like this and getting a town read from him.<br>\n-Carey is going V/LA and no point in saying anything about him. He barely posted anything, so obviously not enough info.<br>\n-the director has been a little devoid of content, imo. He hasn't been very aggressive and only asked others' opinions on the Monkey vs Qwints issue. Getting a bit of scummy read.<br>\n-vandetta has posted two times. His second post was good, but definitely not enough to go off of. Leaning town.<br>\n-mozamis's responses to questions have been weak.

Although Hiraki answered it, the fact that he's asking valid questions is giving me a town read on mozamis.<br>\n-Rob13 has been playing townie... But for some reason, I'm getting a gut scum read. He's definitely active in asking questions, but many of his questions were directed at theory or hypothetical scenarios. Obviously there hasn't been enough information for concrete discussion yet, but his broad questions make me question his townie style.<br>\n-FourTrouble (you), I'm getting a town read because of your aggressive questioning and open accusations. OMGUS-ing and counter voting you would be going against my current read.<br>\n-theunseencamo is attacking Monkey from the very beginning.

He ignores everything that had gone on in the game to vote someone who had posted once in *gasp* less than 24 hours. Pretty bad vote.<br>\n<br>\n#50 makes him sem more of a noob than anything else. Post activity = alignment? No thanks.<br>\n<br>\nThe Four/Monkey interaction in #50/#55/#57 makes Monkey look good and Four look bad. Four is reaching with the buzz word of OMGUS, which doesn't apply to the situation at all. Scum-tell.<br>\n<br>\nThis continues in #64. Monkey still looks good for it.<br>\n<br>\nHis stuff re: Qwints in #87 and a bit before that is all null to me.<br>\n<br>\nAppropriate response to Four in #143<br>\n<br>\nI don't have meta on Monkey, but #177 looks good for him. I see that type of annoyed response more often from town than scum. This isn't something I can explain really - it has a lot to do with tone. It's like at this point he's just going \"fuck it, I'd rather have you out of the game than keep putting up with your shit\". Scum tend to be more methodical.<br>\n<br>\n#257 also looks good. He claims VT, but he ALSO claimed VT back in #169. When have you seen scum forget they already fake-claimed? Never? That's what I thought.<br>\n<br>\nGeneral willingness to be lynched, especially in late posts, if it helps us find scum on the wagon is also good.<br>\n<br>\nThis isn't strong town stuff, but it's almost an entire absense of scum stuff, in my opinion. He looked a bit iffy early, but the later stuff more than makes up for it and brings him to a weak town at worst.<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, let's look at the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nunseencamo - Using incredibly weak reasoning and tunneling on Monkey. Hasn't moved his vote from Monkey since RVS. That's not a genuine attempt to find scum. Posts like his most recent, #269, show that he's just attacking Monkey no matter what is posted. Monkey's #257 was not scummy, and there's no way for Monkey to \"prove\" he's a VT. The attack makes no sense.<br>\n<br>\nqwints - I've discussed this exhaustively, but he tried to hop on a major wagon due to policy, but he couldn't explain even close to adequately why he wanted Monkey policy lynched. He later tried to move his early claims (Monkey doesn't look scummy, I just want to policy lynch) to more popular claims (I used to want to policy, but now here's why I think Monkey is scum) while utilizing zero original ideas. He leeched off what others posted to transition into a more popular reasoning behind his vote. So ObvScum.<br>\n<br>\nHiraki - You're town, even if I disagree with you.<br>\n<br>\nFourTrouble - Early interactions with Monkey were reaching and throwing around buzz-words that didn't apply (OMGUS, mainly) in an attempt to make something stick. That's scummy. He's continued to act questionable since then.<br>\n<br>\nnewearth - NoobTown. Not exactly the most reliable authority on how to find scum.<br>\n<br>\nCarey - \"RVS\" voted Monkey to L-2 several pages in and unvoted after a claim of VT. Later lolvoted up to L-1 with no rationale. Hasn't contributed anything at all. Scum or VI, probably scum due to the \"RVS\" nonsense and subsequent unvote.<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\nSo why on earth would I want to hop onto a wagon that is so utterly awful, both in reasoning and in membership?

The implications here are 1) I'm scum, and 2) therefore my partners must be players with 1 or 0 posts 12 hours into the game. Monkey doesn't act on his claims though, since if he actually believed I was scum (as implied by his post,) he would have voted for me. Instead, he keeps his vote on vendetta which shows that he neither believes (1) or (2). I called this OMGUS earlier in the game because Monkey was calling me scum. The semantics are irrelevant to the point I was trying to make though, which is that Monkey is calling me scum but not voting for me. Hence, I called it an OMGUS without a vote, which is scummy because scum try to avoid blatant OMGUS but they still want to attack and discredit the people who attack them. Monkey's attack on me is basically a threat to try getting me to stop voting for him. The fact he never votes for me ever shows he never actually believes I'm scum.<br>\n<br>\nMonkey continues to call me scum but as soon as qwints starts calling for a his lynch too, Monkey starts calling qwints scum too. His reasoning for calling qwints scum never makes much sense, and his reasoning is all over the place constantly shifting as Monkey realizes his attempts to portray qwints as scum are failing. Key point here, Monkey's modus operandi throughout the entire Day has been to simply FOS whoever is voting for him while actually putting/keeping his vote on inactives. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4721371#p4721371\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4721371#p4721371\" data-post-id=\"4721371\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 177</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote:<br>\nVote: Carey</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm annoyed with him too.

Monkey switches his vote from someone he calls scummy to an inactive perhaps anti-town player. What makes his vote on Carey worse is that Carey says he is V/LA on the weekend, yet Monkey keeps his vote on him. The irony here being that putting your vote on someone who is V/LA for the next few days is completely unproductive itself. Yet Monkey would keep his vote on Carey than vote for the people who he continues to call scum, namely, myself and qwints. To me, it shows that Monkey is putting his vote on the easiest scapegoats for mafia, the inactive players, while continuing to try casting suspicion on the two players who are pushing his wagon more than anyone else.<br>\n<br>\nHis explanation for voting Carey is also absolute crap: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4723108#p4723108\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4723108#p4723108\" data-post-id=\"4723108\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 191</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>It's called multitasking.

A vote is a tool to use, and Monkey was basically negating the value of his vote for catching scum. I'd like to mention at this point that Monkey never really scumhunts much anyway. At all. He just OMGUS'es and votes for inactive players. This is really bad scumhunting, or the more likely option, completely contrived scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then you have this, which is the post that fully convinced me of Monkey's guilt:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4724294#p4724294\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4724294#p4724294\" data-post-id=\"4724294\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 211</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>Four is starting to lean scum to me.

He even said that what he was faulting me for, having \"bad reads,\" is \"different than having actions that are scummy.\" I urge Town to go through these posts carefully to notice Monkey's inconsistencies. The fact of the matter is, Monkey has been saying I am scum the entire game, starting in post 50, made explicit in post 64, and then again in 211, where he forgot that he had FOS'ed me earlier in the game. To me, this shows he never really believed in his FOS early in the game, and when I called him out on it, he panicked and ended up constructing an elaborate lie instead of coming clean and admitting he forgot.<br>\n<br>\nThe other problem with 211 is that Monkey is misrepresenting me. He says that I'm buddying strong players and trying to lynch weak players, but this is simply not true. When Monkey made post 211, I had my vote on Elleran and was attacking Elleran's play.

{"number": 336, "id": "4730693", "user": "FourTrouble", "user_id": "19440", "content": "qwints is a terrible lynch for today. He's towny, nothing like the strong read I'm getting from Hiraki and Elleran, but strong enough town to stop his lynch. The main case against qwints seems to stem from Tiger, and it is being perpetuated by The Director, and Rob, which isn't too big a surprise. I'd put The Director and Rob down as scum, along with Monkey, at this point. Tiger is just misguided as fuck.<br>\n<br>\nTiger's case says qwints is scummy because of 106 and 179. In 106, qwints says he got Monkey mislynched in a previous game. 100% null post. Like, there is no scum motivation for admitting you can mislynch the person you pushing for a lynch on. The town motivation? I can imagine a couple. Being open and honest about things, for one. Lynching qwints because of 106 is utterly retarded. As for 179, qwints is saying that, where prior to 179 he was pushing for a policy lynch (ie not having a solid position whether Monkey was scum or not), now he's pushing for a lynch on Monkey because Monkey is actually scummy. This is a perfectly legitimate change given Monkey's reactions to his wagon. qwints was evaluating Monkey's reactions to determine whether Monkey was scum or not, and he was being open about it, too. It is town behavior, nothing scummy. Tiger's case basically radiates crap all the way through. <br>\n<br>\nThe Director though is not just sheeping Tiger, his reasoning itself is scummy as hell. He basically goes back and forth, admits <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">he doesn't see why scum would \"paralyze the game with the policy lynch nonsense,\"</div> but then tries to fabricate some sort of explanation for why qwints would do that if he's scum. I bolded this because it is so scummy I can't believe anyone missed it. He doesn't think qwints is scummy but tries to rationalize a reason to believe qwints is scummy. For some reason. An Unstated Reason. This is where scum is seeping through. Because of course, if you start with the assumption that someone is scum, no shit you're gonna be able to fabricate reasons to conclude they're scum. Anyone can do that. <br>\n<br>\nThe question here is, what's the town motivation for assuming qwints is scum and then trying to come up with any reason to explain away something that you think is more town sided behavior than scum sided? The Director's vote is fucking horrid, and when Monkey flips guilty, this guy needs to hang next.

He basically repeats the same shit as Tiger, for which the same explanation can be offered. qwints said Monkey is pro-scum regardless of his affiliation so he wanted to policy lynch him.

Is it plausible town behavior? Yes, which is exactly what I explained in my post. 179 is null. The only way you can conclude qwints is scum is if you assume qwints is scum. In that case, of course you can find posts that are \"plausible\" from a scum perspective. It is bad scumhunting though.

However, in your post 412, you changed your vote to Carey with the reason \"Guy's a waste of space.\"<br>\n<br>\nWhat does \"Guy's a waste of space\" imply? Let's consider what this statement's syntax and diction choices imply about Carey. It implies that Carey does not belong in this game. It implies that Carey could be replaced by another, more useful player. What does it NOT imply? He has NOT contributed any opinions. He has NOT said anything worth consideration. Do any of these implications make Carey scummy? No -- they make him anti-town or at least a superbly inactive player.

For one, I don't like that this entire day he hasn't really put up a defense against the wagon against him. He also doesn't seem to be joining in on any in-depth analysis of posts to help find scum. It just doesn't seem like he's doing anything to help the town. I don't like that he's sitting back waiting to see how quickly the wagon against him builds momentum. He was also VERY quick to jump on the thenewearth wagon, the first wagon to begin to direct attention away from himself, and I see that entire wagon as baseless as nobody made a logical claim against thenewearth other than them being too new to get an accurate read.<br>\n<br>\nHiraki really seems to know what he's talking about, and I feel that whether I trust him or not, he's experienced enough to outsmart me as scum, so maybe I'm predisposed to wanting him to be town, but I feel he's leading the scumhunting too much to be scum. I don't really agree with his points against FourTrouble, though FourTrouble doesn't sit right with me either, so I'm assuming Hiraki town for now.<br>\n<br>\nFourTrouble seems to be trying to derail the wagon off of unseen, rather than prodding unseen harder to make a move to defend himself, which comes across as scummy to me, and I dont like that in #638 FT tries to lump unseen (and presumably implying himself) into the group of \"obvious\" towns. If anything, I can't get a decent read out of unseen because he won't defend himself, I certainly don't read him as obvious town.<br>\n<br>\nStill, if FourTrouble were trying to defend unseen as his scum-buddy, I don't think he would be as spoken about it, as it seems likely unseen will get lynched, which would make him pretty suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nunseen is the only person I'm convinced is scummy, until I get some sort of defense out of him, or at least who he thinks is scum.<br>\n<br>\nTheDirector - Also doesn't seem to be actively helping town.

Moving on:<br>\n<br>\n108 - says lots of reason to lynch Monkey, then backtracks in the same post to say the tell he has on Monkey is actually null but he wants to lynch him anyway.<br>\n111 - the first time so far that Hiraki does any scumhunting, directed towards Rob.<br>\n116 - continues his questioning of Rob, has tinge of towniness to it.<br>\n121 - kind of deflects Mozamis' question instead of answering it.<br>\n123 - backs off Rob.<br>\n128 - finally answers Mozamis' question instead of deflecting again.<br>\n134 - quotes Monkey, 0 content.<br>\n174 - asks us to lynch Monkey.<br>\n181 - gives us ultimatum to lynch Monkey or he will deal with it himself, says it's not a dayvig. Nonetheless, no real scumhunting or attempt to explain why Monkey should be lynched.<br>\n184 - just tells Monkey what he's doing.<br>\n<br>\nI want to point out at this time that Hiraki's posts throughout don't seem genuine at any point - as in literally there isn't a single point here where I get the feeling he actually believes Monkey is scum. There is also so far only 1-2 posts that show any sort of actual scumhunting. Moving on:<br>\n<br>\n193 - doesn't make sense, not sure what this post means.<br>\n291 - tiger says he doesn't like monkey wagon, Hiraki tells him to kill Monkey anyway.<br>\n293 - no content.<br>\n313 - says he's fine with either lynch, basically going along with whatever town decides.<br>\n331 - calls The Director town even though he's scummy as fuck.<br>\n390 - asks Carey to explain something, not really a very insightful question.<br>\n415 - just says newearth's behavior is usual noob stuff, which is just stating the obvious.<br>\n501 - asks for a vote count.<br>\n503 - asks for a vote count again.<br>\n506 - votes mozamis.<br>\n511 - says Elleran's vote is a \"bit late.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd D1 ends. So far, considering the sheer number of Hiraki's posts, there is almost no content to them and very little attempt to understand anyone's motivations. He just goes along with whatever wagon is popular, basically just active lurking. Now, D2 is where it gets really bad:<br>\n<br>\n525 - asks how Monkey is town.<br>\n529 - considers using WROD, whatever that means.<br>\n554 - asks if anyone can see the kill coming from unseen.<br>\n560 - votes unseen AFTER tiger votes unseen and gives Hiraki approval for his theory and vote.<br>\n584 - says unseen is scum because Elleran tunneled unseen (which is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">completely false</div> btw, Elleran voted unseen at the start of D1 and then dropped it). So here is the first instance where Hiraki is misrepresenting the way this game has gone. And now:<br>\n<br>\n591 - this is Hiraki's biggest post in the game content wise and it needs to be scrutinzed closely because it becomes apparent right away that Hiraki is scum. First, Hiraki calls everyone who voted for unseen nubtown. No reasoning here so its null. Then says the people who questioned the unseen wagon stay the same. No reasoning so its null. But his lynchpool leaves out Monkey and The New Earth for no apparent reason. It obviously isn't because they voted for unseen because others voted for unseen. So what's the reasoning there? There is none. It conflicts with Hiraki's insistence that Monkey was scum on D1 + asking how Monkey is town at the start of D2 (which implied he didn't think that was the case). Says he thinks Rob is town, director is town, and therefore scum must be between myself, unseen, and Tajo. Here's where the inconsistencies pop up: next he says he thinks here is an SK plus a two team mafia. Then says he can't see it being 2-2-9. Okay, but why an SK and not a 3 person team mafia. This shows us two things. One, it betrays knowledge that the mafia team is only 2 people. Hiraki is completely certain it is not 3 people, which is something only mafia could know. Second, his theory makes no sense because there was only 1 night kill, so why theorize an SK plus two team mafia instead of a single 3 team mafia? He must KNOW that the mafia is 2 people. Then he votes for me. A terrible vote, not just because I know I'm town, but because for the first time all game he offers some reasoning behind it, and it's fucking awful. Let's analyze his reasoning: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4746064#p4746064\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4746064#p4746064\" data-post-id=\"4746064\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 591</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14406\">Hiraki</a> wrote:</cite>For having a keen defense of unseen while never speaking about him in D1. He's basically been tunneling. Especially on Rob with little to no reasoning and just gut for the entirety of the game.</div></blockquote><br>\nI've already explained the problem here before but I'll go over it again. There is nothing scummy about defending someone you haven't spoken about. The fact I didn't speak about the guy makes it quite evident I didn't think he was scum. What is worse though is the second part of his reasoning. I was tunneling on Monkey, this is true, but it's also what Hiraki himself was doing for the vast majority of D1. I want this to sink in: he's calling me scummy for what he himself was doing. This is really what gives him away as scum, it's something I myself sometimes do when I'm scum - I call people out for doing what I'm doing. This is a major scum-tell. The final part of his reasoning is also a misrepresentation of the game, because I never tunneled on Rob. In fact, I voted him for the first time on D2 and the claim that I did it with no reason and just on gut for the entire game is completely 100% false. This cannot be ignored.<br>\n<br>\nIf you aren't convinced at this point that Hiraki is scum, then I dunno what to tell you guys. Anyway, moving on:<br>\n<br>\n594 - His reasoning betrays more knowledge that only scum would have. How? Take a look at the post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4746272#p4746272\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4746272#p4746272\" data-post-id=\"4746272\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 594</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14406\">Hiraki</a> wrote:</cite>Also, if some of you guys need more proof that Monkey/thenewearth/tigerzone are nubtown, just look at how they voted inline.<br>\n<br>\nNubscum would be cautious--don't want to die scenario.</div></blockquote><br>\nHe's saying they are all nubtown instead of nubscum but why insist they are \"nub\" to begin with? Newearth is obviously noob but Monkey and Tiger are not. The only explanation I see here, and maybe I'm biased, is that Hiraki KNOWS they aren't mafia so to explain his town-read on them he's creating a false dichotomy between nubtown and nubscum, and excluding the possibility that these three are neither of those. The creation of the false dichotomy is where you see that Hiraki knows something more than he shouldn't since he's beginning with the assumption that they are noobs, and this assumption only makes sense if you make the prior assumption that they are town since their play - at least Monkey and Tiger - does not indicate that they are as nub as Hiraki is painting them as.<br>\n<br>\n596 - tells Monkey he stands alone.<br>\n598 - no game content.<br>\n601 - no game content.<br>\n603 - says \"LYNCHPOOL\" should clear everything up.<br>\n607 - quotes Rob to challenge my vote on him.<br>\n<br>\n611 - this is just priceless. Hiraki says he did a reaction test for town. What is his reaction test? He saw a connection between Elleran and unseen (which I've already pointed out isn't true), voted unseen on this basis, and then everyone who followed he called town. WTF? If it isn't true, then the people who didn't follow (Rob and me in particular) are the people who are actually reading the game carefully instead of just mindlessly joining any wagon. How does Hiraki's so-called \"reaction test\" show that these people are town? It makes literally no sense, which is why it took me so long to finally realize what he was talking about here. Anyway, again a terrible post that makes no sense from a town point of view.<br>\n613 - here he \"admits\" his reaction test has no guarantee of success, then claims it worked anyway. lolwut? Where's the logic, the reasoning? Or the motivation-seeking? Nowhere because there is none. It makes no sense whatsoever. If anything, his reaction-test is more likely to find scum than town because it just exposes people who don't read the game carefully, who are typically scum.<br>\n619 - Just says he's sure I'm scum, not sure about anyone else.<br>\n621 - Tries to explain my towny behavior as something scum would because he says he's done similar as scum \"at the edge of death.\" I want to emphasize this part because: the behavior Hiraki is talking about occurred when I was nowhere near the edge of death. Besides the fact that at this point Hiraki isn't actually supplying any reason to think my behavior is scummy, he's just trying to justify my town-tells as things that could come from scum and he's doing that by just saying its stuff he would do as scum... as if somehow that means everyone would do it or its something that is more likely to come from scum than town.<br>\n623 - continues trying to push the same idea as in 621. Nothing town motivated about his post, doing everything he can to ignore facing the possibility I am town.<br>\n642 - Hiraki refuses to answer my questions. I attempted to understand his thought process because to make sure he was scum and not misguided town, and he just refuses to even engage with me at all.<br>\n653 - tells qwints to explain something.<br>\n<br>\n656 - this post. Hiraki actually says that he was NOT doing a reaction-test. When I think it is quite clear he was doing a reaction test. Take a look at 611. The reaction-test was 100% premeditated according to the story Hiraki tells in that post. Furthermore, Hiraki says my reaction to the test was good. Huh? His story and posts don't make any sense. There is no consistency to anything he's saying anymore. If my reaction was good, why did he suddenly decide to vote for me AFTER that? Especially when he wasn't voting for me prior to it? What made him vote for me when recent evidence suggested I was town? The narrative he's trying to construct is falling apart right here. He also says I have to die instead of unseen/Tajo because people want me to die. I want this to sink in as well because it is yet another inconsistency in Hiraki's thought process. He says that he's happy with any of those three dying but because people want me to die, that's who he's going for. Which makes no sense because actually, prior to voting for me, there were more votes on unseen, so why switch to me? What caused that? The sole fact I was defending unseen?<br>\n658 - fluff about twilight<br>\n667 - makes no sense here because qwints is pointing out what Hiraki is doing and Hiraki is responding with a nonsensical interpretaion of qwints' posts.<br>\n669 - no content. <br>\n685 - Hiraki backtracks and says his vote on unseen was a reaction test. He also deflects my questions yet again. Instead of answering them, he just calls me scummy for asking the question in the first place. The most hilarious part about this post is the following part:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4757054#p4757054\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4757054#p4757054\" data-post-id=\"4757054\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 685</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14406\">Hiraki</a> wrote:</cite>My opinion is my own and you are trying to fight against it by fighting me rather than finding actual scum. If you still think I'm scum for giving a vote, according to you, with no evidence, then do you think I am absolute shit at scum?</div></blockquote><br>\nHiraki says I'm fighting with him instead of finding actual scum. Except, I'm actually asking Hiraki questions and trying to understand his thought process. What is Hiraki doing? Calling me scum, offering no reasoning for that other than his so-called lynchpool, deflecting my questions, misrepresenting me (since I'm not fighting with him but actually trying to understand his thought process here). The question he asks me at the end here is not only pure WIFOM but also incoherent: he's asking me if I think he's shit at being scum for voting me without a vote, but if he's <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">actually</div> town, wouldn't that mean I think he's good at being scum since he's playing exactly the same as he plays as town? Think about this because his question, however you spin, comes from a scum point of view. If he were town, he would take the fact I think he is scum as a compliment to his scum play.<br>\n<br>\n688 - doesn't really provide any content.<br>\n705 - says if unseen isn't scum, scum is gonna wagon it, which still gives no explanation for why he switched from unseen to me.<br>\n707 - no content.<br>\n710 - no content, just buddying with Rob.<br>\n713 - says The Director is right about things.<br>\n715 - no content.<br>\n719 - no content<br>\n724 - gives his reads, no content behind them.<br>\n<br>\nAnd that concludes my analysis of Hiraki's behavior this game. On D1, he actively lurks and joins the most popular wagons with no reasoning provided of his own, and does almost no scumhunting whatsoever. On D2, he votes me for doing what he himself was doing (hypocrisy), but even worse, goes on to misrepresent me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd actually, I just noticed that Hiraki's misrepresentation of me, that I gave no reasoning for my reads and was going purely on gut, actually applies to himself much more than it applies to me.
