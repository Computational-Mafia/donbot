General Etiquette</div><br>\na) Mafia is a game. Enjoy yourself! Being respectful will ensure other people also enjoy the game.<br>\nb) I don't like personal attacks, so try to keep your tone and insults low. If the other player requests you to stop, cease that type of behavior immediately. I reserve the right to modkill a player for any action should they not listen to a warning. Modkilling turns the alignment of a player into neutral survivor and removes them from the game.<br>\nc) You have been given a win condition. You are expected to play towards that win condition.<br>\nd) I am human, I can make mistakes. It is my first time modding. Please inform me if I do.<br>\ne) If you would like me to notice something in game, please post it in the format Mod: Hi! or I may miss it.<br>\nf) Please do not post in the game if you are not a player.<br>\ng) I reserve the right to change or update any rules.<br>\nh)I will be using <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_action_resolution\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> to determine action results at night.<br>\ni) Any of the roles specifically <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_game\" class=\"postlink\">listed as Normal on The Wiki</a>. In addition, there may be one other role that does not appear on that page but does not use any explicitly non-normal mechanics.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2. Communication</div><br>\na) Do not discuss this game outside of this thread unless explicitly specified. This would be a serious offence otherwise<br>\nb) Do not quote your role PM or any moderator related communications. Paraphrasing is acceptable. Don't push it.<br>\nc) If you die, you are permitted one \"bah\" post with no game related content.<br>\nd) If you die, you will be given access to a dead quicktopic. Do not share this link with anyone.<br>\ne) Do not use any invisible/hard to read text or cryptography. <br>\nf) If you have the ability to edit you posts, don't. I will gladly edit any minor mistakes if you request it.<br>\ng) Mod posts will be in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">bold purple.</div></div> Please do not use this color. Doing so may rsult in me crying a manly tear or a modkill if you are Hoppster (seriously, don't use this colour)<br>\nh) Flavor is provided purely for your entertainment purposes. I reserve the right to be lazy and not provide any flavor at all. This probably won't happen though since my flavour is so awesome<br>\ni) Do not post if the thread is open if the mod has declared a lynch/opening scene is incoming.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3. Voting</div><br>\na) Votes must be bolded or in vote tags at the start of a line. I take no responsibility if your vote is not acknowledged if it is camouflaged in a wall of text.<br>\nb) Unvotes are nice but are not necessary.<br>\nc) Do not abuse voting to intentionally mislead other players. This includes fake hammers and such.<br>\nd) Abbreviations are acceptable as long as it is obvious who you are referring to.<br>\ne) A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1.<br>\nf) Posting is allowed in twilight, between the time a hammer is delivered and when I waltz in and kill the poor person.<br>\ng) Votes posted after the deadline has elapsed will not be counted.<br>\nh) If no majority is reached by the deadline, a No Lynch will occur.<br>\ni) A no lynch requires 50% of the votes, rounded up<br>\nj) Votes by a player being replaced are defaulted to not voiting upon the replacement's arrival.<br>\nk) Fake hammers or encrypted votes are illegal<br>\nl) Self-votes are frowned upon as they are against your win con<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4. Deadlines and Activity</div><br>\na) Day 1 will be 3 weeks. All subsequent days will have deadlines of 2 weeks.<br>\nb) Night 1 will have a deadline of 72 hours and all subsequent nights will have a deadline of 48 hours.<br>\nc) You may request a deadline extension, it will require at least half of the majority of living players (minimum 2 players) to agree. Each extension will be no longer than 72 hours.<br>\nd) I may grant deadline extensions at my own discretion depending on the game situation, and replacements as such.<br>\ne) I reserve the right to shorten deadlines if game activity is minimal.<br>\nf) If no night actions are submitted by the time the maximum deadline expires, you will forfeit your action.<br>\ng) All night actions follow the Natural Action Resolution system unless otherwise specified.<br>\nh) Please aim to post at least every 48 hours. You will receive a prod if you do not post within a 72 hour interval. You have 24 hours to respond to the prod via in-game post (or PM if thread locked) before you are replaced.<br>\ni) You will be automatically replaced if you receive 3 prods, or 2 prods in the same game day.<br>\nj) Please announce all V/LA's in thread or via PM. I will keep track of all V/LA's in vote counts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sample VT role PM</div><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div><br>\n<br>\nYou are a Regular townsperson, and you have no special powers at night (Sorry).

Furthermore, there are other posters with even fewer posts, but they strike me as disengaged, which makes the lurking less of a scum-tell, and more indicative of possible disengagement altogether.

Which to me is unlikely case since that would only give one less of a killing role to knock off the scum. That is why he is either covering that he is a full on vil/SK or using it a sa  cover up as a mafia member. <br>\nb) Trying to use a pro-town role to cover up his tracks. He also backed down on the Emp thing. In fact Emp is now laying low also, well not posting really.<br>\nc) He may be a town and telling the truth. This is the one i really do not believe in.

Everybody starts at 50. Because I don't believe in towntells and am skeptical about most scumtells, it is common for people to stay at 50. 50 does not mean \"no opinion\" - it means \"I don't see scumtells\" from this person. Absent claims, need for deadline compromises, etc. I will always vote the person with the highest score. <br>\n<br>\n52: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toro+5</div> The discussion about Empking is just pure conspiracy argument and planting doubt where there is no cause for it to exist - coupled with the passive \"Don't take this as me wanting to get rid of Empking right off the bat but it's certainly something to think about.\"<br>\n59: Defence here makes me comfortable with the above points. \"I'm merely throwing the thought out there, it's not a weak thought at all.\" There are an infinite number of possible thoughts that you can raise in this game. Raising something inherently means that you think (or want other people to think) that it has some special legitimacy. This is why \"I'm just speculating\" is NEVER an explanation for raising something - because by raising it you are implying that you have some good reason for thinking that it stands out above background noise possibilities. <br>\n63: I'm giving another <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toro+5</div> here for a piss-weak defence. First, he says \"It's not like I'm the only person here who considers this a possibility\" as if the fact that other people are thinking that way excuses him. Secondly, there is a (weak) contradiction in that he now says \"Would a vote legitimize my <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">case</div> for you?\" [italics mine]. If he had a \"case\", why,in 52 and 59, does he present it like merely curious speculation?<br>\n66: Why is it that \"As of now I'm going to re-read back through the thread and look at all of the different conflicts going on.\" read like \"Shit, need to find something else to talk about\"? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"><br>\n70: And now it's a \"strong possibility\".

I still think he is lying. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat is actually suspicious about it though - in the sense of being more likely to scum from scum-Empking than town-Empking? The reason is perfectly valid; if you are a player who is likely to be investigated, that's all the more reason for claiming miller (aside from, as EK also noted, it being the generally-accepted thing). Yes, he could be scum who claimed miller to pre-empt an investigation - but that doesn't actually make it more likely than not that he is actually scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite><br>\nVollkan: I hate his scumhunting style and I feel it's competely arbitrary but that probably doesn't make him scum in every game, so ignore this.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nPanzer, maybe I can change your mind on this:<br>\n<br>\n1) Plenty of players will post lists of every other player, classifying them as \"really scummy\", \"slightly scummy\", \"neutral\", \"leaning town\", etc (or by just listing players in order of suspicion) My system is not fundamentally different from that style of ranking. The list that I post is essentially the same, except that the rankings are represented by numerical points.<br>\n2) The only way my system differs is that my reasons for suspecting people are always explicitly stated and easy to find, because they are signified by the addition of points. In other words, most people might say \"This action is really scummy\", which then will result in a player getting a scummier ranking, though it will always be unclear exactly how strong that particular scumtell was; my system just lets me clearly link  each individual scumtell to changes in a person's ranking.<br>\n3) Also, the point values themselves are also not particularly arbitrary. In order for my system to have any credibility (and for me not to get picked to shreds when I use it), I have to ensure that the point values remain reasonably consistent. Thus, I will almost always give 5 points for ordinary scumtells, 7 points for moderately serious scumtells and 10 points for very serious scumtells. I don't pretend that this is an exact science, and I'll readily admit that I do manipulate the points in my scum games, but, on the whole, it's certainly no less arbitrary than when most people say \"this action is scummy\", without specifying any degree of magnitude for that scumtell.", "time": "Wed Jun 22, 2011 1:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17792&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "17792"}

The list that I post is essentially the same, except that the rankings are represented by numerical points.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2)</div> The only way my system differs is that my reasons for suspecting people are always explicitly stated and easy to find, because they are signified by the addition of points. In other words, most people might say \"This action is really scummy\", which then will result in a player getting a scummier ranking, though it will always be unclear exactly how strong that particular scumtell was; my system just lets me clearly link  each individual scumtell to changes in a person's ranking.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3)</div> Also, the point values themselves are also not particularly arbitrary. In order for my system to have any credibility (and for me not to get picked to shreds when I use it), I have to ensure that the point values remain reasonably consistent. Thus, I will almost always give 5 points for ordinary scumtells, 7 points for moderately serious scumtells and 10 points for very serious scumtells. I don't pretend that this is an exact science, and I'll readily admit that I do manipulate the points in my scum games, but, on the whole, it's certainly no less arbitrary than when most people say \"this action is scummy\", without specifying any degree of magnitude for that scumtell.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1) Having a constant list of you think is scummy is bad. I try to avoid using these list all together because it give town too much information. If you and 2/3 other players are constantly stating who the most town players are, they have a good consensus of who they should kill. And it helps them know exactly where they are on the radar, which is another very dangerous thing<br>\n2)So are most good players's reasons. Sometimes I commit this crime because I'm lazy, but everyone for the most part should do this.<br>\n3) This is where I hate it. The points are easily manipulatable because the degrees are subjective. Also, two people commiting the same scumtell could be two varying degrees of bad or even one could be a scumtell and one couldn't. Essentially with the point skeem/scoreboard, you can manipulate far easier. Also I feel it makes you detached from your vote. \"I'm just voting the scummiest person, look at the scoreboard).

Why do people think the claim is scummy, i don't see why.<br>\n<br>\nand Volkan is scummy because he uses a different scumhunting approach? how does this work either?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, it seemed more that he claimed because he is prolific than because it was the right thing to do. He even pretty much stated so later. Something very close to \"I figured I would get an investigation and I didn't want it to lead to a mislynch\". That reads as scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I do find his approach scummy but I already admitted that it doesn't make him scum in every game.<br>\n<br>\n@Vollkan:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite><br>\nVollkan: I hate his scumhunting style and I feel it's competely arbitrary but that probably doesn't make him scum in every game, so ignore this.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nPanzer, maybe I can change your mind on this:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1) </div>Plenty of players will post lists of every other player, classifying them as \"really scummy\", \"slightly scummy\", \"neutral\", \"leaning town\", etc (or by just listing players in order of suspicion) My system is not fundamentally different from that style of ranking. The list that I post is essentially the same, except that the rankings are represented by numerical points.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2)</div> The only way my system differs is that my reasons for suspecting people are always explicitly stated and easy to find, because they are signified by the addition of points. In other words, most people might say \"This action is really scummy\", which then will result in a player getting a scummier ranking, though it will always be unclear exactly how strong that particular scumtell was; my system just lets me clearly link  each individual scumtell to changes in a person's ranking.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3)</div> Also, the point values themselves are also not particularly arbitrary. In order for my system to have any credibility (and for me not to get picked to shreds when I use it), I have to ensure that the point values remain reasonably consistent. Thus, I will almost always give 5 points for ordinary scumtells, 7 points for moderately serious scumtells and 10 points for very serious scumtells. I don't pretend that this is an exact science, and I'll readily admit that I do manipulate the points in my scum games, but, on the whole, it's certainly no less arbitrary than when most people say \"this action is scummy\", without specifying any degree of magnitude for that scumtell.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1) Having a constant list of you think is scummy is bad. I try to avoid using these list all together because it give town too much information. If you and 2/3 other players are constantly stating who the most town players are, they have a good consensus of who they should kill. And it helps them know exactly where they are on the radar, which is another very dangerous thing<br>\n2)So are most good players's reasons. Sometimes I commit this crime because I'm lazy, but everyone for the most part should do this.<br>\n3) This is where I hate it. The points are easily manipulatable because the degrees are subjective. Also, two people commiting the same scumtell could be two varying degrees of bad or even one could be a scumtell and one couldn't. Essentially with the point skeem/scoreboard, you can manipulate far easier. Also I feel it makes you detached from your vote. \"I'm just voting the scummiest person, look at the scoreboard).

I went with it. That sorts out those fake vig claims really quick, especially from a player as scummy as Toro.<br>\n2) I don't like replacements in general. They are a necessary but  heavy burden. Elfen was straight unreadable because he was an idiot. I don't care if fucking Yosarian or Glork replace in, they aren't gonna make Elfen less of an idiot, even if they play the straight up townest game one can play. The spot is still tainted. And If we choose to clear the idiocy, we could be giving the scum a pass and the game. This is an awkward view, but (since you are on about meta too) meta me. I think PBuG and most other players who have played with me(which is still most the game) can attest to the fact that I hold replacement spots as far more scummy then regular spots. Most people that replace out are either caught scum or someone who never showed up in the beginning. Also, we established that Toro should be shooting Jakesh.<br>\n3) I don't think those are weird views. You can't predict behavior based on such a small sample size. If I get in a fight when I'm drunk, it's unfair to assume I always fight when i'm drunk based on one incident. Why do you think psychologist use samples of 100s even 1000s in their studies? Because 1 incident doesn't mean there is a correalation. Also didn't we go over the weird=/=scummy thing before(this applies to 2 and 3)?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, is tunneling the only thing you stop lurking to do?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1) This makes no sense. The problem with self-vigging is obvious - if they are lying, they will not do it, and if they are telling the truth they SHOULDN'T do it. I also don't see why you bring up the fact that EK suggested it first. How is that at all relevant to your actions?<br>\n2) I agree with you here (see the fact that Elfen's replacement keeps ELfen's points).Though, I don't think you are really responding to Sundy's points which is that you \"Says that Elfen replacement cannot change what Elfen did, even though...he said that there is no real evidence either way on Elfen\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hiplop wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vollkan wrote:</cite> I don't get how you can not like meta and yet be prepared to make a meta argument based off only a couple of games.

Even if they don't have a RBer they can influence the kill during the day to someone who is town and say \"welp, at least we got rid of a town lurker.\" Giving scum advanced knowledge of specific night actions only helps scum and not town because they have more information about night actions to begin with.</div></blockquote><br>\nNote: the blue text by Hoppster was added much later than the initial quote, under the pretense of explaining how I am not reading his post when he is talking about completely different roles in both instances.

Don't like it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThree points:<br>\n1) The fact that I use a numerical system tends to exaggerate my null reads in two ways. First, obviously, it means that my null reads are all explicitly stated (whereas most people will only post their town or scum reads). Second, more subtly, it cuts out a lot of nuance - I'm confident I've given my opinions on every significant matter where you might reasonably expect me to hold a position other than a nullread; needless to say, my points chart won't reflect those opinions. I completely admit that I have a much greater than average rate of null reads (see below: this is a meta trait of mine), but I still think that my system exaggerates it.<br>\n<br>\n2) Have a look across basically any of my games, and you'll more likely than not see both: a) That I frequently have many people at 50 (see also my PSA where I warned of this in advance); and b) People complaining about the significant number of null reads.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: 3) Somewhat lengthy underlying theory explanation</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">3) Theorywise, I think it is ultimately a consequence of my admittedly unusual way of determining tells. Basically, I have the fairly standard starting point of defining a [scum/town] tell as \"any action more likely to come from [scum/town] than [town/scum]\". The big difference is that, because I don't think there is any reliable way to determine more likely (a probabilistic concept) and because I have an inherent scepticism of anecdotal arguments my basic test is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">whether or not any given action could reasonably come from a [town/scum] player, with all the known meta characteristics of the player in question and allowing for reasonable levels of error</div>. <br>\n<br>\nBecause it is almost ALWAYS reasonable for scum to take ostensibly pro-town actions, I don't (at least for almost all practical purposes) believe in behavioural towntells. <br>\n<br>\nLikewise, for me to consider something to be a scumtell, it basically has to be something that I don't think could reasonably come from town. <br>\n<br>\nThis <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2776979#p2776979\" class=\"postlink\">recent example I found a few weeks ago</a> (where I was referred to in a game that I wasn't actually even in) comes to mind here:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Weatherman wrote:</cite> <blockquote><div><cite>RC wrote:</cite> I'd really prefer a Runner lynch to anything on the table right now, but I know I don't have the energy or the capital to commit to a battle against him. I don't see Spyrex as voting Gorrad illegitimately here. He's fluffing his way through the first part of the game. His vote on Cyberbob is kind of lame. [etc etc]<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThe double negative is gut scummy, and is RC really one of the <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vollkan-Netopalis school of \"legitimate\" and \"illegitimate\"?</div> I only forgive that mindset based on case by case meta history - only certain kinds of rare town players read the game as objectively classifying cases as \"legitimate\" and \"illegitimate\" (I think the mindset has gaping holes), but it's a convenient MO as a scum player. <br>\n</div></blockquote> <br>\n<br>\nFrom what I can gather from the context, this is a reference to my tendency to ignore (alignment-wise) anything that I can reasonably/legitimately see as coming from town.

When it is not directed, they do not know if the target is going to be their team or not. Even if they don't have a RBer they can influence the kill during the day to someone who is town and say \"welp, at least we got rid of a town lurker.\" Giving scum advanced knowledge of specific night actions only helps scum and not town because they have more information about night actions to begin with.</div></blockquote><br>\nOh.

Mine has, at worst, the death of one townie. Calling someone scum based on a town flip is exponentially more scummy for that very reason and the fact that it has more inside information than mine (unless I am scum with both of the two I proposed as being scum together).<br>\n<br>\nIn the suggestion of two people being scum together (one explicitly because the other flips scum) the best case scenario is we get two dead scum. In the worst case scenario we get one dead townie. In your scenario the best case scenario will yield you one dead townie and one scum while the worst case scenario yields two dead townies. In the event that Hoppster did flip town what would we have lost? One town member and the secondary case I had on you. That's why I wasn't big on pushing you in addition to Hoppster since the only read I had on you at the time was in relationship to him, so I was content to just throw the occasional thing out to you to see how you would respond.<br>\n<br>\nAnd LOL at the wide net of suspicion comment.

Really vague and just mentions \"I've stepped back and reread other areas. Doesn't tell us those areas, and clearly sees it as a plan B lynch<br>\n<br>\nHe then doesn't realize that Sleepy is l-2 and can't hop on, so settles for trying to force a claim. <br>\n<br>\nMost townies know how many votes their number two suspects have, and it just seems like he's trying to earn townie points by showing interest in waning moments of Sleepy's life. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Oh. I thought he was L-1. <br>\n<br>\nVOTE: SleepyKrew</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is the post he votes him on.

If he really believed that opinion he would have thought my actions were scummy independent of that, since I repeatedly quoted and referenced Hoppsters posts that apparently now condemn me. Furthermore, by this time he had already read the thread in entirety what appears to be three times so my level of scumminess should have been apparent through any one of those rereads in the context of the entire game. Plus, your predecessors behavior (which you seem to agree upon). <br>\n<br>\nCan you articulate your case on me? Why do you think I am \"bloody scummy\"? I have yet to see a coherent post (from anyone) explaining how my behaviors are more likely to come from scum.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Monk</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Going back to Hoppster, I really dislike how he has been relatively unengaged with the game once I stopped pressuring him. Essentially, his entire D2 has revolved around asking people why nobody listened to him about SleepyKrew or why nobody is explaining why there were ignoring him. There have been some other peripheral comments (some in relationship to his large font SleepyKrew condemnation) and some other non committal comments. If Hoppster is scum with SleepyKrew then he could have just started pushing him while he was under attack to save face, maybe save himself, or if he did flip to clear SleepyKrew. <br>\n<br>\nThe whole \"let's talk about yesterday\" attitude is underwhelming and not constructive unless he identified people who he thought was deliberately ignoring him to save SleepyKrew (as town would do); which hasn't happened. His only concern appears to be that he be recognized as the driving force on SleepyKrew.<br>\n<br>\nI also forgot about the question he asked asking everyone for their read on volkkan. What was the point of this question? We all knew he flipped town so what exactly was he trying to get at here? Again, if there was something to indicate scum from this question why was there no follow up? It is just a fluff question otherwise. Plus, the whole railing on me for something he says is a null tell and then talking about his blood boiling is interesting.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">And I guess I shouldn't be surprised by now that Panzer has once again avoided responding to my commentary on his claim/voting record... <blockquote><div><cite>xvart, 965 wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Panzer</div> - No response to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3238376#p3238376\" class=\"postlink\">your obvious voting motivation failure</a> in conjunction with flipped scum and your alleged inside knowledge?

Now that I've called you out for never following up on your \"HEY WHY WAS NOBODY LISTENING TO ME YESTERDAY???\" with no follow up or determination of people ignoring you being indicative of scum you bust out how I was selectively not responding, implying scum motivation? When I have someone pegged as scum I rarely listen to them and who they think is scum as their opinion can be sorted out as a bus or whatever after they flip.

With no follow up to that line of questioning it seems awfully close to just wanting to show off how you were the proponent of SleepyKrew lynch and nothing else.

Not lynching someone who has committed such atrocious scumtells flies in the face of all reason. Regardless of all the contradictions that Panzer has done and his overall scummy behavior the sole fact that he didn't want to lynch SleepyKrew on D1 when he thought SleepyKrew was being serious with his mason miller claim and knew there wouldn't be two mason groups in the same game is basically claiming scum in my book. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 991 wrote:</cite>This is entirely untrue.

I still want to go back and research Panzer's archived games to dig up his mason experience (since his town mindset is to do the absolute minimum to prove he is town when under suspicion). Also, if it comes down to lynching a VT, I would highly suggest lynching Monk instead due to his obvious disconnect and voting patterns. People that do not have consistent voting are more likely to be scum.

And I agree that when reviewing interactions with people you cannot fully judge intent without surrounding context, but in your first read through, if that is something you really believed was true and a scumtell, it should have been obvious at that point, and not only later after ISOing each player individually. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monk, 998 wrote:</cite>You still haven't answered my question as to the town motivation behind misrepresentation of players and their cases on you.</div></blockquote>I'll play along even though the conversation, as I have said, should be distinctly about scum motivations as that is what I have been talking about the entire game. Generally speaking, if something isn't inherently town motivated does not mean it is scum motivated either. Also, for this thought experiment I will assume that I was deliberatly misrepresenting players and their cases (which is far from true considering I got Hoppster up to L-2 without any real accusation of my behavior being as such until recently).<br>\n<br>\nThe town motivation of tenacity and deliberate misrepping someone includes: building a lynch mob against someone who is scummy, gathering votes for someone who is scummy, unequivocally expressing reads, behaving in a transparent manner with voting intentions, not waffling on reads, and putting scum in a corner of which it is difficult to back out.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 999 wrote:</cite>And I'm just flat not reading or responding to xvart's post for the entirity of him being on this game.

And, I have no problem with you ignoring me because I'm not trying to convince you that you are scum; only everyone else. It's almost better this way because as it only makes you look scummier. Town members would have no problem responding to simple questions about their behaviors, motivations, and intents because it would help everyone else develop reads and adjust their hunting of scum accordingly; especially when shown to have a huge contradiction in game knowledge and subsequent voting. The real reason I think you are avoiding answering the question about your lack of vote on SleepyKrew when you knew he wasn't a mason and you thought his claim was serious is that you don't have an answer and you are hoping it gets swept under the rug because crazy xvart is being crazy.<br>\n<br>\nOn a further note, town would want to provide information to help lynch people they think is town. In this case, you think I am scum for my scummy attacks on Hoppster and you. But you still haven't clarified why you agreed with most of my case on Hoppster and then only came around to thinking I was scummy for those cases when you were getting my attention. Your whole argument about me making scummy cases is undermined by the fact that you agreed with most of my case on Hoppster up until I started attacking you, when it became convienent to save yourself to pretend it was a pattern of behavior for me. Since you aren't willing to help make that case and clarify your intentions it appears that you don't really believe that I am scum or you don't really care to get me lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">I went back through Panzer's games in the MS achives and looked through every game he played in with masons.

There is no reason why Panzer should have not been voting <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">anyone but</div> SleepyKrew, even if he didn't want to out himself as a mason. The icing on the cake is SleepyKrew flipped scum.

I have stated this and you haven't seemed to comment on it, more misrep of someone who is actively participating with you. So let me put this out clearly:<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">What on earth is the TOWN reason for blatant misrepresentation of someone and distraction tactics of going, oh look over there \"have a post wall where I've chopped and changed the friggin case on me beyond recognition\"</fieldset></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>monk, 1013 wrote:</cite>while I don't agree with your motivation to misrep, you do agree that you have been, town enough for the moment<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TheFool</span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>monk, 1025 wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xvart</span><br>\n<br>\nStop saying words and die scum, even if you're town you are being incredibly antitown and need to be removed from the game</div></blockquote><br>\nThis progression is fascinating. Monk is convinced I am scum. I explain hypothetical reasons for misrepping someone as town and he drops his vote based on me \"being town enough for the moment.\" Then, Hoppster says I need to be policy lynched at which point Monk comes back around and says \"even if your town\" I need to die. The really crazy part is the fact that he dropped his vote because I provided some town reasons for misrepping someone, whereas he doesn't even discuss or elaborate on the scum motivation behind misrepping (reminder: we had been having a round robin about motivation and intent). I even pointed out his flaw in questioning me regarding the town motivation for misrepping where he never assigned any scum motivation. This voting pattern looks suspiciously like scum voting townie, then he gets called scum for him voting with poor reasons, backs off for terrible reasons, then votes after someone else opens a different door (policy lynch).<br>\n<br>\nAnd, not that it matters in the grand scheme of things, but I don't recall every saying anything along the lines of me being \"picked on\" because I have been verbose.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, they are highly unlikely to be scum together due to Panzer being linked with Thomith; unless there are four scum (which might explain Panzer fake claiming mason, but that is pretty tin foil hat). At this point, I would almost argue for a no lynch but I don't see that helping town in the long run because D3 would just be D2 all over again. While I won't self hammer I see that, given my wagon size and the deadline, you should lynch me. <br>\n<br>\nOn a final note, I realize that I have alienated people based on my tenacity and for that I apologize. It has obviously had a negative effect that I did not foresee. While I was trying to build lynches on scum I was simultaneously defeating my own cause due to people's reluctance to join me.

I want to pretend that was a clever gambit to make sure scum left me alive.</div></blockquote><br>\nActually, by that time I had picked up that something was going on; it just seemed out of place compared to us going toe to toe D1 which is why I tried to throw it back in your face, in case you were a power role. I didn't ever expect you to get lynched but found that stuff that might cast a little bit of suspicion on you and keep you alive.<br>\n<br>\nAnd again, sorry about D1. No hard feelings I hope. Coming into the game I had just busted two scum in another game in subsequent days so my ego was a little inflated with my scumhunting abilities compared to my usual mediocre play, so that had something to do with it. Note to everyone if you really want me to get on your case just go straight for the ad homs, you aren't reading stuff, etc.; although to be fair, I guess I really wasn't reading, but I found it hard to see the motivation behind the posted ISO... Anyways, once someone (I think Hoppster) explicitly pointed out how I wasn't reading it clicked with me because just saying \"you aren't reading\" doesn't do much for me, especially if I think you are scum, because I read it the exact same way. Anyways, no harm no foul. The good thing about going full court press on someone is it puts everyone else in a tough spot in deciding how to come down on it. <br>\n<br>\nThis game reminded me a lot of the game I linked earlier where I steam rolled the town by doing the same thing and fighting tooth and nail for a townie lynch. Although we still won it was really interesting because I was a doctor and a town jailkeeper had already flipped; scum kept me around because they thought I was going to be an easy mislynch and town wouldn't lynch me because they thought my behavior was so pro town despite there being two protective roles. When the part where I obviously didn't read what Hoppster was saying was pointed out at me I took a hard step back and thought about that game and decided I needed to be more careful and not torpedo the town again.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I apologize to anyone (and everyone) who was turned off by me, and this game isn't my typical playstyle.", "time": "Sun Jul 24, 2011 1:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17792&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "17792"}
