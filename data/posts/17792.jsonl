General Etiquette</span><br>a) Mafia is a game. Enjoy yourself! Being respectful will ensure other people also enjoy the game.<br>b) I don't like personal attacks, so try to keep your tone and insults low. If the other player requests you to stop, cease that type of behavior immediately. I reserve the right to modkill a player for any action should they not listen to a warning. Modkilling turns the alignment of a player into neutral survivor and removes them from the game.<br>c) You have been given a win condition. You are expected to play towards that win condition.<br>d) I am human, I can make mistakes. It is my first time modding. Please inform me if I do.<br>e) If you would like me to notice something in game, please post it in the format Mod: Hi! or I may miss it.<br>f) Please do not post in the game if you are not a player.<br>g) I reserve the right to change or update any rules.<br>h)I will be using <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_action_resolution\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> to determine action results at night.<br>i) Any of the roles specifically <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_game\" class=\"postlink\">listed as Normal on The Wiki</a>. In addition, there may be one other role that does not appear on that page but does not use any explicitly non-normal mechanics.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2. Communication</span><br>a) Do not discuss this game outside of this thread unless explicitly specified. This would be a serious offence otherwise<br>b) Do not quote your role PM or any moderator related communications. Paraphrasing is acceptable. Don't push it.<br>c) If you die, you are permitted one \"bah\" post with no game related content.<br>d) If you die, you will be given access to a dead quicktopic. Do not share this link with anyone.<br>e) Do not use any invisible/hard to read text or cryptography. <br>f) If you have the ability to edit you posts, don't. I will gladly edit any minor mistakes if you request it.<br>g) Mod posts will be in <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">bold purple.</span></span></span> Please do not use this color. Doing so may rsult in me crying a manly tear or a modkill if you are Hoppster (seriously, don't use this colour)<br>h) Flavor is provided purely for your entertainment purposes. I reserve the right to be lazy and not provide any flavor at all. This probably won't happen though since my flavour is so awesome<br>i) Do not post if the thread is open if the mod has declared a lynch/opening scene is incoming.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3. Voting</span><br>a) Votes must be bolded or in vote tags at the start of a line. I take no responsibility if your vote is not acknowledged if it is camouflaged in a wall of text.<br>b) Unvotes are nice but are not necessary.<br>c) Do not abuse voting to intentionally mislead other players. This includes fake hammers and such.<br>d) Abbreviations are acceptable as long as it is obvious who you are referring to.<br>e) A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1.<br>f) Posting is allowed in twilight, between the time a hammer is delivered and when I waltz in and kill the poor person.<br>g) Votes posted after the deadline has elapsed will not be counted.<br>h) If no majority is reached by the deadline, a No Lynch will occur.<br>i) A no lynch requires 50% of the votes, rounded up<br>j) Votes by a player being replaced are defaulted to not voiting upon the replacement's arrival.<br>k) Fake hammers or encrypted votes are illegal<br>l) Self-votes are frowned upon as they are against your win con<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4. Deadlines and Activity</span><br>a) Day 1 will be 3 weeks. All subsequent days will have deadlines of 2 weeks.<br>b) Night 1 will have a deadline of 72 hours and all subsequent nights will have a deadline of 48 hours.<br>c) You may request a deadline extension, it will require at least half of the majority of living players (minimum 2 players) to agree. Each extension will be no longer than 72 hours.<br>d) I may grant deadline extensions at my own discretion depending on the game situation, and replacements as such.<br>e) I reserve the right to shorten deadlines if game activity is minimal.<br>f) If no night actions are submitted by the time the maximum deadline expires, you will forfeit your action.<br>g) All night actions follow the Natural Action Resolution system unless otherwise specified.<br>h) Please aim to post at least every 48 hours. You will receive a prod if you do not post within a 72 hour interval. You have 24 hours to respond to the prod via in-game post (or PM if thread locked) before you are replaced.<br>i) You will be automatically replaced if you receive 3 prods, or 2 prods in the same game day.<br>j) Please announce all V/LA's in thread or via PM. I will keep track of all V/LA's in vote counts.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">sample VT role PM</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span><br><br>You are a Regular townsperson, and you have no special powers at night (Sorry).

Used to be known for being a Village Idiot but due to sheer perserverence and playing in as shit load of game(I've been here fair longer and he's played in probably quadruple the number of games I have) he has become a decent player and kind of a staple. Also(this is an old meta) because of his (old)playstyle which consisted of idiotic posts and trolling, he was damn near unreadable(Killa 7 style) so you'd have to either a) policy lynch him or b) investigate him.

Toro has not committed every single scumtell in the book, you have extrapolated his behavior at every turn. Yes, he's quite scummy, but the way you've been reacting is just as scummy. There's a difference between scumhunting and jumpy aggression based on things he isn't even saying.<br><br>p-edit:<br>I think the chance of Toro and Empking being scum together is very low, given that the primary reason either have them have been focused on in the slightest is because of each other.

Toro, on the other hand, has some alright points agaist EmpKing, but I don't reaaally think they hold much merit. For example, all Toro's posts on the mislynch issue were basically fluff. They seemed a little scummy. Then came EmpKing calling Toro Godfather due to the Cop inveStigate request by Toro. I understand why Emp thinks this, and to an extent, I agree. Toro was being pressured, so he plays the \"investigate me\" card. But he could also be town. &gt;_&gt; Rereading time."}

Another word to describe them: Reiterations. I also felt that several of your answers restated points that other players had already made (ex. Toro saying he'd take a cop investigation).

I'm more than happy with a bandwagon on Jakesh. He'd already been called out for his sins (which I noted in my post earlier today). You, on the other hand, have flown under the radar with little attention paid to you (from what I recall, so correct me if I'm wrong, hard to double-check since the thread is already so long), so I decided to post about you. Furthermore, there are other posters with even fewer posts, but they strike me as disengaged, which makes the lurking less of a scum-tell, and more indicative of possible disengagement altogether. Animorph, for instance, I've played a game with where he barely posted, replaced out, and was town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>Also what are your views on Captain Corporal?</div></blockquote><br><br>I've stated in several posts that he's not giving me bad vibes so far.

You surely have them, given how much of the thread has been them arguing with each other.</div></blockquote><br><br>Empking I find more trustworthy than Toro, but he seems to have a very cool head, so I'm trying not to take him at face-value too much. I support a Toro lynch if it comes to that, but I'd rather talk about some other things first, since the case really started to tunnel and get boring. It would not surprise me if they were both town. I would be somewhat surprised if Empking was scum, less surprised if Toro was scum. I don't think they both are."}

The one that is in my head right now is<br><br>a) Toro using this fora cover up as a SK. And on the wiki for mini normal, All it says is a regular Vigilante, not a one-shot. Which to me is unlikely case since that would only give one less of a killing role to knock off the scum. That is why he is either covering that he is a full on vil/SK or using it a sa  cover up as a mafia member. <br>b) Trying to use a pro-town role to cover up his tracks. He also backed down on the Emp thing. In fact Emp is now laying low also, well not posting really.<br>c) He may be a town and telling the truth. This is the one i really do not believe in.

Everybody starts at 50. Because I don't believe in towntells and am skeptical about most scumtells, it is common for people to stay at 50. 50 does not mean \"no opinion\" - it means \"I don't see scumtells\" from this person. Absent claims, need for deadline compromises, etc. I will always vote the person with the highest score. <br><br>52: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Toro+5</span> The discussion about Empking is just pure conspiracy argument and planting doubt where there is no cause for it to exist - coupled with the passive \"Don't take this as me wanting to get rid of Empking right off the bat but it's certainly something to think about.\"<br>59: Defence here makes me comfortable with the above points. \"I'm merely throwing the thought out there, it's not a weak thought at all.\" There are an infinite number of possible thoughts that you can raise in this game. Raising something inherently means that you think (or want other people to think) that it has some special legitimacy. This is why \"I'm just speculating\" is NEVER an explanation for raising something - because by raising it you are implying that you have some good reason for thinking that it stands out above background noise possibilities. <br>63: I'm giving another <span class=\"noboldsig\">Toro+5</span> here for a piss-weak defence. First, he says \"It's not like I'm the only person here who considers this a possibility\" as if the fact that other people are thinking that way excuses him. Secondly, there is a (weak) contradiction in that he now says \"Would a vote legitimize my <span style=\"font-style: italic\">case</span> for you?\" [italics mine]. If he had a \"case\", why,in 52 and 59, does he present it like merely curious speculation?<br>66: Why is it that \"As of now I'm going to re-read back through the thread and look at all of the different conflicts going on.\" read like \"Shit, need to find something else to talk about\"? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"><br>70: And now it's a \"strong possibility\". We go from \"just throwing it out there\" -&gt; \"case\" -&gt; \"strong possibility\"<br>72: \"No one else doubted the authenticity of your Miller claim\". Which is weird...because just a few posts ago he says \"It's not like I'm the only person here who considers this a possibility\" <span class=\"noboldsig\">Toro+5</span><br>83: /agree<br>90: Big post by Toro. Case on CC here makes no sense - in #23 (the post Toro references), CC actually explained why there was no contradiction (rather than, as Toro claims, the post containing a contradiction).  Empking case is trash, as explained. <br>96: Case on Thomith is a beatup (no more points for now, since it pales in comparison to the Empking stuff, and I am conscious of the risk of my system unfairly operating on a very active player like Toro)<br>122: Elfen gets <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elfen+5</span> for the same thing as Toro - planting doubt about Empking based on the claim, and claiming Empking is OMGUSing (withoutn using the acronym)<br><br>tbc...(end of page 6)"}

I still think he is lying. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>What is actually suspicious about it though - in the sense of being more likely to scum from scum-Empking than town-Empking? The reason is perfectly valid; if you are a player who is likely to be investigated, that's all the more reason for claiming miller (aside from, as EK also noted, it being the generally-accepted thing). Yes, he could be scum who claimed miller to pre-empt an investigation - but that doesn't actually make it more likely than not that he is actually scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzer wrote:</cite>Vollkan: I hate his scumhunting style and I feel it's competely arbitrary but that probably doesn't make him scum in every game, so ignore this.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Panzer, maybe I can change your mind on this:<br><br>1) Plenty of players will post lists of every other player, classifying them as \"really scummy\", \"slightly scummy\", \"neutral\", \"leaning town\", etc (or by just listing players in order of suspicion) My system is not fundamentally different from that style of ranking. The list that I post is essentially the same, except that the rankings are represented by numerical points.<br>2) The only way my system differs is that my reasons for suspecting people are always explicitly stated and easy to find, because they are signified by the addition of points. In other words, most people might say \"This action is really scummy\", which then will result in a player getting a scummier ranking, though it will always be unclear exactly how strong that particular scumtell was; my system just lets me clearly link  each individual scumtell to changes in a person's ranking.<br>3) Also, the point values themselves are also not particularly arbitrary. In order for my system to have any credibility (and for me not to get picked to shreds when I use it), I have to ensure that the point values remain reasonably consistent. Thus, I will almost always give 5 points for ordinary scumtells, 7 points for moderately serious scumtells and 10 points for very serious scumtells. I don't pretend that this is an exact science, and I'll readily admit that I do manipulate the points in my scum games, but, on the whole, it's certainly no less arbitrary than when most people say \"this action is scummy\", without specifying any degree of magnitude for that scumtell."}

Just Hopps response seem really good, and I figured you were scum pushing his lynch</div></blockquote><br>I'm going to need more detail than that on what exactly you didn't notice; because in the post to which you are referring Hoppster didn't say anything other than a big collection of his posts. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 433 wrote:</cite>I'm trying to see if you bother trying to work out what I'm showing you. You're not - you're attitude is clearly \"well I don't need to bother trying because he didn't explain\", which is either a terrible-town attitude or a scum attitude.<br><br>You're obviously not even trying to read what I'm helpfully laying out for you. You're basically just trying to smear me now and you're not even trying to scum-hunt.</div></blockquote><br>This is laughable since you are accusing me of \"not trying\" and while you do the absolute bare minimum to try and disprove my suspicions.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 433 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 101 wrote:</cite>Are you saying that there is no chance that Thomith is town? Pray, tell us how you know this.</div></blockquote><br>This is pretty interesting in the fact that you are using the scum knowledge tell (scum know who is not scum) only you are using it backwards. You are asking how Toro knows that Thomith is scum; so unless <span class=\"noboldsig\">you think Toro is bussing Thomith</span> this isn't even a tell. It's backwards; and if you think he is bussing you should have been voting either of them; but at the time of this post you are voting SleepyKrew while only FoSing Toro.</div></blockquote><br>Did I say I was not thinking the bold? No.</div></blockquote><br>You didn't explicity say you think Toro is bussing Thomith; but that is the only conclusion that can be drawn from your statement \"are you saying there is no chance that Thomith is town.\" You are asking Toro how he knows that Thomith is scum with the implication that he has inside information. The only way he would <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> that Thomith is scum is if he is a daycop or they are scum buddies together. Since the first isn't true they would have to be scum buddies together.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 433 wrote:</cite>I'm not somebody who changes his vote every time he sees what he thinks is a scum-tell, because that would be stupid. You're dropping loads, but SleepyKrew has been taking priority because he is more obvious scum. In this case, I thought it was a scum-tell and thusly pressed (yes, I'm not an idiot, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I did realise it would mean Thormith is scum as well</span>), but believed SleepyKrew was still likelier scum taking everything into account.</div></blockquote><br>And what's up with the bolded portion of this quote (which directly follows the previous one)? You try and admonish my argument that you didn't say they were scum together but then you admit that you knew that would be the case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 433 wrote:</cite><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>Why is changing my mind scummy?</li><li>Why is feeling the need to explore my reads scummy?</li><li>Your third point is simply just wrong in all respects.</li></ol></div></blockquote><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>Changing your mind is not a scumtell; but the degree of your changing read and the pomp and circumstance behind the changes is a scumtell. </li><li>I don't really understand your second point or what you are asking me to respond to, but that could just be because of my poor English comprehension and my failure of basic communication skills; however, if you are asking why it is scummy for you to explore your own reads the answer is simple: there is nothing scummy with someone exploring their own reads. It is scummy the manner in which you have done so and the effort it took for you to actually say what you were trying to say. It looks very strongly like you plopped down a long post of quotes with no explanation at all hoping I would back off just because it was a long post and long posts are always well thought out (although it did work on your buddy Panzer since he hasn't been able to articulate anything surrounding his unvote/vote and what he actually saw). </li><li>I'm sorry you feel that way. Your actions speak differently.</li></ol><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 433 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Finally, what do you mean by \"for town.\" That sounds pretty definitively that you know I am town.</div></blockquote><br>Is English your first language? I was going to make a derogatory remark here, but realised that would be rash of me considering you may very well speak Albanian as your first language.<br><br>If English is your first language, you're reaaaally stretching here and I assume that native English speakers on this site (probably at least of average intelligence if not above-average) will see this.<br><br>The gist is, by saying \"for town\" I am probably (indeed I am in this context) accusing you of being scum or stupid-town. (You'd have to be stupid-town to attack me without reading my posts, paticularly when I have commented that you need to start reading my posts.)</div></blockquote><br>So what you are saying is anyone with above average intelligence will realize that when you said \"for town\" you meant \"for scum or stupid-town\"? That completely undermines your entire ad hominem because what you actually said and what you say you were implying do not align at all. When you said \"for town\" (referring to me) you were saying \"for someone who is town\" which looks explicitly like you know I am town. This is the inside information scumtell you incorrectly used earlier.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 433 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Either way, Hoppster is scum. And <span class=\"noboldsig\">if he flips scum then panzer has a very high likelihood of being scum with him.</span></div></blockquote><br>Explain why you think this [the bolded text].</div></blockquote><br>Panzer saw your big spoilered post with no content and no rebuttal or clarification and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3147804#p3147804\" class=\"postlink\">immediately voted me</a>, with the only explanation \"I didn't notice all that\". When asked what he didn't notice he said <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3147808#p3147808\" class=\"postlink\">everything in your post</a> and also said later that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3150356#p3150356\" class=\"postlink\">everything in your response seemed good</a>. What exactly? He can't articulate it because the only thing in your post is you accusing me of not reading and them labeling all of your posts to how they are relevant to each of my accusations. If anything, I would think your post would encourage more people to vote you since there was nothing in the way of defending yourself against the attack. <br><br>Plus, he thinks one of us is scum yet he is voting CC for some pretty weak stuff when he thinks he has a 50/50 shot of hitting scum between us. And then he asks SleepyKrew why he isn't voting for you, which doesn't make sense to me since SleepyKrew is not on his scum list and why would Panzer be asking SleepyKrew (who he doesn't think is scum) why SleepyKrew isn't voting someone who Panzer thinks is 50/50 scum when Panzer isn't voting that person either?"}

(And if you know somebody who is a Simpsons fan, the clear suggestion is that you should buy them this DVD boxset.)<br><br>Finally, pretend we have Madonna advertising a new CD, and she says \"For all true music fans, missing out on this would be stupid!\"<br><br>She's not saying that if you don't buy her CD you're stupid. She is saying if you're a true music fan and you don't buy her CD, you're stupid. Not buying her CD would mean you're either not a true music fan, or you are a true music fan but you're stupid.

I went with it. That sorts out those fake vig claims really quick, especially from a player as scummy as Toro.<br>2) I don't like replacements in general. They are a necessary but  heavy burden. Elfen was straight unreadable because he was an idiot. I don't care if fucking Yosarian or Glork replace in, they aren't gonna make Elfen less of an idiot, even if they play the straight up townest game one can play. The spot is still tainted. And If we choose to clear the idiocy, we could be giving the scum a pass and the game. This is an awkward view, but (since you are on about meta too) meta me. I think PBuG and most other players who have played with me(which is still most the game) can attest to the fact that I hold replacement spots as far more scummy then regular spots. Most people that replace out are either caught scum or someone who never showed up in the beginning. Also, we established that Toro should be shooting Jakesh.<br>3) I don't think those are weird views. You can't predict behavior based on such a small sample size. If I get in a fight when I'm drunk, it's unfair to assume I always fight when i'm drunk based on one incident. Why do you think psychologist use samples of 100s even 1000s in their studies?

They are a necessary but  heavy burden. Elfen was straight unreadable because he was an idiot. I don't care if fucking Yosarian or Glork replace in, they aren't gonna make Elfen less of an idiot, even if they play the straight up townest game one can play. The spot is still tainted. And If we choose to clear the idiocy, we could be giving the scum a pass and the game. This is an awkward view, but (since you are on about meta too) meta me. I think PBuG and most other players who have played with me(which is still most the game) can attest to the fact that I hold replacement spots as far more scummy then regular spots. Most people that replace out are either caught scum or someone who never showed up in the beginning. Also, we established that Toro should be shooting Jakesh.<br>3) I don't think those are weird views. You can't predict behavior based on such a small sample size. If I get in a fight when I'm drunk, it's unfair to assume I always fight when i'm drunk based on one incident. Why do you think psychologist use samples of 100s even 1000s in their studies? Because 1 incident doesn't mean there is a correalation.

You said he was \"unreadable\" and now the slot is forever tainted? Why??? Being a bad player does not make the slot scum or town. And I'm not trying to give his replacement a pass, I'm just saying it wasn't a good idea for you to call for him being vigged based on nothing. It was a bad idea and it may have been anti-town.<br><br>Why are you asking me to meta you for your view of replacements when you were JUST saying how meta was so impossible? And yes, it's weird to apply scientific standards of hundreds of games, because Mafia isn't really like that. And no, weirdness alone doesn't make you scummy, your other actions do. Also your contradictions on when meta is and is not appropriate to use.<br><br>I am definitely not lurking, PJ, and I am not really tunneling you either. I've voted 2 people since I voted you. I just keep on commenting on you because you keep on doing things that strike me as off.<br><br>Hoppster: an example of why xvart is more convincing: You padded your post with a million examples like Madonna and The Simpsons, but you kind of missed the point. You didn't say \"if you're town, you'll feel blah blah blah,\" you said \"for town, you'll feel blah blah blah.\" The lack of an If is key, and I think it's telling you inserted If into your defense, and said it was interchangeable when it is not.<br><br>After xvart/hoppster, I feel a little like I did after empking/toro. Both not scum, maybe both town, slightly more likely to be xvart/empking as town.<br><br>Volkan, the thing that ticked me is you quoted a post saying you were town and said something to the effect of \"let me change your mind.\" obviously I know you meant to refer to the other part you quoted, I just found it amusing.<br><br>I'll look over SK later.

Please do so because just repeating how I am not reading your posts over and over again with no supporting evidence is scummy. After I pushed my case on you did you or did you not make a response post that was labeling my case for me and showing the rest of the players your ISO with which of my case points was relevant to which of your posts? Please explain to us how this is a defense, since it seems quite the opposite (you enhancing my case).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster wrote:</cite>\"For town\" - the following only applies if you are town (fairly interchangeable with \"if you're town\")<br><br>This seems to be the main thing you're struggling to understand. Imagine an old man saying \"For me, playing chess is fun!\"<br><br>He's not saying playing chess is fun for everybody. He's saying it's fun for him. In other words, it only applies if you are him.<br><br>Or a TV advert with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen saying \"For us, L'Oreal is the only hair product we will use!\"<br><br>They're not saying it's the only hair product that anybody uses, it means that it's the only hair product that they specifically will use. It only applies if you are them. (And then the wannabes out there who want to be just like them will then strive to use only L'Oreal.)<br><br>Now imagine an advert starring Homer Simpson, advertising a new DVD boxset. He says \"For all true Simpsons fans, there's no superior Christmas present!\"</div></blockquote><br>Your examples hold no weight. The point in contention is the proper noun (Homer Simpson, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, or me as the case may be); not what they are saying that follows. In each of your examples, it cannot be argued that when you said \"For Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen\" you meant for \"two people <span style=\"font-style: italic\">other than</span> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen\" just like you can't argue that when you said \"For town\" (for someone who is town) you meant \"For someone who is either scum or an idiot.\" Everything that follows is irrelevant to the argument (whether it be preferred make up, Christmas presents, or enjoyment of chess).<br><br>If you were meaning to say \"for someone who is likely town\" or \"someone who might be town\" you should have said that because what you said definitively identifies me as town. It's what we call a scumslip since only scum would know definitively that I am town. Furthermore, the fact that you attempted to use examples and logic (incorrectly) further identifies you as scum because you attempting to undermine me (and my methods) and not defending or excusing the behavior. \"town\" =/= \"scum or idiot\" in any language, ESL or otherwise. The biggest problem you have with this whole issue is that you can't use the excuse \"I was typing too fast and meant 'for someone who is likely town' or 'for someone who might be town'\" because you have backed yourself into a corner and neither of those excuses would hold any weight given your expressed suspicion of me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster wrote:</cite>In fact, I already explained that but of course you didn't read it: <blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster wrote:</cite>The gist is, by saying \"for town\" I am probably (indeed I am in this context) accusing you of being scum or stupid-town. (You'd have to be stupid-town to attack me without reading my posts, paticularly when I have commented that you need to start reading my posts.)</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>I did read it; but all of your \"explanations\", when finally provided, are not sound and appear to me to be taking posts out of context or out of their timeline. I'll explain in more detail later today."}

When his wagon was building (4 votes) you built up a big post and slap down a huge (literally and figuratively) FoS on Toro. It should be noted (detailed below) that this was the first time you started thinking that he might just be \"idiot town\", but everything in your post suggests otherwise. Then the wagon/pressure died down a little and you slotted him in the arrogant town category, supposedly aligning with your unspoken observation in your first FoS post that we are just supposed to take your word for. Then, when Toro is dancing around the L-1/L-2 threshold you bust out another big post asking Toro to claim with mafia 101 information about how town don't lie. <br><br>The whole point is you are on the wagon when it gaining momentum, off the wagon when it is losing momentum, and explain how you were unsure using information that is unconfirmable.

I went with it. That sorts out those fake vig claims really quick, especially from a player as scummy as Toro.<br>2) I don't like replacements in general. They are a necessary but  heavy burden. Elfen was straight unreadable because he was an idiot. I don't care if fucking Yosarian or Glork replace in, they aren't gonna make Elfen less of an idiot, even if they play the straight up townest game one can play. The spot is still tainted. And If we choose to clear the idiocy, we could be giving the scum a pass and the game. This is an awkward view, but (since you are on about meta too) meta me. I think PBuG and most other players who have played with me(which is still most the game) can attest to the fact that I hold replacement spots as far more scummy then regular spots. Most people that replace out are either caught scum or someone who never showed up in the beginning. Also, we established that Toro should be shooting Jakesh.<br>3) I don't think those are weird views. You can't predict behavior based on such a small sample size. If I get in a fight when I'm drunk, it's unfair to assume I always fight when i'm drunk based on one incident. Why do you think psychologist use samples of 100s even 1000s in their studies? Because 1 incident doesn't mean there is a correalation. Also didn't we go over the weird=/=scummy thing before(this applies to 2 and 3)?<br><br>Also, is tunneling the only thing you stop lurking to do?</div></blockquote><br><br>1) This makes no sense. The problem with self-vigging is obvious - if they are lying, they will not do it, and if they are telling the truth they SHOULDN'T do it. I also don't see why you bring up the fact that EK suggested it first. How is that at all relevant to your actions?<br>2) I agree with you here (see the fact that Elfen's replacement keeps ELfen's points).Though, I don't think you are really responding to Sundy's points which is that you \"Says that Elfen replacement cannot change what Elfen did, even though...he said that there is no real evidence either way on Elfen\".<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hiplop wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Vollkan wrote:</cite> I don't get how you can not like meta and yet be prepared to make a meta argument based off only a couple of games.

However, is it so convoluted that you didn't understand it at all or have absolutely nothing else to say about it? Do you disagree that the highlighted red comments by him are contradictory, changing explanations, or justifying behavior after the fact with thoughts that were not present at the time? My entire point is, from my perspective, <span class=\"noboldsig\">it appears that Hoppster on several occasions when he was put under pressure has changed his story or contradicted himself and excused it by saying \"that was what I was thinking at the time even though I didn't say it.\" As he says, once can be excusable, but three times? All of which come under pressure about something he said?</span><br><br>Isolating out the second example, read his entire post. Is there anything in there that would suggest anything other than a full blown suspicion? Is there anything that makes you think that Hoppster's read includes the possibility of Toro being \"idiot town\"?

Don't like it.</div></blockquote><br><br>Three points:<br>1) The fact that I use a numerical system tends to exaggerate my null reads in two ways. First, obviously, it means that my null reads are all explicitly stated (whereas most people will only post their town or scum reads). Second, more subtly, it cuts out a lot of nuance - I'm confident I've given my opinions on every significant matter where you might reasonably expect me to hold a position other than a nullread; needless to say, my points chart won't reflect those opinions. I completely admit that I have a much greater than average rate of null reads (see below: this is a meta trait of mine), but I still think that my system exaggerates it.<br><br>2) Have a look across basically any of my games, and you'll more likely than not see both: a) That I frequently have many people at 50 (see also my PSA where I warned of this in advance); and b) People complaining about the significant number of null reads.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: 3) Somewhat lengthy underlying theory explanation</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">3) Theorywise, I think it is ultimately a consequence of my admittedly unusual way of determining tells. Basically, I have the fairly standard starting point of defining a [scum/town] tell as \"any action more likely to come from [scum/town] than [town/scum]\". The big difference is that, because I don't think there is any reliable way to determine more likely (a probabilistic concept) and because I have an inherent scepticism of anecdotal arguments my basic test is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">whether or not any given action could reasonably come from a [town/scum] player, with all the known meta characteristics of the player in question and allowing for reasonable levels of error</span>. <br><br>Because it is almost ALWAYS reasonable for scum to take ostensibly pro-town actions, I don't (at least for almost all practical purposes) believe in behavioural towntells. <br><br>Likewise, for me to consider something to be a scumtell, it basically has to be something that I don't think could reasonably come from town. <br><br>This <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2776979#p2776979\" class=\"postlink\">recent example I found a few weeks ago</a> (where I was referred to in a game that I wasn't actually even in) comes to mind here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Weatherman wrote:</cite> <blockquote><div><cite>RC wrote:</cite> I'd really prefer a Runner lynch to anything on the table right now, but I know I don't have the energy or the capital to commit to a battle against him. I don't see Spyrex as voting Gorrad illegitimately here. He's fluffing his way through the first part of the game. His vote on Cyberbob is kind of lame. [etc etc]<br></div></blockquote><br>The double negative is gut scummy, and is RC really one of the <span class=\"noboldsig\">vollkan-Netopalis school of \"legitimate\" and \"illegitimate\"?</span> I only forgive that mindset based on case by case meta history - only certain kinds of rare town players read the game as objectively classifying cases as \"legitimate\" and \"illegitimate\" (I think the mindset has gaping holes), but it's a convenient MO as a scum player. <br></div></blockquote> <br><br>From what I can gather from the context, this is a reference to my tendency to ignore (alignment-wise) anything that I can reasonably/legitimately see as coming from town. I quote it only to show the extent to which my views here have a degree of notoriety</div></div></div>"}

When it is not directed, they do not know if the target is going to be their team or not. Even if they don't have a RBer they can influence the kill during the day to someone who is town and say \"welp, at least we got rid of a town lurker.\" Giving scum advanced knowledge of specific night actions only helps scum and not town because they have more information about night actions to begin with.</div></blockquote><br>Oh.

First of all, this is a terrible question and reaks of inside information and future day bandwagon development. Regarding the actual question, how am I to know what the town will think of me and you upon Hoppster's flip? As with any day, I'll let then town judge me upon that flip and if Hoppster flipped (and flipped town) they will have to decide if scum would fight tooth and nail for the lynch of someone who flipped town. <br><br>I first started to get more concerned with my reads on you two being scum together <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3154425#p3154425\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> with your struck out version of my scumtell list but no real commentary on the rest of the list. It appeared to be a soft weak defense which confused me because I didn't see scum connecting themselves that obviously to a buddy especially after already being accused of being buddies, but it wasn't that substantial or concrete compared to Hoppster so I let it go. Then you later came and told me what I was saying about Hoppster was <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3157501#p3157501\" class=\"postlink\">convoluted</a> and nothing else other than your <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3158029#p3158029\" class=\"postlink\">obvious defense of Hoppster regarding directing vig kills</a>. This sort of commentary adds nothing because you clearly weren't even interested in what I was saying despite engaging in the conversation previously. I even asked you what was convoluted and since I was having strange feelings about your previous post I figured I would see how you reacted to being accused again of being scum with him.<br><br>You came back projecting on flips that hadn't occurred setting up a lynch on me and proving your towniness D2. The biggest point is even though you were pretending to be engaged in the Hoppster/xvart debate your only interest was the outcome tomorrow and not the outcome today.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 580 wrote:</cite>I would be willing to bet that if sleepy flips that Xvart is his buddy.</div></blockquote><br>You really are doing your best to tie down my lynch tomorrow based on whoever flips, aren't you?<br><br>I'm much more comfortable with a Panzer lynch today but I also recognize the likelihood of SleepyKrew being scum now that I've stepped back from the game and reread other areas. <br><br>SleepyKrew - consider this my intent to hammer so claim."}

This sort of commentary adds nothing because you clearly weren't even interested in what I was saying despite engaging in the conversation previously.

In the worst case scenario we get one dead townie. In your scenario the best case scenario will yield you one dead townie and one scum while the worst case scenario yields two dead townies. In the event that Hoppster did flip town what would we have lost? One town member and the secondary case I had on you.

Like I said, those that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. But delving into the sole reason he expressed for voting Sleepy:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 580 wrote:</cite>I also just recent finished a game with him, He seemed to tunnel a lot harder. He essentially stayed on target the whole game. I didn't notice this but now that everyone is pointing it out, I want back and checked. I'd be willing to see if this is a meta trait. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:SleepyKrew</span></div></blockquote><br>The sole reason Panzerjager voted SleepyKrew (since he had said nothing else up until this point throughout the entire game) is because of a one game meta sample (plus the added benefit of knowing if it was a meta trait later on). His thoughts on meta:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 442 wrote:</cite>@Hiplop: One game is not a meta.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 447 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite>A) i know, i had to search all your posts,<br>b) one was a mini-normal, not sure on the name/number, but it was near the end of your search history.</div></blockquote><br><br>You can't meta someone from 2 years ago, people change<br><br>You can't meta someone from 2 games, Sample size.<br><br>You can't meta someone from a game that they made 10 posts in, sample size.<br><br>Meta in general is garbage.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS:Hiplop</span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 449 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">He's is drawing conclusions mainly from garbage meta, and I happen to know that Hiplop, myself, and Sleepy were all in a game together that just ended and have the sneaking suspicion that because his \"meta\" is solely based of that game</span>, seeing as he doesn't have meta's on anyone else and normally Meta players will meta read everyone. I find drawing suspicions from irrelevent things scum because he trying to push the lynch of a townie based on fallacious statements and generally stir the pot.</div></blockquote><br><br>So in post 449 Panzerjager votes solely because of meta in one game when he has made it painfully obvious how worthless meta is in case building. When questioned about it he says he wanted to see if it was in fact a meta trait. <br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>Why does he care if it is a meta trait if he thinks meta is worthless;</li><li>The reason behind the vote is the meta argument (which he finds worthless) and not the intent to find out a meta trait.</li></ol><br>If that isn't a not so subtle way to get on a wagon I don't know what is. His reasons for voting are inconsistent with what he has been telling us, which is very indicative of scum."}

Otherwise, independent of Panzer's flip I see CC being scum, especially considering his absence and \"catch up posts\" when he has loads of time. His PBuG/Empking connection comment is especially out of the blue with no real context or explanation. This definitely feels like active lurking under the guise of \"he look I've got scumpair connections so I'm scum hunting.\" He makes no commentary at all about SleepyKrew's flip and the implications on other players. <br><br>What is especially concerning/interesting is he says in his original post upon return that he will have relevant quotes and stuff for the people he thinks is scum and not town, but it appears he is going through posting about players regardless of reading all players first.<br><br>I'd like to go back through and take a closer look at people sitting on the fence about hoppster and I, because when Panzer flips scum I think the other buddy/ies might have exhibited similar behavior to Panzer sitting the fence or even saying \"one of the two is scum\".

Really vague and just mentions \"I've stepped back and reread other areas. Doesn't tell us those areas, and clearly sees it as a plan B lynch<br><br>He then doesn't realize that Sleepy is l-2 and can't hop on, so settles for trying to force a claim. <br><br>Most townies know how many votes their number two suspects have, and it just seems like he's trying to earn townie points by showing interest in waning moments of Sleepy's life. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>Oh. I thought he was L-1. <br><br>VOTE: SleepyKrew</div></blockquote><br><br>This is the post he votes him on. Just hops on without any reason because he realizes he can safely and earn some easy town cred.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>I basically reread the entire game, the cases on SleepyKrew (including Hoppsters). I don't think it will come as a shock to anyone but I was hard core tunneled and as I said needed to step back. Like I said, I would much rather lynch you today but I see the merit of the SleepyKrew case that others have outlined.</div></blockquote><br><br>Two more sleepy mentions here(1 more left). Insist that he read the cases on SleepyKrew and reread the entire game but isn't specfic(which clearly avoid the question I asked of him) about what changed his mind. Just says, I read the game and the cases, I'm convinced and essentialy admits that he's just coattailing other cases but doesn't say what specifically.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>xvart wrote:</cite>A 2 shot BP seems strange as a town role if Toro was telling the truth about his role. I suspect SleepyKrew is not telling us the full story. I've never seen a 2 shot BP before. Has anyone else, and if so what game</div></blockquote><br><br>Just questions the claim but not in the same aggresive manner he'd been playing. It's kinda passive and regrettful like he knows that Sleepy is gonna get lynched for the bad claim.<br><br>This on top of the fact that both his cases on me and Hoppster are complete and utter crap filled with fail logic and misinterpretations, I'm positive he's Sleepy's buddy.</div></blockquote>"}

If he really believed that opinion he would have thought my actions were scummy independent of that, since I repeatedly quoted and referenced Hoppsters posts that apparently now condemn me.

Essentially, his entire D2 has revolved around asking people why nobody listened to him about SleepyKrew or why nobody is explaining why there were ignoring him. There have been some other peripheral comments (some in relationship to his large font SleepyKrew condemnation) and some other non committal comments. If Hoppster is scum with SleepyKrew then he could have just started pushing him while he was under attack to save face, maybe save himself, or if he did flip to clear SleepyKrew. <br><br>The whole \"let's talk about yesterday\" attitude is underwhelming and not constructive unless he identified people who he thought was deliberately ignoring him to save SleepyKrew (as town would do); which hasn't happened. His only concern appears to be that he be recognized as the driving force on SleepyKrew.<br><br>I also forgot about the question he asked asking everyone for their read on volkkan. What was the point of this question? We all knew he flipped town so what exactly was he trying to get at here? Again, if there was something to indicate scum from this question why was there no follow up? It is just a fluff question otherwise. Plus, the whole railing on me for something he says is a null tell and then talking about his blood boiling is interesting.</fieldset><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">And I guess I shouldn't be surprised by now that Panzer has once again avoided responding to my commentary on his claim/voting record... <blockquote><div><cite>xvart, 965 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Panzer</span> - No response to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3238376#p3238376\" class=\"postlink\">your obvious voting motivation failure</a> in conjunction with flipped scum and your alleged inside knowledge?

Now that I've called you out for never following up on your \"HEY WHY WAS NOBODY LISTENING TO ME YESTERDAY???\" with no follow up or determination of people ignoring you being indicative of scum you bust out how I was selectively not responding, implying scum motivation? When I have someone pegged as scum I rarely listen to them and who they think is scum as their opinion can be sorted out as a bus or whatever after they flip. When I thought you were 100% scum I didn't care who you thought was scum because you were, in my opinion at the time, scum. Once I started questioning my read on you I went back (as I have said) and was looking at what you were saying.<br><br>Do you think my \"selective reading\" of your SleepyKrew suspicion yesterday was scum motivated? If so, why are you just now bringing this up???<br><br>So the real question is why did you make such a big deal out of nobody listening to you yesterday and never assigned any reads based on the people that ignored you? With no follow up to that line of questioning it seems awfully close to just wanting to show off how you were the proponent of SleepyKrew lynch and nothing else. That is only compounded by your relative lack of contribution today outside of making a big deal out of nobody listening to you. Those two behaviors combined look an awful lot like scum trying to not make waves today and attempting to ride the town cred you established by pushing the SleepyKrew case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 985 wrote:</cite>Your vote on monk is bad bad bad.

The problem, as was the case with you, is that there was no logical explanation of the changing read or justification for the changing read that is especially concerning. That is compounded by the logic presented for his changing read seemed disingenuous at best and opportunistic at worst.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hoppster, 985 wrote:</cite>Give us a list of reads. \"X and Y are scummy\" is not what I'm looking for.

Typically I have scum reads and everyone else is a null read. In rare cases I'll see something that someone says that is unique to a town vantage point that would almost certainly not come from a scum mindset, but that is rare.

I still want to go back and research Panzer's archived games to dig up his mason experience (since his town mindset is to do the absolute minimum to prove he is town when under suspicion). Also, if it comes down to lynching a VT, I would highly suggest lynching Monk instead due to his obvious disconnect and voting patterns. People that do not have consistent voting are more likely to be scum.

And I agree that when reviewing interactions with people you cannot fully judge intent without surrounding context, but in your first read through, if that is something you really believed was true and a scumtell, it should have been obvious at that point, and not only later after ISOing each player individually. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>monk, 998 wrote:</cite>You still haven't answered my question as to the town motivation behind misrepresentation of players and their cases on you.</div></blockquote>I'll play along even though the conversation, as I have said, should be distinctly about scum motivations as that is what I have been talking about the entire game. Generally speaking, if something isn't inherently town motivated does not mean it is scum motivated either. Also, for this thought experiment I will assume that I was deliberatly misrepresenting players and their cases (which is far from true considering I got Hoppster up to L-2 without any real accusation of my behavior being as such until recently).<br><br>The town motivation of tenacity and deliberate misrepping someone includes: building a lynch mob against someone who is scummy, gathering votes for someone who is scummy, unequivocally expressing reads, behaving in a transparent manner with voting intentions, not waffling on reads, and putting scum in a corner of which it is difficult to back out.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Panzerjager, 999 wrote:</cite>And I'm just flat not reading or responding to xvart's post for the entirity of him being on this game.

And, I have no problem with you ignoring me because I'm not trying to convince you that you are scum; only everyone else. It's almost better this way because as it only makes you look scummier. Town members would have no problem responding to simple questions about their behaviors, motivations, and intents because it would help everyone else develop reads and adjust their hunting of scum accordingly; especially when shown to have a huge contradiction in game knowledge and subsequent voting. The real reason I think you are avoiding answering the question about your lack of vote on SleepyKrew when you knew he wasn't a mason and you thought his claim was serious is that you don't have an answer and you are hoping it gets swept under the rug because crazy xvart is being crazy.<br><br>On a further note, town would want to provide information to help lynch people they think is town. In this case, you think I am scum for my scummy attacks on Hoppster and you. But you still haven't clarified why you agreed with most of my case on Hoppster and then only came around to thinking I was scummy for those cases when you were getting my attention. Your whole argument about me making scummy cases is undermined by the fact that you agreed with most of my case on Hoppster up until I started attacking you, when it became convienent to save yourself to pretend it was a pattern of behavior for me. Since you aren't willing to help make that case and clarify your intentions it appears that you don't really believe that I am scum or you don't really care to get me lynched.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">I went back through Panzer's games in the MS achives and looked through every game he played in with masons.

I have stated this and you haven't seemed to comment on it, more misrep of someone who is actively participating with you. So let me put this out clearly:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">What on earth is the TOWN reason for blatant misrepresentation of someone and distraction tactics of going, oh look over there \"have a post wall where I've chopped and changed the friggin case on me beyond recognition\"</fieldset></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>monk, 1013 wrote:</cite>while I don't agree with your motivation to misrep, you do agree that you have been, town enough for the moment<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TheFool</span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>monk, 1025 wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xvart</span><br><br>Stop saying words and die scum, even if you're town you are being incredibly antitown and need to be removed from the game</div></blockquote><br>This progression is fascinating. Monk is convinced I am scum. I explain hypothetical reasons for misrepping someone as town and he drops his vote based on me \"being town enough for the moment.\" Then, Hoppster says I need to be policy lynched at which point Monk comes back around and says \"even if your town\" I need to die. The really crazy part is the fact that he dropped his vote because I provided some town reasons for misrepping someone, whereas he doesn't even discuss or elaborate on the scum motivation behind misrepping (reminder: we had been having a round robin about motivation and intent). I even pointed out his flaw in questioning me regarding the town motivation for misrepping where he never assigned any scum motivation. This voting pattern looks suspiciously like scum voting townie, then he gets called scum for him voting with poor reasons, backs off for terrible reasons, then votes after someone else opens a different door (policy lynch).<br><br>And, not that it matters in the grand scheme of things, but I don't recall every saying anything along the lines of me being \"picked on\" because I have been verbose.<br><br>Unfortunately, they are highly unlikely to be scum together due to Panzer being linked with Thomith; unless there are four scum (which might explain Panzer fake claiming mason, but that is pretty tin foil hat). At this point, I would almost argue for a no lynch but I don't see that helping town in the long run because D3 would just be D2 all over again. While I won't self hammer I see that, given my wagon size and the deadline, you should lynch me. <br><br>On a final note, I realize that I have alienated people based on my tenacity and for that I apologize. It has obviously had a negative effect that I did not foresee. While I was trying to build lynches on scum I was simultaneously defeating my own cause due to people's reluctance to join me. I'm sorry that I'll likely be unable to help sort out this mess.<br><br>Important posts I believed should be reviewed upon my flip:<br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3245575#p3245575\">viewtopic.php?p=3245575#p3245575</a><!-- l --><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3244051#p3244051\">viewtopic.php?p=3244051#p3244051</a><!-- l --><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3238376#p3238376\">viewtopic.php?p=3238376#p3238376</a><!-- l --><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3186127#p3186127\">viewtopic.php?p=3186127#p3186127</a><!-- l -->"}

I want to pretend that was a clever gambit to make sure scum left me alive.</div></blockquote><br>Actually, by that time I had picked up that something was going on; it just seemed out of place compared to us going toe to toe D1 which is why I tried to throw it back in your face, in case you were a power role. I didn't ever expect you to get lynched but found that stuff that might cast a little bit of suspicion on you and keep you alive.<br><br>And again, sorry about D1. No hard feelings I hope. Coming into the game I had just busted two scum in another game in subsequent days so my ego was a little inflated with my scumhunting abilities compared to my usual mediocre play, so that had something to do with it. Note to everyone if you really want me to get on your case just go straight for the ad homs, you aren't reading stuff, etc.; although to be fair, I guess I really wasn't reading, but I found it hard to see the motivation behind the posted ISO... Anyways, once someone (I think Hoppster) explicitly pointed out how I wasn't reading it clicked with me because just saying \"you aren't reading\" doesn't do much for me, especially if I think you are scum, because I read it the exact same way. Anyways, no harm no foul. The good thing about going full court press on someone is it puts everyone else in a tough spot in deciding how to come down on it. <br><br>This game reminded me a lot of the game I linked earlier where I steam rolled the town by doing the same thing and fighting tooth and nail for a townie lynch. Although we still won it was really interesting because I was a doctor and a town jailkeeper had already flipped; scum kept me around because they thought I was going to be an easy mislynch and town wouldn't lynch me because they thought my behavior was so pro town despite there being two protective roles. When the part where I obviously didn't read what Hoppster was saying was pointed out at me I took a hard step back and thought about that game and decided I needed to be more careful and not torpedo the town again.<br><br>Anyways, I apologize to anyone (and everyone) who was turned off by me, and this game isn't my typical playstyle."}
