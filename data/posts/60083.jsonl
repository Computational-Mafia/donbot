Isn't that exciting? You've waited for that card ever since Zar set foot in mafiascum! Unfortunately, turns out you had no idea people would literally kill to be there. And that's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly</span> what's been happening. Impostors murdered and are impersonating some of the real guests, and they're most definitely not good people. They're set to eliminate Zar, his Westerosi case-building ways, and those that support him! Sadly Zar's way too busy hosting his party to bother double checking everyone's ID's... I mean, come on, there are 5 thousand guests and a handful of events taking place! However, he has given word that he will look at the documents (one person at a time) that are brought to him. His co-host and reviewers have narrowed down the suspect pool to the sketchiest 13 guests. Sadly, you're among them. <br><br>As a precautionary measure, the thirteen of you have been locked in one of the wings of the castle (yep, the same one from 160B). Everyone is certainly convinced the impostors are among you since, aside from flings no one wants to know about, no crimes have happened after you all were locked up together. We think that letting you sort it out should work? Hopefully those impostors won't end up killing everyone in the room and the house! Work your wits to catch them and try to make at least to the final dinner!</span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This is the sample Vanilla Townie role PM</span></span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>Welcome, <span class=\"noboldsig\">[Player X]</span>!

Read them <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br>A2) Play to your faction's win condition, as long as you do not break any game or site rules in doing so.<br>A3) You may not discuss this game anywhere outside the game thread unless explicitly permitted to do so in your role PM.<br>A4) Quoting or pretending to quote your role PM, quicktopics, private communications with the mod, or (in the case of hydrae) discussion with other heads is strictly forbidden. Loose paraphrasing is permitted, although run it past me first when in doubt.<br>A5) Be civil and treat other players with respect--attack the case, not the person. Mafia is a heated game, but I will interfere if anyone resorts to excessive insults, personal attacks, and bullying.<br>A6) There is a zero-tolerance policy against offensive comments or slurs based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. You may be harshly punished for even a first violation of this rule.<br>A7) Encryption is forbidden, as well as messages hidden in invisible text, small text, or BBCode tags. Always err on the side of caution and ask the mod before leaving a code or breadcrumb. A good rule of thumb is that if the average person cannot decipher the code without outside software after having it pointed out, you can't use it.<br>A8) Editing and deleting posts (if you have the power to do so) is strictly forbidden.<br>A9) If you have outside information that influences your knowledge of the game, are aware of someone else having outside information, or have any reason to believe that the game has been compromised, it is your responsibility to inform the mod immediately. I will love you for your honesty.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">B) Voting/Lynching Mechanics</span><br><br>B1) For your vote or unvote to be counted, it must be completely bolded, and use the format Vote: PlayerName/Unvote: PlayerName or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>/<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Playername</span> (capital letters and colon optional). Any other variation (such Hammer: PlayerName) will not be counted.<br>B2) Votes for misspellings or acronyms of players' names (such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playrname</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: PN</span>) are valid as long as the player being voted for is clear. You are not required to unvote before changing your vote. However, votes that are behind spoiler tags, in small or invisible text, or otherwise concealed are invalid.<br>B3) A lynch will occur when 50%+1 of the votes are cast for the same player. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight.<br>B4) (AKA Zachrulez's Nemesis's Rule) You may vote for \"no lynch\" if you wish. If 50% of the players in the game vote for no-lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>B5) Dead is dead - no 'Bah' post. Not even one. If the mod hasn't posted the endgame scene, you may not post again, even after a hammer in LYLO. Under absolutely under no circumstances may you reveal game-relevant information after your death.<br>B6) (AKA The \"Blame Katsuki\" Rule) Votes from an alt account will be interpreted in the most damaging way to your faction. If you can't log in correctly, you have little to complain about.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">C) Activity and Deadlines</span><br><br>C1) Days will be 2 weeks long. <br>C2) Deadlines will not be extended barring exceptional circumstances or replacement situations. If a majority lynch is not reached before deadline, no lynch occurs.<br>C3) You may continue talking after a lynch or deadline has elapsed until the mod posts to end the day. After that, you may not post even if the mod forgets to lock the thread.<br>C4) Night phases will last for 72 hours.<br>C5) In order to be accepted, night actions must be PMd to the mod or posted in bold in scum QTs before the deadline is up. If a player does not select one, he or she will default to \"no action.\"<br>C6) If a replacement is needed during a night phase, I will extend the night deadline until some time after a replacement is found, regardless of whether that slot has a night action.<br>C7) Please treat this game as a commitment and do your best to participate actively.<br>C8) Players will be prodded after forty-eight hours without posting. They may also request prods on other players so long that player has not posted for a reasonable amount of time. All prods will be announced in thread.<br>C9) Players who do not respond to a (non-player-requested) prod within twenty-four hours or need to be prodded too often will be replaced at the discretion of the mod.<br>C10) If you will be unable to post for over forty-eight hours, inform the mod by PM or in the thread of when you'll be V/LA. Assuming the V/LA period is of reasonable length, you will be exempt from prods during that time. All V/LA notifications will be made public by the mod.<br>C11) I will try to post vote counts every page or every twenty-four hours if possible. Players may request a new vote count at any time.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">D) Other</span><br><br>D1) Abilities follow Natural Action Resolution unless explicitly stated otherwise in your role PM.<br>D2) If there is a conflict between the rules and your role PM, the role PM takes precedence.<br>D3) <span style=\"color: Red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Red</span></span> is my color. You may not use it.<br>D4) Any methods of verifiable randomness are forbidden. This includes dice tags. Don't use them. <br>D5) It is possible something may have been overlooked or left unclear. When in doubt, ask. You may be punished for deliberately exploiting technicalities and vague wording in the rules in order to do something you should know is forbidden or unethical.<br>D6) Punishment for breaking any of the above rules may include a private or public warning, force replacement, modkill, or even blacklisting (depending on the seriousness of the offence).<br>D7) I will modkill players in the way most detrimental to their faction. Modkilled players may be retroactively made into Neutral Survivors.<br>D8) I reserve the right to add, remove, or modify rules at any point of the game if it becomes necessary.[/quote]"}

I didn't plan to go through with it to that extent, but I got more or less forced to. And the guy who quickhammered me - who was the only scum in that game - got lynched more or less for that, so I can't even really say that it was bad in retrospect. <br><br>as far as lurkers go, yes I am for lynching lurkers. your 2) is a very weird question, because a) that's just one game, I'd certainly hope that I don't change my opinion based on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">one</span> game, and b) a policy lynch is, by definition, not based on scum reads. The fact that the guy you want to policy lynch is town does not contradict the idea of a policy lynch. <br><br>by the way, there was a reason why I put that link in second and the other one first, as it's much closer to how I normally play. but I do like to experiment."}

TDA's town statements means he is agreeing with something a person has said, agreeing with a mindset, a line of question, their actions, or whatever. By declaring people are town or scum, TDA is letting us know where he stands on people, and that can be good, since the less he hides and the more he shares, the more material with which town has to work. After that, it is a player's judgment call whether to use that to trust/distrust him. To cry wolf and say his declarations have no explanation behind it is to miss the context, and context is very important."}

I mean, I kinda know why I think it, but articulating it to others could be more difficult than I'd prefer. Of the two, silver feels more genuine. TDA feels somewhat town to me from our interactions, and I'm not too sure about Garmr right now, but i'm willing to see that play out a bit more. I can't read TSO that well, jury's still out on him.

I don't really give much credit in standard scum tells in general, I think they're far less useful than meta reads. Maybe that's because the community I'm coming from is a lot smaller, so everyone pretty much knows everyone.

So, I agree with kuribo there. I also think the approach of being aggressive to cause reaction makes a lot of sense. As scum, you have to pretend constantly, pretending is easiest if you're calm. If a situation gets out of hand and people start getting emotional, that's good for town.

What he did seemed genuine; I mentioned that I had played before, he asked me for a link, I gave two links, why not read them. This may not be the most efficient way to scum hunt, but it's certainly not horrible. I guess the idea is that he's actively lurking, but eh."}

I Can't easily be attacked?  My efforts are being called into question by both you and TDA.

That sounds like an excuse you've conjured up to give yourself a pass.<br><br>Furthermore even without trying to meta, you could have looked through his games to see how much relative experience he had.  He could have had 30 games, or 50 games, or who knows how many.  But you casually called s.s. a \"newb\" and then concluded that me looking into it is strange."}

That's cool, you can think that. But I happen to think pretty much the opposite, although less extreme. General tells are weak and not worth much, because different people play so differently.

I really don't. Do you want me to fabricate reads in order to appear more towny? That would be lying. I'd prefer not to. You have very long days, I'll get more comfortable the more context I have for different players. Right now, if I had to assign scum % to every player in this game, it would all be between 20 and 30%.<br><br>Now about what's actually happening, do you guys think Garmr is the kind of player who makes all of this up as scum? He could have faked the self-hammer, and then faked his rage and fullclaim. How likely this is does of course depend on his meta, so whoever has played with him before should state his opinion.<br><br>The hider thing is silly. Look, some PR's are better targets for scum than VT's because they have dangerous powers, and some are worse targets because they are harder to kill. You say you softclaimed as hider to cause scum to shoot you so that they waste their NK. Okay, that's cool. Of course it doesn't guarantee to accomplish anything, and whether or not scum actually does shoot you just comes down to WIFOM, but I'm fine with using it as a strategy.<br><br>However, complaining about the fact that we picked up on your softclaim is just plain stupid. Of course we're gonna do that, we don't know that you're a hider. And it doesn't actually change anything, it's still WIFOM from scum's perspective. If you really wanted to do this strategy, you should have anticipated this reaction from us and react in a way that isn't full claiming. Then, in day 2, you should have come clean. On the other hand, if you're scum who planed all of it, then your actions make sense.<br><br>I'm not sure how sincere the rage is, I don't really get what in this game could have him get this upset, but again, I don't know him, people who do need to decide this."}

The important response is from garmr who instantly hops on the waynegg wagon. Too fast imo. Idk who waynegg is but regardless garmr's response is too quick.<br><br>garmr putting up lots of fluff.<br><br>I agree with kuribo that getting any kind of reaction is a valid method of scumhunting, though he seems to go about ti in a different way than I usually do.<br><br>garmr trying too hard to make geri a wagon.<br><br>I'm around 275 and there seems to be a lot of suspicion on geri. Until here he's only posted to ISO 9. The only important post up until then is ISO 7, which I think is perfectly fine. Based on this, I'm suspicious of the motivations of garmr (insistence on geri wagon) and reinoe (\"strong scumread\" on geri). <br><br>Went through garmr's ISO and his case on geri is absurd. That's he's tunneling so hard on it (I'm up to 279 right now) is extremely suspicious.<br><br>serra/reinoe: I think that this could be town v town, except that reinoe is defending a position that I feel is untenable. The geri case is very weak in my opinion, so his insistence on creating a case where there is none raises flags.<br><br>TDA's obsession with meta continues. I don't like this; while meta can be useful, it basically turns into WIFOM if the person is aware of their own meta.<br><br>I completely disagree with silverspawn that explaining votes is scummy. In fact, it is my opinion that not explaining votes is scummy. Why would you announce a conclusion without presenting the premises and connections and expect people to believe/sheep you?<br><br>I like Aero's 313. Town lean from him, good analysis in my opinion and he's able to see through garmr.<br><br>That said, TSO isn't exactly contributing much in ISO, when you filter all of the meta nonsense.<br><br>Re: 331, hypotheticals are a useful way of addressing the devil's advocate position. If you don't at least acknowledge them, then it's easy to assume a conclusion and confbias your way to a mislynch. Villifying hypotheticals could also be used by scum to railroad the town into not thinking critically. <br><br>I'm at 355 right now and I would like to say that all of this meta nonsense is annoying.<br><br>357 worst claim I've ever seen, obviously fake.<br> <br>I think serra's town, he does good analysis.<br><br>TSO <span style=\"font-style: italic\">still</span> insisting on meta analysis instead of the plethora of in-game material to analyze. <br><br>416: reinoe doesn't post for 60 posts but his next post is a defensive attack nine minutes after a vote. I've been questioning reinoe all game but this is simply a knee-jerk defensive reaction. <br><br>I disagree with Madonna on several points but in general their posts seem to be genuine. I can't even blame them for their vote on me, I can see their perspective. <br><br>Silverspawn's 429 is very reasonable. He was neutral before, now he's slight town.<br><br>reinoe is confusing to me, on the one hand he's backing some unreasonable cases, but on the other hand he will post analysis posts that are flawed but completely understandable from the perspective of someone who genuinely believes a flawed case. Still scumreading, less than garmr.<br><br>I don't like geri's 436, his \"why should I unvote?\" regarding an RVS vote, which still stands despite everything that's happened since then, is questionable.

Also this based on a lot of things you can't prove. I am sincere about my feeling my rage is real through. The interactions between me and serra are because we have never played together (that I can remember) but serra has replaced into my slots before so we kinda know each other but don't. That's why serra is interesting.

You provide the \"reason\" that he should have unvoted if he knew that silver was at L-1, but it's clear that he didn't. To me, this looks like you're generating a justification for early wagoning. You go on to say that gerai is a \"much better vote\" than silver, despite there being no real case on gerai, and you having mounted a meta attack on silver earlier. Why are you so eager to suddenly drop the meta case and join garmr against gerai? Because it's a golden opportunity to place the first vote on a wagon that is being pressured but that has not actually been created yet. You later place a \"strong scumread\" on gerai, despite his having said almost nothing and in fact having probably been afk since you initially voted for him. In your following posts you just keep trying to pressure people into joining you on the gerai wagon. Which you sort of helped create, over nothing. Maybe sheeping was the wrong term, since you sort of helped start it, but I see this as an opportunistic jump onto what garmr was already planting."}

However, that is bad, not scum, as I believe the context of kuribo being a rager wanting to throw down works, and even if I disagree with Garmr's context, he can still perhaps provide some information for Day 2.<br><br>So, page 27. Have we put <span class=\"noboldsig\">anyone</span> to L-1 yet? The last vote count at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6484583#p6484583\">513</a> suggests otherwise, and we should amend that.<br><br>I know I see a Garmr vote today as a waste. I would say TSO is a waste too since that is who Garmr wants to investigate, but here is a crazy idea to all of his nay-sayers: if we distrust him, why not all lay in and give him a target? While it is still up in the air whether Garmr accepts this, the idea is that his ability can be spent in a town-approved manner, instead of him setting up who he targets and possibly how he explains himself the following Day. That is an idea I will put out there, but I am personally fine with his own (probably screwed) investigation. But anyways, I am still not up for a Garmr or TSO lynch, and despite kuribo's harsh words and early claim, I like the scumhunting I saw, so that is a no from me too."}

I really don't. Do you want me to fabricate reads in order to appear more towny? That would be lying. I'd prefer not to. You have very long days, I'll get more comfortable the more context I have for different players. Right now, if I had to assign scum % to every player in this game, it would all be between 20 and 30%.<br><br>Now about what's actually happening, do you guys think Garmr is the kind of player who makes all of this up as scum? He could have faked the self-hammer, and then faked his rage and fullclaim. How likely this is does of course depend on his meta, so whoever has played with him before should state his opinion.<br><br>The hider thing is silly. Look, some PR's are better targets for scum than VT's because they have dangerous powers, and some are worse targets because they are harder to kill. You say you softclaimed as hider to cause scum to shoot you so that they waste their NK. Okay, that's cool. Of course it doesn't guarantee to accomplish anything, and whether or not scum actually does shoot you just comes down to WIFOM, but I'm fine with using it as a strategy.<br><br>However, complaining about the fact that we picked up on your softclaim is just plain stupid. Of course we're gonna do that, we don't know that you're a hider. And it doesn't actually change anything, it's still WIFOM from scum's perspective. If you really wanted to do this strategy, you should have anticipated this reaction from us and react in a way that isn't full claiming. Then, in day 2, you should have come clean. On the other hand, if you're scum who planed all of it, then your actions make sense.<br><br>I'm not sure how sincere the rage is, I don't really get what in this game could have him get this upset, but again, I don't know him, people who do need to decide this.</div></blockquote>"}

That is an idea I will put out there, but I am personally fine with his own (probably screwed) investigation.

Yea, it's walls of words, but you could easily just explain your reasoning on a few of them and move on. Making the blanket statement of \"I won't be replying to you any more\" isn't helping anybody. <br><br>Basically, on Reinoe vs. Serra, I think that their both being unhelpful, and I don't think either of them are really doing much scumhunting of the other players.

Perhaps Garmr's idea that I wanted to monopolize his power was something you felt was a scumread, but I address the importance that he not screw around with town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6495778#p6495778\">833</a> and in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6487596#p6487596\">675</a> despite my \"monopol[y]\" suggestion, said Garmr's target is his own should he feel otherwise.<br><br>~<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@vincero, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492962#p6492962\">776</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6493917#p6493917\">785</a>:</span> According to the latest votecount (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6495706#p6495706\">831</a>), TSO and TDA are both voting for two separate people, both of whom are not Garmr's vote.<br><br>Four scummates? There is no evidence to suggest such a high number, and I feel this is unreasonable. If town, you need to probably not take things personally to the extent that you are going to call out a scumteam (and definitely not that large), but I do suggest seeing a vote on a townie as a slight. If scum, with that many people fingered as scum, it might not be unreasonable to think vincero was trying to hide a scummate, should he himself flip."}

At least it reflects well on his reading comprehension... Do you think his turnaround to go back to voting you was scummy? You weren't exactly a viable lynch, so I'm not sure it was opportunistic. And, to be fair, you had just spent the better part of 2 pages in a mostly useless shouting match with exakt, who you thought was NS.

I don't exactly agree with Garmr's vincero case, but he's not exactly a townread, so I'd consider lynching him.

Initial reasoning sucks and supporting quotes are bad. TSO and Garmr would die in a night kill if they are both town, getting rid of them, and Plan B reinoe would be the lynch today because Night 1 will hopefully sort out TSO and Garmr. Scum plan for a scum lord.<br><br>...<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6484599#p6484599\">516</a>: Oh, explanation. Still scum.<br><br>Anyways, at the top of page 21 and I am taking a break because the initial grievance about serrapaladin has been looked at, and though there must be more to look at, this whole damn thing looks too long. Enjoy a wall of no-one-is-going-to-read-that.<br><br>My takeaway is that serra looks pretty good as town. A lot of crap has been brought to his door and plenty of it has been seen to and dealt with. I am not coming from the same perspective, reinoe, and maybe part of that is my unwillingness to play the meta game. I do not try to bring past games into a current one, and nor do I look at one game I played with another person and try to apply it here. I might get a general feeling of a player and use that as a starting point for further, ahem, feels, but I feel that is the extent of my meta application. My impression of the serra x reinoe debate is one of semantics and over-use of meta to the point of death tunneling."}

I knew I would get to something, someday. I see a lot of the grief here is a lack of reading the game as it progresses as the context around serrapaladin's posts here. I feel I was able to extract a lot of the positions serra takes on people based on his posts, because if he says something short and sweet, he links the post in question, and I can read and make my own thoughts. You obviously feel otherwise, and your rejection to serra's posts seems like something you have already decided, and you are looking for/making up the scumslant. The case here goes down several posts, to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6489655#p6489655\">722</a>, and that is impressive and dedicated. I definitely still disagree, but I do appreciate following your case and process.

He's still pushing Garmr which I don't get; Do you not understand that keeping him until tomorrow is better whether he's town OR scum? (That goes for anyone on his wagon by the way). The thing about his push on Garmr is that he keeps flip flopping it: sometimes it's a policy lynch, other times he's scum. The self vote is what does it for me, though, I think. It comes across as scum, trying to look like town that's too fed up to even continue. <br><br>Side note: Anyone who self votes should just be modkilled. I hate that so much."}

We were hoping to have 13 presents under the tree for you from the Three Wise Men, but it looks like I'll only need to worry about 12. I guess we'll repurpose whatever Vincero was going to get. Or do you want me to give him a consolation present anyway before I tell you whether or not he's an impostor?\"<br><br>It took a while and some sneering (hopefully no more storm offs), but eventually everyone agreed to give him a pity gift.<br><br>\"Alright then. Vincero, here's your gift.\"<br><br>Vincero received a modest white envelope from Zar. Once he opened it, he found a cruise to Neverland, without a return date on it!<br><br><img src=\"http://yoursourceisopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/d394b6d9ticket-icon.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"><br><br>\"It is paid, vince.

Scum fears pressure more than town does, scum feels the need to explain votes carefully more than town does. If every town was afraid of putting someone at L-X, we would never have wagons.

Your read of TSO jumps from \"definite scum and we are finding out by lynch or hide,\" to \"total townie, so town that I will not vote for him or target him at night\". Like, what the hell. For the rest of the day, it is all about anybody else, but epecially vincero and silverspawn, serrapaladin blowup aside, and come today, not even a TSO thought in your mind as you vote for elleheathen. To me, it looks like you are taking whichever scumspects look like easy pickings, since apparently elleheathen is taking heat for calling vincero town (a nulltell to me), and vincero and silverspawn were pretty easy targets as we neared deadline.<br><br>I wish you felt consistent, and I feel your reads yesterday were very all over the place.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Everyone:</span> We need to lynch Garmr, and doing it today is the best time. His claim still requires verifying, he failed to achieve a town goal last night, his target was not even clear if he even achieved that goal, and I cannot see why discussing his lynch is not more topical today. Whether or not we go through two towns today and tonight, I do not want to see Garmr make it to LYLO with a huge, questionable cloud over his head because he put so much WIFOM yesterday. <br><br>Garmr might flip scum, which is good.<br><br>Garmr might flip town, which is bad, but not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">so</span> bad. Simply put, putting him down now saves us the drama of sorting him out later, and also clears another townie (with their death), but definitely narrows down our suspects.<br><br>To not lynch him now on grounds of practical sense and his scumplay that was yesterday, means that when we do lynch him, we have too much to investigate. If he flips scum, we have to look at droog, should droog not be dead. If he flips town with droog alive, we lose two town later in the game, when numbers are critical. A dead town droog, mind you, is of no use in clearing Garmr, but a dead Garmr does help clear droog, whether or not droog makes it to the morning after.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br>I am unvoting for now, but know that my vote is still for Garmr.

(Warning, rhetorical questions ahead) Would it be had I silently kept my vote on vincero? Would it be had I more publicly crowed about the lynch before he flipped? Would it be that I unvoted vincero before he got lynched? Would it be if vincero flipped scum and I had expressed doubts? Essentially, I am saying there is no pleasing you, you would have come to a scumread due to some bias (scum or not). My failure, if you were to actually point it out instead of this weak argument, was not taking the time or care to jump off the wagon I initially started while building a stronger (but how stronger) case on another player. Unfortunately, my options were to jump on silverspawn/droog wagon (which frankly was equally as valid, so why leave the first), or try to push a new wagon near the end of deadline."}

So far this game you've written walls when they weren't needed, focussed on garmr the entire game and generally discussed things that weren't relevant. <br>Yes, his choice was obv. I remember him saying about the time just before I came in I think that he was either going to hide behind vince or silverspawn, whichever didn't get lynched. I also like how you completely ignored the part after he said he might fuck with scum where he discussed the pros and cons and just said, nah the cons outweigh the pros here, hiding behind x. And an appropriate time to address this is when we lynch him at the end of the day, it's not really worth discussing now because all is does is shut down town discussion, yes we have to lynch him, and unless something amazing happens yes it should be today, he forced this by all his soft claiming and shit. <br><br>Doing the rest of the ISO's today, got some time a bit later."}

Lynching me should be a hard lesson for you all to judge a player by the content and the motive behind his/her content (who they are pushing, do they actually believe what they are saying ect.) Instead of focusing on statistical play because that always backfires. Do you think I would bloody claim hider day 1 if I was scum. I have perfect scum win history do you think I would ruin that with a shitty claim like that.

Eventually it will all drop back onto me and I'll be todays lynch.<br><br>Tomorrow elle will have no content and since I flipped town she will be in a bad position the only way she will make it through is by relying on kuribo's play which he was town read for quiting. Kuribo is smart enough to know that quitting and claiming vanilla townie actually puts the slot in a great position. I also know as scum he can get angry at town the example is aircraft mafia where he gets pissed off at wayne gg and joined me in my crusade against him. At the end of the game kuribo gave wayne gg quite a verbal bashing.<br><br>Look at kuribos other action -trying to push me to full claim,going with the majority, he stopped producing content when he felt he was in a suitable position to be town read.-<br><br>She'll most likely flip scum. She is trying to hide behind me and people are refusing to see that so lynch me today and lynch that scummy girl tomorrow.<br><br>I Feel like reinoe is sticking mighty close to me through and I feel a bit uneasy.

I am actually going to need to post quotes to be clear, and we are back to seeing walls. Ugh, ugh, ugh.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Oooh. Who's the new wagon? Or are they irrelevant now?</div></blockquote><br>Tackling in one go; for someone who ISOed me, you should remember <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6498770#p6498770\">928</a>, where I posted scumreads and a nullread/scumlean. All could have been possible wagons. Are they irrelevant now if I am pursuing my main issue, something which I pointed out on Day 1 and which I wanted to resolve the coming day? No, but setting aside Garmr and possibly causing wagons other than where I would like would be sidetracking, and I am not for that.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And I think I get where you're coming from with the vince votes. I didn't factor timing into the equation there at all. And hey, I didn't particularly think staying on Vincent was scummy, just the way you went about it was. On saying that, that was the least worrisome part of your case.</div></blockquote><br>Again, if you read it as a scumtell, that is all you and there is not a response you are going to accept which changes that, so I pointed out the futility of debating your hard assertion. Thank you for acknowledging my standpoint was possible before deciding on another explanation.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So far this game you've written walls when they weren't needed, focussed on garmr the entire game and generally discussed things that weren't relevant.</div></blockquote><br>Please quote irrelevant things for clarity. Please tell me which walls were not needed and why.<br><br>Yes, sadly Garmr had been a focus of mine, namely to see him not lynched D1 and give him a chance to do something pro-town when he claimed a power role. Ideally, everyone would have agreed Garmr was a backburner item to settle on D2, but I recall a lot of people trying to lynch him instead of tackling other players. While Garmr may have been a large part of my discussion yesterday, I also went and voted another avenue. Again, I did not build a case against vincero, but I felt no need and was vindicated when a majority of players joined; obviously voting vincero had merit.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Yes, his choice was obv. I remember him saying about the time just before I came in I think that he was either going to hide behind vince or silverspawn, whichever didn't get lynched. I also like how you completely ignored the part after he said he might fuck with scum where he discussed the pros and cons and just said, nah the cons outweigh the pros here, hiding behind x.</div></blockquote><br><strike>I disagree with his choice being obvious, which is why I bring it up. Please quote Garmr when he was clear about his choice; I provided quotes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6514618#p6514618\">1095</a> which showed his waffling after TSO, and thus the doubt surrounding his night target. If you feel that any of those quotes inaccurately portrayed his choice, I would like to know and then take back my assertion.<br><br>I ignored nothing; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6514618#p6514618\">1095</a>'s first paragraph lays out how I followed his public statements regarding who his hide target would be. Again, if I missed something, I am willing to concede to proof or a better interpretation.</strike><br><br>Double-checked; I did quote plenty of accurate things, but I know I did not quote his pro/cons post, and further down I did not catch his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6495313#p6495313\">819</a>. Garmr does say if vincero got lynched, he would hide behind silverspawn. I am wrong about how clear he was; apologies.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And an appropriate time to address this is when we lynch him at the end of the day, it's not really worth discussing now because all is does is shut down town discussion, yes we have to lynch him, and unless something amazing happens yes it should be today, he forced this by all his soft claiming and shit.</div></blockquote><br>At least on this we agree."}

To only talk when mentioned is not necessarily scumplay but just poor town play.<br><br>Anyway, I'm not overly convinced on the gerai lynch. I'm not exactly townreading him - he has basically flown under the radar for me - but I don't know. I don't really see scum \"accidentally\" hammering in the manner that he did and then responding how he did.  In fact, Reinoe's point in post 1153 makes me think gerai is more likely to not be scum (partially because i am still scumreading reinoe) just because I have a hard time believing that he would expect this to work as scum."}

It's not even people looking at the content I actually posted a town like this is going to lose the game. <br><br>When I look at the player list I see some inexperience with situations I have presented (looking through your games there's atleast 5 players who have never been in a similar situation who are newer.). Lynching me should be a hard lesson for you all to judge a player by the content and the motive behind his/her content (who they are pushing, do they actually believe what they are saying ect.) Instead of focusing on statistical play because that always backfires. Do you think I would bloody claim hider day 1 if I was scum. I have perfect scum win history do you think I would ruin that with a shitty claim like that. Scum have to think long term not short term and about self preservation do you think I would place my self in a desirable position to get lynched as scum -_-<br><br>I have already predicted what will happen and it obvious to see.<br><br>People are pushing their scum reads but towns so split on who to push that it would be hard to get a lynch off. Eventually it will all drop back onto me and I'll be todays lynch.<br><br>Tomorrow elle will have no content and since I flipped town she will be in a bad position the only way she will make it through is by relying on kuribo's play which he was town read for quiting. Kuribo is smart enough to know that quitting and claiming vanilla townie actually puts the slot in a great position. I also know as scum he can get angry at town the example is aircraft mafia where he gets pissed off at wayne gg and joined me in my crusade against him. At the end of the game kuribo gave wayne gg quite a verbal bashing.<br><br>Look at kuribos other action -trying to push me to full claim,going with the majority, he stopped producing content when he felt he was in a suitable position to be town read.-<br><br>She'll most likely flip scum. She is trying to hide behind me and people are refusing to see that so lynch me today and lynch that scummy girl tomorrow.<br><br>I Feel like reinoe is sticking mighty close to me through and I feel a bit uneasy.

I feel a lot of it translates into AtE, wherein you proclaim helplessness, you portray your situation as something for which people are settling versus purposefully choosing, and you hypothesize about probable outcomes which anyone with half a brain (at least pretend your fellow players have that much) can conjecture.  Your defense to all the flack you are getting is to try to defend your meta, which is bad because then your defense is WIFOM; having us either take things on faith or granting you leeway for scummy play is asking for a lot. That is the issue here: I do not know what your play is like in other games, but your play here has been bad/scummy, and you are getting punished for it.<br><br>That last sentence irks me because it has to be in-part true. Logical reasons to clear you aside, you are also being punished for poor play, no matter how good you are on good days. Your Day 1 here was not one of those good days. Garmr, should you legitimately be a 1-shot Hider, you played one outstandingly bad. Your softclaim was too much, your hardclaim came out in the midst of a bad altercation, your flares-up won you no patience with others, and you are trying to defend yourself with self-meta against a mix of emotional frustration and logic. Your current defense, Garmr, is not going to stop any push on you, but I also think any defense would fail, period.</div></blockquote><br>Even when you get rid of my fluff i still produce more content than the average player in this game.</div></blockquote><br>Why are you contributing fluff in the first place?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6518124#p6518124\" class=\"postlink\">post 1141</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6518112#p6518112\" class=\"postlink\">post 1140</a>, T S O wrote:</cite>the really quick wagon also makes me feel uncomfortable but you know what he'll die anyway</div></blockquote><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tbh his just null for me</span> but no one wants to vote my scum read (elle) and since everyone suspicious of me theyare all hesitant about jumping on my wagon.<br></div></blockquote><br>You're voting Geri over Elle to get to night faster.<br><br>I also stand by what I said all of yesterday too.

I am okay with either serrapaladin or you, ac1983fan, walking me through that one, as I am a dunce.</div></blockquote><br>*shrugs* I have been following serra for most of the game 'cause he's pretty obv town.  Serra and I agree on reinoe but he doesn't seem to be that popular of a lynch.  Right now town is divided - anything that unites us a bit more is good."}

That is an idea I will put out there, but I am personally fine with his own (probably screwed) investigation.

Then backed off his thor read when thor commented on thor/me being scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>The reason I've been scumreading SB since he replaced in is mostly because he's been just making generalizations or plain inaccurate accusations against me and others; His cases are flat. For example, in post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6548094#p6548094\" class=\"postlink\">1412</a>,<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6548100#p6548100\" class=\"postlink\">1413</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6548101#p6548101\" class=\"postlink\">1414</a>, I pointed out where what he said is just plain incorrect. This isn't \"Aeronaut is acting scummy\", it's more along the lines of making up fake quotes which arent even close to my views, or saying I was trying to lynch somebody that I simply didn't. <span class=\"noboldsig\">These are things that are verifiable.</span> You can literally just look back in the game. It's like saying the sky just isn't blue. Hint: It is. <br><br>He hasn't bothered responding to those things since I posted them, and tried to pass it off as a quote war. In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6561223#p6561223\" class=\"postlink\">post 1599</a>, he says he doesn't have time to reply to me, but then replies to only a bit of my argument. He selectively replied to my case on him, with the thing he had an answer for at the time.<br><br>Mix that with some of the awfulness of the other three players in that slot, I don't see a scenario where SB isn't scum.  <br><br><br>As far as I'm concerned, we lynch Thor today, and then SB tomorrow. I think Serra is town. Thor, on the other hand, I've played with before. I've also looked at the newbie game that Serra linked... and I just really think he needs to die today. I don't really agree with Serra and SB that he's more town because of joining up with Titus so quickly, I think that's something that scum!Thor is very likely to do. He knew titus was probably in trouble, Titus came up with that scheme, and he was trying to build momentum to get Garmr lynched before people started questioning it too much. That whole thing went down in like a few hours. <br><br>I also don't really see scum!Serra fighting back scum!Titus on that. It would have been really easy for scum!serra to just slide right in and vote Garmr, but that's not what happened. Process of elimination, that just leaves Thor/SB, which is kind of just an extra confirmation at this point. Unless something is really wonky in this game, I don't see an alternative scenario."}

Love was supposed to be in the air everytime we looked around, but apparently love was the least of the interests in the secluded section where the 7 remaining sketchy guests roamed. In vain had Zar tried to get the impostors weeded out soon, 6 were already missing and a seventh one was to be picked from the remaining guests. Talk about love... there seemed to be only pure hatred left here.<br><br>Anyway, as a compensation for all the hurt feelings of the mod, and also to compensate the lack of the fake Madonna performance, it was decided that the cheesy pick of the guest being expelled would be heard first, if only to understand the mindset they were in. Maybe it would shed some light as to what we were encountering. <br><br>So after some deliberation, the majority decided Aeronaut was going to get to pick the next love song for the station. A melancholic air filled the atmosphere as Aeronaut, tired, head down moved to the phone and mumbled something to the Operator no one got to hear well. He then handed in his ID which Zar looked at, and then frowned.<br><br>As Zar's pick finished in the station, the DJ's voice was heard:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"And now Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a special request coming straight from the Castle's guests to 99.9 FM, LVRadio!\"</span><br><br>And then, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-I2s5zRbHg\" class=\"postlink\">this tune</a> started playing. <br><br>Aeronaut then said: \"I guess that's all I have to say\", and then started to run away, bolting through the door crying. But no one was sure if the tears were of sadness or lunacy. The song he chose though, made fairly clear what he had meant.</span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Aeronaut, <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Goon</span></span>, forced to confess he was up to no good (lynched) on Day Four!</span><br><br><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">It is Now Night and it will last for Seventy Two (72) Hours.</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadline</span>: February 10, 2015 12:00 PM New York Time.

Aeronaut's Amy Winehouse rendition (which was surprisingly good, perhaps he could have even considered auditioning for the X-Factor --if he hadn't been a killer in disguise) had sent the remaining Six guest into a somber mood. It had worried 'Zar very much because he was afraid of what could happen during the night if left alone (heck, there was NO WAY he was going to stay babysitting these people, he had seen what they were capable of). So he left the premises hoping to not be given grim news. <br><br>The morning came, and with it, the somber dawn brought news from the secluded wing. Bitter love almost always leads to tragic endings. It's obsessive and toxic. And so it had happened. Now there were only five guests to worry about. On the upside, the castle was going to be reducing a bit its expenses on room and board. It would unfortunately not make for a very fun </span></span><span style=\"color: fucsia\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mardi Gras</span></span><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> preparation.

Also, Zar had an idea that these would somehow make evident which of<br>the sketchy peeps was part of the ploy to bring the party down. <br><br>The first of the remaining guests to parade her costume through the hall was elle. She had picked a somewhat flamboyant, but rather well fitting fantasy Samba School Outfit. <br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: elle's costume!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/df4lwBG.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div>.<br><br>Since it didn't have any pockets, elle was forced to hand in over her ID.<br><br>Zar smiled. \"It's okay\" he said. \"You can go to the party now. We'll forget all past transgressions. Party hard.\"<br><br>Elle felt relieved. She was either sick or tired of hanging out with the same people. \"At least I'll share the fun!\".<br><br>Then, it was SB's turn. He had obviouslt tried to pick something that could match elle's appealing costume. It seemed alright enough. A bit less revealing for someone so eager to carnival out, certainly, which Zar thought was odd.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: SB's costume!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JyOrqHa.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div><br><br>There was something in the outfit that just seemed off to Zar. The headpiece was too big, and it fit him kind of loose? He decided to card SB until he could inspect the last of the ID's.<br><br>Thor was the last to come out of the dressers. He had certainly tried to find something that wasn't too revealing, but it looked like he had failed to find anything fitting him. Particularly bothersome of his costume was the prop he accompanied his outfit with.<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Thor's Costume!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/L2aW1mN.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div><br><br>So he confiscated Thor's card. Both looked relatively legit.<br><br>Zar was thus stuck with a dilemma, of whom to banish from the party. And called ellen to help him judge who was going to join her in the carnival.<br><br>Elle was a bit shocked at the picks. She was going to have to play fashion police here.<br><br>\"So, elle. Tell me who you think is probably the conniving conspirationist against the Holiday Bash between these two?\"<br><br>\"I don't know.\" elle said. For one, it's like... that headpiece SB chose is probably large and loose enough to hide a bazooka in it. I think SB is hiding something. And then Thor maybe is trying to hide in the clear with that obvious weapon? This is confusing. WHY AM I STILL HERE I WANT TO PARTY!\"<br><br>\"Help me choose elle. I promise we'll make an event of it.\"<br><br>Elle's eyes narrowed, as she scrutinized every single terrible aspect of both outfits. In the end, she decided the stains in Thor's sword were probably not from tomato sauce.<br><br>\"Hey!\" Thor bickered. \"Why can't elle hide a gun in her costume?

A 1-Shot hider wouldn't have been too bad either; a Roleblocker wouldn't have interacted well with the Hider because NAR lets hide resolve first. For a second, the hider was almost wiped out, as Garmr was planning to Hide behind elle and Aeronaut almost NK'd elle's slot when he was considering killing Madonna. I was fairly demotivated to write flavor on day one until I decided to put up the baby sloth because the idea of having to keep constantly searching for replacements because some people simply abandoned the slots AFTER replacing in was a bit downbringing plus the few rule breachings and scream matches that this game spun around. As things calmed down, I got back on track writing some flavor for it. <br><br>I think town took a hit with the shenanigans of Day One and was fairly disorganized well into the end. To their advantage, Garmr's play with the hider let them organize themselves a little better. I think killing droog over TSO could've been a scum mistake. As far as design, I considered a Mafia Ascetic, but decided against it because it might have given the Mafia an unfair edge since it would have thrown in a misleading result for the hider. In addition, the hider had fairly big odds of \"clearing\" a mason or dying behind a goon, and the scum would have been given a double result if they targeted the hider's target, so all in all I do agree with it being balanced.<br><br>acfan was in the right track with his Role Hunting, I think they would have found TSO was a PR if they had checked him over serrapaladin."}

All others were obligatory.<br>That's a tough bill of sale for a scum team. You might as well have less players and make it a nightless game or something at that point, in my opinion.<br><br>I will admit 'clears' are, in my opinion, the vastly most potent town effect in the game as they remove the whole 'uninformed' aspect from town and, consequently, batter away at scum's real benefit against being the minority. I actually prefer investigatives like watchers and trackers for that explicit reason. However, even for someone who thinks 'clears' are great, I submit there was far too much of that tech in this game."}
