Isn't that exciting? You've waited for that card ever since Zar set foot in mafiascum! Unfortunately, turns out you had no idea people would literally kill to be there. And that's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">exactly</div> what's been happening. Impostors murdered and are impersonating some of the real guests, and they're most definitely not good people. They're set to eliminate Zar, his Westerosi case-building ways, and those that support him! Sadly Zar's way too busy hosting his party to bother double checking everyone's ID's... I mean, come on, there are 5 thousand guests and a handful of events taking place! However, he has given word that he will look at the documents (one person at a time) that are brought to him. His co-host and reviewers have narrowed down the suspect pool to the sketchiest 13 guests. Sadly, you're among them. <br>\n<br>\nAs a precautionary measure, the thirteen of you have been locked in one of the wings of the castle (yep, the same one from 160B). Everyone is certainly convinced the impostors are among you since, aside from flings no one wants to know about, no crimes have happened after you all were locked up together. We think that letting you sort it out should work? Hopefully those impostors won't end up killing everyone in the room and the house! Work your wits to catch them and try to make at least to the final dinner!</div></div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">This is the sample Vanilla Townie role PM</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\n<br>\nWelcome, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[Player X]</div>!

Read them <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br>\nA2) Play to your faction's win condition, as long as you do not break any game or site rules in doing so.<br>\nA3) You may not discuss this game anywhere outside the game thread unless explicitly permitted to do so in your role PM.<br>\nA4) Quoting or pretending to quote your role PM, quicktopics, private communications with the mod, or (in the case of hydrae) discussion with other heads is strictly forbidden. Loose paraphrasing is permitted, although run it past me first when in doubt.<br>\nA5) Be civil and treat other players with respect--attack the case, not the person. Mafia is a heated game, but I will interfere if anyone resorts to excessive insults, personal attacks, and bullying.<br>\nA6) There is a zero-tolerance policy against offensive comments or slurs based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. You may be harshly punished for even a first violation of this rule.<br>\nA7) Encryption is forbidden, as well as messages hidden in invisible text, small text, or BBCode tags. Always err on the side of caution and ask the mod before leaving a code or breadcrumb. A good rule of thumb is that if the average person cannot decipher the code without outside software after having it pointed out, you can't use it.<br>\nA8) Editing and deleting posts (if you have the power to do so) is strictly forbidden.<br>\nA9) If you have outside information that influences your knowledge of the game, are aware of someone else having outside information, or have any reason to believe that the game has been compromised, it is your responsibility to inform the mod immediately. I will love you for your honesty.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">B) Voting/Lynching Mechanics</div><br>\n<br>\nB1) For your vote or unvote to be counted, it must be completely bolded, and use the format Vote: PlayerName/Unvote: PlayerName or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>/<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Playername</span> (capital letters and colon optional). Any other variation (such Hammer: PlayerName) will not be counted.<br>\nB2) Votes for misspellings or acronyms of players' names (such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playrname</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: PN</span>) are valid as long as the player being voted for is clear. You are not required to unvote before changing your vote. However, votes that are behind spoiler tags, in small or invisible text, or otherwise concealed are invalid.<br>\nB3) A lynch will occur when 50%+1 of the votes are cast for the same player. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight.<br>\nB4) (AKA Zachrulez's Nemesis's Rule) You may vote for \"no lynch\" if you wish. If 50% of the players in the game vote for no-lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\nB5) Dead is dead - no 'Bah' post. Not even one. If the mod hasn't posted the endgame scene, you may not post again, even after a hammer in LYLO. Under absolutely under no circumstances may you reveal game-relevant information after your death.<br>\nB6) (AKA The \"Blame Katsuki\" Rule) Votes from an alt account will be interpreted in the most damaging way to your faction. If you can't log in correctly, you have little to complain about.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">C) Activity and Deadlines</div><br>\n<br>\nC1) Days will be 2 weeks long. <br>\nC2) Deadlines will not be extended barring exceptional circumstances or replacement situations. If a majority lynch is not reached before deadline, no lynch occurs.<br>\nC3) You may continue talking after a lynch or deadline has elapsed until the mod posts to end the day. After that, you may not post even if the mod forgets to lock the thread.<br>\nC4) Night phases will last for 72 hours.<br>\nC5) In order to be accepted, night actions must be PMd to the mod or posted in bold in scum QTs before the deadline is up. If a player does not select one, he or she will default to \"no action.\"<br>\nC6) If a replacement is needed during a night phase, I will extend the night deadline until some time after a replacement is found, regardless of whether that slot has a night action.<br>\nC7) Please treat this game as a commitment and do your best to participate actively.<br>\nC8) Players will be prodded after forty-eight hours without posting. They may also request prods on other players so long that player has not posted for a reasonable amount of time. All prods will be announced in thread.<br>\nC9) Players who do not respond to a (non-player-requested) prod within twenty-four hours or need to be prodded too often will be replaced at the discretion of the mod.<br>\nC10) If you will be unable to post for over forty-eight hours, inform the mod by PM or in the thread of when you'll be V/LA. Assuming the V/LA period is of reasonable length, you will be exempt from prods during that time. All V/LA notifications will be made public by the mod.<br>\nC11) I will try to post vote counts every page or every twenty-four hours if possible. Players may request a new vote count at any time.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">D) Other</div><br>\n<br>\nD1) Abilities follow Natural Action Resolution unless explicitly stated otherwise in your role PM.<br>\nD2) If there is a conflict between the rules and your role PM, the role PM takes precedence.<br>\nD3) <div style=\"display:inline;color:Red\">Red</div> is my color. You may not use it.<br>\nD4) Any methods of verifiable randomness are forbidden. This includes dice tags. Don't use them. <br>\nD5) It is possible something may have been overlooked or left unclear. When in doubt, ask. You may be punished for deliberately exploiting technicalities and vague wording in the rules in order to do something you should know is forbidden or unethical.<br>\nD6) Punishment for breaking any of the above rules may include a private or public warning, force replacement, modkill, or even blacklisting (depending on the seriousness of the offence).<br>\nD7) I will modkill players in the way most detrimental to their faction. Modkilled players may be retroactively made into Neutral Survivors.<br>\nD8) I reserve the right to add, remove, or modify rules at any point of the game if it becomes necessary.[/quote]", "time": "Sun Dec 14, 2014 4:01 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

TDA's town statements means he is agreeing with something a person has said, agreeing with a mindset, a line of question, their actions, or whatever. By declaring people are town or scum, TDA is letting us know where he stands on people, and that can be good, since the less he hides and the more he shares, the more material with which town has to work. After that, it is a player's judgment call whether to use that to trust/distrust him. To cry wolf and say his declarations have no explanation behind it is to miss the context, and context is very important.", "time": "Sun Dec 21, 2014 8:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

I don't really give much credit in standard scum tells in general, I think they're far less useful than meta reads. Maybe that's because the community I'm coming from is a lot smaller, so everyone pretty much knows everyone. Though I do think that overexplaining votes is one of the better general scum tells.<br>\n<br>\nAnd to answer the question about how new I am: I finished about ~8 games, all on the side I linked.<br>\n<br>\nAbout alts: well without having much context I dislike the idea, I probably just wouldn't allow alts period, why allow people to cloud their meta in such a cheap way. So, I agree with kuribo there. I also think the approach of being aggressive to cause reaction makes a lot of sense. As scum, you have to pretend constantly, pretending is easiest if you're calm. If a situation gets out of hand and people start getting emotional, that's good for town. He did step out of line as he clearly got personal, but the approach is good.<br>\n<br>\nAbout the serrapaladin/reinoe debate: I really disagree with the case on reinoe. What he did seemed genuine; I mentioned that I had played before, he asked me for a link, I gave two links, why not read them. This may not be the most efficient way to scum hunt, but it's certainly not horrible.

I really don't. Do you want me to fabricate reads in order to appear more towny? That would be lying. I'd prefer not to.

He could have faked the self-hammer, and then faked his rage and fullclaim. How likely this is does of course depend on his meta, so whoever has played with him before should state his opinion.<br>\n<br>\nThe hider thing is silly. Look, some PR's are better targets for scum than VT's because they have dangerous powers, and some are worse targets because they are harder to kill. You say you softclaimed as hider to cause scum to shoot you so that they waste their NK. Okay, that's cool. Of course it doesn't guarantee to accomplish anything, and whether or not scum actually does shoot you just comes down to WIFOM, but I'm fine with using it as a strategy.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, complaining about the fact that we picked up on your softclaim is just plain stupid. Of course we're gonna do that, we don't know that you're a hider. And it doesn't actually change anything, it's still WIFOM from scum's perspective. If you really wanted to do this strategy, you should have anticipated this reaction from us and react in a way that isn't full claiming. Then, in day 2, you should have come clean. On the other hand, if you're scum who planed all of it, then your actions make sense.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure how sincere the rage is, I don't really get what in this game could have him get this upset, but again, I don't know him, people who do need to decide this.", "time": "Thu Dec 25, 2014 12:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

Based on this, I'm suspicious of the motivations of garmr (insistence on geri wagon) and reinoe (\"strong scumread\" on geri). <br>\n<br>\nWent through garmr's ISO and his case on geri is absurd. That's he's tunneling so hard on it (I'm up to 279 right now) is extremely suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nserra/reinoe: I think that this could be town v town, except that reinoe is defending a position that I feel is untenable. The geri case is very weak in my opinion, so his insistence on creating a case where there is none raises flags.<br>\n<br>\nTDA's obsession with meta continues. I don't like this; while meta can be useful, it basically turns into WIFOM if the person is aware of their own meta.<br>\n<br>\nI completely disagree with silverspawn that explaining votes is scummy. In fact, it is my opinion that not explaining votes is scummy. Why would you announce a conclusion without presenting the premises and connections and expect people to believe/sheep you?<br>\n<br>\nI like Aero's 313. Town lean from him, good analysis in my opinion and he's able to see through garmr.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, TSO isn't exactly contributing much in ISO, when you filter all of the meta nonsense.<br>\n<br>\nRe: 331, hypotheticals are a useful way of addressing the devil's advocate position. If you don't at least acknowledge them, then it's easy to assume a conclusion and confbias your way to a mislynch. Villifying hypotheticals could also be used by scum to railroad the town into not thinking critically. <br>\n<br>\nI'm at 355 right now and I would like to say that all of this meta nonsense is annoying.<br>\n<br>\n357 worst claim I've ever seen, obviously fake.<br>\n <br>\nI think serra's town, he does good analysis.<br>\n<br>\nTSO <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">still</div> insisting on meta analysis instead of the plethora of in-game material to analyze. <br>\n<br>\n416: reinoe doesn't post for 60 posts but his next post is a defensive attack nine minutes after a vote. I've been questioning reinoe all game but this is simply a knee-jerk defensive reaction. <br>\n<br>\nI disagree with Madonna on several points but in general their posts seem to be genuine. I can't even blame them for their vote on me, I can see their perspective. <br>\n<br>\nSilverspawn's 429 is very reasonable. He was neutral before, now he's slight town.<br>\n<br>\nreinoe is confusing to me, on the one hand he's backing some unreasonable cases, but on the other hand he will post analysis posts that are flawed but completely understandable from the perspective of someone who genuinely believes a flawed case. Still scumreading, less than garmr.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like geri's 436, his \"why should I unvote?\" regarding an RVS vote, which still stands despite everything that's happened since then, is questionable. Surely he must have a read stronger than RVS by now.<br>\n<br>\nac198sfan's 444 looks genuine. Leaning town.<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion, townreads are Aero, serra, ac1983, Madonna, exakt, kuribo, silver. Scumreads are TSO, reinoe, garmr, TDA. Geri is neutral until we get more content, I would have leaned town except for 436.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Garmr</span>", "time": "Thu Dec 25, 2014 4:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

The important response is from garmr who instantly hops on the waynegg wagon. Too fast imo. Idk who waynegg is but regardless garmr's response is too quick.<br>\n<br>\ngarmr putting up lots of fluff.<br>\n<br>\nI agree with kuribo that getting any kind of reaction is a valid method of scumhunting, though he seems to go about ti in a different way than I usually do.<br>\n<br>\ngarmr trying too hard to make geri a wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI'm around 275 and there seems to be a lot of suspicion on geri. Until here he's only posted to ISO 9. The only important post up until then is ISO 7, which I think is perfectly fine. Based on this, I'm suspicious of the motivations of garmr (insistence on geri wagon) and reinoe (\"strong scumread\" on geri). <br>\n<br>\nWent through garmr's ISO and his case on geri is absurd. That's he's tunneling so hard on it (I'm up to 279 right now) is extremely suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nserra/reinoe: I think that this could be town v town, except that reinoe is defending a position that I feel is untenable. The geri case is very weak in my opinion, so his insistence on creating a case where there is none raises flags.<br>\n<br>\nTDA's obsession with meta continues. I don't like this; while meta can be useful, it basically turns into WIFOM if the person is aware of their own meta.<br>\n<br>\nI completely disagree with silverspawn that explaining votes is scummy. In fact, it is my opinion that not explaining votes is scummy. Why would you announce a conclusion without presenting the premises and connections and expect people to believe/sheep you?<br>\n<br>\nI like Aero's 313. Town lean from him, good analysis in my opinion and he's able to see through garmr.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, TSO isn't exactly contributing much in ISO, when you filter all of the meta nonsense.<br>\n<br>\nRe: 331, hypotheticals are a useful way of addressing the devil's advocate position. If you don't at least acknowledge them, then it's easy to assume a conclusion and confbias your way to a mislynch. Villifying hypotheticals could also be used by scum to railroad the town into not thinking critically. <br>\n<br>\nI'm at 355 right now and I would like to say that all of this meta nonsense is annoying.<br>\n<br>\n357 worst claim I've ever seen, obviously fake.<br>\n <br>\nI think serra's town, he does good analysis.<br>\n<br>\nTSO <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">still</div> insisting on meta analysis instead of the plethora of in-game material to analyze. <br>\n<br>\n416: reinoe doesn't post for 60 posts but his next post is a defensive attack nine minutes after a vote. I've been questioning reinoe all game but this is simply a knee-jerk defensive reaction. <br>\n<br>\nI disagree with Madonna on several points but in general their posts seem to be genuine. I can't even blame them for their vote on me, I can see their perspective. <br>\n<br>\nSilverspawn's 429 is very reasonable. He was neutral before, now he's slight town.<br>\n<br>\nreinoe is confusing to me, on the one hand he's backing some unreasonable cases, but on the other hand he will post analysis posts that are flawed but completely understandable from the perspective of someone who genuinely believes a flawed case. Still scumreading, less than garmr.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like geri's 436, his \"why should I unvote?\" regarding an RVS vote, which still stands despite everything that's happened since then, is questionable. Surely he must have a read stronger than RVS by now.<br>\n<br>\nac198sfan's 444 looks genuine. Leaning town.<br>\n-----<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion, townreads are Aero, serra, ac1983, Madonna, exakt, kuribo, silver. Scumreads are TSO, reinoe, garmr, TDA.

You go on to say that gerai is a \"much better vote\" than silver, despite there being no real case on gerai, and you having mounted a meta attack on silver earlier. Why are you so eager to suddenly drop the meta case and join garmr against gerai? Because it's a golden opportunity to place the first vote on a wagon that is being pressured but that has not actually been created yet. You later place a \"strong scumread\" on gerai, despite his having said almost nothing and in fact having probably been afk since you initially voted for him. In your following posts you just keep trying to pressure people into joining you on the gerai wagon. Which you sort of helped create, over nothing.

I hope all those horrible rage posts decrease from here on out, and while I am sure some information lies within all that dreck, a lot of it is WIFOM, whiny bad play, and even a flip would not help much extract and separate the real and unreal from that mess. For those of you who flipped out: I wish you were dead, so I need not bother with you and your spoiled ISO. All of you get a scumlean/read for it, so thanks a lot if you are town because you helped muddy the waters, and no one should be able to claim they must be town due to caring so much they rage posted.<br>\n<br>\nThe early claims were bad too, which are both Garmr and kuribo if memory serves. However, that is bad, not scum, as I believe the context of kuribo being a rager wanting to throw down works, and even if I disagree with Garmr's context, he can still perhaps provide some information for Day 2.<br>\n<br>\nSo, page 27.

I would say TSO is a waste too since that is who Garmr wants to investigate, but here is a crazy idea to all of his nay-sayers: if we distrust him, why not all lay in and give him a target? While it is still up in the air whether Garmr accepts this, the idea is that his ability can be spent in a town-approved manner, instead of him setting up who he targets and possibly how he explains himself the following Day. That is an idea I will put out there, but I am personally fine with his own (probably screwed) investigation. But anyways, I am still not up for a Garmr or TSO lynch, and despite kuribo's harsh words and early claim, I like the scumhunting I saw, so that is a no from me too.", "time": "Sat Dec 27, 2014 5:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

I really don't. Do you want me to fabricate reads in order to appear more towny? That would be lying. I'd prefer not to. You have very long days, I'll get more comfortable the more context I have for different players. Right now, if I had to assign scum % to every player in this game, it would all be between 20 and 30%.<br>\n<br>\nNow about what's actually happening, do you guys think Garmr is the kind of player who makes all of this up as scum? He could have faked the self-hammer, and then faked his rage and fullclaim. How likely this is does of course depend on his meta, so whoever has played with him before should state his opinion.<br>\n<br>\nThe hider thing is silly. Look, some PR's are better targets for scum than VT's because they have dangerous powers, and some are worse targets because they are harder to kill. You say you softclaimed as hider to cause scum to shoot you so that they waste their NK. Okay, that's cool. Of course it doesn't guarantee to accomplish anything, and whether or not scum actually does shoot you just comes down to WIFOM, but I'm fine with using it as a strategy.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, complaining about the fact that we picked up on your softclaim is just plain stupid. Of course we're gonna do that, we don't know that you're a hider. And it doesn't actually change anything, it's still WIFOM from scum's perspective. If you really wanted to do this strategy, you should have anticipated this reaction from us and react in a way that isn't full claiming. Then, in day 2, you should have come clean. On the other hand, if you're scum who planed all of it, then your actions make sense.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure how sincere the rage is, I don't really get what in this game could have him get this upset, but again, I don't know him, people who do need to decide this.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Sun Dec 28, 2014 5:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

While it is still up in the air whether Garmr accepts this, the idea is that his ability can be spent in a town-approved manner, instead of him setting up who he targets and possibly how he explains himself the following Day. That is an idea I will put out there, but I am personally fine with his own (probably screwed) investigation.

Serra thinks diving into off-site meta isn't the best use of someone's time.  However as we are all aware, everyone scumhunts differently.  And serra's question...is actually a fake question.  I looked up silverspawn's specific meta because he had four votes and he did look kinda scummy that's why his particular meta took a priority.  Also Serra thinks doing a metadive gives me something to do without engaging in the game.  There are two things wrong with this.  First of all  I completed both meta dives and did not delay interacting with this game.  Serrapaladin is cognizant of this fact so his comment is rather baseless.

Enjoy a wall of no-one-is-going-to-read-that.<br>\n<br>\nMy takeaway is that serra looks pretty good as town. A lot of crap has been brought to his door and plenty of it has been seen to and dealt with. I am not coming from the same perspective, reinoe, and maybe part of that is my unwillingness to play the meta game. I do not try to bring past games into a current one, and nor do I look at one game I played with another person and try to apply it here. I might get a general feeling of a player and use that as a starting point for further, ahem, feels, but I feel that is the extent of my meta application. My impression of the serra x reinoe debate is one of semantics and over-use of meta to the point of death tunneling.", "time": "Fri Jan 02, 2015 4:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

I knew I would get to something, someday. I see a lot of the grief here is a lack of reading the game as it progresses as the context around serrapaladin's posts here. I feel I was able to extract a lot of the positions serra takes on people based on his posts, because if he says something short and sweet, he links the post in question, and I can read and make my own thoughts. You obviously feel otherwise, and your rejection to serra's posts seems like something you have already decided, and you are looking for/making up the scumslant. The case here goes down several posts, to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6489655#p6489655\">722</a>, and that is impressive and dedicated. I definitely still disagree, but I do appreciate following your case and process. There is at least one time in my wall where I am agreeing that serrapaladin is being evasive or not clear enough, so I do not think you are jumping at solely shadows, but part of your case seems to be meta, and I am frankly no good in that arena.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6489854#p6489854\">727</a> by serra sucks.

Did you want to clarify why that was in there; your wall was quite large, and if you missed making one point, would you like the chance to bring it up now?

I didn't feel as if you were giving real particulars, so I read into you a bit. Stating who you aren't in favor of lynching is fine, but stating who you'd like to lynch is much better. <br>\n<br>\nI was satisfied with Garmr's answers to what I asked. TSO was an emotional vote, and decided after cooling off that it was a bad one. He liked your post because it was similar to his thinking at the time. Don't see how it can be clarified more than that. My wall was directed at Garmr and only garmr; I don't care if anyone else read it.

I think this is true especially for new scum, if you're new you try to explain all of your votes carefully in order to appear reasonable, whereas town just doesn't care as much.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is flawed because it opens up an avenue for scum to strongly pressure a town player without the town player being able to defend themselves against it without looking scummy for defending their position.</div></blockquote><br>\nNot only is silverspawn trying to justify not having to explain anything, it's not even taking into consideration that though rare, that is exactly how some obvtowns play. Complete transparency is exactly the type of shit scum is going to call 'overexplaining'. There's apparently some kind of thin line between being clear and being scum?

Scum fears pressure more than town does, scum feels the need to explain votes carefully more than town does. If every town was afraid of putting someone at L-X, we would never have wagons.

We were hoping to have 13 presents under the tree for you from the Three Wise Men, but it looks like I'll only need to worry about 12. I guess we'll repurpose whatever Vincero was going to get. Or do you want me to give him a consolation present anyway before I tell you whether or not he's an impostor?\"<br>\n<br>\nIt took a while and some sneering (hopefully no more storm offs), but eventually everyone agreed to give him a pity gift.<br>\n<br>\n\"Alright then. Vincero, here's your gift.\"<br>\n<br>\nVincero received a modest white envelope from Zar. Once he opened it, he found a cruise to Neverland, without a return date on it!<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://yoursourceisopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/d394b6d9ticket-icon.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\n\"It is paid, vince.

Your read of TSO jumps from \"definite scum and we are finding out by lynch or hide,\" to \"total townie, so town that I will not vote for him or target him at night\". Like, what the hell. For the rest of the day, it is all about anybody else, but epecially vincero and silverspawn, serrapaladin blowup aside, and come today, not even a TSO thought in your mind as you vote for elleheathen. To me, it looks like you are taking whichever scumspects look like easy pickings, since apparently elleheathen is taking heat for calling vincero town (a nulltell to me), and vincero and silverspawn were pretty easy targets as we neared deadline.<br>\n<br>\nI wish you felt consistent, and I feel your reads yesterday were very all over the place.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Everyone:</div> We need to lynch Garmr, and doing it today is the best time. His claim still requires verifying, he failed to achieve a town goal last night, his target was not even clear if he even achieved that goal, and I cannot see why discussing his lynch is not more topical today. Whether or not we go through two towns today and tonight, I do not want to see Garmr make it to LYLO with a huge, questionable cloud over his head because he put so much WIFOM yesterday. <br>\n<br>\nGarmr might flip scum, which is good.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr might flip town, which is bad, but not <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">so</div> bad. Simply put, putting him down now saves us the drama of sorting him out later, and also clears another townie (with their death), but definitely narrows down our suspects.<br>\n<br>\nTo not lynch him now on grounds of practical sense and his scumplay that was yesterday, means that when we do lynch him, we have too much to investigate. If he flips scum, we have to look at droog, should droog not be dead. If he flips town with droog alive, we lose two town later in the game, when numbers are critical. A dead town droog, mind you, is of no use in clearing Garmr, but a dead Garmr does help clear droog, whether or not droog makes it to the morning after.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<br>\nI am unvoting for now, but know that my vote is still for Garmr.

Essentially, I am saying there is no pleasing you, you would have come to a scumread due to some bias (scum or not). My failure, if you were to actually point it out instead of this weak argument, was not taking the time or care to jump off the wagon I initially started while building a stronger (but how stronger) case on another player.

And an appropriate time to address this is when we lynch him at the end of the day, it's not really worth discussing now because all is does is shut down town discussion, yes we have to lynch him, and unless something amazing happens yes it should be today, he forced this by all his soft claiming and shit. <br>\n<br>\nDoing the rest of the ISO's today, got some time a bit later.", "time": "Fri Jan 09, 2015 4:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

Lynching me should be a hard lesson for you all to judge a player by the content and the motive behind his/her content (who they are pushing, do they actually believe what they are saying ect.) Instead of focusing on statistical play because that always backfires. Do you think I would bloody claim hider day 1 if I was scum.

All could have been possible wagons. Are they irrelevant now if I am pursuing my main issue, something which I pointed out on Day 1 and which I wanted to resolve the coming day? No, but setting aside Garmr and possibly causing wagons other than where I would like would be sidetracking, and I am not for that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And I think I get where you're coming from with the vince votes.

Please tell me which walls were not needed and why.<br>\n<br>\nYes, sadly Garmr had been a focus of mine, namely to see him not lynched D1 and give him a chance to do something pro-town when he claimed a power role. Ideally, everyone would have agreed Garmr was a backburner item to settle on D2, but I recall a lot of people trying to lynch him instead of tackling other players. While Garmr may have been a large part of my discussion yesterday, I also went and voted another avenue. Again, I did not build a case against vincero, but I felt no need and was vindicated when a majority of players joined; obviously voting vincero had merit.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Yes, his choice was obv. I remember him saying about the time just before I came in I think that he was either going to hide behind vince or silverspawn, whichever didn't get lynched. I also like how you completely ignored the part after he said he might fuck with scum where he discussed the pros and cons and just said, nah the cons outweigh the pros here, hiding behind x.</div></blockquote><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">I disagree with his choice being obvious, which is why I bring it up. Please quote Garmr when he was clear about his choice; I provided quotes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6514618#p6514618\">1095</a> which showed his waffling after TSO, and thus the doubt surrounding his night target. If you feel that any of those quotes inaccurately portrayed his choice, I would like to know and then take back my assertion.<br>\n<br>\nI ignored nothing; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6514618#p6514618\">1095</a>'s first paragraph lays out how I followed his public statements regarding who his hide target would be. Again, if I missed something, I am willing to concede to proof or a better interpretation.</div><br>\n<br>\nDouble-checked; I did quote plenty of accurate things, but I know I did not quote his pro/cons post, and further down I did not catch his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6495313#p6495313\">819</a>. Garmr does say if vincero got lynched, he would hide behind silverspawn. I am wrong about how clear he was; apologies.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And an appropriate time to address this is when we lynch him at the end of the day, it's not really worth discussing now because all is does is shut down town discussion, yes we have to lynch him, and unless something amazing happens yes it should be today, he forced this by all his soft claiming and shit.</div></blockquote><br>\nAt least on this we agree.", "time": "Sat Jan 10, 2015 12:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

To only talk when mentioned is not necessarily scumplay but just poor town play.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I'm not overly convinced on the gerai lynch. I'm not exactly townreading him - he has basically flown under the radar for me - but I don't know. I don't really see scum \"accidentally\" hammering in the manner that he did and then responding how he did.  In fact, Reinoe's point in post 1153 makes me think gerai is more likely to not be scum (partially because i am still scumreading reinoe) just because I have a hard time believing that he would expect this to work as scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nFair point about trying to involve myself into the game more.

Lynching me should be a hard lesson for you all to judge a player by the content and the motive behind his/her content (who they are pushing, do they actually believe what they are saying ect.) Instead of focusing on statistical play because that always backfires. Do you think I would bloody claim hider day 1 if I was scum.

Kuribo is smart enough to know that quitting and claiming vanilla townie actually puts the slot in a great position. I also know as scum he can get angry at town the example is aircraft mafia where he gets pissed off at wayne gg and joined me in my crusade against him. At the end of the game kuribo gave wayne gg quite a verbal bashing.<br>\n<br>\nLook at kuribos other action -trying to push me to full claim,going with the majority, he stopped producing content when he felt he was in a suitable position to be town read.-<br>\n<br>\nShe'll most likely flip scum.

I feel a lot of it translates into AtE, wherein you proclaim helplessness, you portray your situation as something for which people are settling versus purposefully choosing, and you hypothesize about probable outcomes which anyone with half a brain (at least pretend your fellow players have that much) can conjecture.  Your defense to all the flack you are getting is to try to defend your meta, which is bad because then your defense is WIFOM; having us either take things on faith or granting you leeway for scummy play is asking for a lot. That is the issue here: I do not know what your play is like in other games, but your play here has been bad/scummy, and you are getting punished for it.<br>\n<br>\nThat last sentence irks me because it has to be in-part true. Logical reasons to clear you aside, you are also being punished for poor play, no matter how good you are on good days. Your Day 1 here was not one of those good days. Garmr, should you legitimately be a 1-shot Hider, you played one outstandingly bad. Your softclaim was too much, your hardclaim came out in the midst of a bad altercation, your flares-up won you no patience with others, and you are trying to defend yourself with self-meta against a mix of emotional frustration and logic.

It had to be his hat. Or maybe it was the fact he was the only of the guests who got a celebrity related present? Perhaps some envy had risen among the players?<br>\n<br>\nEventually, they all came up with the perfect plan to get rid of him. As geraitm was distracted by the shiny lights of the tree that was by now being dismantled, everyone piled on him, grabbing him and tying him up. Once they were convinced he could not move anymore, and after securing his wallet, they put him inside one of the boxes left to stow away the Christmas decorations. There was a roll of ribbon large enough to make a bow after the lid was properly secured. In addition, they had found some money inside the wallet, probably enough to pay for expedited shipping.<br>\n<br>\nThe end result was quite pleasing. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: geraitm-in-a-box</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3v1allV.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nVincero would have no idea of what he was going to be expecting as a Secret Santa present! The excuse of delays in holiday shipping would have to do in the accompanying note. <br>\n<br>\nWhen Zar came over to check on the gang he was pleased to find out they were sending a present to their exiled friend. He had heard vincero was doing quite well, but still figured he might be pleased with a sincere present... or was it?<br>\n<br>\nSomething ringed suspicious to Zar. (Cerainly not that a constant thumping came from the box... not at all!). He demanded some explanations, and eventually got everyone to confess what they had planned and got them to hand in the wallet. Some pocket money that could do to buy some of the items needed for V-day was going to be well received. Oh, and the ID was there anyway, so might as well scan it and see if vince was in for an unpleasant surprise...<br>\n<br>\nZar took a glimpse at the ID, scanned it. Smiled, and signed the waybill of the package. \"Should be there in a couple of days,\" he said. \"In the meantime, why don't you all take a rest?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"But what about OUR presents?

Zar had no idea if geraintm ever made it to vincero's side, but wasn't going to ask anyone about delivery confirmation. Christmas was just the beginning of many holiday celebrations that were to take place in the mansion. I mean, ZAR'S SCUMDAY had to be after all an event to remember. There would be Red Velvet Cake, to start. Why Red Velvet? That's not Zar's favorite cake, but it fits the mod and it lets Zar recycle some of the red props that were left from Christmas. <br>\n<br>\nZar was certain he was going to need amusement in the sketchy room too since part of his party was going to be spent by the guests there still trying to figuring out who was out to ruin the celebrations. He had an idea. She was going to be there, and probably knew what the songs where about, so... why not have her perform?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Take a Guess!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/efdFWiP.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nWell, she is probably <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">NOT</div> the real one, but there should be enough props available in the Castle to at least have her look the part.

Hmm.<br>\n<br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">still</div> want to lynch him. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy point is that it felt like you were just posting easy content and then had contradictory stances on Garmr and I feel like if you were bullheaded town you would've just kept pushing the wagon considering you said \"if he isn't cleared we can't trust it anyway\". The way you unvoted didn't seem to match what you were saying. And I never said a thing about your D2 content considering I said I was still on page 20 so ???. <br>\n<br>\nAlso your push today is more like a conspiracy theory than something reasonable a townie would come up with, it looks like you decided to push them before actually looking at the post and never really say why they're individually scummy and are just trying to sell the duo as the scumteam in a package.<br>\n<br>\nWhat do you think of reinoe/thor anyway? You haven't really touched on them at all which is weird considering they're sort of a big deal. <br>\n<br>\nAlso want Thor to explain what he's thinking right now since there's a lot of questions and comments that don't really mean much.

I hope all those horrible rage posts decrease from here on out, and while I am sure some information lies within all that dreck, a lot of it is WIFOM, whiny bad play, and even a flip would not help much extract and separate the real and unreal from that mess. For those of you who flipped out: I wish you were dead, so I need not bother with you and your spoiled ISO. All of you get a scumlean/read for it, so thanks a lot if you are town because you helped muddy the waters, and no one should be able to claim they must be town due to caring so much they rage posted.<br>\n<br>\nThe early claims were bad too, which are both Garmr and kuribo if memory serves.

I would say TSO is a waste too since that is who Garmr wants to investigate, but here is a crazy idea to all of his nay-sayers: if we distrust him, why not all lay in and give him a target? While it is still up in the air whether Garmr accepts this, the idea is that his ability can be spent in a town-approved manner, instead of him setting up who he targets and possibly how he explains himself the following Day. That is an idea I will put out there, but I am personally fine with his own (probably screwed) investigation. But anyways, I am still not up for a Garmr or TSO lynch, and despite kuribo's harsh words and early claim, I like the scumhunting I saw, so that is a no from me too.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis post looks extremely fabricated to me.

The thor push isn't a recent occurrence, but has been on the cards since D1.

I remember liking my aero townread more than my AC townread, and that would also validate kuribo's read of aero's reaction to him.<br>\n<br>\nConsider this: scum!reinoe is generally townread and town!serra is basically the only one suspicious of him, when ACfan replaces into a lurker slot.

It was maybe cheap giftwrap used by the guests, perhaps the ID had fallen onto something that could have caused it. Or maybe Zar's hands were dirty with something when he grabbed the ID.

Then called me scum, without examining the consistency. Then backed off his thor read when thor commented on thor/me being scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe reason I've been scumreading SB since he replaced in is mostly because he's been just making generalizations or plain inaccurate accusations against me and others; His cases are flat. For example, in post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6548094#p6548094\" class=\"postlink\">1412</a>,<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6548100#p6548100\" class=\"postlink\">1413</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6548101#p6548101\" class=\"postlink\">1414</a>, I pointed out where what he said is just plain incorrect. This isn't \"Aeronaut is acting scummy\", it's more along the lines of making up fake quotes which arent even close to my views, or saying I was trying to lynch somebody that I simply didn't. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">These are things that are verifiable.</div> You can literally just look back in the game. It's like saying the sky just isn't blue. Hint: It is. <br>\n<br>\nHe hasn't bothered responding to those things since I posted them, and tried to pass it off as a quote war. In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6561223#p6561223\" class=\"postlink\">post 1599</a>, he says he doesn't have time to reply to me, but then replies to only a bit of my argument. He selectively replied to my case on him, with the thing he had an answer for at the time.<br>\n<br>\nMix that with some of the awfulness of the other three players in that slot, I don't see a scenario where SB isn't scum.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs far as I'm concerned, we lynch Thor today, and then SB tomorrow. I think Serra is town. Thor, on the other hand, I've played with before. I've also looked at the newbie game that Serra linked... and I just really think he needs to die today. I don't really agree with Serra and SB that he's more town because of joining up with Titus so quickly, I think that's something that scum!Thor is very likely to do. He knew titus was probably in trouble, Titus came up with that scheme, and he was trying to build momentum to get Garmr lynched before people started questioning it too much. That whole thing went down in like a few hours. <br>\n<br>\nI also don't really see scum!Serra fighting back scum!Titus on that. It would have been really easy for scum!serra to just slide right in and vote Garmr, but that's not what happened. Process of elimination, that just leaves Thor/SB, which is kind of just an extra confirmation at this point. Unless something is really wonky in this game, I don't see an alternative scenario.", "time": "Tue Feb 03, 2015 12:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=1775", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}

Love was supposed to be in the air everytime we looked around, but apparently love was the least of the interests in the secluded section where the 7 remaining sketchy guests roamed. In vain had Zar tried to get the impostors weeded out soon, 6 were already missing and a seventh one was to be picked from the remaining guests. Talk about love... there seemed to be only pure hatred left here.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, as a compensation for all the hurt feelings of the mod, and also to compensate the lack of the fake Madonna performance, it was decided that the cheesy pick of the guest being expelled would be heard first, if only to understand the mindset they were in. Maybe it would shed some light as to what we were encountering. <br>\n<br>\nSo after some deliberation, the majority decided Aeronaut was going to get to pick the next love song for the station. A melancholic air filled the atmosphere as Aeronaut, tired, head down moved to the phone and mumbled something to the Operator no one got to hear well. He then handed in his ID which Zar looked at, and then frowned.<br>\n<br>\nAs Zar's pick finished in the station, the DJ's voice was heard:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"And now Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a special request coming straight from the Castle's guests to 99.9 FM, LVRadio!\"</div><br>\n<br>\nAnd then, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-I2s5zRbHg\" class=\"postlink\">this tune</a> started playing. <br>\n<br>\nAeronaut then said: \"I guess that's all I have to say\", and then started to run away, bolting through the door crying. But no one was sure if the tears were of sadness or lunacy. The song he chose though, made fairly clear what he had meant.</div></div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Aeronaut, <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Mafia Goon</div>, forced to confess he was up to no good (lynched) on Day Four!</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It is Now Night and it will last for Seventy Two (72) Hours.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Deadline</div>: February 10, 2015 12:00 PM New York Time.

Aeronaut's Amy Winehouse rendition (which was surprisingly good, perhaps he could have even considered auditioning for the X-Factor --if he hadn't been a killer in disguise) had sent the remaining Six guest into a somber mood. It had worried 'Zar very much because he was afraid of what could happen during the night if left alone (heck, there was NO WAY he was going to stay babysitting these people, he had seen what they were capable of). So he left the premises hoping to not be given grim news. <br>\n<br>\nThe morning came, and with it, the somber dawn brought news from the secluded wing. Bitter love almost always leads to tragic endings. It's obsessive and toxic. And so it had happened. Now there were only five guests to worry about. On the upside, the castle was going to be reducing a bit its expenses on room and board. It would unfortunately not make for a very fun </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:fucsia\">Mardi Gras</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\"> preparation.

He was wasting too much of his time dealing with the sketchy people left. <br>\nSo he had agreed to let them pick costumes from the boxes of leftover props still available, in case they had not managed to bring theirs when they first came. <br>\nThese people were fairly inexperienced of how parties rolled in the Castle, anyway, so it was to be expected.<br>\n<br>\nThe costumes available were rather skimpy and revealing, but it was a tropical themed carnival and the Castle is well heated. Also, Zar had an idea that these would somehow make evident which of<br>\nthe sketchy peeps was part of the ploy to bring the party down. <br>\n<br>\nThe first of the remaining guests to parade her costume through the hall was elle. She had picked a somewhat flamboyant, but rather well fitting fantasy Samba School Outfit. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: elle's costume!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/df4lwBG.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div>.<br>\n<br>\nSince it didn't have any pockets, elle was forced to hand in over her ID.<br>\n<br>\nZar smiled. \"It's okay\" he said. \"You can go to the party now. We'll forget all past transgressions. Party hard.\"<br>\n<br>\nElle felt relieved. She was either sick or tired of hanging out with the same people. \"At least I'll share the fun!\".<br>\n<br>\nThen, it was SB's turn. He had obviouslt tried to pick something that could match elle's appealing costume. It seemed alright enough. A bit less revealing for someone so eager to carnival out, certainly, which Zar thought was odd.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: SB's costume!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JyOrqHa.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThere was something in the outfit that just seemed off to Zar. The headpiece was too big, and it fit him kind of loose? He decided to card SB until he could inspect the last of the ID's.<br>\n<br>\nThor was the last to come out of the dressers. He had certainly tried to find something that wasn't too revealing, but it looked like he had failed to find anything fitting him. Particularly bothersome of his costume was the prop he accompanied his outfit with.<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Thor's Costume!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/L2aW1mN.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSo he confiscated Thor's card. Both looked relatively legit.<br>\n<br>\nZar was thus stuck with a dilemma, of whom to banish from the party. And called ellen to help him judge who was going to join her in the carnival.<br>\n<br>\nElle was a bit shocked at the picks. She was going to have to play fashion police here.<br>\n<br>\n\"So, elle. Tell me who you think is probably the conniving conspirationist against the Holiday Bash between these two?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"I don't know.\" elle said. For one, it's like... that headpiece SB chose is probably large and loose enough to hide a bazooka in it. I think SB is hiding something. And then Thor maybe is trying to hide in the clear with that obvious weapon? This is confusing. WHY AM I STILL HERE I WANT TO PARTY!\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Help me choose elle. I promise we'll make an event of it.\"<br>\n<br>\nElle's eyes narrowed, as she scrutinized every single terrible aspect of both outfits. In the end, she decided the stains in Thor's sword were probably not from tomato sauce.<br>\n<br>\n\"Hey!\" Thor bickered. \"Why can't elle hide a gun in her costume? Maybe she has an invisible lasso like Wonder Woman! Who knows! She should be here too.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Because her ID passed the UV test.\" Zar responded. \"You both took too long to come out so I ran it there while I waited, I just didn't say anything. Thor, I know you picked a Gladiator costume, so I've found a way to let you join the fun. How about we send you to the Lion den?\"<br>\n<br>\nThor's face changed from wrath to horror. He was doomed.

A 1-Shot hider wouldn't have been too bad either; a Roleblocker wouldn't have interacted well with the Hider because NAR lets hide resolve first. For a second, the hider was almost wiped out, as Garmr was planning to Hide behind elle and Aeronaut almost NK'd elle's slot when he was considering killing Madonna. I was fairly demotivated to write flavor on day one until I decided to put up the baby sloth because the idea of having to keep constantly searching for replacements because some people simply abandoned the slots AFTER replacing in was a bit downbringing plus the few rule breachings and scream matches that this game spun around. As things calmed down, I got back on track writing some flavor for it. <br>\n<br>\nI think town took a hit with the shenanigans of Day One and was fairly disorganized well into the end. To their advantage, Garmr's play with the hider let them organize themselves a little better. I think killing droog over TSO could've been a scum mistake. As far as design, I considered a Mafia Ascetic, but decided against it because it might have given the Mafia an unfair edge since it would have thrown in a misleading result for the hider. In addition, the hider had fairly big odds of \"clearing\" a mason or dying behind a goon, and the scum would have been given a double result if they targeted the hider's target, so all in all I do agree with it being balanced.<br>\n<br>\nacfan was in the right track with his Role Hunting, I think they would have found TSO was a PR if they had checked him over serrapaladin.", "time": "Sun Feb 22, 2015 5:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60083&start=2000", "forum": "53", "thread": "60083"}
