I do indeed feel there's a strong chance of him being scum. The fact that other people see it as a policy lynch makes me feel stronger about it because if I'm wrong (it's day 1...you can't ever be 100%, all just WIFOM) then I don't necessarily see it as that bad of a loss considering he'd probably cost town the game later anyways if he isn't scum.

I think I'm confusing you and him with someone else. <br><br>This changes everything.<br><br>I don't see how you can have a town read on Jordan from the first 4 posts you quoted. The first post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8874824#p8874824\">49</a>) is him commenting on Jupiter's jump on FF for shooting down his theory. The issues I have with it is that he finds his vote for Fish RVS when there wasn't a hint of sarcasm in Jupiter's reasoning and he doesn't seem to question if it was for real. He just sort of scoffs and scolds Jupiter. He shows no sign of seriously wanting to consider if this is something that Jupiter genuinely believes in. <br><br>The second post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8879631#p8879631\">247</a>) you quoted is just him throwing a bunch of NAI and baseless reasons for wanting you lynched and him essentially attacking and discrediting Two Face play style. <br><br>The third one (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8891801#p8891801\">455</a>) is him weirdly flipping his read on you and parking his vote on Jupiter. The fourth post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8896438#p8896438\">555</a>) partially explains why he's voting for Jupiter but his reasoning feels more of the beginning of an unnecessary lash out and contrived considering how he was pushing you earlier.</div></blockquote><br>If you scum read jordan and I as partners lynch me first. I can have a town read on Jordan because I think those posts come from him as town. is that hard to understand? read some of his other games if you want.</div></blockquote><br><br>I get that but I need a little more. How many games have you played with Jordan? What is Jordan's town game like?"}

I think I'm confusing you and him with someone else. <br><br>This changes everything.<br><br>I don't see how you can have a town read on Jordan from the first 4 posts you quoted. The first post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8874824#p8874824\">49</a>) is him commenting on Jupiter's jump on FF for shooting down his theory. The issues I have with it is that he finds his vote for Fish RVS when there wasn't a hint of sarcasm in Jupiter's reasoning and he doesn't seem to question if it was for real. He just sort of scoffs and scolds Jupiter. He shows no sign of seriously wanting to consider if this is something that Jupiter genuinely believes in. <br><br>The second post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8879631#p8879631\">247</a>) you quoted is just him throwing a bunch of NAI and baseless reasons for wanting you lynched and him essentially attacking and discrediting Two Face play style. <br><br>The third one (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8891801#p8891801\">455</a>) is him weirdly flipping his read on you and parking his vote on Jupiter. The fourth post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8896438#p8896438\">555</a>) partially explains why he's voting for Jupiter but his reasoning feels more of the beginning of an unnecessary lash out and contrived considering how he was pushing you earlier.</div></blockquote><br>If you scum read jordan and I as partners lynch me first. I can have a town read on Jordan because I think those posts come from him as town. is that hard to understand? read some of his other games if you want.</div></blockquote><br><br>I get that but I need a little more. How many games have you played with Jordan? What is Jordan's town game like?</div></blockquote><br>3 times. he was town all 3. idled the fuck out of 1 and played just like this in the other 2. funnily,  he also pushed me early in one of those. he is a scummy player, he gets mislynched a lot from my experience.  this feels like his town game. he pushed me with horrible reasoning, sure,  but that horrible reasoning had good intentions."}

There is the possibility in my head that the scum team is Titus, Jupiter, and Jordan, and in that case, Jupiter was trying his best to white knight onto Eddie to try and get focus off of jordan.

Why would you need one scum lynch? Scum can, will, and should vote their partners, so a scum flipped wagon will still most likely have scum on it. If not, you can figure out and decide if it's an all town wagon.</div></blockquote><br>Ok well agree to disagree"}

You are overplaying something that should be very minor. And then the way you react to Jupiter, saying you are going to lynch him to.

You possibly were not the best choice but considering how little time I had to get into this game before the deadline, you were a reasonable one.<br><br>P.S. How do you add spoilers."}

This is an active game for him and a simple meta dive can figure that out). This goes to an Eddie vote in just a few posts. Uses scum read on Eddie to clear Creature. Then its just a lot of shit posting for a bit about what hes seen in other games, which is something I think scum like to do as a cheeky look at me kinda thing. Then there is more shit posting. Then he gets into it with Creature again, and when I get involved he buddies the shit out of me.<br><br>As far as his voting record, he was the hammer on Jordan day 1, was the l-1 vote on LUV after the failed tracker claim, and then hammered on Penguin. Then he replaces out over night? Added to the fact that he replaced into the game after a newb failed to pick up the role.

This doesn't make sense as a scum move if there isn't already scum on the jordan wagon. That being said, Eddie and I ended up on momo before the end of the day, and if Realeo is claiming us two as the scum team, he is admitting that he thinks that the jordan wagon, the day 1 lynch, was all town. If you look at Screenplay, he had jumped off of the jordan wagon, then jumped back on for the hammer, as he was getting more votes onto himself, which is actually a reason why I may be doubting myself on Realeo, as he was voting the screenplay slot here in contrast to jordan.<br><br>On Eddie, Eddie and momo were cross voting Day 2, and LUV chooses to try to make the Eddie lynch happen. This is the counterwagon attempt if the momo counterwagon falls through, which, what do you know, screenplay is there, AND then goes and votes Luv. Also, LUV was voting Eddie at the end of Day 1, Eddie wasn't even on Jordan, this is a town slot to me through actions too. This is just VCA reasons.<br><br>So I'm going to color in Eddie/Creature as blue because they are yet to be flipped, but I do see them as town, and look at it with me this way. Also, I know I'm town, so I'll put myself as a purple.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 1</span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 1 Wagon on Creature</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Creature</span></span> (5/7) -

I'll do some stuff in a second. Time for some Boon Logic that's probably going to get me lynched, but town, if I get lynched, seriously look into this stuff. originally, I didn't think Screenplay was scum. I thought it was realeo and one of either Formerfish/massive. I've been paranoid of one of them being scum this entire game. I have a bad tendency to auto town read people I've played a good chunk with, and I believe they know this, so I needed them to keep thinking that. Formerfish and massive both look terrible in the VCA, but I didn't put much highlight on the two of them on purpose. The VCA helped me realize that Screenplay is scum. Like, he just is. So I Boon'd it up on him. I boon'd all over him. look at the past few pages. I boonskiied all over it. Anywho, I found scum. Now what? I push and push until I get to that annoying level of Boonskiies, KNOWING that whichever massive or formerfish was scum would come and eventually push me. If massive or fish were scum, they would get the feeling of \"oh, i can handle townBoon.\" Formerfish hasn't really pushed me all game, neither has massive, but massive has been having a setup all game for an eventual push on me if he needed it, but kept me in a sense where he could still get me to vote with him if need me. . And honestly, this worked so much, as my only remaining would be scum partner, would be massive. So that helps shed connections off of me with that."}

So...they are definitely scum together. Remember that there was no kill that night. Momo DID block massive. Realeo brought up the fact that momo shouldn't claim just yet, but he did anyways. massive doesn't join the conversation until after momo claims. Right after. He was waiting for the right time to come in. This goes well with the fact that Gin had previously said \"Block Boon or Me\", bringing this game even further back than before in the case he was potentially setting up for a lynch on me. massive was against Twoface, as he posted things like \"guys, this isn't town 2F.\" really trying to get people to see Scum2F. Gin says to 2f \"Now, how did it instantly click to you that Uzi wasn't town?\".

First being the fact that as soon as massive took issue with one of Boons actions, Boon used that as a catalyst for his read changing so suddenly on massive. Secondly, this post is almost a warning to me that if I show any doubt based off his behavior that I will get scumread as a result. Shit, third he is following the same behavior that he saw Eddie employ and eventually get hard town read as a result. Notice srceen is still his top scum read.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8986651#p8986651\" class=\"postlink\">post 2641</a>, Boonskiies wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: massive</span><br><br>I'm actually pretty confident in both of these at this point. massive was blocked on the no kill night.

First imma go elevate myself a bit. Ill be right back. Ok. I am good now.<br><br>See this is what I think is happening. I think that the scum team is Boon/srceen. I think that right now Boon is vote sitting on srceen and pushing massive more than anything else. To scumBoon this has two advantages. One, massive lynch gets traction, he hops back on massive and a mislynch occurs. Two, srceen lynch goes through and boon gets a nice town cred boost going into a very dangerous situation tomorrow where boon pushes massive as thats whats hes been doing during the recent part of the day. And if massive gets lynched, tomorrow I feel like I am going to be the target in boons sights, not srceen. Why? Because all game boon has been doing basically the same thing to me that he did to massive, massive just made the mistake to engage boon before i saw anything scummy. When massive flips town boon will point the finger at me and say that he knew one of us was scum, and he is sure now that its me. Leaving his already sure target in srceen on the back burner and the heat totally on me leading to a second mislynch and the win. This is a desperate and dangerous game of chicken these guys are playing to secure their win. <br><br>We stay the course here as Boon is just about unable to take his vote off his partner, and then we can deal with him tomorrow."}

He had no reason to leave off of me and stop pushing me when he did. Similar reason as to why I began to start town reading you. Looking back on it, massive got involved in the Srceen and Boon feud off. This was to try and get something to happen, try to get a lynch going through. I don't believe he knew which way he was going to go yet. Formerfish, later seeing this, and seeing me go for massive, made his case for Boon/Srceen, which really, doesn't even make sense to me, but I'll get into that in a second. Formerfish's proposed case on Boon/Srceen, yet focusing solely on lynching Srceen earlier, shows he wanted me for the lynch tomorrow, as after a NK, I'd be the easier lynch due to suspicion on the Eddie/Boon team you were giving. That started to settle, and now he dropped his want to lynch Srceen first. I am a little unsure of how Srceen and my interactions are being seen as scum theatre. We were yelling at each other, pretty aimlessly and pointlessly, in this game for pages. I was constantly calling him lazy and he was asking the same damn question I was answering regardless. How is that a Scum v Scum interaction? Sure, I could see if it went a couple times, but the fact that it was going for a while is what gets me. We didn't even choose to end our feud immediately. I was pushing for a massive/Srceen scum team for a while, which shouldn't even be in consideration at this point. I put Srceen in an easily lynchable situation earlier. That made no sense as a Scum v Scum case. He was L-1. Formerfish's case came along just as massive and I had a 1v1 which painted Srceen and I of all people as scum? And then it goes in circles again."}

Even later Eddie indicates that he is seeing massivescum more than boonscum and is thinking about a vote change. By my count, that would have made 4 if srceen didnt pull off, and makes you the lynch. Instead srceen pulls off, and then hammers the lynch that I wanted to go through, you know \"me\" who was srceens biggest scum read. I mean shit, you think that if i were running a counterwagon on boon that you would have been the one i was pulling it off of right?

I think that srceen had absolutely no intention of lynching massive yesterday. I think that he buddied boon by voting massive with him, and just waited. At this point one of two things is going to happen. Either the lynch on massive goes through, and now srceen gets town points for being on that lynch early with boon, since he knew boon was town before the massive scumflip. Or, srceen does what he did and quick hammers boon sending us to night phase, and now has the opportunity to claim that that action is too scummy to be scum. Keep in mind that boons lynch was the 3rd mislynch that this slot has hammered on.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9026018#p9026018\" class=\"postlink\">post 3151</a>, Realeo wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Anyone <span style=\"font-style: italic\">directly</span> fosing Screen?</span> At this point, Screen is POE scum for some.

Between that and 3084 boon and massive are going back and forth. 3084 is you asking boon a question. 3087 has creature voting massive. Realeo comes in asking a bunch of questions. Then Eddie comes in at 3097 and asks us all to give our opinions on him. Massive complies, I dont. Realeo answers, and boon is posting as well. Then out of nowhere you hammer boon. You dont answer Eddie. You dont even tell him to fuck off. You just vote. Its not so much you were sitting in wait for someone to throw the 3rd vote down and then you quick hammered. I am saying you rushed the lynch because you had to. You saw that it was about to turn agianst massive and you couldn't let that happen.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>IIRC Boon was being called my \"partner\" now Massive is?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah dipshit, things have changed since you hammered boon.

And it would have been helpful if eddie ended up coming to the conclusion that we were going after the wrong person and swung the lynch someplace else. Again, I contend you that decided you werent going to let that happen. You could have given your intent and a deadline to get any last words in. Instead you hammered without any warning.<br><br>Eddie and Realeo: you guys have to be seeing what I am here. Srceen is going for to scummy to be scum with that hammer, and the other 2 that his slot has committed on mislynches. His progression on the boon lynch is shit, and the hammer was horribad. And now he is trying to \"mod clear\" his partner on lylo based off of shit.  The scum team is srceen and massive. It explains fucking everything."}
