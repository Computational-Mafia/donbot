Site-wide rules always apply here.<br>    <br>2. If you have a question for me, you can always PM me. If you need to talk to me in thread, please bold your question and begin with @mod so I can locate it better.<br><br>3. You may not use hidden or encrypted text.<br><br>4. If you have a power to edit/delete your post, don't do it. If you hydra/alt slip, or have a tag failure, ask me to correct it. Otherwise it will be left.<br><br>5. Play nice. I really don't mind bad language, but keep it reasonable. Players will be warned if necessary.<br><br>6. Do not EVER discuss ongoing games in this thread nor discuss this game elsewhere.<br><br>7. Do not quote ANYTHING that the moderator sends you. Doing so will result in an instant modkill.<br><br>8. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Red is my color. Don't use it. Any other colours are fine.</span></span></span><br><br>9. Don't attempt to impersonate the mod. At all.<br><br>10. If you break these rules, I have full rights to punish you at my will. This can range from simple warning to modkill/force-replace.<br><br>11. If I feel like it, I always have a full right to add/modify the rules. If I do, I will fully explain the reason behind such action.<br><br>12. Most importantly, have fun!<br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Voting and Lynching:</span></span></span></span><br><br>1. You vote by either using bold tag (<span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Mac</span>) or using vote tags (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Mac</span>.)<br><br>2. Unvoting is not required. Votes MUST use the above formatting or they will not be counted. Abbreviations of names are fine as long as they are understandable. Don't try to trick me either.<br><br>3. A lynch occurs when half of players + 1 vote the same person. Once a lynch happens, the game will enter the twilight period until the game is locked. Discussion may continue at this point until the thread is locked.<br><br>4. The majority MUST be reached before the deadline expires, or else a no-lynch will occur.<br><br>5. Players are allowed ONE \"bah\" post after being nightkilled. This MUST NOT contain any information with regards to the game, or the player will most likely be warned for breaking site rules.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Activity and Deadline:</span></span></span></span><br><br>1. Deadline for each day is 14 days, and deadline for each night is 48 hours.<br><br>2. If you're on V/LA, please tell me beforehand by either posting it in thread or PM to me.<br><br>3. If you don't post here for 48 real hours, I will prod you. Failure to receive prod within 24 hours or receiving 3+ prods in game will cause force-replacement.<br><br>4. If you do not submit a night action, it will count as No Action.<br><br>5. If I have to extend deadline, I will. If I do, I will post it on thread."}

It doesn't matter how many words were in that post or how many weren't. There's intent. Want to know one of my few meta reads on you so far? You avoid getting on a wagon early game.

I wanted to wait it out more, see what votes you were going to place, but I got too excited. <br><br>And then pie comes in to play and posts that list, which only cemented my initial read of you.

But I'm not liking your play one bit: if you're so certain that my meta read of you on that one post is wrong, you shouldn't react this defensive. A meta read is a tool to read someone, a minor tool, not something that defines everything. I could have been swayed had you replied differently.

It doesn't matter how many words were in that post or how many weren't. There's intent. Want to know one of my few meta reads on you so far? You avoid getting on a wagon early game.

There's more:<br><br>Secondly, as soon as a wagon (even the slightest hint of) starts while you're on it, you get off the wagon. Take a guess when you took your vote off of SoS (hint: after pie voted her). Thirdly, you're twisting my words again. When we went into full on debate in the other game, that's all you did.

But I'm not liking your play one bit: if you're so certain that my meta read of you on that one post is wrong, you shouldn't react this defensive. A meta read is a tool to read someone, a minor tool, not something that defines everything. I could have been swayed had you replied differently.

So hayato and ICE are scum? Plus, there's a catch-22 here. If I'm town I would agree with the test, but that would make me scum???<br>3) I could say the same about you. This is pretty subjective, I think I've been very direct.<br>4) I've said you were scum and not said anything else since? (Unless you count anti-town semantics).<br>5) Part of a reaction test (which you failed, lol) which, may I say, is as valid as yours.<br>6) So I guess straws and bargepoles are the same thing?<br>7) Here's the meat. Let's analyse which of your 8 reasons rely on the reaction test: 1, 2, 3 (since FMPOV I haven't been misrepping), 7. That's 1/2 of your (revised) case. Your original has a 75% reliance on the test. <br>8) This is funny, I'm scum for trying to get others to not believe your test? Another catch-22, since if I were town, I wouldn't do this, but then I'd be letting people believe I was scum. Since when has arguing been a scumtell anyway. Also, you've been manipulating people into not believing my case on you: does that make you scum?"}

Pie has continually been pushing for me and other players (RC, for instance) being scum due to us failing this reaction test. The test is, as Pie has admitted, anecdotal, has worked only once outside of himself, and has, by his own words, said that it isn't solid and doesn't test for specific reactions (which means it can't even be a reaction test). Pie took 200 pages to out the reasons for his reads list, which is quite a long time (and though I have asked, 'why not sooner?' this has not been answered sufficiently) so, to me, this looks like Pie has simply lied about this test from the get-go.<br><br>Basically, Pie has been using bad logic (with full knowledge that it is bad logic) to push lynches on players (only those who have voted/voiced opposition to him, so let's call it an OMGUS), at a time when more discussion could be had on immediate events. Unlike Pie's points, this is actually a scumtell.<br><br>2) Pie's reaction to earlygame pressure. Pie's response to being voted for and pushed was to become incredibly verbose and OMGUS everyone. Rather than rebutting RC's points, Pie just screams 'no, your reaction is shit) and deflects attention away from this. Pie only actually gets involved with the game when he's threatened, as there's an 80-post gap between his first and second post. Post 95 seems to be a confused mess of reads (not even sure if serious or not) and 102 contains the line 'do you see what I'm seeing on RC?'. Pie has asked this question in some form multiple times and to me this looks like he is seeking validation before advancing, a common scum behaviour. Plus, we don't know what he sees on RC since he hasn't told us (a behaviour he hasn't dropped throughout the game) so not only is he looking for validation, he's looking for someone else to state the answers for him. This is textbook scum behaviour. <br><br>3) The lack of content. Content starts right after this whole 'reaction test' nonsense, but before that (posts 95-197) Pie contributes very little towards the game, something I'd call lurking. While not specifically a scumtell, contrast it with recent behaviour and we see that Pie has connected little with the game, save the 'reaction test'.<br><br>4) Selective quoting (see 'but I don't think much can be read into it') has been used by Pie to a great extent, taking things out of context to make others seem scummy. Whilst other logical fallacies can occur naturally (strawmanning, misinterpretation, etc) this requires active thought on Pie's behalf. That Pie is actively warping others' words is indicative that the word 'mafia' appears in his role PM.<br><br>5) The catch-22s, as seen above. Pie has turned certain actions into a scumtell, such as discrediting cases and trying to get people on your side. First, these are not scumtells but the foundation of how mafia is played. Second, according to Pie, if I were town I'd agree with his case, but that makes me scum. In other words, no matter what I do, there's a scumtell I'm committing for Pie. This is some more deliberate bad logic on Pie's part. <br><br>6) Strawmanning, misrepping, selective quoting, grasping at straws, being contradictory over how his own test works, etc. None are as strong as Pie wishes them to be, but taken into consideration they don't portray him in a good light.<br><br>If I need to expand or clarify, I'd be happy to do so."}

I think what I want you to do right now is interact with people some more. What do you think of Meph? Hayato? Aegor? Anything strike you?<br></div></blockquote><br>Can do.<br><br>Thoughts on players:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Meph</span> started this game quite pro-town in my eyes. His early push on Remembrance and then later on myself both seem town motivated, looking for new angles and checking people out from different perspectives. Lately my opinion of him has dropped some. His vote on me, while seemingly town motivated at the time for purposes of pressuring me, is currently really weak considering the information we have now. He needs to either dig further in to my motivations or start pursuing new angles, because he's way behind and it's getting harder and harder to see him as the strong town player he started as.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Hayato</span> has been kind of all over the place. As I've expressed earlier, I've liked some of his pushes (I honestly agree with his point about RC stipulating pie has an associative tell with me then voting me, as RC hadn't pointed out anything I did that was scummy instead what pie did that implied scum. Scum can often throw off players regarding who their buddies are) but his buddying of me is somewhat worrisome, particularly in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5544368#p5544368\" class=\"postlink\">post 272</a>. Hayato hasn't said anything that suggests he specifically thinks I'm town, and instead has mostly been attacking RC for voting me for reasons that have nothing to do with his belief of my alignment. This could suggest that he already knows I'm town, but he definitely isn't one of my big suspects.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Aegor</span> is a player that for some reason has really managed to slip past my notice. Regarding the replacement discussion, I personally feel like the replacement out was alignment neutral. I was also considering dropping this game due to the website issues. That doesn't, however, mean that discussion regarding the replacement is worthless. I strongly disagree with his assertion that <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5531366#p5531366\" class=\"postlink\">post 65</a> is backpedaling, I found that post to be quite town motivated at the time (despite the vote being currently quite outdated, not to mention wrong). Much of the rest of his play has been attempting to get town engaged, which I find town motivated. After taking a closer look at him I find Aegor to be one of my stronger town reads at the moment.<br><br>Some questions:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Meph</span>, has your opinion on me changed at all? You did partially retract your point about me \"hypocritically\" endorsing one wagon then voting another, considering how I was only giving my opinion on another wagon when specifically asked for it. Furthermore, I feel like I clarified my vote on pie.<br><br>Do you find it scummy that Remembrance considers replacements when determine alignment? Also, what is your opinion on Flameaxe. You clearly didn't like my vote on him, but you didn't actually give your opinion on the player.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Hayato</span>, I mostly just want to know what your opinion of me is. Do you find me town? If not, why have you been defending me?<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Aegor</span>, your current vote is really weak. MME hasn't posted solid content in forever (cough cough get your ass in here MME, it is well past Thursday). I would also like to point out that your FoS on Frog seems more or less based around the fact that you dislike his skepticism of pie's reaction test. If Frog is town, he has every reason to be skeptical, because it would be blatantly wrong.<br><br>Do you have further reasoning to find Frog scummy? Also, do you currently still feel like MME is the scummiest player in the game? If so, your current suspicions are fairly weak and I may have second thoughts about that town read.<br><br>PEDIT: Well shit, looks like some of that effort on Meph is going to be wasted. I probably feel fairly neutral about the slot, and will judge the replacement on his/her own merit.<br><br>Also, how was SoS's vote justified? Unless I missed something, they voted because TV didn't start walling. That combined with the lack of catch up post that was promised combined with prodding another player to make a catch up post just looks really suspicious to me."}

But, I'd be leaning town on my own, mostly on the basis of watching your thought process in the hunterxhunterx game in the dead qt after we were both dead and still trying to figure the game out.<br><br>There was something you did in that game that impressed the hell out of me.  It was when you town-read Remilia Scarlet-bork on the basis of his posts having a lonely feel to them.  It wasn't just what you picked up on, it was the way you described it, which spoke to a real effort to get inside bork's head and see the game from his perspective.<br><br>That was when my own townread of you solidified in hunterx.  I haven't had that kind of epiphany in this game, but I'm seeing what looks like very genuine scumhunting from you in your interactions, especially the way you sweep aside semi-mature scumreads to get people to focus on the components of their read so you can get a better sense of their thought process.<br><br>I'm more reliant on experiential meta than in data from cold-reading old game threads.  And that means I've only seen your town game up close.  In fact, I'm not even sure you've ever had a scum role at MS.  When I last did a meta dive before your hiatus I couldn't find one.  <br><br>I'll be kinda surprised if as scum you can duplicate what I'm picking up from your interactions.<br><br>I expect that this post answers you as well, Bauss.  If not, then you'll probably have to ask your question differently."}

His deal is a way of saying \u201cI\u2019m town because I\u2019m not afraid of getting lynched to prove it\u201d. <br><br>Why would town self-sacrifice himself, to get two other might-be-town (me and ICE in his perspective) lynched, when he could provide arguments to try and get us lynched?

Just becuase I suggest there is scum on a wagon doesn't mean the wagon is scum driven or that the wagon is good/bad. To say that like its gospel is either a blatant misrep or a lack of understanding of how scum can/will play. Its typical for scum to opportunistically slide a vote onto a wagon at a point that it feels comfortable/non attention grabbing. Early on, when it doesn't have momentum... mid range, in the \"butter zone\"... when a deadline is approaching and \"we have to lynch somebody.\" These are some common examples.

You don't think scum would ever slide and park a vote onto a scum buddy early on D1 when that wagon didn't have any real steam?

You obviously didn't have a look at the Xenogears Large theme game.  Even when AFB was making 5-6 post combos raging at you in NY 167, the Sangres post count was always higher, and the majority of those posts were mine.  That changed on the final day with the gunsmith reveal and RC's faked cop guilty.  In other words, I can and do manipulate my post count as scum sometimes.<br><br>The observation about engaging probably has some truth, but it's a subtle thing that could easily be lost in the noise in my games, because I go silent frequently as town, too, especially when a lot is happening in the game thread.

Its more the quantity/quality, or overall \"usefulness\" of the posts. Where you're coming from, where you're going, what's the game status, who are you developing a read on, who's opinion are you trying to leverage off, etc. You were a leader as town, trying to rally townies to work together. As scum you weren't. It feels as if youre not part of the team when you're scum. Its nuance, but I found it and I think its a pretty good window into your play.<br><br>So, I have one last point/observation that I need clarity on:<br>Why are you voting me? <br>I've noticed from your play that you have been reluctant to hang players that you know can be assets to the town, if you are uncertain of their alignment. So why, at this stage of the game, given my play (which you said yourself could jive with either alignment) are you voting me? Surely with several days remaining, and other suspects around, there are other plays to be made... but you've parked your vote on me even as I sit at L2.

You obviously didn't have a look at the Xenogears Large theme game.  Even when AFB was making 5-6 post combos raging at you in NY 167, the Sangres post count was always higher, and the majority of those posts were mine.  That changed on the final day with the gunsmith reveal and RC's faked cop guilty.  In other words, I can and do manipulate my post count as scum sometimes.<br><br>The observation about engaging probably has some truth, but it's a subtle thing that could easily be lost in the noise in my games, because I go silent frequently as town, too, especially when a lot is happening in the game thread.

Its more the quantity/quality, or overall \"usefulness\" of the posts. Where you're coming from, where you're going, what's the game status, who are you developing a read on, who's opinion are you trying to leverage off, etc. You were a leader as town, trying to rally townies to work together. As scum you weren't. It feels as if youre not part of the team when you're scum.

At the time I put the vote down, it was because of the scummiest looking post in the game up to that point.  I still haven't seen an individual post that exceeds that one.  I wanted your reaction - which was basically ignoring the vote until your wagon hit L-2, and I wanted the reactions of other players, which I've gotten.   And thirdly I wanted to see who would put you at L-1.  And no one has, which suggests either scum don't have a strong appetite for your lynch, or they've already committed as many votes to the wagon as they're willing to given the game state.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">UNVOTE</span><br><br>You've encouraged others to look on their own wagons for scum.

(Scum might know we are looking at viable wagons voting patterns and withhold voting, scum might pile votes onto a single wagon as in too bad to be scum, etc etc.)<br><br>I actually have a small case worth sharing on Remembrance, which I can fill out, once everybody decides not to hang me. If I push on him too hard and do my thing now, I'm likely to be run back up and pushed to L1 for a claim. So, I'll wait for the green light from some folks before I light him up again.<br><br>In the interim, RC does have great instincts but its hard to follow the loose play style for me.

This is my least preferred wagon for Today.<br><br>BBMolla \u2013 BBMolla town-reads RC but says \u201cI would still policy-lynch RC.\u201d Ref: Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5582654#p5582654\">464</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5589346#p5589346\">565</a>. It feels like, he doesn\u2019t want an RC lynch to happen but if it does happen, he wants to be on the wagon and thus, readied with the second post.<br>I would gladly sheep RC, if others start to join that wagon by tomorrow.<br><br>SoS \u2013 FF played very well as town in my last game with her. Yet, her play up until now is very different from that game. Her contribution so far is far less than what I have expected from her. Maybe because at that time she replaced in D2 and have more info than we have right now. My 3rd choice after RC and BBMolla\u2019s wagon. <br><br>I would recommend a Flameaxe or a DJ lynch but it seems unlikely that it\u2019s going to happen.<br><br>MME is looking better IMO. His questions seems town-minded. <br><br>Aegor needs to respond to my posts. Ignoring doesn\u2019t make things disappear.<br><br>Frog and ICE are town.<br><br>I find myself agreeing to the most part of CDB\u2019s and scorpion\u2019s early post. I like scorp\u2019s thoughts on Flameaxe, which mirrors my own. Town points for him. Though, I\u2019ve did a lot of skimming. Will do another round of reads on his posts. <br><br>I\u2019ve decided not to respond to Rem\u2019s posts about me unless someone wants me to. Ref: Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5577612#p5577612\">424</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5582234#p5582234\">456</a>.

You must now surely be aware - in fact, you have talked about people's reactions to you in other games - that your style is, at best, unorthodox and will rub some up the wrong way. Objections about game tactics, such as I have raised about faking investigation results, are inevitable between players of conflicting styles and you have no reason to think that I would only raise them as scum. It is plainly sensible that I would have this objection regardless of my alignment in this game, that I would raise it as town and therefore that I would raise it as scum as well. You and I may not be kindred spirits, but let's not overreact."}

May I also point out that you're criticising Hayato for putting off the Aegor lynch, despite the fact that you literally asked for everyone to stop posting yesterday? You're more guilty of opposing progress than he is. Being on both lynches isn't inherently towny. I don't like 939. Calling bullshit, by the way: you were posting it to get towncred."}

This was my answer:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think it's better if those thoughts come from you, to avoid coming out tomorrow with the same opinions. Not that I'm saying it would be suspicious if we had the same opinions. If during the game, you share the same opinion, don't hesitate to express it.

Not even trying to convince others to join your wagon. Wow very hard-bus here.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't even remember what prompted my vote here, but the implication is that this somehow ties in with my original argument. it doesn't. I never made any statements about the weight of my votes or the veracity of cases I made. this is where heyato and I seem to disconnect. they are changing the definition of \"hard bus\" from my initial statements. not to say that I was necessarily correct in using the term, but I did define what I meant.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>heyato wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5595048#p5595048\" class=\"postlink\">post 698</a>, don_johnson wrote:</cite>did I miss something?

I guess there could be a .00001% chance that flameaxe is a bp townie and SoS is a dayvig. so yeah, let's risk a no lynch for such incredible odds. :/</div></blockquote><br><br>Here, you told others, we should ignore SoS claim and lynch him. He was at L-1. ONLY NOW, you want to convince others to lynch him, when there is one vote left and there were people waiting around to drop the hammer. VERY hard bus here. WoW!!</div></blockquote><br><br>again an attack on the veracity of my statements. at this point I believe there was some ridiculous conversation going on in the thread and it was very obvious to everyone that SOS was scum. maybe heyato truly believed there was another explanation, the odds of there being a dayvig and a bp townie in a game and that the dayvig targeted the bp townie on day 1 are about equivalent to the odds that some sort of \"god\" actually exists in the universe. if you read the above statement, I actually do quote the odds. heyato's argument also ignores the very important part of the supposed miller crumb. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>heyato wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5602303#p5602303\" class=\"postlink\">post 854</a>, don_johnson wrote:</cite>I have read day 2. mme hasn't really presented a case. the way I see it we have two people claiming role info, if that is indeed what mme is claiming. so I guess that's where I'm confused.

Please. I don\u2019t like being ignored.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>^^ I can talk about 968 a bit more, too. in a little bit. heyato actually brings up a couple good points, but I believe some of it may fall into the wifom or circular logic category. I will take a closer look here going forward.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>I don't care what you want to call it, Don, you brought up being on both wagons to make you seem better in some way, but that's bad logic and you're continuing to profess it.</div></blockquote><br><br>I strongly disagree. this game is very mathematical imo. and though I am not a good mathematician, my odds are generally good indicators of gamestate. for instance, I gave odds on SOS' day 1 claim. I realize that true odds are difficult to manage in this game, but if it makes you feel better you can call my odds \"gut\". either way, when someone claims dayvig and there target fails to die, and they also claim to have breadcrumbed \"miller\", and there is some ridiculous conversation going on about an innocent child... then yeah, my odds and my gut say the player is scum. and I was right. so whatevz. it is not bad logic to say \"in a game where scum got strung up day 1 and day 2, it is not likely that the third scum bussed both partners without flinching in some way or casting out some small defence or attempting in some small way to derail at least one of the wagons.\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> About the wagon, TV's defence makes sense as if he is the last scum he must have some sort of amazing powers to compensate for going up against a doc and a 2-shot cop, so bussing him is stupid.</div></blockquote><br><br>agreed.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> Nothing about what you've done or where you've been makes you any less likely to be scum than anyone else. </div></blockquote><br><br>untrue. I am much less likely to be scum based on wagon analysis. anyone who thinks otherwise is not good at wagon analysis.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>Plus, if you're butting heads with Hayato, I'd like you to get to 968 asap. </div></blockquote><br><br>yeah. I will. I skimmed it the first time, but when I looked at it I noticed some good points.  but like I said, imo, Occam's razor points to the guy trying to derail both wagons and believing in shitty claims and being on one wagon and off the other. I would be shocked if the third scum is not somewhere in the flameaxe, heyato, frog, TV pool. and that's tough because I am starting to see reasons why you all could be scum and why you could all be town. I will most likely have to reread this entire game in order to come up with a truly informed vote. this prospect does not excite me."}

I never made any statements about the weight of my votes or the veracity of cases I made. this is where heyato and I seem to disconnect. they are changing the definition of \"hard bus\" from my initial statements. not to say that I was necessarily correct in using the term, but I did define what I meant.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>heyato wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5595048#p5595048\" class=\"postlink\">post 698</a>, don_johnson wrote:</cite>did I miss something?

SoS, you say, looked surely scum. If this is so, then scum can leap on the wagon quite freely. Furthermore, MME had a guilty on Aegor yesterday, meaning it was very easy for scum to get on that one as well. Frankly, scum being on both wagons is very possible and has few repercussions. Why is it 'unlikely', therefore?</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>heyato wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5602303#p5602303\" class=\"postlink\">post 854</a>, don_johnson wrote:</cite>I have read day 2. mme hasn't really presented a case. the way I see it we have two people claiming role info, if that is indeed what mme is claiming. so I guess that's where I'm confused.

I don\u2019t like being ignored.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>^^ I can talk about 968 a bit more, too. in a little bit. heyato actually brings up a couple good points, but I believe some of it may fall into the wifom or circular logic category. I will take a closer look here going forward.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>I don't care what you want to call it, Don, you brought up being on both wagons to make you seem better in some way, but that's bad logic and you're continuing to profess it.</div></blockquote><br><br>I strongly disagree. this game is very mathematical imo. and though I am not a good mathematician, my odds are generally good indicators of gamestate. for instance, I gave odds on SOS' day 1 claim. I realize that true odds are difficult to manage in this game, but if it makes you feel better you can call my odds \"gut\". either way, when someone claims dayvig and there target fails to die, and they also claim to have breadcrumbed \"miller\", and there is some ridiculous conversation going on about an innocent child... then yeah, my odds and my gut say the player is scum. and I was right. so whatevz. it is not bad logic to say \"in a game where scum got strung up day 1 and day 2, it is not likely that the third scum bussed both partners without flinching in some way or casting out some small defence or attempting in some small way to derail at least one of the wagons.\"<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">True odds are literally impossible with this kind of set-up, actually. All you've given is 'gut' with the pretence of it being fact. What you have so far pedalled: 3rd member not being on the wagon, hard-bussing, etc, is not correct. Look at Aegor, he bussed SoS unflinchingly. Why can member 3 have not joined?<br><br>It is absolutely bad logic to make the claim in bold. You have not explained it at all and there is not evidence to support it. I may also bring up how you've mainly been discussing setup, and not ingame stuff; this is an old scumtell.</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> About the wagon, TV's defence makes sense as if he is the last scum he must have some sort of amazing powers to compensate for going up against a doc and a 2-shot cop, so bussing him is stupid.</div></blockquote><br><br>agreed.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> Nothing about what you've done or where you've been makes you any less likely to be scum than anyone else. </div></blockquote><br><br>untrue. I am much less likely to be scum based on wagon analysis. anyone who thinks otherwise is not good at wagon analysis.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">''Here is what I think, and if you think differently, you're bad at this''<br><br>Shouldn't have to explain why this is awful.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>Plus, if you're butting heads with Hayato, I'd like you to get to 968 asap. </div></blockquote><br><br>yeah. I will. I skimmed it the first time, but when I looked at it I noticed some good points.  but like I said, imo, Occam's razor points to the guy trying to derail both wagons and believing in shitty claims and being on one wagon and off the other. I would be shocked if the third scum is not somewhere in the flameaxe, heyato, frog, TV pool. and that's tough because I am starting to see reasons why you all could be scum and why you could all be town. I will most likely have to reread this entire game in order to come up with a truly informed vote. this prospect does not excite me.</div></blockquote>"}

I don't agree with some of what Hayato's just said but I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain why right now and I'm not even sure how helpful it'd be anyway."}

I, for one, am pretty mediocre at reading a player's posts and determining alignment from them. I'm also not very good at determining someone's alignment by getting in to a heated back and forward with them (generally when I do that it is because I'm already fairly certain of their guilt and looking to get other votes on them).<br><br>What I am very good at is assessing the situation. I look at how wagons formed, how they fell apart, how easily they formed, and determine who is scum based on that. If a player is scummy as hell, gets run up to L-1 or L-2 then another player does something sort of scummy and gets lynched, there's a good chance the first wagon was scum. Competing wagons are rarely all on town. Scum are very difficult to lynch, whereas bad townie is very easy to lynch. Too little resistance on your wagon likely means you're wrong, whereas too much resistance that makes no sense likely means you're right.<br><br>Also some people prefer town hunting, and I do this too sometimes. Try finding a block of players that, for the purposes of that day, will not be lynched because of the fact that they are probably town. With the rest of the pool being much smaller, you have a much higher chance of finding scum.<br><br>Basically, if something isn't working out for you try a different mindset. If you've been avoiding rereads, give them a try. If you've only been looking at players in ISO, try looking at players within context (i love using multiple tabs). If you tend to only go through the gist of things, try reading players carefully in ISO. If you find yourself with too much confirmation bias, question your own reads. Look at possibilities where you might be wrong. Things like that."}

That said, it didn't really reach worst case scenario. <br><br>Explanation of play: I was completely blind to SoS for the entire game and I should've pushed Pieguyn differently. The reason I asked what everyone was reading me as was because of the basics I.e., scum don't like to form opinions on players when they're being town read/don't like to commit and make themselves inflexible. I tried to force the issue as I had posted enough that players would have had to have an opinion of me by then. Which worked okay, since I called out Aegor for his change in stance/vagueness? Aegor got me by implying that my play in another game(marriage, which ended recently) was different, so I backed off on him. I agree that Hayato did a really good job early in the game, but started making mistakes about half-way through day 1. It's pretty funny that he thought CBD was a traitor.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"><br><br>This was a pretty weird game from my stand point. Most of my problems were the same problems I've always had and the response I got was pretty varied, I think I just sucked.<br><br>MME played the solidest I think. He got town read and investigated correctly/pushed well. I have a feeling his activity dropped partly due to recognizing he was being town read too hard and hoped that the reads would cool off enough so that he wouldn't be killed at night, which, once again is solid play(maybe?).<br><br>@Frog, don't self vote. I don't really know how to increase your ability to scum hunt as I'm confused by the process myself. I usually rely on meta because I think that there are personal tells that give a player away. You mentioned specifically getting into arguments with town players, so my recommendation would be to go meta the person you're arguing with and seeing if they tend to argue with others as town more than scum. This might allow you to rethink who you're talking to and why they're arguing with you. This can be pretty fruitless though, since even if you figure out they're town you still have an angry arguer breathing down your neck.<br><br>@Flameaxe  you're still right (and now very right) that it was dumb to make assumptions on Aegor's slot due to replacing out.
