Site-wide rules always apply here.<br>\n    <br>\n2. If you have a question for me, you can always PM me. If you need to talk to me in thread, please bold your question and begin with @mod so I can locate it better.<br>\n<br>\n3. You may not use hidden or encrypted text.<br>\n<br>\n4. If you have a power to edit/delete your post, don't do it. If you hydra/alt slip, or have a tag failure, ask me to correct it. Otherwise it will be left.<br>\n<br>\n5. Play nice. I really don't mind bad language, but keep it reasonable. Players will be warned if necessary.<br>\n<br>\n6. Do not EVER discuss ongoing games in this thread nor discuss this game elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n7. Do not quote ANYTHING that the moderator sends you. Doing so will result in an instant modkill.<br>\n<br>\n8. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Red is my color. Don't use it. Any other colours are fine.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n9. Don't attempt to impersonate the mod. At all.<br>\n<br>\n10. If you break these rules, I have full rights to punish you at my will. This can range from simple warning to modkill/force-replace.<br>\n<br>\n11. If I feel like it, I always have a full right to add/modify the rules. If I do, I will fully explain the reason behind such action.<br>\n<br>\n12. Most importantly, have fun!<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Voting and Lynching:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. You vote by either using bold tag (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Mac</div>) or using vote tags (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Mac</span>.)<br>\n<br>\n2. Unvoting is not required. Votes MUST use the above formatting or they will not be counted. Abbreviations of names are fine as long as they are understandable. Don't try to trick me either.<br>\n<br>\n3. A lynch occurs when half of players + 1 vote the same person. Once a lynch happens, the game will enter the twilight period until the game is locked. Discussion may continue at this point until the thread is locked.<br>\n<br>\n4. The majority MUST be reached before the deadline expires, or else a no-lynch will occur.<br>\n<br>\n5. Players are allowed ONE \"bah\" post after being nightkilled. This MUST NOT contain any information with regards to the game, or the player will most likely be warned for breaking site rules.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Activity and Deadline:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. Deadline for each day is 14 days, and deadline for each night is 48 hours.<br>\n<br>\n2. If you're on V/LA, please tell me beforehand by either posting it in thread or PM to me.<br>\n<br>\n3. If you don't post here for 48 real hours, I will prod you. Failure to receive prod within 24 hours or receiving 3+ prods in game will cause force-replacement.<br>\n<br>\n4. If you do not submit a night action, it will count as No Action.<br>\n<br>\n5. If I have to extend deadline, I will.

It doesn't matter how many words were in that post or how many weren't. There's intent. Want to know one of my few meta reads on you so far? You avoid getting on a wagon early game. You did so last game, you're doing so now. Guess what your first post was in that other game. Hint: it's not a wagon vote. I wanted to wait it out more, see what votes you were going to place, but I got too excited. <br>\n<br>\nAnd then pie comes in to play and posts that list, which only cemented my initial read of you.

Take a guess when you took your vote off of SoS (hint: after pie voted her). Thirdly, you're twisting my words again. When we went into full on debate in the other game, that's all you did.

Your original has a 75% reliance on the test. <br>\n8) This is funny, I'm scum for trying to get others to not believe your test? Another catch-22, since if I were town, I wouldn't do this, but then I'd be letting people believe I was scum. Since when has arguing been a scumtell anyway.

{"number": 289, "id": "5547173", "user": "frog", "user_id": "18726", "content": "So, onto my summarised case for why Pie is scum:<br>\n<br>\n1) The reaction test. Pie has continually been pushing for me and other players (RC, for instance) being scum due to us failing this reaction test. The test is, as Pie has admitted, anecdotal, has worked only once outside of himself, and has, by his own words, said that it isn't solid and doesn't test for specific reactions (which means it can't even be a reaction test). Pie took 200 pages to out the reasons for his reads list, which is quite a long time (and though I have asked, 'why not sooner?' this has not been answered sufficiently) so, to me, this looks like Pie has simply lied about this test from the get-go.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, Pie has been using bad logic (with full knowledge that it is bad logic) to push lynches on players (only those who have voted/voiced opposition to him, so let's call it an OMGUS), at a time when more discussion could be had on immediate events. Unlike Pie's points, this is actually a scumtell.<br>\n<br>\n2) Pie's reaction to earlygame pressure. Pie's response to being voted for and pushed was to become incredibly verbose and OMGUS everyone. Rather than rebutting RC's points, Pie just screams 'no, your reaction is shit) and deflects attention away from this. Pie only actually gets involved with the game when he's threatened, as there's an 80-post gap between his first and second post. Post 95 seems to be a confused mess of reads (not even sure if serious or not) and 102 contains the line 'do you see what I'm seeing on RC?'. Pie has asked this question in some form multiple times and to me this looks like he is seeking validation before advancing, a common scum behaviour. Plus, we don't know what he sees on RC since he hasn't told us (a behaviour he hasn't dropped throughout the game) so not only is he looking for validation, he's looking for someone else to state the answers for him. This is textbook scum behaviour. <br>\n<br>\n3) The lack of content. Content starts right after this whole 'reaction test' nonsense, but before that (posts 95-197) Pie contributes very little towards the game, something I'd call lurking. While not specifically a scumtell, contrast it with recent behaviour and we see that Pie has connected little with the game, save the 'reaction test'.<br>\n<br>\n4) Selective quoting (see 'but I don't think much can be read into it') has been used by Pie to a great extent, taking things out of context to make others seem scummy. Whilst other logical fallacies can occur naturally (strawmanning, misinterpretation, etc) this requires active thought on Pie's behalf. That Pie is actively warping others' words is indicative that the word 'mafia' appears in his role PM.<br>\n<br>\n5) The catch-22s, as seen above. Pie has turned certain actions into a scumtell, such as discrediting cases and trying to get people on your side. First, these are not scumtells but the foundation of how mafia is played. Second, according to Pie, if I were town I'd agree with his case, but that makes me scum. In other words, no matter what I do, there's a scumtell I'm committing for Pie. This is some more deliberate bad logic on Pie's part. <br>\n<br>\n6) Strawmanning, misrepping, selective quoting, grasping at straws, being contradictory over how his own test works, etc. None are as strong as Pie wishes them to be, but taken into consideration they don't portray him in a good light.<br>\n<br>\nIf I need to expand or clarify, I'd be happy to do so.", "time": "Fri Dec 27, 2013 3:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34923&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "34923"}

I stated that I feel the test has promise, but more as a way to blow open day 1 than as the premise of lynching a player.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, regarding your first point implying pie is scum, if he genuinely believes his reaction test is legitimate then this would be kind of a town tell in my eyes.

Anything strike you?\n</div></blockquote>\nCan do.<br>\n<br>\nThoughts on players:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Meph</div> started this game quite pro-town in my eyes. His early push on Remembrance and then later on myself both seem town motivated, looking for new angles and checking people out from different perspectives. Lately my opinion of him has dropped some. His vote on me, while seemingly town motivated at the time for purposes of pressuring me, is currently really weak considering the information we have now. He needs to either dig further in to my motivations or start pursuing new angles, because he's way behind and it's getting harder and harder to see him as the strong town player he started as.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Hayato</div> has been kind of all over the place. As I've expressed earlier, I've liked some of his pushes (I honestly agree with his point about RC stipulating pie has an associative tell with me then voting me, as RC hadn't pointed out anything I did that was scummy instead what pie did that implied scum. Scum can often throw off players regarding who their buddies are) but his buddying of me is somewhat worrisome, particularly in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5544368#p5544368\" class=\"postlink\">post 272</a>. Hayato hasn't said anything that suggests he specifically thinks I'm town, and instead has mostly been attacking RC for voting me for reasons that have nothing to do with his belief of my alignment. This could suggest that he already knows I'm town, but he definitely isn't one of my big suspects.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Aegor</div> is a player that for some reason has really managed to slip past my notice. Regarding the replacement discussion, I personally feel like the replacement out was alignment neutral. I was also considering dropping this game due to the website issues. That doesn't, however, mean that discussion regarding the replacement is worthless. I strongly disagree with his assertion that <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5531366#p5531366\" class=\"postlink\">post 65</a> is backpedaling, I found that post to be quite town motivated at the time (despite the vote being currently quite outdated, not to mention wrong). Much of the rest of his play has been attempting to get town engaged, which I find town motivated. After taking a closer look at him I find Aegor to be one of my stronger town reads at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nSome questions:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Meph</div>, has your opinion on me changed at all? You did partially retract your point about me \"hypocritically\" endorsing one wagon then voting another, considering how I was only giving my opinion on another wagon when specifically asked for it. Furthermore, I feel like I clarified my vote on pie.<br>\n<br>\nDo you find it scummy that Remembrance considers replacements when determine alignment? Also, what is your opinion on Flameaxe. You clearly didn't like my vote on him, but you didn't actually give your opinion on the player.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Hayato</div>, I mostly just want to know what your opinion of me is. Do you find me town? If not, why have you been defending me?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Aegor</div>, your current vote is really weak. MME hasn't posted solid content in forever (cough cough get your ass in here MME, it is well past Thursday). I would also like to point out that your FoS on Frog seems more or less based around the fact that you dislike his skepticism of pie's reaction test. If Frog is town, he has every reason to be skeptical, because it would be blatantly wrong.<br>\n<br>\nDo you have further reasoning to find Frog scummy? Also, do you currently still feel like MME is the scummiest player in the game? If so, your current suspicions are fairly weak and I may have second thoughts about that town read.<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT: Well shit, looks like some of that effort on Meph is going to be wasted. I probably feel fairly neutral about the slot, and will judge the replacement on his/her own merit.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, how was SoS's vote justified? Unless I missed something, they voted because TV didn't start walling. That combined with the lack of catch up post that was promised combined with prodding another player to make a catch up post just looks really suspicious to me.", "time": "Sat Dec 28, 2013 9:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34923&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "34923"}

In that post, Pie labelled three players as mafia, SoS, Meph and Ice. SoS and Meph RVS voted Pie, but Ice didn&#8217;t and thus that post is weird and looked suspicious. It could be seen as an allignment-tell, but Pie was the one who posted that suspicious post, not ICE.<br>\n<br>\nBut why vote ICE? If RC was wrong about ICE-Pie being partners, at least he could be right about Pie, who made the suspicious post. His vote should be on Pie. <br>\n<br>\nWhen questioned about that, RC replied with:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Voting Pieguyn would put him on alert and make it harder to get tells from him. Voting IceNinja allows me to gauge Pie's reaction without risking him shutting down, which is a common town reaction to D1 pressure.</div></blockquote>\n\nTwo theories:<br>\n<br>\nEither town-RC voted ICE to gauge reactions like he said <br>\n<br>\nOR<br>\n<br>\nScum-RC voted ICE to avoid putting a serious vote on an already-moving-wagon which is Pie&#8217;s.<br>\n<br>\nAnd notice how, by doing that RC ended RVS and gets town-cred?

RC&#8217;s behaviour matches a scum-partner of mine in another game. He knew, that no one is suspecting him, he got too comfortable and did nothing. This mirrored RC exactly. I&#8217;m sure he would behave differently, if he was pressured with multiple votes on him. <br>\n<br>\nHe ignored my vote and my case on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5534376#p5534376\">139</a>. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHis deal on post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5570474#p5570474\">359</a> is clearly a bluff. He knew, I can&#8217;t decide for all of you. Even if I were to accept that deal, he knew you people won&#8217;t agree to that. His deal is a way of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m town because I&#8217;m not afraid of getting lynched to prove it&#8221;. <br>\n<br>\nWhy would town self-sacrifice himself, to get two other might-be-town (me and ICE in his perspective) lynched, when he could provide arguments to try and get us lynched?

Just becuase I suggest there is scum on a wagon doesn't mean the wagon is scum driven or that the wagon is good/bad. To say that like its gospel is either a blatant misrep or a lack of understanding of how scum can/will play. Its typical for scum to opportunistically slide a vote onto a wagon at a point that it feels comfortable/non attention grabbing.

Lots of chatter. Engaging the player base. Talking, exploring, etc. Whether I liked your content or not, there was a vast amount of it.

You obviously didn't have a look at the Xenogears Large theme game.  Even when AFB was making 5-6 post combos raging at you in NY 167, the Sangres post count was always higher, and the majority of those posts were mine.

In other words, I can and do manipulate my post count as scum sometimes.<br>\n<br>\nThe observation about engaging probably has some truth, but it's a subtle thing that could easily be lost in the noise in my games, because I go silent frequently as town, too, especially when a lot is happening in the game thread.  Observing without jostling what's going on too much is sometimes pretty revealing.  I think you probably understand the reasons for that technique because you also employ it.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I'm left with the task of figuring out if your waiting game this time had town or scum motivation, because your wait/pounce style of play should work well for both alignments.<br>\n<br>\nYou", "time": "Fri Jan 03, 2014 9:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34923&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "34923"}

So why, at this stage of the game, given my play (which you said yourself could jive with either alignment) are you voting me? Surely with several days remaining, and other suspects around, there are other plays to be made... but you've parked your vote on me even as I sit at L2.

At the time I put the vote down, it was because of the scummiest looking post in the game up to that point.  I still haven't seen an individual post that exceeds that one.  I wanted your reaction - which was basically ignoring the vote until your wagon hit L-2, and I wanted the reactions of other players, which I've gotten.   And thirdly I wanted to see who would put you at L-1.  And no one has, which suggests either scum don't have a strong appetite for your lynch, or they've already committed as many votes to the wagon as they're willing to given the game state.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">UNVOTE</div><br>\n<br>\nYou've encouraged others to look on their own wagons for scum.

TV here made a case that all the scum were being super cocky because they thought they had a stacked comp, and I perfectly saw that coming through on several of the hydras. Plus, I had just played scum with Bro and modded his town game and I clearly knew the difference, and that was scum Broseidon. The rage was obviously fake too, so I claimed a cop guilty on him because there was literally no other way to get town to lynch someone who the follower (another scum too, and oh my god I was right about that one too~) claimed as a protective. Meanwhile, the majority of the town was trying to lynch me for having the audacity to go against the grain on something that was incredibly obvious.<br>\n<br>\nYou're calling me a liability and yet if you go back, with N's theme game as the only exception, my reads are pretty damn good.

I never made any statements about the weight of my votes or the veracity of cases I made. this is where heyato and I seem to disconnect. they are changing the definition of \"hard bus\" from my initial statements. not to say that I was necessarily correct in using the term, but I did define what I meant.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>heyato wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5595048#p5595048\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5595048#p5595048\" data-post-id=\"5595048\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 698</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10505\">don_johnson</a> wrote:</cite>did I miss something?

I realize that true odds are difficult to manage in this game, but if it makes you feel better you can call my odds \"gut\". either way, when someone claims dayvig and there target fails to die, and they also claim to have breadcrumbed \"miller\", and there is some ridiculous conversation going on about an innocent child... then yeah, my odds and my gut say the player is scum. and I was right. so whatevz. it is not bad logic to say \"in a game where scum got strung up day 1 and day 2, it is not likely that the third scum bussed both partners without flinching in some way or casting out some small defence or attempting in some small way to derail at least one of the wagons.\"<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> About the wagon, TV's defence makes sense as if he is the last scum he must have some sort of amazing powers to compensate for going up against a doc and a 2-shot cop, so bussing him is stupid.</div></blockquote>\n\nagreed.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> Nothing about what you've done or where you've been makes you any less likely to be scum than anyone else. </div></blockquote>\n\nuntrue.

I will. I skimmed it the first time, but when I looked at it I noticed some good points.  but like I said, imo, Occam's razor points to the guy trying to derail both wagons and believing in shitty claims and being on one wagon and off the other. I would be shocked if the third scum is not somewhere in the flameaxe, heyato, frog, TV pool. and that's tough because I am starting to see reasons why you all could be scum and why you could all be town.

I never made any statements about the weight of my votes or the veracity of cases I made. this is where heyato and I seem to disconnect. they are changing the definition of \"hard bus\" from my initial statements. not to say that I was necessarily correct in using the term, but I did define what I meant.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>heyato wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5595048#p5595048\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5595048#p5595048\" data-post-id=\"5595048\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 698</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10505\">don_johnson</a> wrote:</cite>did I miss something?

SoS, you say, looked surely scum. If this is so, then scum can leap on the wagon quite freely.

I will take a closer look here going forward.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>I don't care what you want to call it, Don, you brought up being on both wagons to make you seem better in some way, but that's bad logic and you're continuing to profess it.</div></blockquote>\n\nI strongly disagree. this game is very mathematical imo. and though I am not a good mathematician, my odds are generally good indicators of gamestate. for instance, I gave odds on SOS' day 1 claim. I realize that true odds are difficult to manage in this game, but if it makes you feel better you can call my odds \"gut\". either way, when someone claims dayvig and there target fails to die, and they also claim to have breadcrumbed \"miller\", and there is some ridiculous conversation going on about an innocent child... then yeah, my odds and my gut say the player is scum. and I was right. so whatevz. it is not bad logic to say \"in a game where scum got strung up day 1 and day 2, it is not likely that the third scum bussed both partners without flinching in some way or casting out some small defence or attempting in some small way to derail at least one of the wagons.\"<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">True odds are literally impossible with this kind of set-up, actually. All you've given is 'gut' with the pretence of it being fact. What you have so far pedalled: 3rd member not being on the wagon, hard-bussing, etc, is not correct. Look at Aegor, he bussed SoS unflinchingly. Why can member 3 have not joined?<br>\n<br>\nIt is absolutely bad logic to make the claim in bold. You have not explained it at all and there is not evidence to support it. I may also bring up how you've mainly been discussing setup, and not ingame stuff; this is an old scumtell.</div>\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> About the wagon, TV's defence makes sense as if he is the last scum he must have some sort of amazing powers to compensate for going up against a doc and a 2-shot cop, so bussing him is stupid.</div></blockquote>\n\nagreed.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite> Nothing about what you've done or where you've been makes you any less likely to be scum than anyone else. </div></blockquote>\n\nuntrue. I am much less likely to be scum based on wagon analysis. anyone who thinks otherwise is not good at wagon analysis.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">''Here is what I think, and if you think differently, you're bad at this''<br>\n<br>\nShouldn't have to explain why this is awful.</div><br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>Plus, if you're butting heads with Hayato, I'd like you to get to 968 asap. </div></blockquote>\n\nyeah. I will. I skimmed it the first time, but when I looked at it I noticed some good points.  but like I said, imo, Occam's razor points to the guy trying to derail both wagons and believing in shitty claims and being on one wagon and off the other. I would be shocked if the third scum is not somewhere in the flameaxe, heyato, frog, TV pool. and that's tough because I am starting to see reasons why you all could be scum and why you could all be town. I will most likely have to reread this entire game in order to come up with a truly informed vote. this prospect does not excite me.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Wed Jan 22, 2014 4:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34923&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "34923"}

I think you are misunderstanding me there. I did \"rebut\" his points. his whole case is about my use of the term \"hard bus\", which as I pointed out, was not a majorly relevant part of the points I was trying to make. if you remove the terminology from my standpoint, what I am saying still makes sense. if you remove the terminology from his case against me, the case doesn't even exist.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>There's nothing to support your claim that, just because you were on both wagons, you were less likely to be scum.</div></blockquote>\n\n^^ I disagree. and my point is that it doesn't only apply to myself. it seems people are making a big deal about it, but its not like I'm using the logic selectively. I am applying it because I wholeheartedly believe that if we are looking at a 3p scumteam, then the third scum will not have been on both wagons. I think it is more likely that that third teammate would have tried to slow down and/or avoid one or both wagons. to me that is what is common sense. obviously we have different definitions.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>What you have so far pedalled: 3rd member not being on the wagon, hard-bussing, etc, is not correct. Look at Aegor, he bussed SoS unflinchingly. Why can member 3 have not joined?</div></blockquote>\n\nAegor bussed unflinchingly? I would have to reread as I did not get that impression. but if he did, that would be a precise reason why team member three would not have. what world do you live in where the scum team acts in such a manner? I have been playing a long time and count on one finger where I actively bussed ALL of my teammates. and even in that instance, I did flinch at times though it was not that noticeable.  this is an incomplete list of what I have \"pedaled\".<br>\n<br>\ndiscussing set up is not a scumtell. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>frog wrote:</cite>\n''Here is what I think, and if you think differently, you're bad at this''</div></blockquote>\n\njust because I play lazily at times, does not mean I don't pay attention and have good insights into games.", "time": "Wed Jan 22, 2014 12:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34923&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "34923"}

His increased posting rate didn't make anybody else scummier, just made him harder to read. With more time to read him, I've since decided he's likelier town, but all that means is that, with no obvious scumreads (as I've not pretended to have), it's a harder decision, not a clearer one. Given the time pressures and read pressures, I preferred leaving my vote where it was to moving it when I would not have had time to make a sufficiently well thought-out decision on who the better option was, and I'd rather leave <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">a</div> vote while busy than no vote. We're not in LyLo - far from it - and nothing disastrous happens if he gets mislynched while I'm AFK.

His increased posting rate didn't make anybody else scummier, just made him harder to read. With more time to read him, I've since decided he's likelier town, but all that means is that, with no obvious scumreads (as I've not pretended to have), it's a harder decision, not a clearer one. Given the time pressures and read pressures, I preferred leaving my vote where it was to moving it when I would not have had time to make a sufficiently well thought-out decision on who the better option was, and I'd rather leave <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">a</div> vote while busy than no vote. We're not in LyLo - far from it - and nothing disastrous happens if he gets mislynched while I'm AFK.

I did not answer yesterday as there were more pressing issues at hand (see: deadline which we missed) and I wasn't on a lot before the day ended either, so I couldn't have answered the question.

I, for one, am pretty mediocre at reading a player's posts and determining alignment from them. I'm also not very good at determining someone's alignment by getting in to a heated back and forward with them (generally when I do that it is because I'm already fairly certain of their guilt and looking to get other votes on them).<br>\n<br>\nWhat I am very good at is assessing the situation. I look at how wagons formed, how they fell apart, how easily they formed, and determine who is scum based on that. If a player is scummy as hell, gets run up to L-1 or L-2 then another player does something sort of scummy and gets lynched, there's a good chance the first wagon was scum. Competing wagons are rarely all on town. Scum are very difficult to lynch, whereas bad townie is very easy to lynch. Too little resistance on your wagon likely means you're wrong, whereas too much resistance that makes no sense likely means you're right.<br>\n<br>\nAlso some people prefer town hunting, and I do this too sometimes. Try finding a block of players that, for the purposes of that day, will not be lynched because of the fact that they are probably town. With the rest of the pool being much smaller, you have a much higher chance of finding scum.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, if something isn't working out for you try a different mindset. If you've been avoiding rereads, give them a try. If you've only been looking at players in ISO, try looking at players within context (i love using multiple tabs). If you tend to only go through the gist of things, try reading players carefully in ISO. If you find yourself with too much confirmation bias, question your own reads.

Sorry for replacing out.<br>\n<br>\nThe set up was pretty rough for scum and the scum kills were directed every day. I think it hit them hardest when Iceninja was put off the table from his claim. That said, it didn't really reach worst case scenario. <br>\n<br>\nExplanation of play: I was completely blind to SoS for the entire game and I should've pushed Pieguyn differently. The reason I asked what everyone was reading me as was because of the basics I.e., scum don't like to form opinions on players when they're being town read/don't like to commit and make themselves inflexible. I tried to force the issue as I had posted enough that players would have had to have an opinion of me by then. Which worked okay, since I called out Aegor for his change in stance/vagueness? Aegor got me by implying that my play in another game(marriage, which ended recently) was different, so I backed off on him. I agree that Hayato did a really good job early in the game, but started making mistakes about half-way through day 1. It's pretty funny that he thought CBD was a traitor.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"><br>\n<br>\nThis was a pretty weird game from my stand point.

He got town read and investigated correctly/pushed well. I have a feeling his activity dropped partly due to recognizing he was being town read too hard and hoped that the reads would cool off enough so that he wouldn't be killed at night, which, once again is solid play(maybe?).<br>\n<br>\n@Frog, don't self vote. I don't really know how to increase your ability to scum hunt as I'm confused by the process myself. I usually rely on meta because I think that there are personal tells that give a player away. You mentioned specifically getting into arguments with town players, so my recommendation would be to go meta the person you're arguing with and seeing if they tend to argue with others as town more than scum. This might allow you to rethink who you're talking to and why they're arguing with you. This can be pretty fruitless though, since even if you figure out they're town you still have an angry arguer breathing down your neck.<br>\n<br>\n@Flameaxe  you're still right (and now very right) that it was dumb to make assumptions on Aegor's slot due to replacing out.
