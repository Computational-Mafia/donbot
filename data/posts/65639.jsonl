Votes should be in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>, but I'll count votes if the intention is clear and there's bolding/some attempt at bolding. Unvotes before registering a new vote are helpful but not required. Note that any attempts at fake votes will be frowned on, and most likely counted anyway.<br>3) When a player reaches a majority of votes, they are lynched. I will reveal their alignment, and the game will move into night. Players can still talk during twilight.<br>4) Days will have automatic deadlines of approximately <span class=\"noboldsig\">12 days</span> (announced at the start of the day). This will only be extended in special circumstances, as determined by me. No majority at deadline means no lynch. Additionally, if a majority of all living players vote to no lynch, no lynch will occur and the game will move into twilight.<br>5) Twilight occurs after a lynch has occured but before the flip. Players may post in the thread during twilight. Twilight may extend for a small period of time after the final votecount to allow for verification of said votecount.<br>6) Nights will have automatic deadlines of approximately <span class=\"noboldsig\">48 hours</span>. Even if the day post has not been made, any actions submitted after the deadline (announced at the start of the night) will not be counted.<br>7) No talking to other players, dead or alive, outside of the thread, unless your role permits it.<br>8) Once dead, you stop posting. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Please do not make a \"bah\" post.</span><br>9) Anyone not posting for 48 hours is proddable. Players who fail to post promptly after being prodded or repeatedly require prods may be replaced. I also reserve the right to prod or replace players who are within activity limits but who are trying to find loopholes.<br>10) I'll try to post votecounts as often as possible. Feel free to ask for a votecount at any time. I'll try not to make mistakes, but let me know if I do. Remember that my timezone will make me unavailable at some points during the day.<br><br>11) Avoid excessive profanity, flaming, etc. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I may choose to deal with problems of this kind privately</span>, so do not be concerned if no public action is taken.<br>12) You may paraphrase, but not quote, PMs from the Mod or other forms of private communication. <span class=\"noboldsig\">This includes game-related private topics with other players.</span><br><br>13) Do not use encrypted or hard-to-see text (including \"invisible\" text, text below the 50% text size option, or text hidden via BBCode.) Spoiler tags are fine, but please use the spoiler= tag.<br>14) Methods of verifiable randomness, including dice tags, should never be used.<br>15) I will use <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #40826D\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">bolded viridian (#40826D)</span></span></span> when editing players' posts and for other official moderation stuff. Don't try to impersonate me.<br>16) This game has been reviewed for normalcy and balance. <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Natural Action Resolution</a> will apply.<br>17) Please PM me if you have questions.<br>18) I reserve the right to change or add rules if necessary. My priority is to ensure that everybody in this game has the opportunity to enjoy playing the game.<br><br>19) If you need to be replaced for any reason, <span class=\"noboldsig\">contact me privately and stop posting in the thread</span>. If you wish to request moderator action against another player, <span class=\"noboldsig\">contact me privately and do not post about it in the thread</span>.<br><br>20) Have fun and play to win!<br><br>Consult the Setup Information post below for more details."}

GWS is scum' (Like how did he even come to that conclusion??? ) (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7721242#p7721242\">60</a>).<br>- LovelyG votes Guy for scum (and vice versa), but doesn't question or even try to interact with him until Guy responds to LovelyG's answer to my question (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7722839#p7722839\">94</a>). Like there is something wrong here wrt an early town tunnel. <br>- Then Guy tries to deflect his defensiveness (that came out of the post that Lowell read me as scum) with a joke. <br>- Lowell then has a problem with my activity and says that he has others to look at (which we haven't seen him do yet) (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7723811#p7723811\">98</a>).<br>- LovelyG calls me flippant and \"says\" that he likes my activity, but it doesn't seem like it tbh (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7724111#p7724111\">102</a>).<br>- LovelyG then wants to kill an inactive player without asking for prod or to be replaced. Like thats a pretty clear scum tell there (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7725576#p7725576\">117</a>).<br>- Once Pista voted for me, Lowell saw a gap to drop in and is voting me because of activity??? Like this is crazy ass scummy! (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7726607#p7726607\">122</a>)<br>- Which only makes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7726625#p7726625\">123</a> look like a cover up post. <br>- And LovelyG chips in to support Lowell on this endeavor. Like he is convinced to leave his tunnel on Guy because he believes Lowell to be town? And wants to sheep him? Like what is going on here? That is a clear sign of a scum team (without day chat) at work (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7726651#p7726651\">124</a>).<br><br>Part of the reason Guy was a town lean for me earlier was his hint at being our Vig, but I constantly tried to double check myself to be sure about that, and now I don't think he is. This is just a bunch of scums coming into the game with a preplanned agenda. That is what it is!"}

I'll be happy to at least prove his earlier flimsy theories wrong, though.<br><br>I don't care for how Postie appears to be coaching FA. She's a big girl. You're trying to look helpful. I still don't understand that weird townread you gave her. Isn't she uncounterclaimed macho tracker or am I forgetting?"}

Because I observed that he was not seeing the Lowell-LovelyGiant pair, then he started something with FA for a silly ego reason wrt the LovelyGiant wagon and then went away when LovelyGiant was at L-1. Could all be a coincidence and that he is actually upset or something, but it makes me wary of him.

I wanted to know why she is pressured and nervous wrt the wagons and why she didn't mention about the LovelyGiant wagon. This everyone knows by now.<br><br>3) But what I also wanted to do was check how many scums are there in the two major wagons.<br><br>4) My thinking before the unvote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739181#p7739181\">525</a>) was that LovelyGiant was at L-1 and if Lowell (or any player not on LovelyGiant's wagon for that matter) is scum with him, then they would most likely buss their buddy to end the day early and get town cred. <br><br>5) So I unvoted to see such a reaction (and still make sure that we don't end the day early). <br>In comes Mr. Lowell with his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739546#p7739546\">530</a>. Filled with bussing emotions and another mediocre reason to vote for LovelyGiant. <br><br>6) I knew that you guys would brush this aside because of my earlier theory on him, so I wanted to see if there are other buddies to LovelyGiant.<br><br>7) Just then FA unvotes &lt;3 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739582#p7739582\">533</a>) Which is proof enough for me that she is town this game.<br><br>8) As soon as pistachi0n voted for FA after ignoring the LovelyGiant wagon (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740461#p7740461\">536</a>). I was sure that we got a scum, but I wanted to build a case on her.<br><br>9) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7741889#p7741889\">571</a> was meant to get a reaction from scum pistachi0n and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7745790#p7745790\">671</a> + <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7745791#p7745791\">672</a> is just that.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div>Reasons for why Pistachi0n is individually scum:<br><br>A) She comes into the game after a long while and votes for a claimed Town PR while ignoring two players who have been scummy (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740461#p7740461\">536</a>). <br><br>B) She wants FA lynched because scums could leave her alive to screw with us, and wants a cop on her if she is not lynched (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740633#p7740633\">539</a>). Not only is she trying to get rid of a info based Town PR, but is trying to get other info roles to target her instead.<br><br>C) She was pressured and nervous when Postie (who she has called a sheep in 536 questions her), and says that 'FA surviving would not clear her' when no one brought that topic up. Which implies that she is thinking that FA will not die in the night. How can she know that for sure? <br><br>I am sure there are lots of scummy people in the game that FA can track if her claim is true. Then in that case if she is town, she is more likely to be killed than not. Unless the scums have a role that can stop her from tracking. And it seems pistachi0n is aware of a scum role blocker, or wants to lynch FA instead because such a role doesn't exist with the scums. Eitherway she has more info and is nervous and pressured because of that. Otherwise why would you be pressured by a player who you think is a sheep?<br><br>D) After I pointed this out, instead of agreeing that she looked scummy and that she still thinks FA is scum (or votes for one of the major wagons). Which Imo a town pistachi0n would have done. She votes for me? <br>Like this is the height of scumminess!<br><br>E) If you check her ISO, you will see that she voted for BlueTrin in RVS, then voted me for a reason that was already answered in the game (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7726442#p7726442\">121</a>), then she supported n_n, asked about my meta, talked about n_n being replaced, and then comes back and votes for FA after saying that I don't have lurker paranoia. The Irony! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br><br>F) She has been actively lurking this game, and none of her posts have any original content or an assertive voice.<br><br>Thus pistachi0n is scum with either LovelyGiant or Creature or Both. Aka she is definitely scum.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: pistachi0n</span> for good measure."}

Unless it was day 4 or something where you are very sure of the slot, lynching a slot where replacement has occurred is kinda difficult. I mean if creature is town, then what? Creature never said much throughout the day.<br>I still think that creature slot is scum. But I also think the same for pista and guy. We now have 2 days to complete the lynch. If pista comes here and gives a suitable defence, then we can move to a different slot but that's all we can do."}

Imo Pista was scummy, but maybe her mislynch could have been avoided. Her reactions were meh though :/<br><br>But I take responsibility for her mislynch, and probably I was lulled into pursuing her wagon. I did consider not posting the case on her yesterday, but at that point I believed that her lynch was the safest bet for us because she did avoid mentioning the LovelyGiant wagon and called the Creature wagon as terrible. *sigh*<br><br>Anyways, I reread parts of the game and I noticed that you had infact mentioned the intent to hammer. Still not liking some of your posts around Lowell and LovelyGiant though. <br><br>Regarding Not_Mafia, I would like to see his catch up of Day 1 before supporting the wagon, and still think that LovelyGiant is a good lynch, especially because it clears certain connections in the game.<br><br>And almost50 was a town lean for me, so idk why the vig would kill him over other players."}

I wanted to know why she is pressured and nervous wrt the wagons and why she didn't mention about the LovelyGiant wagon. This everyone knows by now.<br><br>3) But what I also wanted to do was check how many scums are there in the two major wagons.<br><br>4) My thinking before the unvote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739181#p7739181\">525</a>) was that LovelyGiant was at L-1 and if Lowell (or any player not on LovelyGiant's wagon for that matter) is scum with him, then they would most likely buss their buddy to end the day early and get town cred. <br><br>5) So I unvoted to see such a reaction (and still make sure that we don't end the day early). <br>In comes Mr. Lowell with his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739546#p7739546\">530</a>. Filled with bussing emotions and another mediocre reason to vote for LovelyGiant. <br><br>6) I knew that you guys would brush this aside because of my earlier theory on him, so I wanted to see if there are other buddies to LovelyGiant.<br><br>7) Just then FA unvotes &lt;3 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739582#p7739582\">533</a>) Which is proof enough for me that she is town this game.<br><br>8) As soon as pistachi0n voted for FA after ignoring the LovelyGiant wagon (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740461#p7740461\">536</a>). I was sure that we got a scum, but I wanted to build a case on her.<br><br>9) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7741889#p7741889\">571</a> was meant to get a reaction from scum pistachi0n and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7745790#p7745790\">671</a> + <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7745791#p7745791\">672</a> is just that.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div>Reasons for why Pistachi0n is individually scum:<br><br>A) She comes into the game after a long while and votes for a claimed Town PR while ignoring two players who have been scummy (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740461#p7740461\">536</a>). <br><br>B) She wants FA lynched because scums could leave her alive to screw with us, and wants a cop on her if she is not lynched (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740633#p7740633\">539</a>). Not only is she trying to get rid of a info based Town PR, but is trying to get other info roles to target her instead.<br><br>C) She was pressured and nervous when Postie (who she has called a sheep in 536 questions her), and says that 'FA surviving would not clear her' when no one brought that topic up. Which implies that she is thinking that FA will not die in the night. How can she know that for sure? <br><br>I am sure there are lots of scummy people in the game that FA can track if her claim is true. Then in that case if she is town, she is more likely to be killed than not. Unless the scums have a role that can stop her from tracking. And it seems pistachi0n is aware of a scum role blocker, or wants to lynch FA instead because such a role doesn't exist with the scums. Eitherway she has more info and is nervous and pressured because of that. Otherwise why would you be pressured by a player who you think is a sheep?<br><br>D) After I pointed this out, instead of agreeing that she looked scummy and that she still thinks FA is scum (or votes for one of the major wagons). Which Imo a town pistachi0n would have done.

I wanted to know why she is pressured and nervous wrt the wagons and why she didn't mention about the LovelyGiant wagon. This everyone knows by now.<br><br>3) But what I also wanted to do was check how many scums are there in the two major wagons.<br><br>4) My thinking before the unvote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739181#p7739181\">525</a>) was that LovelyGiant was at L-1 and if Lowell (or any player not on LovelyGiant's wagon for that matter) is scum with him, then they would most likely buss their buddy to end the day early and get town cred. <br><br>5) So I unvoted to see such a reaction (and still make sure that we don't end the day early). <br>In comes Mr. Lowell with his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739546#p7739546\">530</a>. Filled with bussing emotions and another mediocre reason to vote for LovelyGiant. <br><br>6) I knew that you guys would brush this aside because of my earlier theory on him, so I wanted to see if there are other buddies to LovelyGiant.<br><br>7) Just then FA unvotes &lt;3 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7739582#p7739582\">533</a>) Which is proof enough for me that she is town this game.<br><br>8) As soon as pistachi0n voted for FA after ignoring the LovelyGiant wagon (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740461#p7740461\">536</a>). I was sure that we got a scum, but I wanted to build a case on her.<br><br>9) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7741889#p7741889\">571</a> was meant to get a reaction from scum pistachi0n and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7745790#p7745790\">671</a> + <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7745791#p7745791\">672</a> is just that.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div>Reasons for why Pistachi0n is individually scum:<br><br>A) She comes into the game after a long while and votes for a claimed Town PR while ignoring two players who have been scummy (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740461#p7740461\">536</a>). <br><br>B) She wants FA lynched because scums could leave her alive to screw with us, and wants a cop on her if she is not lynched (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7740633#p7740633\">539</a>). Not only is she trying to get rid of a info based Town PR, but is trying to get other info roles to target her instead.<br><br>C) She was pressured and nervous when Postie (who she has called a sheep in 536 questions her), and says that 'FA surviving would not clear her' when no one brought that topic up. Which implies that she is thinking that FA will not die in the night. How can she know that for sure? <br><br>I am sure there are lots of scummy people in the game that FA can track if her claim is true. Then in that case if she is town, she is more likely to be killed than not. Unless the scums have a role that can stop her from tracking. And it seems pistachi0n is aware of a scum role blocker, or wants to lynch FA instead because such a role doesn't exist with the scums. Eitherway she has more info and is nervous and pressured because of that. Otherwise why would you be pressured by a player who you think is a sheep?<br><br>D) After I pointed this out, instead of agreeing that she looked scummy and that she still thinks FA is scum (or votes for one of the major wagons). Which Imo a town pistachi0n would have done. She votes for me? <br>Like this is the height of scumminess!<br><br>E) If you check her ISO, you will see that she voted for BlueTrin in RVS, then voted me for a reason that was already answered in the game (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7726442#p7726442\">121</a>), then she supported n_n, asked about my meta, talked about n_n being replaced, and then comes back and votes for FA after saying that I don't have lurker paranoia.

I checked with the listmod, who told me that n_n was not an alt of a player in this game. In the meantime, n_n requested replacement on the grounds that he felt his presence was inadvertently derailing the game and making it unplayable for himself and others. I consider this entire affair an unfortunate set of circumstances and hold nobody at fault.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Frozen Angel requesting replacement, etc.</span><br>Frozen Angel's posts around pages 10-20 were indeed against rule 19 and in general I don't think they were entirely appropriate to a Mafia game. Considering that I had not emphasised my atypical rule re. requesting replacement, and that no previous warnings had been given, I did not feel that action beyond the private warning I gave was appropriate at that time, and as far as I saw everyone's behaviour was fine after that point.  If there is something I missed (entirely possible, I didn't read the thread in great detail) please do bring it to my attention.

I have all the right. I am a player in this game, and I have all the right to bring up anything that jeopardizes the integrity of the game.<br><br>If you don't like the discussion, then don't get involved. Simple as that. <br><br>I observed a few things that were wrong about that slot and informed the mod. I don't understand why an absolute new player to the forum would want to replace into a game, then leave the game on being called out as an alt. There was no vitriol, hatred or attack in my post. I mentioned my thoughts if n_n was an alt, that is about it. <br><br>If he wasn't an alt, there would be no reason to worry about the post then. Since the post was pretty clearly addressed to 'If n_n was an alt'. <br><br>Innocent people when accused wrongly, usually stay in to prove otherwise.

If Terminator slot was scum, then that player would have had MOD level of information. If it was the other way, then scums would know one slot isn't town PR.<br><br>Its a bad thing really. New players who contact the mod to be replaced into a game, are always a problem. Can't trust them not to be an alt; especially, if their thought pattern matches an existing player in the game.<br><br>Respect the game and don't cheat, that is all I am saying. Neither am I asking n_n to be banned, nor am I discrediting town for the win. So, I don't know what your problem is. <br><br>The game is over, so give it a rest. I don't want to talk about this any further, so if you guys give it a rest, then this discussion would be over on its own. If you dig more, then its on you."}
