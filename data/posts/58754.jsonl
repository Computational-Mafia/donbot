Its going to be all out today because I think the chance of me living past tonight are going to be approaching zero.<br>\n<br>\nI am confirmed town just through basic theory because I am a double voter.  Not only would there need to only be two scum for my slot to end up town, but the town would need to be amazingly overpowered since it would move the win threshold for scum up one day.  The fact that I am NOT dead suggests that scum actually fails to realize this theory or that bjc was way off on his reads and scum was happy keeping him alive for a day.<br>\n<br>\nBasically I should be next to confirmed town already, and if we ever are able to prove there are three scum I am confirmed even more.  It got mentioned already, the DV is permanent so there is no way I can be scum here outside of amazingly absurd situations that probably are not normal.<br>\n<br>\nThis brings me into the reione-scum, because its pretty likely that someone like him just is missing this fact given his posts and either has partners who aren't able to argue him off the point or also miss it.<br>\n<br>\nCombine the fact that he is actually still calling this slot scum, and the following<br>\n<br>\n1) Onyx/Wake pretending to be a newbie is probably null.  Best odds are that he decided to fake it regardless of alignment, unless you are going to argue that he entered a game as an alt with the intention of trying to hide it if he was scum, while owning up to it if he was town.  This just is going to be one of those things that no matter what happened, it was his plan from day one.  Common one for me is \"Does it matter?\" when getting called an alt, because it doesn't.  Latching onto trying to push a lynch over a null tell is of itself a scumtell.<br>\n<br>\n2) His vote on Flubber was very extrapolated (there an egghead word) from his read on Wake.  That doesn't make any sense because he is making an \"If A than B\" argument while jumping straight to B.  Its a massive lapse in logic and a very convenient turnaround in a read on Flubber.  Its again at best a poor logic vote from reione as it just bucks common logic.  I have no problem basing some reads on what you think others are, but quickly coming in to hammer, ESPECIALLY when Wake was at L-3, it feels like taking the lynch when he could instead of trying to get his \"scum read\" lynched.<br>\n<br>\n3) He is doing the same thing again today.  Circle back to first point (I am confirmed town - call the slot scum) and again he is voting players \"because they are scum with Wake\" which is especially funny since a much bigger threat to wipe out bad points that reione is pushing just took the slot over.  Timing of it now being a challenge mixed with voting Cerberus because \"Wake is scum\" just is a copout more than anything else.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote reione</div><br>\n<br>\nHe needs to die right about now.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.wallchan.com/images/thumbs/7994.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nThat was a lot of words, nap time.<br>\n<br>\nOh also watch Boon and Toby.

He townreads bjc based on his role, and has unexplained town reads on Toby and Flubber.  Boonskiies and Abbott appeared null in this post, whereas in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6110872#p6110872\" class=\"postlink\">175</a> he reported Boonskiies as likely town. <br>\n<br>\nNo vote was cast by Wake/Onox.<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\nThe Ruffling called Toby, bjc, and Reinoe town with townreads on both Cerb and I. He called SoS null.  Boonskies as slight scum read, Abbott as scum (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6141024#p6141024\" class=\"postlink\">436</a>)and Victor (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6140901#p6140901\" class=\"postlink\">432 and 433</a>) and Clusk (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6140942#p6140942\" class=\"postlink\">435</a>) as 'likely scum' in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6140874#p6140874\" class=\"postlink\">430</a>.<br>\n<br>\nThere was light questioning of Evil Regals in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6171446#p6171446\" class=\"postlink\">605</a>.<br>\n<br>\nA vote on clusk is placed in 437.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Important things to note here:</div><br>\n1) Ruffling first called Cerberus town, and he declined to speak at all about my gambit of 'knowing' Cerberus was town.  This gambit was not subtle either.  It's unlikely that Ruffling didn't understand what I was claiming with my language.  However, he didn't jump on the wagon. Why?  This lack of action makes me think he knew Cerberus was town causing him to a) either not realize my gambit or b) wanting to white knight the man he knew was town.<br>\n<br>\nSo my town read on Cerb is a little strengthened (though I recognize this is an argument from silence).<br>\n<br>\n2) I don't care for this slot's treatment of the AbboTT slot here.  Wake null read him.  Ruffling scum read him, chose Clusk to vote, and reported giving Abbott's slot slack for flaking.  It looks like a convienent excuse to call out a scum buddy without voting him.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Other's views on the Onox/Wake/Ruffling slot:</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Victor</div></div> -  This is the most notable and memorable association with this slot in my head.  Victor votes Onox in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6117646#p6117646\" class=\"postlink\">289</a> and continues his pressure from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6122877#p6122877\" class=\"postlink\">347 - 377</a> before switching his focus to Flubber.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Victor's switch to Flubber is hardly damning.  He was the one of the first who initiated the pressure and sustained pressure on Wake.  His vote switch is redeemed because he resumed his vote on Ruffling the very next day.  If he were merely trying to get out of bussing once the wagon built, it would be easy to ignore Ruffling the very next day.  A Ruffling death meant suspicion would be cast on Victor anyway. I doubt a scum!Victor would want that attention.  <br>\n<br>\nSolid town read on Victor that I'm not likely to repeal.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bjc/RD</div></div> - An interesting post here is by bjc in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6117828#p6117828\" class=\"postlink\">292</a>.  He notes that Onox is a waste of time and urges a Flubber lynch.  His opinion changes as of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6124199#p6124199\" class=\"postlink\">368</a>.  RD's entrance to the game declares Wake's use of an alt as null in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6178067#p6178067\" class=\"postlink\">622</a> and when Reinoe claims, her quick reaction seems to be calling a bluff on Rein's 'investigation'.  <br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Not very much is to note here except early in the wagon bjc dissented before agreeing that wake could possibly be scum.  He does not switch his vote(s) from Flubber. Hardly any information could be gleaned from this.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, although RD seems slightly aligned with Wake for the simple action of calling Reinoe out, she had good reasoning, and she -did- end up being right about Rein lying.<br>\n<br>\n I still lean a town read just because a double voter is -likely- town.  Albeit, this is a weak town read.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toby</div></div> - Toby's first notable interaction with Onox is in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6110981#p6110981\" class=\"postlink\">187</a> where she called him out for having no reads.  In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6117679#p6117679\" class=\"postlink\">290</a>, she pointed out an inconsistency in Onox's posting which she continued in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6123717#p6123717\" class=\"postlink\">358</a><br>\n and also into day 2 in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6162017#p6162017\" class=\"postlink\">553</a>. She was on the Flubber wagon in day 1.<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">The fact that Toby continues her question about the two posts by Onox and the inconsistency of them into day 2, also tends to speak town for her more than scum.  Where it would be easy to drop a Ruffling scum read, especially with a new replacement and on a new day, she stuck to her concern. <br>\n<br>\nAnother town read.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cerberus</div></div> - <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6113668#p6113668\" class=\"postlink\">252</a> is Cerb's first interaction with Onox, but he does little to follow up on it.  It seems like it may because he's generally inactive this game?
