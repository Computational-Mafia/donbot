Obviously that also occasionally makes it correct scum play. The only other way to play miller is to try desperately hard not to appear scummy enough to be investigated, which inevitably backfires, as cautious play is often punished accordingly. For me, the miller claim is a null for the moment.

I was fully aware he had been replaced, but since I was voting for his slot based on him, I used his name.

I think this whole thing with DemonHybrid (another player I'm leaning strongly town on) has been a canard, and has distracted us from the fact that DonGrant never posted once before being replaced today and that ZazieR, despite promises to the contrary (and a list of questions), has yet to contribute meaningfully either.

He was the L-2 vote)</div></blockquote><br><br>I think if you go back and look at yesterday, you'll notice that I started the day voting for DonGrant, switched to voting for David when he and Parama started going at it, went back and re-read, posted my reasons why I didn't think it was likely David was scum, and then re-voted for Don/ZazieR when she steadfastly refused to post in the game and was eventually replaced. This game has been pretty badly marred by terrible, anti-town play from townies, and except for the fact that I'm at least posting in the game I can probably get thrown in the fire with the lot of them for skipping the lone scum lynch and helping send 3 townies to the gallows. <br><br>My major suspicions right now are on David, whose weak defenses about not posting yesterday seem phoned-in. His involvement on the Steven wagon looks more and more like a bus to me in hindsight, and his sudden suspicion of Surprise_Carcinogen in post 398 doesn't seem all that genuine, either. <br><br>I'm getting a pretty firm town read on DemonHybrid, especially the way he handled himself at the tail end of yesterday, Parama-sheeping today and brief over-defensiveness about not posting aside, which leaves Surprise_Carinogen and Parama.<br><br>I haven't liked Surprise_Carcinogen's play today, and if Parama's vote on him had stood for more than 20 minutes it'd seem pretty well damning. I can definitely understand Parama's gut reaction to the phrase \"got me pegged,\" and S_C's reaction to the resulting pressure - and being voted - does seem to belie the sort of calm that comes with knowing that a mislynch isn't about to happen. <br><br>On the other hand, I can't seem to get a proper read on Parama. General rustiness aside, I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out why a player who so blatantly flouts the conventions of posting actual cases (until today with his VCA), who hammered (or intended to hammer) two targets that he never posted his actual thoughts about, and who then all but demanded a massclaim, only to not offer his own claim at the end, is being left to skate by the town's general attention. One possibility - and it's the one I'm leaning towards - is that he's right about DP and S_C, who are trying desperately not to attract more than the absolute minimum of attention in hopes that I (most likely) will draw his last bolt of ire, which would explain the general sense I have that everyone is walking on eggshells around him. Mixed into that would be the fact that Demon's played games with him before and knows the style. Objectively, though, his vote this late in the game seems fairly reckless - or confident in a bad way - and his abject refusal to shed even a little light on his decision not to claim also feels objectively scummy. I think if David, for instance, had refused to claim during the massclaim we'd be in D6 by now, and it puzzles me - bordering on worries me - that Parama is getting different treatment. <br><br>Also, I'm extremely confused about the lack of a Mason left in this game. I guess it's possible that Parama is simply the last Mason, and is lying to generate discussion about it - and this again seems most logical - but otherwise we're left with the possibilities that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">another</span> player is lying about their claim, or that there isn't another Mason left in the game and Reck's role was basically Vanilla, or that his role was a false-reveal of some kind. <br><br>Oh, and I left out the thing that most nails David to the wall I think: asking sordros to claim, then never commenting on the fact that he asked a dead player to claim. I think this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DavidParker, Post 387 wrote:</cite>I don't mind Parama not claiming. We can judge his claim if and when he claims. If he doesn't think it helps that's fine. He's not going to be the lynch for today anyways, so he can use his information how he wants. I'm doing a reread, but my top two picks are carcinogen and Bill at this point.</div></blockquote><br><br>is overly deferential as well, and it's this kind of behavior that leads me to believe that this is simply some kind of end-game gambit by Parama with pretty straightforward implications and that David and Surprise are scum together.<br><br>So there's all that."}
