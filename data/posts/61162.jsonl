This game will feature a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">closed</span> setup.  That means roles are not public information at the beginning of the game.<br><br>2. The preferred voting method is to put vote tags around the player's name, but I will still accept the old method of bolding the word \"vote\" followed by said player's name, e.g. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TellTaleHeart</span>or <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: TellTaleHeart</span>. As long as I can tell to whom you are referring, spelling does not count and I will accept abbreviated or otherwise shortened forms of the name of the vote's recipient (e.g. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TTH</span>).  If you want to change your vote, it would be nice if you unvoted first, but you don't have to.  You may also <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>, unvoted the same way as before.<br><br>3. A majority of votes is required for a lynch, even at deadline. Once a lynch has been decided, it is final and further votes and unvotes do not count for the current day. If deadline is reached with no player having enough votes for a lynch, the day ends in an automatic No Lynch.<br><br>4. Day 1 will have an 18 (real) day deadline.  Subsequent days will have a 14 day deadline.  I reserve the right to extend this deadline.<br><br>5. Once you are dead, you may not continue to post in the thread.  This includes \"bah\" posts.<br><br>6. You may post in any color that can be easily read against the forum background other than <span style=\"color: darkblue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">dark blue</span></span></span>. That color is mine.<br><br>7. Unless you're the moderator (that's me), please do not delete or edit any posts in this thread.<br><br>8. You are not allowed to discuss this game outside of the thread unless I tell you otherwise, nor are you allowed to discuss other ongoing games in this thread.<br><br>9. Do not quote or pretend to quote any private communication, either from me or from anyone else you are allowed to talk with at night. You are allowed to paraphrase, but you are not allowed to plagiarize. If in doubt as to your paraphrase's legality, PM me with the wording you want to use.<br><br>10. I will issue a prod to any player that does not post for 48 hours without notifying me of his or her absence. (I'm sorry, but I do not check the V/LA thread. If you do not tell me to do so, neither will I check your signature.) If you are prodded, you will have 24 hours from the time of submission to post in thread. Failure to do so may result in replacement. Keep in mind that I have the board time down to the second. I will only prod the same player twice\u2014after that, he or she must post every 48 hours to ensure that he or she remains in the game.<br><br>11. I'd love for everyone to play the game to completion, but if you must please feel free to request replacement.<br><br>12. The most important rule of all, saved for last for what I think is a very good reason: This is a game. HAVE FUN! Enjoy! And good luck!</ul>"}

Whilst I do find Unlynchable to be scummy from his desire to get a quick lycnh and from the way he seems to be posting random scum lists with no justification and the way he has reacted to my comments there isn't really enough evidence for an L-1.  Yes I have questioned the motives of votes on other wagons and I'll share my thoughts on that later once I've finished going through Pisskop's ISO. I didn't say that me being the first to vote for Unlynchable would make me the scummiest. I said there is the possibility I could get called scummy for it. I think this because if it turned out Unlynchable was mislynched then I feel I'd be called scummy because I came up witht he first reason to vote for him and in this case the reasoning would be wrong. I can easily see how this could be construed as a scum trying to get a mislynch on someone."}

I think it's far easier to get panicky and defensive as scum, because being lynched is a lot scarier as scum.  Your team is losing a much larger proportion of its members than if you were town.  The stakes are higher, it's more important not to get lynched.  It's natural that some of that would translate into paranoia about getting lynched.  I'm not saying it's the be-all and end-all of scumtells, but I definitely think it is one.  And although pisskop's OMGUS definitely doesn't look like town behaviour, I want to see more out of both pisskop and Skold before we lynch anyone.<br><br>If it comes down to it, I definitely wouldn't be upset by a pisskop lynch.  I'm not going to vote him because I don't want any lynch this early and it looks like his wagon is gaining weight, but a) his posts seem slightly off to me, b) the OMGUS is blatant in his recent posts, and c) the associative tells from lynching him would be far more interesting than those from Skold, regardless of his alignment.  However, I think that if pisskop is scum, Skold likely is too, so by that logic, it doesn't matter much to me which we lynch.<br><br>tl;dr considering votehopping to pisskop, want to wait and see more evidence first."}

Your points about Pisskop in regards to his thoughts about Skold are good but other than that you don't have many other reasons to want to lynch him (other than his erratic behaviour as of now) which I do find slighlty scummy in itself especially considering the fact that you want to quick lynch him even though you know what I think about quick lynches. I just don't feel you have as many reasons as you think you do to lynch him. If you have any more points on Pisskop post them if not I'd suggest trying to find a few as I doubt your case is going to sway any other players.

How can you possibly say that town having more information is bad?  Let me summarize the correct argument against long days for you:<br>Scum has time to argue their way out of lynches.  The game goes dead, townies get bored, nobody posts anything.<br>We're <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nowhere near this point.</span>  Your point about town having too much information makes no sense regardless of that.  And your logic about us being nowhere near a lynch on pisskop is terrible logic.  If we're not going to lynch him yet, my vote doesn't matter.  If we're going to lynch him already, you're outright manipulating me into giving my vote.  There's no way you can possibly be afraid of the day ending without a lynch - it's barely begun.<br><br>I'm positive that one of you or pisskop is scum.  Would you bet your life on pisskop flipping red?"}

I've also played with Jingle before and read a couple of his games, and he seems to have an infuriating habit of withholding information regardless of alignment.

Even if Skold is scum (which I doubt. I'm leaning towards him just being an arse) how would an early lynch help town? The answer is: it wouldn't. It would just stop us from communincating and gathering information, putting us behind scum early on in the game. I'm just pointing this out to say my joke vote on you isn't really a joke vote anymore.</div></blockquote><br><br>Because he's obvscum, the scumminess seeps from the pores of every letter of his posts</div></blockquote><br><br>Right now Unlynchable is joint top of my scum list. He has consistently been useless by posting unreasoned scum lists without any reasoning, has tried to push for a early lynches multiple times and has just posted completely irrelevant information (I have eyes too you know? You're not special with your ability to read). As the quotes above show he voted for Skold and then asked for us to all lynch him on page 2. He didn't post any reasoning for his vote on Skold (instead he hid behind the reasoning of Jingle) and when I asked him why he wanted an early lynch he avoided the question and just said 'Skold is scum' without any reasoning.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\" class=\"postlink\">post 55</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite>Skold/Pisskop/Collatz</div></blockquote><br><br>What is this? Not only did he not say this was his supposed scum list he didn't post any reasoning again. Also, please note that he put me into his scum list 7 minutes after I asked him to share his reasons for voting Skold.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6702852#p6702852\" class=\"postlink\">post 71</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite>3 posts and 3 votes left to lynch Skold, you know what to do</div></blockquote><br><br>Here he is pushing for an early lynch despite all my posts about why an early lynch would be bad for us. After calling him out on this (yet again) he responded with:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6703411#p6703411\" class=\"postlink\">post 80</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite>Skold is scum and I want to lynch him efficiently. Sorrynotsorry.</div></blockquote><br><br>When I asked what 'lynch him efficiently' meant he said:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6703771#p6703771\" class=\"postlink\">post 90</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite> <br>We could have had a scumflip by now</div></blockquote><br><br>Which not only ignored the question I aksed but didn't shed any light on anything. Basically, all he said was 'Skold is scum' in a different way. And what made Unlynchable so sure that Skold was scum as he still has not shared his reasons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6702968#p6702968\" class=\"postlink\">post 76</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite>Skold/Pisskop/Jingle</div></blockquote><br><br>Again with another scum list with no reasoning and somehow I have dissappeared from this list once I started applying more pressure. Also Jingle is now on this list after he told Unlynchable to post another scum list with 'less stupid'.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6706833#p6706833\" class=\"postlink\">post 180</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite>It's page 8</div></blockquote><br> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6707093#p6707093\" class=\"postlink\">post 184</a>, Unlynchable wrote:</cite>I merely stated a fact</div></blockquote><br> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\">  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <br>This is the most unhelpful thing I've ever seen.

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br><br>Now, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still). If he is still adamant about Skold being scum despite all the more viable suspects I am assuming he has a strong case on him (\u00a350 says he doesn't) so why did he abandon his case to quick lynch Pisskop?<br><br>@Unlychable why do you think Skold is scum? Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br><br>tldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing. This is also along with his blatant bandwagoning.<br><br>I'd vote for Unlynchable in this post but I'm already doing so."}

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br><br>Now, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still). If he is still adamant about Skold being scum despite all the more viable suspects I am assuming he has a strong case on him (\u00a350 says he doesn't) so why did he abandon his case to quick lynch Pisskop?<br><br>@Unlychable why do you think Skold is scum? Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br><br>tldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing.

Claim on your prerogative, when the results that you got over the night benefit town. Oh, and also claim before you get lynched.</div></blockquote><br>Do you think I cannot/couldn't provide legitimate reasoning?<br><br>In mylo today we have 8 alive. This means with likely 3 scum (pretty much guaranteed) if we mislynch we lost barring a vigkill on scum which we are not going to take into consideration as we (shouldn't unless you are the vig) know if said player can shoot tonight.<br><br>There are on average 3-4 PR's in mini normals, if everyone claims and we have only 3 PRs, the 2 (living) PR's are confirmed town. This means we have much better chance to lynch scum today as we have a pool of 6 to lynch from instead of 8. This is of course a very good benefit to massclaiming today. If we have 4 PR's then even better although it's possible 1 is scum with 4 claims this is where we use our judgement either way mafia is a game about information when you are faced with situation where you either lynch scum or lose (which we are currently in - simplified) you should put all information on the table.<br><br>This is fairly standard mafia theory. You claim in mylo (if you intend to lynch) or lylo because you should make the most informed lynch possible considering it could be the last.<br><br>Do you disagree?"}

If you want to argue that the town needs power roles to balance out with the mafia's power roles, that's not correct. It's the other way around. The town has no need for power roles, they're only added to make the town more interesting. This is a normal game. That doesn't mean \"X number of power roles, no matter what.\" The Normal games might very well be totally vanilla: no power roles of any sort. While clearly this isn't a game <span style=\"font-style: italic\">without</span> power roles, we don't really know how many there are. We can <span style=\"font-style: italic\">attempt</span> a meta-clear, but it's not foolproof. Saying that it makes you \"confirmed town\" that there aren't more power roles is blatant falsehood.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6762030#p6762030\" class=\"postlink\">post 403</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>This meta clear stuff is very obvious.

Your meta-clear argument would be very convincing if you were playing like a town player. But calling out a mass-claim without claiming yourself, purposefully withholding information from the town, and then revealing that the reason that you took the last place to claim is in essence <span style=\"font-style: italic\">for</span> your  meta-clear argument, and for no other reason? I'm sorry, but that isn't proper logic, in my mind. We trusted you with that last claim spot because there's a lot that many different power roles could have done with it. A tracker could have fingered a mafia role-blocker that they tracked if the role-blocker claimed a non PR. It's a good position to counter-claim from. Leaving any PR claim for last prevents the mafia from doing any weird counter-claiming bullshit, so if you were a cop you would have taken last position in order to capitalize on finding scum. But you did nothing like that.<br><br>The meta-clear as a town member would have worked no matter when you claimed. You could have stated, \"There are three town roles revealed so far, the meta indicates that it is likely that all claimed power roles are town\" after everyone claimed. You didn't need to claim last for that to happen. And you have no productive information that would have required a mass-claim.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6762030#p6762030\" class=\"postlink\">post 403</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>We are not nolynching.

As far as I'm concerned, Slandaar, scissor-slot, are town, and the same should apply to anyone. I feel Collatz is currently the strongest choice, but I haven't done any scumhunting of my own. Which I probably should. Poor form and technique to rely off of other peoples' work. Really, Slandaar and to a certain extent Jingle are the only ones doing scumhunting. I'd say that casts Jingle as town, and it does, but I don't doubt that Jingle has the capacity to be scum. Really, this is a lazy town, and I'm too busy to make much difference.

Skold seeing himself as falling most likely would not try to toss out a teammate instead, I think. He's too fresh a player, and seems a bit too reserved for that. So if we lynch Madman and Madman is scum, we more or less know that Skold is not scum, so we don't shoot him. If we lynch him and he's town, then we can guess with a fairly high degree of certainty that he's scum, since the other town is probably Jingle. But you might be right in shooting Wrong Song if we lynch Madman and Madman is town. I'm highly confident that Madman is scum, but if he isn't, I still would probably suspect Wrong Song more than Skold."}

Skold seeing himself as falling most likely would not try to toss out a teammate instead, I think. He's too fresh a player, and seems a bit too reserved for that. So if we lynch Madman and Madman is scum, we more or less know that Skold is not scum, so we don't shoot him. If we lynch him and he's town, then we can guess with a fairly high degree of certainty that he's scum, since the other town is probably Jingle. But you might be right in shooting Wrong Song if we lynch Madman and Madman is town. I'm highly confident that Madman is scum, but if he isn't, I still would probably suspect Wrong Song more than Skold.</div></blockquote><br>I do not really like the way you answered this question - the new answer makes okay sense - but the new answer doesn't seem to line up with your old answer.<br>Do you think both thoughts make sense together?<br><br>@Slaandarina - ^^^ weigh in on this as well, tell me if I'm crazy or not."}

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br><br>Now, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still). If he is still adamant about Skold being scum despite all the more viable suspects I am assuming he has a strong case on him (\u00a350 says he doesn't) so why did he abandon his case to quick lynch Pisskop?<br><br>@Unlychable why do you think Skold is scum? Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br><br>tldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing.

The only way I think that this would be real is if in the same post he voted for BBT because he felt the \u201clynch vote\u201d was that bad. He didn\u2019t do that though, he just unvoted. The lone unvote shows me that he wanted to get some town dred off the mislynch, and wanted to absolve himself of the stigma of being on that lynch by showing that he wanted off it when it was just a little bit too late.<br><br>Post #343- The first part is going against Slandaar and the idea of mass claiming. My favorite quote from that little tiff is \u201cAll you PRs out there, don\u2019t listen to this guy.\u201d It comes across very fake.<br><br>Then we start getting into the accusations about my hammer. I whole heartedly believe that Unlynchable knew that he should have claimed. BBT thought that he had hammered, so it would only make sense that it could be considered intent. Unlynchable posted another bullshit one liner, and bounced. I came on about 3 hours later, saw what he posted, and then hammered. <br><br>\u201cI think preemptively hammering, without giving people a chance to claim, is an anti-town action.\u201d How do you feel about slots that are in a position to claim, and choose not to? Do you beg them, pretty please claim? Or do you take the absence of a claim as your answer?<br><br>I\u2019d also like to point out that in this post Arch throws a FoS onto BBT\u2026 who fucking died the night before. Smells like a fake town slip to me.<br><br>Post #364- Agrees that he can see my side of the hammer situation. Jokes about giving me the FoS and not the Fist of Suspicion and a vote. <br>Changes his stance on Slandaar, claims, and says that he had no idea that this was mylo. This smells like another faked town slip. He claimed before we all even agreed that we would be doing a mass claim, for what its worth.<br><br>Post #401-416- 6 posts where the basis for most of them is the fact that Slandaar wouldn\u2019t claim his role and the results the role has gotten. I found it really hard to believe that you couldn\u2019t think of one good reason why he would not divulge the information he had. The fact that you went on and fucking on about not understanding it made it feel like you were fishing for information, and trying to get his role out there. I got what Slan was saying and figured that the info would come out in time, or it wouldn\u2019t because the info was useless. If he could clear town or confirm scum he would have.<br><br>Remember that post I said we would get back to? Well, here we are. Post #418. Archs reads list.

Going through his iso I can\u2019t find a progression of a read on Collatz, or even much mention of him until this. <br><br>Post #457- Now Collatz is his highest scum read (not stated, but this is the only lynch mentioned in quite sometime).<br><br>Post #465- Vote for yours truly. And for good reasons too\u2026 wait, Arch actually didn\u2019t even mention why he switched his vote onto me. Just says gut, and that Collatz is still a strong choice.<br><br>#470/479- Both are to the mod for extensions/replacements.<br><br>#494- Rehashing the old and tired idea that my hammer was scummy. Even after admitting that he saw things from my point of view. You claim that I didn\u2019t give him a chance to claim when he clearly posted before I hammered.<br><br>#496- Aggression is not a tell. Activity is not a tell (most times). Admits to not scum hunting. <br><br>#529- \u201c...but still, dat hammer.\u201d Again talking about my hammer as the only thing that he can point to for me being scum.<br><br>#570- I feel like in MYLO which Arch has already admitted to believing we may be in, that voting so quickly for a replacement is a bad call. I get that Arch has been throwing jabs at Collatz in absentee, but one post shouldn\u2019t have put him over the top like that imo.<br><br>#571- Again he says that I didn\u2019t give Unlynchable a chance to claim.

Your points about Pisskop in regards to his thoughts about Skold are good but other than that you don't have many other reasons to want to lynch him (other than his erratic behaviour as of now) which I do find slighlty scummy in itself especially considering the fact that you want to quick lynch him even though you know what I think about quick lynches. I just don't feel you have as many reasons as you think you do to lynch him. If you have any more points on Pisskop post them if not I'd suggest trying to find a few as I doubt your case is going to sway any other players.

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br><br>Now, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still).

Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br><br>tldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing.

Not to mention, fish's absurd lurking, hypocritical attacks on me, and self-contradictory justifications of his actions more or less confirm him as scum.

What can you expect Fish to do, Archmage? Unlynchable had already the chance to claim. He chose not to. That's on him and him alone.</div></blockquote><br><br>Care to explain why? My logic makes sense to me. I'll lay it all out, and you tell me which part is broken.<br><br>Fish is justifying his hammer by saying that Unlynchable was given the chance to claim, he refused, so three hours after Unlynchable refused, fish hammers. In essence, it is simplified as the statement \"formerfish had declared intent, therefor his hammer is justified.\" fish's argument then attempts to state how he had justified intent through BBT's attempted hammer and Unlynchable's failed claim: \"Unlynchable had failed to claim, and BBT attempted to hammer, therefor intent is implied.\"<br><br>I am not attacking his justifying statements, no matter how convoluted they are. Rather, I am following a statement derived from fish's primary statement, the basis of his argument. It follows that if formerfish had declared intent, then his hammer would be justified, it is therefor true that \"If fish did not have intent, then his hammer is not justified by his intent.\" Asofar, we have only been operating off of formerfish's logic. Now, we bring in the first logic that is purely mine: \"If fish states that his hammer would not be justified without intent, then he is implicitly stating that he cares about intent.\" Call this Statement 1.<br><br>Fish's actions demonstrate that he had no care for intent when he hammered Unlynchable. Statement 2 is that \"BBT attempted to hammer without declaring intent.\" Statement 3 is that \"If formerfish cared about intent, he would object if someone attempted to hammer without intent.\" Therefor, Statement 4 reasonably follows that \"If formerfish cares about intent, he object to BBT attempting to hammer without intent.\" Statement 5 is that \"formerfish did not recognize BBT's attempt to hammer without intent, therefor formerfish did not object to BBT attempting to hammer without intent.\" Statement 6 is that \"formerfish used BBT's attempt to hammer without intent to justify his hammer, therefor formerfish does not retroactively object to BBT's attempt to hammer without intent.\" Statement 7 is that \"Statements 5 and 6 contradict Statement 4, therefor Statement 4 is false.\" My final statement is \"Statement 4 contradicts Statement 1, therefor fish does not care about intent.\" <br><br>Since fish did not care about intent, his hammer cannot be justified by intent. Therefor, his defense falls.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6829110#p6829110\" class=\"postlink\">post 633</a>, Skold wrote:</cite>Onto the next paragraph: The hammer wasn't bad and nor was the defense.<br><br>''Major General Mercy''.

Here's my reasoning:<br><br>Formerfish's lynch, and more importantly, his fallacious and hypocritical justifications of that action and his attacks on me, mean that formerfish is scum.<br><br>Formerfish has contributed hardly anything the whole game.

Always calling him null read, leaning towards scum, or recently leaning towards town. It's the kind of read that scum has towards scum, from my experience.<br><br>And RationalMadman? Let's look at his perspective. So, a townie jumps into a slot that's getting a lot of pressure. They try to push the town towards scum lynch. A scum jumps into such a slot? They try to separate themselves from other scum as much as possible. So of course, RM just votes Slandaar. Trying to contribute as little as possible, I think. But let's look at his slot's posts.<br><br>Collatz posted very little. However, he was very, very defensive of Skold: an ISO and a control-f finds more than twice as many mentions of Skold (55) as Collatz had posts (24). He spent a lot of time defending Skold when Unlynchable was shitting around.<br><br>Also, voting analysis checks out. None of these three have ever voted for one of the other.<br><br>I like this scum team. PoE backs it up. Fish is trying to sheep Wrong, so fish and wrong can't be scum together.

I can't think of much that could convince me that those three aren't the scum team.</div></blockquote><br><br>In essence, you've hardly posted anything, but you did try to defend Skold once. Skold defended you. Skold changed his vote to me after your post, lynching for me after your post. Skold kept a very neutral opinion about you for most of the game, until the end, where he read you heavily as town. Either it's a series of unfortunate events leading to Skold making a very convincing looking fake buddy, or you're scum. Plus, I still buy exactly zero percent of your attacks against me and zero percent of your justification for hammering Unlynchable.<br><br>[quote=\"In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6845108#p6845108\" class=\"postlink\">post 671</a>Why do you think there is going to be a replacement for RM?[/quote]<br><br>Because he's blatantly trolling."}

If scum thought the kill might be coming more their way, skold, killing Thor would make it look like I could be scum too. Slandaar was town reading me yesterday so killing him would make it lookike they were trying to eliminate my support and make my mislynch easier to accomplish. RM is most likely scum that either volunteered to be bussed or it was decided by his partners because he is useless in any other fashion. I know my play has been erratic here, and I really do apologize for that. In games where I'm vt I usually look for something I can sink my teeth into and it took awhile for me to find it. Arches insisting that my hammer was solo scummy that it became the base for his read on me is ridiculous. In just about any other game that hammer is barely mentioned, yet here it becomes the crux of the interaction between him and I. Then he backs it up by saying I let skold defend me. I don't know if I missed where I pleaded for others to help me out, but I don't think that happened. White knighting is a thing and it could be very possible for skold to be defending me because he knew how hard it would be for me to get a real wagon going on arch knowing that RM wouldn't vote there and not many of Slan, Thor or Jingle expressed interest.<br><br>Scum team is Arch and RM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote RM</span>"}
