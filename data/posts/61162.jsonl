This game will feature a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">closed</div> setup.  That means roles are not public information at the beginning of the game.<br>\n<br>\n2. The preferred voting method is to put vote tags around the player's name, but I will still accept the old method of bolding the word \"vote\" followed by said player's name, e.g. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TellTaleHeart</span>or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: TellTaleHeart</div>. As long as I can tell to whom you are referring, spelling does not count and I will accept abbreviated or otherwise shortened forms of the name of the vote's recipient (e.g. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TTH</span>).  If you want to change your vote, it would be nice if you unvoted first, but you don't have to.  You may also <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>, unvoted the same way as before.<br>\n<br>\n3. A majority of votes is required for a lynch, even at deadline. Once a lynch has been decided, it is final and further votes and unvotes do not count for the current day. If deadline is reached with no player having enough votes for a lynch, the day ends in an automatic No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\n4. Day 1 will have an 18 (real) day deadline.  Subsequent days will have a 14 day deadline.  I reserve the right to extend this deadline.<br>\n<br>\n5. Once you are dead, you may not continue to post in the thread.  This includes \"bah\" posts.<br>\n<br>\n6. You may post in any color that can be easily read against the forum background other than <div style=\"display:inline;color:darkblue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">dark blue</div></div>. That color is mine.<br>\n<br>\n7. Unless you're the moderator (that's me), please do not delete or edit any posts in this thread.<br>\n<br>\n8. You are not allowed to discuss this game outside of the thread unless I tell you otherwise, nor are you allowed to discuss other ongoing games in this thread.<br>\n<br>\n9. Do not quote or pretend to quote any private communication, either from me or from anyone else you are allowed to talk with at night. You are allowed to paraphrase, but you are not allowed to plagiarize. If in doubt as to your paraphrase's legality, PM me with the wording you want to use.<br>\n<br>\n10. I will issue a prod to any player that does not post for 48 hours without notifying me of his or her absence. (I'm sorry, but I do not check the V/LA thread. If you do not tell me to do so, neither will I check your signature.) If you are prodded, you will have 24 hours from the time of submission to post in thread. Failure to do so may result in replacement. Keep in mind that I have the board time down to the second. I will only prod the same player twice&#8212;after that, he or she must post every 48 hours to ensure that he or she remains in the game.<br>\n<br>\n11. I'd love for everyone to play the game to completion, but if you must please feel free to request replacement.<br>\n<br>\n12. The most important rule of all, saved for last for what I think is a very good reason: This is a game. HAVE FUN! Enjoy!

Yes I have questioned the motives of votes on other wagons and I'll share my thoughts on that later once I've finished going through Pisskop's ISO. I didn't say that me being the first to vote for Unlynchable would make me the scummiest. I said there is the possibility I could get called scummy for it. I think this because if it turned out Unlynchable was mislynched then I feel I'd be called scummy because I came up witht he first reason to vote for him and in this case the reasoning would be wrong.

The stakes are higher, it's more important not to get lynched.  It's natural that some of that would translate into paranoia about getting lynched.  I'm not saying it's the be-all and end-all of scumtells, but I definitely think it is one.

Even if Skold is scum (which I doubt. I'm leaning towards him just being an arse) how would an early lynch help town? The answer is: it wouldn't.

He has consistently been useless by posting unreasoned scum lists without any reasoning, has tried to push for a early lynches multiple times and has just posted completely irrelevant information (I have eyes too you know? You're not special with your ability to read). As the quotes above show he voted for Skold and then asked for us to all lynch him on page 2. He didn't post any reasoning for his vote on Skold (instead he hid behind the reasoning of Jingle) and when I asked him why he wanted an early lynch he avoided the question and just said 'Skold is scum' without any reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\" data-post-id=\"6701356\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 55</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25530\">Unvotable</a> wrote:</cite>Skold/Pisskop/Collatz</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat is this?

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br>\n<br>\nNow, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still).

Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br>\n<br>\ntldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing.

Even if Skold is scum (which I doubt. I'm leaning towards him just being an arse) how would an early lynch help town? The answer is: it wouldn't.

He has consistently been useless by posting unreasoned scum lists without any reasoning, has tried to push for a early lynches multiple times and has just posted completely irrelevant information (I have eyes too you know? You're not special with your ability to read). As the quotes above show he voted for Skold and then asked for us to all lynch him on page 2. He didn't post any reasoning for his vote on Skold (instead he hid behind the reasoning of Jingle) and when I asked him why he wanted an early lynch he avoided the question and just said 'Skold is scum' without any reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\" data-post-id=\"6701356\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 55</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25530\">Unvotable</a> wrote:</cite>Skold/Pisskop/Collatz</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat is this?

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br>\n<br>\nNow, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still). If he is still adamant about Skold being scum despite all the more viable suspects I am assuming he has a strong case on him (&#163;50 says he doesn't) so why did he abandon his case to quick lynch Pisskop?<br>\n<br>\n@Unlychable why do you think Skold is scum? Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br>\n<br>\ntldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing. This is also along with his blatant bandwagoning.<br>\n<br>\nI'd vote for Unlynchable in this post but I'm already doing so.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI really like this post, and I like the suggested lynch. Unlynchable's been fogging up the game with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">lots</div> of posts about generally nothing. I'll support this lynch.

Most of the reasons were already provided: you hammered really aggressively, didn't give him a chance to claim. S'why I suspected BBT before I realized that he died.<br>\n<br>\nI dunno about you. You've been really aggressive all game long. Fairly low activity until recently, IIRC. Which I probably don't. As far as I'm concerned, Slandaar, scissor-slot, are town, and the same should apply to anyone. I feel Collatz is currently the strongest choice, but I haven't done any scumhunting of my own. Which I probably should. Poor form and technique to rely off of other peoples' work. Really, Slandaar and to a certain extent Jingle are the only ones doing scumhunting. I'd say that casts Jingle as town, and it does, but I don't doubt that Jingle has the capacity to be scum. Really, this is a lazy town, and I'm too busy to make much difference.

This will probably annoy you, however, think about the fact I claimed PR into everyone, only the vig is claimed leaving me as the 3rd PR. Vig/Doc is too weak for a town which means the 3rd PR, me, is also town. Knowing this you can trust my decision not to claim while also trusting I am a PR and am town which is the goal of massclaim; not to see what PR's we have but to try and reduce the suspects.

He has consistently been useless by posting unreasoned scum lists without any reasoning, has tried to push for a early lynches multiple times and has just posted completely irrelevant information (I have eyes too you know? You're not special with your ability to read). As the quotes above show he voted for Skold and then asked for us to all lynch him on page 2. He didn't post any reasoning for his vote on Skold (instead he hid behind the reasoning of Jingle) and when I asked him why he wanted an early lynch he avoided the question and just said 'Skold is scum' without any reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\" data-post-id=\"6701356\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 55</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25530\">Unvotable</a> wrote:</cite>Skold/Pisskop/Collatz</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat is this?

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br>\n<br>\nNow, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still). If he is still adamant about Skold being scum despite all the more viable suspects I am assuming he has a strong case on him (&#163;50 says he doesn't) so why did he abandon his case to quick lynch Pisskop?<br>\n<br>\n@Unlychable why do you think Skold is scum? Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br>\n<br>\ntldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing. This is also along with his blatant bandwagoning.<br>\n<br>\nI'd vote for Unlynchable in this post but I'm already doing so.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI really like this post, and I like the suggested lynch.

The only way I think that this would be real is if in the same post he voted for BBT because he felt the &#8220;lynch vote&#8221; was that bad. He didn&#8217;t do that though, he just unvoted. The lone unvote shows me that he wanted to get some town dred off the mislynch, and wanted to absolve himself of the stigma of being on that lynch by showing that he wanted off it when it was just a little bit too late.<br>\n<br>\nPost #343- The first part is going against Slandaar and the idea of mass claiming. My favorite quote from that little tiff is &#8220;All you PRs out there, don&#8217;t listen to this guy.&#8221; It comes across very fake.<br>\n<br>\nThen we start getting into the accusations about my hammer. I whole heartedly believe that Unlynchable knew that he should have claimed. BBT thought that he had hammered, so it would only make sense that it could be considered intent. Unlynchable posted another bullshit one liner, and bounced. I came on about 3 hours later, saw what he posted, and then hammered. <br>\n<br>\n&#8220;I think preemptively hammering, without giving people a chance to claim, is an anti-town action.&#8221; How do you feel about slots that are in a position to claim, and choose not to? Do you beg them, pretty please claim? Or do you take the absence of a claim as your answer?<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;d also like to point out that in this post Arch throws a FoS onto BBT&#8230; who fucking died the night before. Smells like a fake town slip to me.<br>\n<br>\nPost #364- Agrees that he can see my side of the hammer situation. Jokes about giving me the FoS and not the Fist of Suspicion and a vote. <br>\nChanges his stance on Slandaar, claims, and says that he had no idea that this was mylo. This smells like another faked town slip. He claimed before we all even agreed that we would be doing a mass claim, for what its worth.<br>\n<br>\nPost #401-416- 6 posts where the basis for most of them is the fact that Slandaar wouldn&#8217;t claim his role and the results the role has gotten. I found it really hard to believe that you couldn&#8217;t think of one good reason why he would not divulge the information he had. The fact that you went on and fucking on about not understanding it made it feel like you were fishing for information, and trying to get his role out there. I got what Slan was saying and figured that the info would come out in time, or it wouldn&#8217;t because the info was useless. If he could clear town or confirm scum he would have.<br>\n<br>\nRemember that post I said we would get back to? Well, here we are. Post #418. Archs reads list. Collatz, whose case Arch sheeped to vote Unlynchable, is now a weak to moderate scum read. Going through his iso I can&#8217;t find a progression of a read on Collatz, or even much mention of him until this. <br>\n<br>\nPost #457- Now Collatz is his highest scum read (not stated, but this is the only lynch mentioned in quite sometime).<br>\n<br>\nPost #465- Vote for yours truly. And for good reasons too&#8230; wait, Arch actually didn&#8217;t even mention why he switched his vote onto me. Just says gut, and that Collatz is still a strong choice.<br>\n<br>\n#470/479- Both are to the mod for extensions/replacements.<br>\n<br>\n#494- Rehashing the old and tired idea that my hammer was scummy. Even after admitting that he saw things from my point of view. You claim that I didn&#8217;t give him a chance to claim when he clearly posted before I hammered.<br>\n<br>\n#496- Aggression is not a tell. Activity is not a tell (most times). Admits to not scum hunting. <br>\n<br>\n#529- &#8220;...but still, dat hammer.&#8221; Again talking about my hammer as the only thing that he can point to for me being scum.<br>\n<br>\n#570- I feel like in MYLO which Arch has already admitted to believing we may be in, that voting so quickly for a replacement is a bad call. I get that Arch has been throwing jabs at Collatz in absentee, but one post shouldn&#8217;t have put him over the top like that imo.<br>\n<br>\n#571- Again he says that I didn&#8217;t give Unlynchable a chance to claim. THIS IS FALSE. FLAT OUT FUCKING FALSE. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SAY IT, IT IS STILL FALSE. Sorry, I get upset when people lie about me.<br>\n<br>\n#578- &#8220;I&#8217;m still not satisfied with his statement that intent was implied since BBT thought he hammered him.&#8221; Guess this, &#8220;I can see your side of things, though,&#8221; from #364 doesn&#8217;t apply anymore. <br>\n<br>\nSo why did you think Unlynchable was scum again?<br>\n1.\tIrony (Check)<br>\n2.\tUselessness (Check)<br>\n3.\tObfuscation (Check)<br>\na.\tNaked voting (Check)<br>\nb.\tGeneral aggravation (Nah)<br>\nc.\tEmpty posting (Check)<br>\n4.\tNot contributing up to your standards.

He didn't post any reasoning for his vote on Skold (instead he hid behind the reasoning of Jingle) and when I asked him why he wanted an early lynch he avoided the question and just said 'Skold is scum' without any reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6701356#p6701356\" data-post-id=\"6701356\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 55</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25530\">Unvotable</a> wrote:</cite>Skold/Pisskop/Collatz</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat is this?

The problem here is that not only did he abandon his, apparently, very strong reasons for wanting to lynch Skold but he also put the hammer on Pisskop without any reasons and without giving him the chance to claim which is what Formerfish had asked for him to do. Not only that but by getting Pisskop lynched with his vote he ignored what I said and what Ponystar also said about how early lynches do not help us in the long term. When Pisskop called him out on the final vote Unlynchable said 'you did all the work yourself' which is just him trying to shift the blame from himself.<br>\n<br>\nNow, at the start of day 2 Unlynchable has voted for Skold again without any reasons (still). If he is still adamant about Skold being scum despite all the more viable suspects I am assuming he has a strong case on him (&#163;50 says he doesn't) so why did he abandon his case to quick lynch Pisskop?<br>\n<br>\n@Unlychable why do you think Skold is scum? Why did you vote for Pisskop? Why did you not wait for Pisskop to claim? Why do you want to end the day early?<br>\n<br>\ntldr; Unlynchable is scum because of how hard he has been trying to get an early lynch (despite warnings) and from all he has been doing to prevent the thread from progressing.

However, he was very, very defensive of Skold: an ISO and a control-f finds more than twice as many mentions of Skold (55) as Collatz had posts (24). He spent a lot of time defending Skold when Unlynchable was shitting around.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, voting analysis checks out. None of these three have ever voted for one of the other.<br>\n<br>\nI like this scum team. PoE backs it up. Fish is trying to sheep Wrong, so fish and wrong can't be scum together. Jingle has been contributing, making posts, so I favor him as town over people with less activity. Thor and Slaandar are confirmed town. That leaves Skold, fish, and Madman. I can't think of much that could convince me that those three aren't the scum team.", "time": "Sun May 03, 2015 7:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61162&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "61162"}

My logic makes sense to me. I'll lay it all out, and you tell me which part is broken.<br>\n<br>\nFish is justifying his hammer by saying that Unlynchable was given the chance to claim, he refused, so three hours after Unlynchable refused, fish hammers. In essence, it is simplified as the statement \"formerfish had declared intent, therefor his hammer is justified.\" fish's argument then attempts to state how he had justified intent through BBT's attempted hammer and Unlynchable's failed claim: \"Unlynchable had failed to claim, and BBT attempted to hammer, therefor intent is implied.\"<br>\n<br>\nI am not attacking his justifying statements, no matter how convoluted they are. Rather, I am following a statement derived from fish's primary statement, the basis of his argument. It follows that if formerfish had declared intent, then his hammer would be justified, it is therefor true that \"If fish did not have intent, then his hammer is not justified by his intent.\" Asofar, we have only been operating off of formerfish's logic. Now, we bring in the first logic that is purely mine: \"If fish states that his hammer would not be justified without intent, then he is implicitly stating that he cares about intent.\" Call this Statement 1.<br>\n<br>\nFish's actions demonstrate that he had no care for intent when he hammered Unlynchable. Statement 2 is that \"BBT attempted to hammer without declaring intent.\" Statement 3 is that \"If formerfish cared about intent, he would object if someone attempted to hammer without intent.\" Therefor, Statement 4 reasonably follows that \"If formerfish cares about intent, he object to BBT attempting to hammer without intent.\" Statement 5 is that \"formerfish did not recognize BBT's attempt to hammer without intent, therefor formerfish did not object to BBT attempting to hammer without intent.\" Statement 6 is that \"formerfish used BBT's attempt to hammer without intent to justify his hammer, therefor formerfish does not retroactively object to BBT's attempt to hammer without intent.\" Statement 7 is that \"Statements 5 and 6 contradict Statement 4, therefor Statement 4 is false.\" My final statement is \"Statement 4 contradicts Statement 1, therefor fish does not care about intent.\" <br>\n<br>\nSince fish did not care about intent, his hammer cannot be justified by intent. Therefor, his defense falls.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6829110#p6829110\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6829110#p6829110\" data-post-id=\"6829110\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 633</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25339\">Skold</a> wrote:</cite>Onto the next paragraph: The hammer wasn't bad and nor was the defense.<br>\n<br>\n''Major General Mercy''.

Always calling him null read, leaning towards scum, or recently leaning towards town. It's the kind of read that scum has towards scum, from my experience.<br>\n<br>\nAnd RationalMadman? Let's look at his perspective. So, a townie jumps into a slot that's getting a lot of pressure. They try to push the town towards scum lynch. A scum jumps into such a slot? They try to separate themselves from other scum as much as possible. So of course, RM just votes Slandaar. Trying to contribute as little as possible, I think. But let's look at his slot's posts.<br>\n<br>\nCollatz posted very little. However, he was very, very defensive of Skold: an ISO and a control-f finds more than twice as many mentions of Skold (55) as Collatz had posts (24). He spent a lot of time defending Skold when Unlynchable was shitting around.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, voting analysis checks out. None of these three have ever voted for one of the other.<br>\n<br>\nI like this scum team. PoE backs it up. Fish is trying to sheep Wrong, so fish and wrong can't be scum together. Jingle has been contributing, making posts, so I favor him as town over people with less activity. Thor and Slaandar are confirmed town. That leaves Skold, fish, and Madman. I can't think of much that could convince me that those three aren't the scum team.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIn essence, you've hardly posted anything, but you did try to defend Skold once. Skold defended you. Skold changed his vote to me after your post, lynching for me after your post. Skold kept a very neutral opinion about you for most of the game, until the end, where he read you heavily as town. Either it's a series of unfortunate events leading to Skold making a very convincing looking fake buddy, or you're scum. Plus, I still buy exactly zero percent of your attacks against me and zero percent of your justification for hammering Unlynchable.<br>\n<br>\n[quote=\"In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6845108#p6845108\" class=\"postlink\">post 671</a>Why do you think there is going to be a replacement for RM?[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nBecause he's blatantly trolling.", "time": "Sat May 09, 2015 10:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61162&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "61162"}

Collatz/RM pair is connected through them both being connected through Skold, but you and fish connect straight up. You came out the gate gunning for Skold yesterday, which does look well on you not being scum, but...<br>\n<br>\nBleeeegh. My paranoia is through the roof.
