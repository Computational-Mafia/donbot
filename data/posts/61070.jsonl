Thirteen guests of different backgrounds all arrive at relatively the same time, all around 6PM to watch the sports game. All is well, but one of the chefs come running out of the kitchen. One of the new frycooks had been murdered! Apon further examination, it was discovered that he'd been poisoned, not long ago. Since all of the other chefs and employees at Aero's Bistro had to have their hands washed at ALL TIMES, it couldn't have been them, so the only logical option is that a small group within the guests had conspired against the bistro, and plotted to close it's doors forever! <br><br>Finally, Aero comes up with the most logical solution; the guests will be locked in the restaurant and forced to decide among themselves who the killers are. Meanwhile, the bistro would provide them with all the delicious food they could eat!</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Our Playerlist:</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1.

No using it under any circumstances, and no impersonating or pretending to impersonate the mod. <br>3) Play to your faction's win condition, as long as you do not break any game or site rules in doing so.<br>4) You may not discuss this game anywhere outside the game thread unless explicitly permitted to do so in your role PM.<br>5) Directly quoting your role PM, QT or private communications with the mod is strictly forbidden. Loose paraphrasing is permitted. <br>6) I expect every player to be civil and to treat eachother with respect. Mafia is a heated game, but I'll interfere if anyone resorts to excessive insults, personal attacks, or bullying. <br>7) No weird forms of encryption. Crumbing is perfectly OK. <br><br><span style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting/Lynching Mechanics</span></span></span></span><br><br>I) For your vote or unvote to be counted, it must either be in the form of <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Aeronaut</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aeronaut</span>. Nicknames/abbreviations are fine as long as I know who you're talking about.<br>II) A lynch will occur when 50%+1 of the votes are cast for the same player. (E.G. if there are 9 people left in-game, 5 votes insures a lynch) <br>III) You may vote for \"no lynch\" if you wish. If 50% of the players in the game vote for no-lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>IV) If you are killed, you may make one tasteful \"Bah\" post, but it must 100% non revealing of any sort of game information, or anything of that sort. It must be a farewell only. <br>V) Twilight phase talking is allowed. <br><span style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: 116%;\"><br><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Activity and Deadlines</span></span></span></span><br><br>I) Each Day phase will last [number of living players + 4] days. For example, if there are 10 players left in the game, you will have a two week deadline. <br>II) Deadlines will be extended for replacement situations and exceptional circumstances. <br>III) Night phases will last for 72 hours. <br>IV) In order to be accepted, night actions must be PMd to the mod or posted in bold in scum QTs before the deadline is up. If a player does not select one, he or she will default to \"no action.\"<br>V) Players will be prodded after forty-eight hours without posting. All prods will be announced in thread.<br>VI) Players who do not respond to a prod within twenty-four hours or need to be prodded three times in a game phase will be force-replaced. <br>VII) If you will be unable to post for over forty-eight hours, inform the mod by PM or in the thread of when you'll be V/LA. Assuming the V/LA period is of reasonable length, you will be exempt from prods during that time. All V/LA notifications will be made public by the mod.<br>VIII)Please keep the game active! If you're in like ten other games and are planning on lurking through this, just replace out. <br><br><span style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Other</span></span></span></span><br><br>I) I reserve the right to add, remove, or modify rules at any point of the game if it becomes necessary.<br>II) Pretending to break the rules is just as bad as breaking them, and will be taken just as seriously.<br>II) If you feel like I've missed something, or you feel I need to take action about something, please let me know in-thread or by PM.</fieldset><br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:15%\"></div><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Sample Vanilla Townie PM</legend>Welcome to Delicious Mafia!<br><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.

I only use it as one tool and not the only one. Reason being, people can and do manipulate their meta.

There is a few ways that I can take this post, one way I can take it is, he is town and he is telling the truth, and we leave him alone and move onto our next real target. The other way of taking it, is he is scum hiding behind this and leading us to believe that scum would not do this on day 1 and we leave him alone, and never pay much attention to him when we wriggle the numbers down when he starts to enter our thoughts again. <br><br>I am not a big fan of this self vote thing, what it achieves is nothing, it's anti town and doesn't allow us to learn anything from it. If it got to a lynch, it removes one voter from the list that we can analyze. <br><br>I am going to give Choof the benefit of the doubt on this but it is something I am noting down and will refer back to when required. <br><br>I am getting town vibes from Riblet, on his strong stance.<br><br>As I hit submit, new posts are in the game. <br><br>My stance has changed on Choof, looking at his latest posts he now claiming a power role.

Right off the bat I notice in 358 that you seem to be bullying Riblet for not being on your wagon?  That's a fairly aggressive stance if you are Town since I would think you wouldn't want to be lynched.  In 380 you piled on more by saying he's trying to avoid VCA.  Kind of early for an accusation like that, isn't it?  Don't you typically need a flip in the first place?  What if Choof had been scum and he was the one that drove that wagon?  Also, please don't claim scum as Town.  If you are Town you are hurting me.  And that makes me very sad.  More on that at the bottom.<br><br>Riblet: What's your read on House?  I'd love to hear your progression on him.  Also, what do you think of me?  Am I handsome?  Also, why do I hate posts 458 and 463 AND 478 so much?  In post 481 I can at least agree that your stated vote motivation isn't inherently scummy.  Post 514 is pretty gross, though.  You are using formatting differences as a meta excuse to scum read someone?  529 - can you link to a game or two where she did this?  Might make you look less silly - oh.  549.  LOL.<br><br>Bookitty: In post 386 you have a quote demonstrating House saying SilverWolf should know his meta.  Did you use that quote 289 as a reason to vote for House?  Because if you did, I think you missed something important.<br><br>oddmusic: What did you mean in post 401 when you said \"I feel like Bootykitty's trying to push both Silverwolf and House at the same time?\"<br><br>SilverWolf: You agreed with the above post 401.  Maybe you can shed some light?  I don't see it.  I hope you responded to post 451 better than in post 455.  Why is Kop Town as of 492?  Did I miss a post where you elaborated on this?<br><br>TSO: I like the cut of your jib.  You've got swagger.  Your example post in 403 did make Kop look opportunistic.  Then again, this is only Day 1.  If House flips Town at some time in the future, this could be a file in the case, though.  Also, language can be toned down a bit.  Your voice might be louder with fewer f-bombs.  But post 451, a post without f-bombs, is good work. Looking for posts from Kop to see if 452 is more good work.<br><br>Psyche: I wish your avatar was a pineapple.  Also, how did Choof become confirmed Town according to post 434?  I didn't read that far back.<br><br>elusive: I like you calling out the tunnel vision in 447 and 448.  I don't know if that makes you Town or helpful scum but I like it.<br><br>Kop: 599 stinks.  Unless, of course, you think Silver was in danger of actually claiming at that point for absolutely no reason?<br><br>Ozgin: Okay.  I gave you the first one.  But 619 is dumb.  Rather than role fish, and why assume it's role related at all, why not aske her where her READ is coming from?<br><br>tn5421:  Really I'd rather see better contributions to the game before sarcastic noncontributing posts like 626.  Seriously.  That's not fun to read and doesn't make the game state fun while also not furthuring the game or contributing anything of value.  I hope your game improves as I read.<br><br><br><br>Overall, I think there was probably too much meta talk for Day 1.  Meta is maleable.  This is especially true on Day 1.  That's why it doesn't mean as much until later in the game when people tend to tire of faking meta.<br><br>Here's a fun fact about me for the record; I will ALWAYS play to my win condition.  That means you will never see me self-vote [unless I'm a Jester or that vote in some other way enables me to achieve my win condition] and I will never claim scum.  If any of you do stuff like this on the regular, I'd ask that you take a step back and ask yourself if this is the right game for you because it is actually a team game and you are hurting your team when you do stuff like this.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Choof</span><br><br>[microphone drop]"}

He was not aggressively confronting me at that time the way I expected him to do as town and had seen him do in the past. I didn't feel like elaborating though because I had dropped my case on House by the time TSO asked me that and wasn't scumreading House any more.<br><br>Kop was town to me because the reasons he was being wagoned were bad. His awkward posting in response to not liking House's scumclaim was not scummy at all. I was wagoning House for similar reasons along with others so why was his vote bad and mine wasn't or why was his any worse than Bootkitty's opportunistic vote. I felt the reasons were very reachy to start calling for him to be hanged and all that other blustery language TSO was using and I didn't like it. In hindsight, I should of let the wagon continue to catch scum but hey, I like to break up wagons on town sometimes. <br><br>Ozgin is scum for assuming I was claiming anything and trying to find out what it was and you are town for asking me for my read of kop instead."}

He jumped off reason is because Silverwolf vouched that I am town, and now he has jumped back on again (for no reason that I can actually see, would like some clarification as to why this vote is here).

Naked voting, barely posting, saying things that didn't make sense. I love how one of the scum in the game admonished me for voting for her and saying it was obvious she was a PR when it really wasn't. Once she claimed, and wasn't cc'd, I left her alone except asking for her reads, votes, and who she was jailkeeping because the strategy was that if we lynched scum and knew her target, if she died then we know the one jailed didn't do it, if no one died then the person jailed likely did because it was a 2 scum game. Worked like a charm too. <br><br>Anyway, I have a habit of getting scummy acting PR's outed by attacking them as town for being scummy. I'm aggressive as town. I was told in my newbie game before that, where I was scum, by one of the newbie's that I'm aggressive as scum too. I always thought I was pretty cautious and manipulative as scum and not that aggressive but apparently I'm an aggressive player as both alignments. <br><br>Oh well............................"}

Well, catch-up post, anyway.<br><br>I am really sorry about being gone.  I haven't had a chance to do more than skim the game so far (I'm still really swamped) but I do have some reads.<br><br>1. T S O - Not a lot of content to go on, honestly, but his postings are in line with what I've seen as his town game.  I'm going to say null, lean-town primarily for his push on Kop which made sense to me despite the mason claim later.<br><br>2. SilverWolf - Mason<br><br>3. Boonskiies* - I don't have meta on Boonskiies that I can talk about.  I think he might be scum, but I'm not confident enough to push that, especially given how wrong I've been about some of my previous suspicions.  Lean-scum.<br><br>4. House - I'm still iffy on House.  SilverWolf attacking him and then vouching for him isn't convincing me right now.  I don't have definite town meta on him myself, and I can't tell if he's clever scum or just snarky town.  I'm going with null and IGMEOY for now.<br><br>6. Ozgin - If Elusive is town, I think Ozgin is scum.  He seemed to be jumping on playstyle things in a way I strongly associate with scum.  <br><br>7. oddmusic - Despite my stupid misattribution of a quote from House to oddmusic, I honestly don't see anything scummy here.  I think scum would have definitely jumped on my mistake and tried to push a case there.  Oddmusic didn't do that, and his suspicions are really in line with mine as I read through quickly.  This guy is almost certainly town.<br><br>8. tn5421 - Meh.  I guess TN could be scum, but in the games I've played with him that I remember (Epic Mafia Time, primarily) he was town and he played just like this.  I'm going lean-town just for that.<br><br>9. Saul Goode - I thought Choof was town, especially given that he was being pressured a lot. Saul could have come in and stalled out for a while, but he didn't do that.  I note the Amished tell but I'm not really putting that much stock in it because Choof was legitimately weird.  I'm putting this slot at town.<br><br>10. Psyche - Psyche is not scum.  I'm almost 100 percent on this.<br><br>11. elusive - I don't have good meta on elusive.  I don't think the RQS is indicative of anything; she seems pretty neutral right now and I'm going to leave her there at null.  She could be scum, but I'm really leaning town right now on this slot because I felt like she won the argument with Ozgin and his arguments really look like weak and manufactured scum pushes.<br><br>12. Wrong Song - Probably my most confident scumread right now.  I hated Riblet's play and Wrong Song writing both me and Psyche off as town is pinging my scumdar, honestly.  I don't like turning down a townread on me, but there's no basis given for that.  <br><br>13. Kop - Mason<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Wrong Song</span><br><br>I'm actually pretty grateful that the masons outed themselves because I would have wasted time trying to figure Kop out.  I am pretty confident given the posts so far that I would have correctly sorted SilverWolf as town, but I don't think I would have done the same for Kop.<br><br>Sorry again for being gone so long.

His continuation of the Saul tunnel with the, just trust me vibe doesn't cut it with me and his explanation for it was kind of weak. Plus, he needs to read my Psyche/Saul interaction again as several people really need to I think. I'd like to see him interact with Saul when Saul gets off V/LA as that will help me a lot with this read.

I don't like scumcases built on a single post, especially with the certainty that TSO did here, but it seems like town does this all the time, so whatever. What does bug me is that a lot of his posts afterwards are claims that everybody should sheep him\u2026basically off of the single KOP post. <br><br>The KOP push wasn't horrible in and of itself. The fact that it was built on a single vote wasn't bad. TSO treating KOP like confirmed scum for making a vote he didn't like\u2026that was bad.<br><br>Anyway, we all know the drill by now, SilverWolf softs, TSO moves his vote off of KOP, then much later Ozgin pressures SilverWolf into fullclaiming as mason with KOP.<br><br>Starting around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6680099#p6680099\">521</a> TSO gets involved in SW vs. Riblet, siding with SilverWolf.

Unvotes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6685957#p6685957\">939</a> after Boon returns to the thread.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6688960#p6688960\">1091</a> TSO responds to Riblet and Saul attacking him for his KOP push. While I didn't especially love the KOP push (and it's weird seeing Saul (choof) and Riblet working together if only for a second here), his responses, especially to the second part are solid, in particular pointing out Saul's bad logic.<br><br>I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6689099#p6689099\">1112</a> for town. Or to be more specific, the last part of 1112. It's another example of TSO recognizing bad logic and pointing it out.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6694139#p6694139\">1341</a> is TSO's vote on Wrong Song. It's explained through a specific example of a contradiction in Wrong Song's catchup post. The following post notes that Wrong Song's catchup post was \"blantantly full of contradictions\". This is a solidly explained vote, much better, even without the ensuing context, than the KOP vote IMO.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6694288#p6694288\">1347</a> TSO, at prompting from House, explains why he thinks Wrong Song is worse than TN. According to TSO, tn could just be lazy. Wrong Song looks blatantly scummy, due to the contradictions in Song's readslist. I haven't made up my mind yet on Wrong Song (that's coming next), but this, at the very least, remains a good looking read by TSO.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6695289#p6695289\">1486</a>, TSO dismisses any posts by Boon as \"hardcore trolling\", basically telling us to ignore them all. Okay, this I really don't like (though I did find it amusing when Boon took that as a compliment, considering we just had a player replace out due to being called a troll to often)</div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Conclusion</span>: I don't like TSO's initial read on KOP, not just because KOP turned out a mason, but also because it was fairly insubstantial. He's also been slow to use his vote this game, which for a player apparently known for being aggressive I find odd. His later read on Wrong Song feels better though, and he's been pretty solid at pointing out logical fallacies through the more recent portions of the game. Most of the stuff I don't like from his game I've seen coming from town. So that's a townread on TSO for me."}

I think that deserves a look over.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6693416#p6693416\" class=\"postlink\">post 1307</a>, Wrong Song wrote:</cite>Hi guys.<br><br>I'm going to catch up right now.<br><br>Okay, page 1 is a bunch of useless shit. </div></blockquote><br><br>This is pretty typical for page 1. Why comment on it?

More the eagerness without actually voting the said lurkers. Does really nothing, but contribute a filler post.</div></blockquote><br><br>So from this bit it's clear that Wrong Song is reading the thread for the first time, considering SW's pretty much confirmed town when he's making this post. Or it would be except Song maintains the possibility that SW is scum later in the same post. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not sure why, but I'm pinging on Choof's posts. They aren't neither scummy nor town, but I just don't like this. I can't tell if it's a playstyle difference or the useless spam that he's contributing to the thread that does nothing to move the game state forward.<br><br>So many people I want to lynch. This list includes {Choof, Psyche, Silverwolf, T S O}.</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh the Choof thing. It's a toneread, and a weak one at that. The fact that Wrong Song is ready to lynch off of it bugs me a little. Also note that Song had commented on neither Psyche nor TSO and is now claiming he'd like to lynch the pair of them. Odd.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Actually, I'm warming up to Choof-town, but still pinging pretty badly on Psyche, but it just might be the coaching that's going on more than anything else. So not going to vote there yet. </div></blockquote><br><br>What is pinging Wrong Song about Psyche? He's barely mentioned him.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't really like Kop's sheep into the House-Wagon. Something feels off on that vote and saying that people are town-town, but not pressuring elsewhere. This looks like scum-coasting.</div></blockquote><br><br>Heh. Wrong Song and TSO had exactly the same reaction to Kop's vote on House. I feel like I got hit over the head with box of bricks marked dramatic irony.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I *actually* think House is town. This is a major gut read, but I'm not really feeling the Silverwolf v House debate. I think Silverwolf is applying bad meta.</div></blockquote><br><br>Actually, there's some hints that Wrong Song isn't reading through the post for the first time, and this is one of them. Considering that that was the exact conclusion that SilverWolf came to on her read on House later on this remark seems a little\u2026convenient. I don't know, I'm probably reaching again on this.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>As much as I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\"> like </span> KOP, T S O is bugging me even <span style=\"font-style: italic\"> more</span>. T S O has a sticky vote, he's not commenting on new content, but is willing to push Kop. That feels fishy as hell.</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay this is really bad. It helps me to have some perspective on KOP/TSO but criminy is this still bad. Remembering that KOP didn't comment much (and still doesn't), I think it's plenty reasonable that TSO didn't move his vote off of Kop. Not commenting on new content\u2026well did you see how hard TSO was scumreading KOP? If I had a scumread that hard, I wouldn't comment on new stuff either. (Side note: how TSO tried to build the KOP wagon wasn't great. I explained that in my TSO post. What Wrong Song is talking about\u2026isn't a reason why it's not great).<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Ozgin's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6680669#p6680669\">573</a> IS REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD.

Unless you're trying to convince me that you're making this post for the first time then why would you vote before you were done with your post?<br><br>Also yes, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6680669#p6680669\">573</a> was pretty damn bad.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The game I read with Oddmusic in it.

Thought I'd respond to this since a couple of people have talked about it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Thinking Bookitty is town, btw. Same with Psyche.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why? It's particularly noticeable since the last time we talked about Psyche, he was a scumread. Now he's a townread. Wrong Song never mentioned a single post of his in between. Not a single one.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Saul Goode is scum.

The four scumreads are okay. I'm not sure why I'm a scumread, but considering Wrong Song seems entirely averse to explaining any of his reads, why should this be any different?

You don't just join a game and pretend your previous slot owner doesn't exist.

That's not fair and is not something that happens in mafia.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is sort of bad logic. I mean yes, a read of a player who replaced out still has an effect on the game.

A solid, coherent, easily defensible scumread on TSO! I disagree personally, but still, it's not a bad case, and it's well argued. So why the hell is Wrong Song still voting Saul?

There's not as many contradictions in the initial catchup post as TSO suggested but there are a couple contradictions in subsequent posts.

This is a scumread.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Wrong Song</span><br><br>That's 5 votes or L-2 by my count.<br><br>@ Wrong Song: <br>1) Partway through your catchup post you put a vote on Ozgin. Later on, when giving your scumreads he wasn't there. Why?<br>2) Your last read on choof was a townread. But in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6693514#p6693514\">1313</a> you wanted to hold Saul accountable for choof's scumminess.

Yet you claim not to want to kill him, and he's not on your apparently immutable list of people you wanted killed. Explain."}

I'm not sure if that's coloured by my minor townread on Choof and Riblet's extreme tunnel on him, though.  I felt like he set up several straw-man arguments (the ones I remember are the \"appeasement\" thing about oddmusic and the weird 'I'm going to vote my top scum read' reasoning about how people are lynched without his help) and I dislike the definite scumread on Choof while the same logic isn't applied to House (if I recall correctly, he called House a VI for doing it -- he doesn't even consider that for Choof).  If Riblet ever explained his other reasons for Choof being scum other than what I thought was a joke scumclaim, I surely didn't see it.<br><br>For me, Wrong Song is equally bad in a different way.  He's still tunnelling on Choof (now Saul) and he's throwing suspicion in a lot of directions without what I see as good cause.  I don't like his unexplained townreads on me and Psyche; I feel that Psyche is town based on my meta experience with him, but Wrong Song doesn't even give that much of an explanation.  Apparently we're town \"just because.\"  If I remember correctly, he's also scumreading oddmusic, which seems really unjustified to me as well.<br><br>I also think Ozgin is likely scum, so I'm good with that lynch as well.

I'm over it, done with it.</div></blockquote><br><br>This does seem like really genuine frustration.  I just don't have any way to know if it's indicative of alignment in THIS game.

Naked voting, barely posting, saying things that didn't make sense. I love how one of the scum in the game admonished me for voting for her and saying it was obvious she was a PR when it really wasn't. Once she claimed, and wasn't cc'd, I left her alone except asking for her reads, votes, and who she was jailkeeping because the strategy was that if we lynched scum and knew her target, if she died then we know the one jailed didn't do it, if no one died then the person jailed likely did because it was a 2 scum game. Worked like a charm too. <br><br>Anyway, I have a habit of getting scummy acting PR's outed by attacking them as town for being scummy. I'm aggressive as town. I was told in my newbie game before that, where I was scum, by one of the newbie's that I'm aggressive as scum too. I always thought I was pretty cautious and manipulative as scum and not that aggressive but apparently I'm an aggressive player as both alignments. <br><br>Oh well............................</div></blockquote><br><br>It's a pretty well known fact that Malakittens loves naked votes and loves to analyze wagons late-game than early game. The meta is for her to lurk early game and then get stronger down the road. She was pretty damn obvious as a PR. Also town got really lucky that game because truth be told they should have lost. <br><br>Also the first line of the second paragraph is true, but that's because you don't put the little pieces together.

I was also trying to bait TN with the Amished tell-case on Saul Goode, but it seems that TN can give two shits about scumhunting because if he did he would have already argued against my case on Saul Goode. <br><br>(What I'm referring to is in TN's firs game ever on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=42975\" class=\"postlink\">site.</a> The same tell was used on him as a case, ended up being wrong, but as town I would think TN would have more passion to try to argue that this tell isn't as accurate as people make it out to be.

I'm not sure if that's coloured by my minor townread on Choof and Riblet's extreme tunnel on him, though.  I felt like he set up several straw-man arguments (the ones I remember are the \"appeasement\" thing about oddmusic and the weird 'I'm going to vote my top scum read' reasoning about how people are lynched without his help) and I dislike the definite scumread on Choof while the same logic isn't applied to House (if I recall correctly, he called House a VI for doing it -- he doesn't even consider that for Choof).  If Riblet ever explained his other reasons for Choof being scum other than what I thought was a joke scumclaim, I surely didn't see it.<br><br>For me, Wrong Song is equally bad in a different way.  He's still tunnelling on Choof (now Saul) and he's throwing suspicion in a lot of directions without what I see as good cause.  I don't like his unexplained townreads on me and Psyche; I feel that Psyche is town based on my meta experience with him, but Wrong Song doesn't even give that much of an explanation.  Apparently we're town \"just because.\"  If I remember correctly, he's also scumreading oddmusic, which seems really unjustified to me as well.<br><br>I also think Ozgin is likely scum, so I'm good with that lynch as well.

I apologize for blowing up at you. You are right. I am terrible at dealing with scummy looking PR's. I also suck at being an important PR because I usually end up outing myself under pressure. My very first game here newbie 1532, I was the town tracker and outed myself due to being scumread and wagoned due to scum and town pushing me. I was pretty scummy I'll admit but I was nervous. It is extremely difficult to be a PR with night actions. What really sucked about that game is of course I was killed N2 but I tracked correctly and couldn't tell anyone because I was dead. Anyway, I do better as a VT or a PR with no night actions like mason or a BP or something. So yeah, your advice was well intentioned and I just got pissy cuz guess what? I'm also an emotional player.<br><br>No, you do not have to replace out. You feel townier than you did though. I don't get the Oddmusic scumread though. I'm confused on that one.

I'm thinking if you stopped being aggressive and took a look at people's play in general then maybe that would help pause you getting scummy PR's to out themselves. I'm not saying that it's good for people to play scummy as a PR, but not everyone can play a PR effectively if they don't roll it as much. Others have better handling certain roles, but playing a protective roles isn't easy. it's like you have the whole game on your shoulders so it's that much harder because you have to try to guess who scum are, try to counter what they are going to do etc without being super transparent. it's hard as fuck.</div></blockquote><br><br>OK, This makes sense. I apologize for blowing up at you. You are right. I am terrible at dealing with scummy looking PR's. I also suck at being an important PR because I usually end up outing myself under pressure. My very first game here newbie 1532, I was the town tracker and outed myself due to being scumread and wagoned due to scum and town pushing me. I was pretty scummy I'll admit but I was nervous. It is extremely difficult to be a PR with night actions. What really sucked about that game is of course I was killed N2 but I tracked correctly and couldn't tell anyone because I was dead. Anyway, I do better as a VT or a PR with no night actions like mason or a BP or something. So yeah, your advice was well intentioned and I just got pissy cuz guess what? I'm also an emotional player.<br><br>No, you do not have to replace out. You feel townier than you did though. I don't get the Oddmusic scumread though. I'm confused on that one.

Well I'm prepared to let you live to day 3, but let me assure you if there is no kill from you after night 2, I will want you lynched, and I will push you for it. <br><br>House, you claimed vengeful townie, hmmm. Does something tell me here that you have claimed this so that nobody lynches you and buys you not to be NK? Or is this something telling me that you are scum and by claiming that role, nobody will lynch you so you coast all the way through till the end? Hmmm something that I will give some thought too. <br><br>Orzgin, that hammer is still bugging me. You are my first lynch option, so let me ask you, I want you to roleclaim here, now."}

But in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6693514#p6693514\">1313</a> you wanted to hold Saul accountable for choof's scumminess.

I am not seeing any interaction that makes me feel like that.</div></blockquote><br><br>It's mostly because tn has been voting for Boon most of the game. But I hate doing associative tells without a scum flip so that isn't set in stone and I agree wagon analysis is not that useful by itself for finding scum but is just a general indicator that scum would join a wagon on town. Especially if Ozgin is scum and was also being wagoned. <br><br>Boon, tn, and Ozgin could all help themselves a lot more by improving their play this game because I have found while part of me wants to go after lurkers and bad players as being scum-it isn't always the case. There almost always is at least one scum in the more proactive, townie looking players. But really, Boon's, tn's Ozgin's votes are the worst as they all seemed to want to go after Psyche or easy votes.<br><br>I also feel like TSO's OMGUS was more scum motivated than town motivated OMGUS and that plus the counter wagon is a big factor in looking at TSO today. He never even voted Ozgin despite saying his thinking he is scum but went after WS instead who I admit was scummy so I'm not sure that is enough of a case by itself on TSO. An Ozgin flip would help a lot with that read and is for sure the optimal lynch for today. Basically, if Ozgin is town-all this associative stuff on TSO is bunk. Also, though a lot of TSO's votes were safe votes like tn and Boon. <br><br>Before we lynch though, I want to at least try to pin down who the others might be for no other reason than to help Saul with his shot.<br><br>And since there are 3 it's gotta be more than the obvious Ozgin, tn choices. My paranoia and experience tells me one of the townier people is scum outside of myself, Kop, and Saul."}

I've never been pushed by House before really, and his gameplay doesn't seem to be different, it's just interesting to be on this side. I'm going to lean scum on him, if only due to POE, and my town read of T S O. Also, I have some other scum reads that I will talk about that would make House scum. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Bookitty</span> - Yeah, I don't like Boo this game. She's off. She's scum. I feel like she's trying to setup possible mislynches around the board, and make it in a way where she could easily reason herself without having pressure given to her. I really don't like how Boo's interactions with House. Her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6714658#p6714658\" class=\"postlink\">read on House here</a> feels like a way of communicating to her scum partner. Also the town read is odd to match up with what was said.  <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ozgin</span> - Bookitty and House have each only been on Ozgin's wagon once. Bookitty went on Ozgin real early in the game, before anything really happened, so I think that's something. She soon moves off. House sees Ozgin potentially going down a little later, but still early, and decides to put a vote there, and not for real any good reason. I believe this shows something. Also, there's a VCA I want to do involving Ozgin, which I'll do in a sec. Anyways, by association, Ozgin is scum. Not even relating to his gameplay...oi.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">oddmusic</span> - I think he's playing a fine game. He seems like town trying to figure things out.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tn5421</span> - Sigh...I hate to say it, but after reading the thread, and everyone's ISO's...I think we're being biased against each other and are in a Town v Town situation, and scum is hopping on it. Give this some thought, please, Tn. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Saul Goode</span>- I like Saul. Saul is good. I like how he's dealing with House. town.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">elusive</span> - if you lynch elusive, I quit. Elusive is the towniest person here. As scum, she never would have brought up the fact of her misreading me all the time as a reason to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> vote me. Respect to elusive, and also my strongest non mason town read.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kop</span> - mason? yeah. town.<br><br>So yeah, I believe the scum team is Bookitty/Ozgin/House.

Why?<br><br>Because that slot was scummy as fuck before Ozgin replaced so is still likely to be scum now.

Disagreeing with something doesn't mean it's scummy.</div></blockquote><br>Fair enough and I can adjust my little post tests to match this. I was just re-looking at some of my posts to re-fresh my memory of where I stand in this game and there are several places you are actively trying to help me scum hunt like this post and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6715388#p6715388\">1990</a> for example and some of your behavior reminds me of Psyche who was trying to help me too so yeah, House is town folks.<br><br>I think Boon's latest posts look town. I think oddmusic and elusive's ISO's look town enough where I'm not going to push for a lynch. And I'm obviously not pushing for Saul or Kop so who's left?<br><br>-Ozgin-likely scum<br>-tn-possible scum<br>-T S O-maybe scum<br>-Bookitty-maybe scum (I need to re-ISO her like I did House)<br><br>OK, I'm narrowing it down slowly but surely, I'm getting closer."}

I'm treating this as a game basically where I replaced into. As I didn't get into this game until recently. Usually when I replace into a game as town, I instantly see a town read, and I usually come in very strong. I'm pretty confident in my reads right now."}

All you have to do is explain yourself in a way that makes sense coming from town, show post link of things you've already said if you'd rather, and I'll drop the whole thing if I can understand were you are coming from. Pissing me off doesn't accomplish the same goal or make me want to work with you to figure out where you are coming from. You do realize some of my behavior is designed to get scum to slip up right? Like asking the same question several different ways to see if there's a contradiction. At least on those I suspect. Pushing the issue even when YOU feel it is explained and seeing your reaction is also helpful in getting a read on you.

He was at L-1 at one point, but I thought your unvote was good enough to keep him safe while he made his cases.<br>I thought and think his cases suck.

It seemed to me you didn't even know that I voted him to help pressure him.

Has said nothing of substance, claimed several people were obviously town including himself. keeps promising more content and that he is more active as scum so he can't be scum now. Honestly null here.<br><br>House - I don't personally like playing with... abrasive... players like this. I end up wanting to lynch them for reasons that aren't usually related to finding scum. I didn't really like that House started the game not playing toward his town meta (according to SW, since I have one game history with him I wouldn't be able to tell) and then suddenly switched into it. What worries me most about House is how little of his posts actually progress scum hunting. Bickering and taunting with other players doesn't really do this.<br><br>Bookitty - Lowest post count of the players in this game. Too little to stick out in my mind. Maybe will ISO and try to figure her out later.<br><br>oddmusic - 3 more posts than kittykat, sorry but these lurkers need to be pushed because I can't read someone if I have to stop and remember who they were when I finally see a post from them.<br><br>tn23423 - paid attention to this lurker a little bit since TSO is pushing me to vote them. In the few posts I come across, makes some comments but never pushes scum hunting forward, just does enough to seem active. I could maybe vote this with you TSO.<br><br>Saul/Choof - good replacement here, is currently claiming vig I think? prove it by showing us a second kill and we are good. Outside possibility of being an SK even then, but would be a terrible SK to have claimed vig day 1 since scum are obligated to kill him.<br><br>elusive - like 1 good post for every 10 off topic posts. awesome way to stay active.

By dinner, the guests still have no clue who the murders may be. When the large clock is about to strike midnight, a decision must be made. The guests begin to suspect <span class=\"noboldsig\">Tn5421</span>, who had been quiet and distant... possibly guilty. \"Yea!

Tn began spewing blood all over the nice carpet. \"Oh dear!\" yelled Aero. \"Now you've all made a mess!\" Aero ran into the supply closet to get some Oxy-clean.

As for the rest of the guests, he couldn't really trust them to not kill him, so it was another night sleeping under tables for them! <br><br>But, once again, not all of the guests were as sleepy as they seemed...

Lucky has been promising to catch up but hasn't yet and he replaced Ozgin who was scummy so is someone to look at as a suspect for sure. Also, D2 Saul said he didn't take his shot due to the mislynch and didn't want to hit town but would take it N2 to prove his claim. tn did some lame gambit and ended up hammering himself as a 2 shot bodyguard. Kop one of the Masons was NK'd. No shot was taken overnight by Saul and we are wondering why. Also, elusive was replaced by you and Oddmusic was replaced by goodmorning. <br><br>Other things to note. Boon was almost lynched and claimed VT. Bookitty and T S O are sort of suspicious for various reasons (I would like you and GM to give your thoughts here). You and GM are likely town based on the people in your spots before you. Saul and House are either both town and being honest about their claims or there is a slight possibility of a fakeclaim we need to figure out. I am wondering why Kop was killed over me only because of how well I know House and wondering if he is involved in that in someway-my super paranoia kicking in here. I've had a hard townread on both Saul and House but I'm obviously confused.<br><br>I think this should be enough for you to finish catching up on your own."}

Also, he has some inconsistencies in his play and all his strange self-meta talk and excuses for not playing for awhile there was looking pretty scummy as well.

I said you were being condescending and patronising in what looks like some effort to discredit SilverWolf in the eyes of town.  I note that Lucky2U has chimed in to support your attempt, too.<br><br>I am amused, however, at your characterisation of me as this evil genius scum.  I don't think anyone has ever said anything like that about me before, so that made me happy.  Thank you. <br><br>You've been wrong about a lot, Boonskiies, so let me outline your misreps in this game:<br><br>1.  I thought TN was town.  I wasn't absolutely sure, so I didn't fight as hard as I should have.  But anyone who has actually read the game would know that I didn't think TN was scum, I didn't support his lynch and that I said so repeatedly.  If you'd actually read my ISO or the rest of the game, you'd know that TN was a guy at a minimum because of all of us referring to him as \"him\" or \"he\".  You didn't even know that.<br><br>2.  I hate lurkers.  They make this game hard to play because they give nothing on which to base a read.  I went with SilverWolf's plan to pressure lurkers, first TN, then you.  It wasn't until ToDay when you started trying to discredit SilverWolf that I became convinced that you were scum.  Your certainty that Kop was killed because SilverWolf was wrong in her reads makes no sense, since SilverWolf herself said that she and Kop were on the same page and I didn't find any outlier suspicions that Kop expressed in this thread.  Your hysterical OMGUS yesterday was based on pressure votes in an effort to stop lurkers from lurking.  It worked in part, but you still need to read the thread.<br><br>I also don't like that you moved your vote off House as soon as you could after you were told he was a vengeful townie, something that you should have known already.  That's not a misrep; it's just an observation that doesn't make me feel all snuggly puppies and kittens about your alignment either.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@MOD:</span> Could we have a prod on Saul Goode and Elusive, please?"}

I hate saying things like that with no flip but they have been going after each other a good part of the game in a way that doesn't look like scum distancing. I am not seeing how Bookitty's theory makes her scum since I've sort of been feeling the same way. <br><br>If Lucky strongly believes House is scum and I'm wrong, he should be trying to convince me of that but his push on House is extremely weak and mostly revolves around trying to get me to change my mind. <br><br>Boon has been calling House scum for awhile but mostly just for House's wagon position and I'm not sure he even voted for him until today and now he's not any more. Boon's OMGUS reads this game are a little excessive as well.<br><br>House has also been willing to go after Bookitty at every opportunity and also was after Boon for awhile yesterday as well.<br><br>Also, Boon is scumreading Lucky as well but wasn't scumreading Ozgin when he did that quickhammer. <br><br>I'm not sure what to make of all this yet but it is something to think about. I feel like there may be a connection here but I can't figure it out for sure and I think I need to re-read these parts of the game when I have time. I also feel like some of the voting in this game is hard to analyze because Kop and I going after/voting people makes it easier for others to come along for the ride so I'll have to see if anyone was doing that excessively or not. <br><br>T S O has pushed every mislynch wagon so he could be wrong town or scum trying to get the mislynches through. It's hard to say because I thought Wrong Song and tn were summy as well. They are pushes either town or scum would be interested in which makes this hard to analyse.<br><br>Zebulin is pretty null. I was thinking elusive was town but has a lot of fluff posting so I'm not even sure on that read any more. This spot is null.<br><br>Still think Oddmusic was town and GM hasn't done anything to make me think otherwise. Saul read town but not taking his shot is just off, period. Unless he was blocked."}

I've reviewed his ISO and it's very similar to that plus just reading it, looks like town posting. goodmorning has been coming off as town as well since she's replaced in. This is probably my strongest townread in the game.<br><br>-House is town and I've explained it before and I'm sticking with it. You can find it in my ISO. I've talked about it a lot.<br><br>-Saul Goode reads as town and I think his intentions were good at trying to draw the NK and almost every one of his posts is trying to figure things out and work with me to scumhunt. If I'm wrong about a read, this is where I'm wrong but I'm going to put him in town for now. <br><br>-I think Zebulin is likely town as well based on some of elusive's posting which looked similar to her town posting in other games and his posts since replacing are a lot of trying to figure out the game that comes off as town to me. elusive fluffs as town also so I'm not going to hold that against that spot and I've gotten no scum vibes from Zebulin so far<br><br>-The other town in the game is probably Bookitty but this is my weakest townread. She did have some posts that came off as frustrated town in her interactions with me and several posts where she seems to be trying to figure things out. If Boon is scum, she is very likely to be town. If he's town, re-look at her tomorrow then. Especially since, up until her recent posts, I've had my suspicions that she felt a little off. Recent posts are much better though.<br><br>-TSO is my weakest scumread and that's because I really haven't seen any strong reads from him except for the wagons he pushed which all happened to be mislynch wagons-kop (although didn't result in a lynch), wrong song, tn specifically. He was the leading push on all of these. Plus, he and Boon seem to be defending each other a lot which is relevant if Boon flips scum. At any rate, I think he needs to be looked at a lot more. Since he's going to be gone all week, you guys are going to have to look at him next day.<br><br>-Lucky is scum based on Ozgin's extremely scummy play plus I don't think he's done much since he replaced in that looks like town really. His quick move to put Boon at L-1 when I wanted to give reads first really hit me the wrong way.<br><br>-Boon is scum for all of the reasons Bookitty has already given plus myself when I talked about him here <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6761823#p6761823\">2644</a> and here <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6760235#p6760235\">2631</a> Most of what he has been doing is self-meta, making excuses, OMGUS reads and votes, and trying to discredit me. He already claimed VT and is the ideal lynch today.<br><br>OK, guys you can lynch if you want whenever everyone is ready to end the day. No hurry but I've said what I need to say for now. If you end up needing my vote, I can do that as well."}

Boon just kept on smiling. Gosh was this guy weird. They approached a giant vat of a thick brown boiling substance. <br><br>\"Chocolate...\" whispered Silverwolf. They hoisted Boon up on a little ramp, and let go. He slid into the boiling chocolate, still without much fight in him. As he sank deeper and deeper into the chocolate, only above his torso was visible, then his shoulders, then his head.

T S O shoots him in the head, just as a fuse blows and the lights turn out. <br><br>T S O's laughter can be heard throughout the halls of the resturaunt as the dinnerguests run for their lives. \"And I wasn't alone!\" He screams. <br><br>Goodmorning runs to the front door in the main lobby.

Saul runs back toward her. \"Are you alright?\" He yelled. <br><br>\"Go on without me!\" She yells back. Saul runs to her aid, and kneels down, trying to help her up.

This site is a LOT slower than I'm used to and I found it difficult to stay engaged.
