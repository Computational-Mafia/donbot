Thirteen guests of different backgrounds all arrive at relatively the same time, all around 6PM to watch the sports game. All is well, but one of the chefs come running out of the kitchen. One of the new frycooks had been murdered! Apon further examination, it was discovered that he'd been poisoned, not long ago. Since all of the other chefs and employees at Aero's Bistro had to have their hands washed at ALL TIMES, it couldn't have been them, so the only logical option is that a small group within the guests had conspired against the bistro, and plotted to close it's doors forever! <br>\n<br>\nFinally, Aero comes up with the most logical solution; the guests will be locked in the restaurant and forced to decide among themselves who the killers are. Meanwhile, the bistro would provide them with all the delicious food they could eat!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Our Playerlist:</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1.

No using it under any circumstances, and no impersonating or pretending to impersonate the mod. <br>\n3) Play to your faction's win condition, as long as you do not break any game or site rules in doing so.<br>\n4) You may not discuss this game anywhere outside the game thread unless explicitly permitted to do so in your role PM.<br>\n5) Directly quoting your role PM, QT or private communications with the mod is strictly forbidden. Loose paraphrasing is permitted. <br>\n6) I expect every player to be civil and to treat eachother with respect. Mafia is a heated game, but I'll interfere if anyone resorts to excessive insults, personal attacks, or bullying. <br>\n7) No weird forms of encryption. Crumbing is perfectly OK. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting/Lynching Mechanics</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI) For your vote or unvote to be counted, it must either be in the form of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Aeronaut</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aeronaut</span>. Nicknames/abbreviations are fine as long as I know who you're talking about.<br>\nII) A lynch will occur when 50%+1 of the votes are cast for the same player. (E.G. if there are 9 people left in-game, 5 votes insures a lynch) <br>\nIII) You may vote for \"no lynch\" if you wish. If 50% of the players in the game vote for no-lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\nIV) If you are killed, you may make one tasteful \"Bah\" post, but it must 100% non revealing of any sort of game information, or anything of that sort. It must be a farewell only. <br>\nV) Twilight phase talking is allowed. <br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Activity and Deadlines</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI) Each Day phase will last [number of living players + 4] days. For example, if there are 10 players left in the game, you will have a two week deadline. <br>\nII) Deadlines will be extended for replacement situations and exceptional circumstances. <br>\nIII) Night phases will last for 72 hours. <br>\nIV) In order to be accepted, night actions must be PMd to the mod or posted in bold in scum QTs before the deadline is up. If a player does not select one, he or she will default to \"no action.\"<br>\nV) Players will be prodded after forty-eight hours without posting. All prods will be announced in thread.<br>\nVI) Players who do not respond to a prod within twenty-four hours or need to be prodded three times in a game phase will be force-replaced. <br>\nVII) If you will be unable to post for over forty-eight hours, inform the mod by PM or in the thread of when you'll be V/LA. Assuming the V/LA period is of reasonable length, you will be exempt from prods during that time. All V/LA notifications will be made public by the mod.<br>\nVIII)Please keep the game active! If you're in like ten other games and are planning on lurking through this, just replace out. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 155%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Other</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI) I reserve the right to add, remove, or modify rules at any point of the game if it becomes necessary.<br>\nII) Pretending to break the rules is just as bad as breaking them, and will be taken just as seriously.<br>\nII) If you feel like I've missed something, or you feel I need to take action about something, please let me know in-thread or by PM.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:15%\"></div><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Sample Vanilla Townie PM</legend>Welcome to Delicious Mafia!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.

He swapped his vote to me, so I followed suit.<br>\n<br>\n2 - A vt's most powerful tool is their vote. People can be urged to vote one way or another, but it's ultimately that person's decision.<br>\n<br>\n3 - Scum know that I'm green.

There is a few ways that I can take this post, one way I can take it is, he is town and he is telling the truth, and we leave him alone and move onto our next real target. The other way of taking it, is he is scum hiding behind this and leading us to believe that scum would not do this on day 1 and we leave him alone, and never pay much attention to him when we wriggle the numbers down when he starts to enter our thoughts again. <br>\n<br>\nI am not a big fan of this self vote thing, what it achieves is nothing, it's anti town and doesn't allow us to learn anything from it. If it got to a lynch, it removes one voter from the list that we can analyze. <br>\n<br>\nI am going to give Choof the benefit of the doubt on this but it is something I am noting down and will refer back to when required. <br>\n<br>\nI am getting town vibes from Riblet, on his strong stance.<br>\n<br>\nAs I hit submit, new posts are in the game. <br>\n<br>\nMy stance has changed on Choof, looking at his latest posts he now claiming a power role.

{"number": 714, "id": "6683400", "user": "Saul Goode", "user_id": "25543", "content": "I started reading at post 358 [page 15].<br>\n<br>\nHouse: I have some concerns.  Right off the bat I notice in 358 that you seem to be bullying Riblet for not being on your wagon?  That's a fairly aggressive stance if you are Town since I would think you wouldn't want to be lynched.  In 380 you piled on more by saying he's trying to avoid VCA.  Kind of early for an accusation like that, isn't it?  Don't you typically need a flip in the first place?  What if Choof had been scum and he was the one that drove that wagon?  Also, please don't claim scum as Town.  If you are Town you are hurting me.  And that makes me very sad.  More on that at the bottom.<br>\n<br>\nRiblet: What's your read on House?  I'd love to hear your progression on him.  Also, what do you think of me?  Am I handsome?  Also, why do I hate posts 458 and 463 AND 478 so much?  In post 481 I can at least agree that your stated vote motivation isn't inherently scummy.  Post 514 is pretty gross, though.  You are using formatting differences as a meta excuse to scum read someone?  529 - can you link to a game or two where she did this?  Might make you look less silly - oh.  549.  LOL.<br>\n<br>\nBookitty: In post 386 you have a quote demonstrating House saying SilverWolf should know his meta.  Did you use that quote 289 as a reason to vote for House?  Because if you did, I think you missed something important.<br>\n<br>\noddmusic: What did you mean in post 401 when you said \"I feel like Bootykitty's trying to push both Silverwolf and House at the same time?\"<br>\n<br>\nSilverWolf: You agreed with the above post 401.  Maybe you can shed some light?  I don't see it.  I hope you responded to post 451 better than in post 455.  Why is Kop Town as of 492?  Did I miss a post where you elaborated on this?<br>\n<br>\nTSO: I like the cut of your jib.  You've got swagger.  Your example post in 403 did make Kop look opportunistic.  Then again, this is only Day 1.  If House flips Town at some time in the future, this could be a file in the case, though.  Also, language can be toned down a bit.  Your voice might be louder with fewer f-bombs.  But post 451, a post without f-bombs, is good work. Looking for posts from Kop to see if 452 is more good work.<br>\n<br>\nPsyche: I wish your avatar was a pineapple.  Also, how did Choof become confirmed Town according to post 434?  I didn't read that far back.<br>\n<br>\nelusive: I like you calling out the tunnel vision in 447 and 448.  I don't know if that makes you Town or helpful scum but I like it.<br>\n<br>\nKop: 599 stinks.  Unless, of course, you think Silver was in danger of actually claiming at that point for absolutely no reason?<br>\n<br>\nOzgin: Okay.  I gave you the first one.  But 619 is dumb.  Rather than role fish, and why assume it's role related at all, why not aske her where her READ is coming from?<br>\n<br>\ntn5421:  Really I'd rather see better contributions to the game before sarcastic noncontributing posts like 626.  Seriously.  That's not fun to read and doesn't make the game state fun while also not furthuring the game or contributing anything of value.  I hope your game improves as I read.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I think there was probably too much meta talk for Day 1.  Meta is maleable.  This is especially true on Day 1.  That's why it doesn't mean as much until later in the game when people tend to tire of faking meta.<br>\n<br>\nHere's a fun fact about me for the record; I will ALWAYS play to my win condition.  That means you will never see me self-vote [unless I'm a Jester or that vote in some other way enables me to achieve my win condition] and I will never claim scum.  If any of you do stuff like this on the regular, I'd ask that you take a step back and ask yourself if this is the right game for you because it is actually a team game and you are hurting your team when you do stuff like this.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Choof</span><br>\n<br>\n[microphone drop]", "time": "Tue Mar 17, 2015 3:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}

Just an observation. Don't read so much into it, and don't accuse me of things that I didn't fucking do.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n2. Quoted my post and used brackets for the word too which was not only unnecessary but stupid.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">This is just a pitiful and petty argument. I converted what you addressed specifically to one person into the raw information that you were presenting to the thread by saying it. I didn't change the meaning or value of what you said in any way. Again, pathetic that you're being so petty.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n3.

But even so, there's a difference between being social and being directly friendly. I'm not \"attempting to make it seem\" like jack shit, I'm just stepping on your toes a little. Glad to see it's so easy to make you react. Another petty argument.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n4. Has no clear or concrete cases on anyone.

No. I only made a case on Psyche and that was, to me, pretty clear cut that it was scummy. I'm not 'failing epically,' in fact you're <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">flailing</div> epically. If I'm so stupid and using such garbage logic, then why even bother addressing me? Because you're petty at best and just looking for an easy scapegoat to ride into a D1 town lynch.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAlso you're not funny either.

So work on that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Psht, a player like you doesn't deserve nor warrant charm.

Naked voting, barely posting, saying things that didn't make sense. I love how one of the scum in the game admonished me for voting for her and saying it was obvious she was a PR when it really wasn't. Once she claimed, and wasn't cc'd, I left her alone except asking for her reads, votes, and who she was jailkeeping because the strategy was that if we lynched scum and knew her target, if she died then we know the one jailed didn't do it, if no one died then the person jailed likely did because it was a 2 scum game. Worked like a charm too. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I have a habit of getting scummy acting PR's outed by attacking them as town for being scummy. I'm aggressive as town. I was told in my newbie game before that, where I was scum, by one of the newbie's that I'm aggressive as scum too. I always thought I was pretty cautious and manipulative as scum and not that aggressive but apparently I'm an aggressive player as both alignments. <br>\n<br>\nOh well............................", "time": "Sat Mar 21, 2015 11:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=1475", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}

I haven't had a chance to do more than skim the game so far (I'm still really swamped) but I do have some reads.<br>\n<br>\n1. T S O - Not a lot of content to go on, honestly, but his postings are in line with what I've seen as his town game.  I'm going to say null, lean-town primarily for his push on Kop which made sense to me despite the mason claim later.<br>\n<br>\n2. SilverWolf - Mason<br>\n<br>\n3. Boonskiies* - I don't have meta on Boonskiies that I can talk about.  I think he might be scum, but I'm not confident enough to push that, especially given how wrong I've been about some of my previous suspicions.  Lean-scum.<br>\n<br>\n4. House - I'm still iffy on House.  SilverWolf attacking him and then vouching for him isn't convincing me right now.  I don't have definite town meta on him myself, and I can't tell if he's clever scum or just snarky town.  I'm going with null and IGMEOY for now.<br>\n<br>\n6. Ozgin - If Elusive is town, I think Ozgin is scum.  He seemed to be jumping on playstyle things in a way I strongly associate with scum.  <br>\n<br>\n7. oddmusic - Despite my stupid misattribution of a quote from House to oddmusic, I honestly don't see anything scummy here.  I think scum would have definitely jumped on my mistake and tried to push a case there.  Oddmusic didn't do that, and his suspicions are really in line with mine as I read through quickly.  This guy is almost certainly town.<br>\n<br>\n8. tn5421 - Meh.  I guess TN could be scum, but in the games I've played with him that I remember (Epic Mafia Time, primarily) he was town and he played just like this.  I'm going lean-town just for that.<br>\n<br>\n9. Saul Goode - I thought Choof was town, especially given that he was being pressured a lot. Saul could have come in and stalled out for a while, but he didn't do that.  I note the Amished tell but I'm not really putting that much stock in it because Choof was legitimately weird.  I'm putting this slot at town.<br>\n<br>\n10. Psyche - Psyche is not scum.  I'm almost 100 percent on this.<br>\n<br>\n11. elusive - I don't have good meta on elusive.  I don't think the RQS is indicative of anything; she seems pretty neutral right now and I'm going to leave her there at null.  She could be scum, but I'm really leaning town right now on this slot because I felt like she won the argument with Ozgin and his arguments really look like weak and manufactured scum pushes.<br>\n<br>\n12. Wrong Song - Probably my most confident scumread right now.  I hated Riblet's play and Wrong Song writing both me and Psyche off as town is pinging my scumdar, honestly.  I don't like turning down a townread on me, but there's no basis given for that.  <br>\n<br>\n13. Kop - Mason<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Wrong Song</span><br>\n<br>\nI'm actually pretty grateful that the masons outed themselves because I would have wasted time trying to figure Kop out.  I am pretty confident given the posts so far that I would have correctly sorted SilverWolf as town, but I don't think I would have done the same for Kop.<br>\n<br>\nSorry again for being gone so long.

His continuation of the Saul tunnel with the, just trust me vibe doesn't cut it with me and his explanation for it was kind of weak. Plus, he needs to read my Psyche/Saul interaction again as several people really need to I think. I'd like to see him interact with Saul when Saul gets off V/LA as that will help me a lot with this read.

I don't like scumcases built on a single post, especially with the certainty that TSO did here, but it seems like town does this all the time, so whatever. What does bug me is that a lot of his posts afterwards are claims that everybody should sheep him&#8230;basically off of the single KOP post. <br>\n<br>\nThe KOP push wasn't horrible in and of itself. The fact that it was built on a single vote wasn't bad. TSO treating KOP like confirmed scum for making a vote he didn't like&#8230;that was bad.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, we all know the drill by now, SilverWolf softs, TSO moves his vote off of KOP, then much later Ozgin pressures SilverWolf into fullclaiming as mason with KOP.<br>\n<br>\nStarting around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6680099#p6680099\">521</a> TSO gets involved in SW vs. Riblet, siding with SilverWolf.

While I didn't especially love the KOP push (and it's weird seeing Saul (choof) and Riblet working together if only for a second here), his responses, especially to the second part are solid, in particular pointing out Saul's bad logic.<br>\n<br>\nI like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6689099#p6689099\">1112</a> for town. Or to be more specific, the last part of 1112. It's another example of TSO recognizing bad logic and pointing it out.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6694139#p6694139\">1341</a> is TSO's vote on Wrong Song. It's explained through a specific example of a contradiction in Wrong Song's catchup post. The following post notes that Wrong Song's catchup post was \"blantantly full of contradictions\". This is a solidly explained vote, much better, even without the ensuing context, than the KOP vote IMO.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6694288#p6694288\">1347</a> TSO, at prompting from House, explains why he thinks Wrong Song is worse than TN. According to TSO, tn could just be lazy. Wrong Song looks blatantly scummy, due to the contradictions in Song's readslist. I haven't made up my mind yet on Wrong Song (that's coming next), but this, at the very least, remains a good looking read by TSO.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6695289#p6695289\">1486</a>, TSO dismisses any posts by Boon as \"hardcore trolling\", basically telling us to ignore them all.

He's also been slow to use his vote this game, which for a player apparently known for being aggressive I find odd. His later read on Wrong Song feels better though, and he's been pretty solid at pointing out logical fallacies through the more recent portions of the game. Most of the stuff I don't like from his game I've seen coming from town.

I'm not sure if that's coloured by my minor townread on Choof and Riblet's extreme tunnel on him, though.  I felt like he set up several straw-man arguments (the ones I remember are the \"appeasement\" thing about oddmusic and the weird 'I'm going to vote my top scum read' reasoning about how people are lynched without his help) and I dislike the definite scumread on Choof while the same logic isn't applied to House (if I recall correctly, he called House a VI for doing it -- he doesn't even consider that for Choof).  If Riblet ever explained his other reasons for Choof being scum other than what I thought was a joke scumclaim, I surely didn't see it.<br>\n<br>\nFor me, Wrong Song is equally bad in a different way.  He's still tunnelling on Choof (now Saul) and he's throwing suspicion in a lot of directions without what I see as good cause.  I don't like his unexplained townreads on me and Psyche; I feel that Psyche is town based on my meta experience with him, but Wrong Song doesn't even give that much of an explanation.  Apparently we're town \"just because.\"  If I remember correctly, he's also scumreading oddmusic, which seems really unjustified to me as well.<br>\n<br>\nI also think Ozgin is likely scum, so I'm good with that lynch as well.

I like to tunnel and I have tunneled to the point where I have made scum give up entirely and show their true colors.

I have some meta on him, but it's not hundred percent solid and probably not accurate, but I feel him giving up feels a hell of a lot townier rather than fighting it. Then again I'm an emotional player so I might have allowed my gut to take control when I shouldn't. I also believe that Boonskiies because he's a lurker he's an easier push, if he's town, so scum are taking advantage of that.<br>\n<br>\nCan you explain on the Ozgin thing for me?

Naked voting, barely posting, saying things that didn't make sense. I love how one of the scum in the game admonished me for voting for her and saying it was obvious she was a PR when it really wasn't. Once she claimed, and wasn't cc'd, I left her alone except asking for her reads, votes, and who she was jailkeeping because the strategy was that if we lynched scum and knew her target, if she died then we know the one jailed didn't do it, if no one died then the person jailed likely did because it was a 2 scum game. Worked like a charm too. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I have a habit of getting scummy acting PR's outed by attacking them as town for being scummy. I'm aggressive as town. I was told in my newbie game before that, where I was scum, by one of the newbie's that I'm aggressive as scum too.

I'm not sure if that's coloured by my minor townread on Choof and Riblet's extreme tunnel on him, though.  I felt like he set up several straw-man arguments (the ones I remember are the \"appeasement\" thing about oddmusic and the weird 'I'm going to vote my top scum read' reasoning about how people are lynched without his help) and I dislike the definite scumread on Choof while the same logic isn't applied to House (if I recall correctly, he called House a VI for doing it -- he doesn't even consider that for Choof).  If Riblet ever explained his other reasons for Choof being scum other than what I thought was a joke scumclaim, I surely didn't see it.<br>\n<br>\nFor me, Wrong Song is equally bad in a different way.  He's still tunnelling on Choof (now Saul) and he's throwing suspicion in a lot of directions without what I see as good cause.  I don't like his unexplained townreads on me and Psyche; I feel that Psyche is town based on my meta experience with him, but Wrong Song doesn't even give that much of an explanation.  Apparently we're town \"just because.\"  If I remember correctly, he's also scumreading oddmusic, which seems really unjustified to me as well.<br>\n<br>\nI also think Ozgin is likely scum, so I'm good with that lynch as well.

How about you stop putting lies in my mouth first of all and secondly look at the big picture. You asked me to do it when I replaced in. I had just read 50+ pages in about an hour, my brain was fired so reading it then wouldn't have helped because if I missed it the first time I probably wouldn't have it found it so elightening the second time around. Yesterday I had work and then family dinner plans which ended around 3am and I didn't really want to grab my computer and read it during that time. So before you sprout lies can you actually look at the big picture?<br>\n<br>\nMy reasons for scum reading Saul didn't have any reason to do with my previous slot scum reading him. Why can't you or anyone see that..?<br>\n<br>\nThis is just proven you can't read my alt and sure as hell can't my main. Let's leave it at that.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nhuh? Does anything I'm doing actually look like a tunnel on you because we have barely interacted at all yet?<br>\n<br>\nStop calling me a liar-that only makes me like you less and will color my read of you. If I'm missing something, you can fill me in and help me with that misunderstanding. <br>\n<br>\nYour defenses of yourself are just kind of going after the people attacking you which is totally something I've done as scum before and probably will not do again. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, what does me not knowing your main or being able to read your main have to do with this? I feel like you know a lot more about me than I do about you. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not expecting you to have read everything in detail and RL of course is more important to this game. I'm not even sure how to address that stuff. <br>\n<br>\nAll I want is you to read that interaction with Psyche/myself/Saul and tell me if you see town or scum or null from Saul. That's it. Until Saul can respond to you, that's all I ask.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou are giving me a chance. I told you flat out that I would be going back over those interactions, but instead of backing off and letting me do that you are saying that I'm not \"bothering\" to go over it, which is flat out untrue.

I'm thinking if you stopped being aggressive and took a look at people's play in general then maybe that would help pause you getting scummy PR's to out themselves. I'm not saying that it's good for people to play scummy as a PR, but not everyone can play a PR effectively if they don't roll it as much. Others have better handling certain roles, but playing a protective roles isn't easy. it's like you have the whole game on your shoulders so it's that much harder because you have to try to guess who scum are, try to counter what they are going to do etc without being super transparent. it's hard as fuck.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOK, This makes sense. I apologize for blowing up at you. You are right. I am terrible at dealing with scummy looking PR's. I also suck at being an important PR because I usually end up outing myself under pressure. My very first game here newbie 1532, I was the town tracker and outed myself due to being scumread and wagoned due to scum and town pushing me. I was pretty scummy I'll admit but I was nervous. It is extremely difficult to be a PR with night actions. What really sucked about that game is of course I was killed N2 but I tracked correctly and couldn't tell anyone because I was dead. Anyway, I do better as a VT or a PR with no night actions like mason or a BP or something. So yeah, your advice was well intentioned and I just got pissy cuz guess what? I'm also an emotional player.<br>\n<br>\nNo, you do not have to replace out. You feel townier than you did though. I don't get the Oddmusic scumread though. I'm confused on that one.

But what they are trying to say is that I could be an SK fake claiming Vig.  That way I could go about killing at random without worrying about being SK hunted.  And while that makes good sense in theory?  In practicality I would have also announced myself to the scum team.  And that's not such a great idea.  Plus, if we were in a situation where we found all the scum in short order and the game was continuing?  I'd never survive LYLO/final 3.  So it's basically something cute that people say just as a way to illustrate that they believe the claim but aren't happy about it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell, a BP SK could get away with claiming vig without being killed by scum but like you said, there's this little problem of end game scenarios that wouldn't work out too well for an SK claiming vig. I don't believe you are SK.

I'm thinking if you stopped being aggressive and took a look at people's play in general then maybe that would help pause you getting scummy PR's to out themselves. I'm not saying that it's good for people to play scummy as a PR, but not everyone can play a PR effectively if they don't roll it as much. Others have better handling certain roles, but playing a protective roles isn't easy. it's like you have the whole game on your shoulders so it's that much harder because you have to try to guess who scum are, try to counter what they are going to do etc without being super transparent. it's hard as fuck.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOK, This makes sense. I apologize for blowing up at you. You are right. I am terrible at dealing with scummy looking PR's. I also suck at being an important PR because I usually end up outing myself under pressure. My very first game here newbie 1532, I was the town tracker and outed myself due to being scumread and wagoned due to scum and town pushing me. I was pretty scummy I'll admit but I was nervous. It is extremely difficult to be a PR with night actions. What really sucked about that game is of course I was killed N2 but I tracked correctly and couldn't tell anyone because I was dead. Anyway, I do better as a VT or a PR with no night actions like mason or a BP or something. So yeah, your advice was well intentioned and I just got pissy cuz guess what? I'm also an emotional player.<br>\n<br>\nNo, you do not have to replace out. You feel townier than you did though. I don't get the Oddmusic scumread though. I'm confused on that one.

Anything is possible in mafia games, but it is seemingly over powered town to scum. <br>\n<br>\nSaul you are my first port of call, you have claimed vigilante, but it appears that there is a Serial Killer in this game, now for a game of this size, a vigilante, along with SK seems to be a bit overpowering, and the lack of kills, holstering day one? Well I'm prepared to let you live to day 3, but let me assure you if there is no kill from you after night 2, I will want you lynched, and I will push you for it. <br>\n<br>\nHouse, you claimed vengeful townie, hmmm. Does something tell me here that you have claimed this so that nobody lynches you and buys you not to be NK? Or is this something telling me that you are scum and by claiming that role, nobody will lynch you so you coast all the way through till the end? Hmmm something that I will give some thought too. <br>\n<br>\nOrzgin, that hammer is still bugging me. You are my first lynch option, so let me ask you, I want you to roleclaim here, now.", "time": "Thu Mar 26, 2015 10:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=1825", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}

But I hate doing associative tells without a scum flip so that isn't set in stone and I agree wagon analysis is not that useful by itself for finding scum but is just a general indicator that scum would join a wagon on town. Especially if Ozgin is scum and was also being wagoned. <br>\n<br>\nBoon, tn, and Ozgin could all help themselves a lot more by improving their play this game because I have found while part of me wants to go after lurkers and bad players as being scum-it isn't always the case. There almost always is at least one scum in the more proactive, townie looking players. But really, Boon's, tn's Ozgin's votes are the worst as they all seemed to want to go after Psyche or easy votes.<br>\n<br>\nI also feel like TSO's OMGUS was more scum motivated than town motivated OMGUS and that plus the counter wagon is a big factor in looking at TSO today.

Also, there's a VCA I want to do involving Ozgin, which I'll do in a sec. Anyways, by association, Ozgin is scum. Not even relating to his gameplay...oi.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo...

Why?<br>\n<br>\nBecause that slot was scummy as fuck before Ozgin replaced so is still likely to be scum now.

Bookitty's ISO has a couple good read's lists but otherwise doesn't have a ton of real deep scumhunting posts I'd expect from town tbh. I'm completely unfamiliar with her play.

I don't get Bookitty's read progression on T S O and seems to be mostly following the crowd this game.<br>\n<br>\nSo here's my guess for scumteam, scummiest to least scummy:<br>\n<br>\n-Ozgin, tn, Bookitty<br>\n<br>\nOK, So.........................................I realized I argued against it but I think the Ozgin slot is a good lynch for today. He was scummy, I think that's universally accepted here.

I think I was a little \"ready\" to take offense.  <br>\n<br>\nHere's what happened from my perspective:<br>\n<br>\nI voted Boon to help pressure him.  It wasn't any different to me than the vote on TN and I have been pretty diligent about watching votecounts to make sure that no one was going to get lynched without the chance to claim/offer last words.<br>\nYou unvoted Boon, but he was still promising content so I left it there.  He was at L-1 at one point, but I thought your unvote was good enough to keep him safe while he made his cases.<br>\nI thought and think his cases suck.  But that doesn't make him scum imo, it just makes him wrong.  I have some OMGUS there but I am trying to keep that separate from an objective read.<br>\nHe asked two conftown to unvote him and then said (and I'm basing this on memory) that one of House and I were scum.  Then we were scum together.  There's no explanation for this weird shift, but I'm also chalking that up to OMGUS on Boon's part.  I get that he didn't know why I voted him, but I think he ought to have known if he read the game.  (Same for TSO.)<br>\nI wanted to vote Ozgin but you were asking repeatedly for more time (we have six days left).  I agreed with this and wanted to give as much time as possible before moving my vote, something I'd indicated that I wanted to do at least once and probably more than that.<br>\nBoon was making noises threatening me about voting TN (which I don't want to do, and have said I don't want to do and would only do to avoid a NL).<br>\nFrom my perspective, you then suddenly jumped on me (we are so close to deadline) about not moving my vote off Boon.  It seemed to me you didn't even know that I voted him to help pressure him.

He caught some flack for it but I think it was towny of him to pursue something he saw as scum. Crossing fingers that TSO is town so we can have fun together.<br>\n<br>\nSilverwolf and Kop - chances of mason claim being an elaborate gambit? not likely, especially on day 1. <br>\n<br>\nBoonskies - this guy's posts are so far and few between up to the page I'm at that I barely remembered he was in the game. Has said nothing of substance, claimed several people were obviously town including himself. keeps promising more content and that he is more active as scum so he can't be scum now. Honestly null here.<br>\n<br>\nHouse - I don't personally like playing with... abrasive... players like this. I end up wanting to lynch them for reasons that aren't usually related to finding scum. I didn't really like that House started the game not playing toward his town meta (according to SW, since I have one game history with him I wouldn't be able to tell) and then suddenly switched into it. What worries me most about House is how little of his posts actually progress scum hunting. Bickering and taunting with other players doesn't really do this.<br>\n<br>\nBookitty - Lowest post count of the players in this game. Too little to stick out in my mind. Maybe will ISO and try to figure her out later.<br>\n<br>\noddmusic - 3 more posts than kittykat, sorry but these lurkers need to be pushed because I can't read someone if I have to stop and remember who they were when I finally see a post from them.<br>\n<br>\ntn23423 - paid attention to this lurker a little bit since TSO is pushing me to vote them. In the few posts I come across, makes some comments but never pushes scum hunting forward, just does enough to seem active. I could maybe vote this with you TSO.<br>\n<br>\nSaul/Choof - good replacement here, is currently claiming vig I think? prove it by showing us a second kill and we are good.

He's either scum or town that is so apathetic that he's a hindrance to the game at this point. I would like more input from Lucky so I can read that slot better because it's basically still null-scum to me but we have 3 days left and I'm fine putting tn to L-2. I think the resistance to his lynch by Bookitty should be looked at no matter what he flips because she is so certain that he's town it's kind of weird at this point. However, I did get frustrated town out of one of her posts yesterday so just look at this tomorrow because I'm sure I won't be here and I want my posts to be looked at when I'm gone.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: tn5421</span>", "time": "Tue Apr 07, 2015 1:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=2450", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}

This time, all names are on the table. Once again though, the morning melts into afternoon, which begins to bleed into evening soon after. The guests, while very well fed, begin to grow fatigued. By dinner, the guests still have no clue who the murders may be. When the large clock is about to strike midnight, a decision must be made. The guests begin to suspect <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tn5421</div>, who had been quiet and distant... possibly guilty. \"Yea! It's him!\" they yell. \"Get him!\" They begin to corner Tn, who begins to defend himself, but it is too late. <br>\n<br>\nOne of the guests stabs TN with a nearby spork, yelling angrily. \"YOU MADE ME MISS THE SCANDAL FINALE, YOU BASTARD!\" He yelled. Tn began spewing blood all over the nice carpet. \"Oh dear!\" yelled Aero. \"Now you've all made a mess!\" Aero ran into the supply closet to get some Oxy-clean.

Aero locks himself in his office, just to keep away those pesky triple-homocidal maniacs. He puts a sock on the door, knowing that that will surely keep them out. As for the rest of the guests, he couldn't really trust them to not kill him, so it was another night sleeping under tables for them! <br>\n<br>\nBut, once again, not all of the guests were as sleepy as they seemed...

Lucky has been promising to catch up but hasn't yet and he replaced Ozgin who was scummy so is someone to look at as a suspect for sure. Also, D2 Saul said he didn't take his shot due to the mislynch and didn't want to hit town but would take it N2 to prove his claim. tn did some lame gambit and ended up hammering himself as a 2 shot bodyguard. Kop one of the Masons was NK'd. No shot was taken overnight by Saul and we are wondering why. Also, elusive was replaced by you and Oddmusic was replaced by goodmorning. <br>\n<br>\nOther things to note. Boon was almost lynched and claimed VT. Bookitty and T S O are sort of suspicious for various reasons (I would like you and GM to give your thoughts here). You and GM are likely town based on the people in your spots before you.

I said you were being condescending and patronising in what looks like some effort to discredit SilverWolf in the eyes of town.  I note that Lucky2U has chimed in to support your attempt, too.<br>\n<br>\nI am amused, however, at your characterisation of me as this evil genius scum.  I don't think anyone has ever said anything like that about me before, so that made me happy.  Thank you. <br>\n<br>\nYou've been wrong about a lot, Boonskiies, so let me outline your misreps in this game:<br>\n<br>\n1.  I thought TN was town.  I wasn't absolutely sure, so I didn't fight as hard as I should have.  But anyone who has actually read the game would know that I didn't think TN was scum, I didn't support his lynch and that I said so repeatedly.  If you'd actually read my ISO or the rest of the game, you'd know that TN was a guy at a minimum because of all of us referring to him as \"him\" or \"he\".  You didn't even know that.<br>\n<br>\n2.  I hate lurkers.  They make this game hard to play because they give nothing on which to base a read.  I went with SilverWolf's plan to pressure lurkers, first TN, then you.  It wasn't until ToDay when you started trying to discredit SilverWolf that I became convinced that you were scum.  Your certainty that Kop was killed because SilverWolf was wrong in her reads makes no sense, since SilverWolf herself said that she and Kop were on the same page and I didn't find any outlier suspicions that Kop expressed in this thread.  Your hysterical OMGUS yesterday was based on pressure votes in an effort to stop lurkers from lurking.  It worked in part, but you still need to read the thread.<br>\n<br>\nI also don't like that you moved your vote off House as soon as you could after you were told he was a vengeful townie, something that you should have known already.  That's not a misrep; it's just an observation that doesn't make me feel all snuggly puppies and kittens about your alignment either.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MOD:</div> Could we have a prod on Saul Goode and Elusive, please?", "time": "Mon Apr 13, 2015 12:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=2625", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}

I hate saying things like that with no flip but they have been going after each other a good part of the game in a way that doesn't look like scum distancing. I am not seeing how Bookitty's theory makes her scum since I've sort of been feeling the same way. <br>\n<br>\nIf Lucky strongly believes House is scum and I'm wrong, he should be trying to convince me of that but his push on House is extremely weak and mostly revolves around trying to get me to change my mind. <br>\n<br>\nBoon has been calling House scum for awhile but mostly just for House's wagon position and I'm not sure he even voted for him until today and now he's not any more. Boon's OMGUS reads this game are a little excessive as well.<br>\n<br>\nHouse has also been willing to go after Bookitty at every opportunity and also was after Boon for awhile yesterday as well.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Boon is scumreading Lucky as well but wasn't scumreading Ozgin when he did that quickhammer. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure what to make of all this yet but it is something to think about. I feel like there may be a connection here but I can't figure it out for sure and I think I need to re-read these parts of the game when I have time. I also feel like some of the voting in this game is hard to analyze because Kop and I going after/voting people makes it easier for others to come along for the ride so I'll have to see if anyone was doing that excessively or not. <br>\n<br>\nT S O has pushed every mislynch wagon so he could be wrong town or scum trying to get the mislynches through.

{"number": 2722, "id": "6763889", "user": "SilverWolf", "user_id": "24413", "content": "Thank You Zebulin.<br>\n<br>\nOK, here is where I feel town is:<br>\n<br>\n-goodmorning: Oddmusic read as town to me based on a previous game we played together where he was very detail oriented and town. I've reviewed his ISO and it's very similar to that plus just reading it, looks like town posting. goodmorning has been coming off as town as well since she's replaced in. This is probably my strongest townread in the game.<br>\n<br>\n-House is town and I've explained it before and I'm sticking with it. You can find it in my ISO. I've talked about it a lot.<br>\n<br>\n-Saul Goode reads as town and I think his intentions were good at trying to draw the NK and almost every one of his posts is trying to figure things out and work with me to scumhunt. If I'm wrong about a read, this is where I'm wrong but I'm going to put him in town for now. <br>\n<br>\n-I think Zebulin is likely town as well based on some of elusive's posting which looked similar to her town posting in other games and his posts since replacing are a lot of trying to figure out the game that comes off as town to me. elusive fluffs as town also so I'm not going to hold that against that spot and I've gotten no scum vibes from Zebulin so far<br>\n<br>\n-The other town in the game is probably Bookitty but this is my weakest townread. She did have some posts that came off as frustrated town in her interactions with me and several posts where she seems to be trying to figure things out. If Boon is scum, she is very likely to be town. If he's town, re-look at her tomorrow then. Especially since, up until her recent posts, I've had my suspicions that she felt a little off. Recent posts are much better though.<br>\n<br>\n-TSO is my weakest scumread and that's because I really haven't seen any strong reads from him except for the wagons he pushed which all happened to be mislynch wagons-kop (although didn't result in a lynch), wrong song, tn specifically. He was the leading push on all of these. Plus, he and Boon seem to be defending each other a lot which is relevant if Boon flips scum. At any rate, I think he needs to be looked at a lot more. Since he's going to be gone all week, you guys are going to have to look at him next day.<br>\n<br>\n-Lucky is scum based on Ozgin's extremely scummy play plus I don't think he's done much since he replaced in that looks like town really. His quick move to put Boon at L-1 when I wanted to give reads first really hit me the wrong way.<br>\n<br>\n-Boon is scum for all of the reasons Bookitty has already given plus myself when I talked about him here <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6761823#p6761823\">2644</a> and here <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6760235#p6760235\">2631</a> Most of what he has been doing is self-meta, making excuses, OMGUS reads and votes, and trying to discredit me. He already claimed VT and is the ideal lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nOK, guys you can lynch if you want whenever everyone is ready to end the day. No hurry but I've said what I need to say for now. If you end up needing my vote, I can do that as well.", "time": "Mon Apr 13, 2015 4:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=2700", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}

A few others seem to agree as well. <br>\n<br>\n\"NO!\" yelled Lucky. \"It's not me! You've got it wrong!\" He backs away. \"No, I think we're quite right\" says T S O. <br>\n<br>\nLucky tries to run, but T S O jumps in front of him and pulls his gun. \"SEE YA LATER, SHIT LORD!\" He yells, as he pulls the trigger. Lucky2u falls to the ground, spouting dark colored blood. \"I'm... Innocent.\" he says.

OMG you guys I haven't even finished breakfast yet.\" Then he stops. \"Wait a moment....\" said Aero. \"Where did you get that gun?\" <br>\n<br>\nT S O turns to Aero. \"....Whoops!\" he yells. He shoots Aero square in the leg, and Aero falls to the ground. He looks up. \"... I knew it all along.\" said Aero. \"You're from Tony Spagoni's Pizza Joint! You want me put out of business! He paid you to come murder my cook so that we'd fail our health inspection!\" <br>\n<br>\n\"Oh no... not at all.\" said T S O. He peeled off his mask, revealing a familiar, but menacing face. \"I AM Tony Spagoni!\" A look of horror falls across Aero's face. T S O shoots him in the head, just as a fuse blows and the lights turn out. <br>\n<br>\nT S O's laughter can be heard throughout the halls of the resturaunt as the dinnerguests run for their lives. \"And I wasn't alone!\" He screams. <br>\n<br>\nGoodmorning runs to the front door in the main lobby. Still locked. A bolt of lightnight strikes outside and House can be seen standing at the window nonchalently. \"That's cute\" he says. He takes out his knife. \"See you in hell!\" he yells, plunging it into Goodmorning. Goodmorning is dead.<br>\n<br>\nZebulin had run into the back room of the building, trying to find an alterior exit. He opens a door which he believes to be the back door, and runs through it it. <br>\n<br>\nSuddenly, he begins to shiver. He backs into a pile of frozen meat and realizes he has run into the freezer. He runs back to the door and jiggles the handle; someone had locked it from the outside. He sees TSO's face smiling as he slowly begins freezing to death.<br>\n<br>\nFinslly, Bookitty and Saul Goode are running through the kitchen in the dark, trying to find some way out. The deep voice of House can be heard from not far away: \"Stop trying to run, my pretties!\" He yelled. \"you'll all be dead soon!\"<br>\n<br>\nBookitty trips on a pizza box. Saul runs back toward her. \"Are you alright?\" He yelled. <br>\n<br>\n\"Go on without me!\" She yells back. Saul runs to her aid, and kneels down, trying to help her up. It is only when he feels the knife in his torso that he realizes his mistake.<br>\n<br>\n\"Sorry bud.\" Says Bookitty. \"But there's only room for one italian resturaunt on this street\"<br>\n<br>\nHouse and T S O join her, and the three of them watch their last victim die slowly. \"Better get back to the joint\" says T S O. \"We open in half an hour\".<br>\n<br>\n------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: A WIN CONDITION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 220%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:Red\">T S O, Mafia 2-Shot Rolecop, </div>WINS</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 220%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:Red\">House, Mafia Goon, </div>WINS</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 220%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:Red\">Bookitty, Mafia Goon, </div>WINS</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 220%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Goodmorning, Vanilla Townie</div> IS ENDGAMED</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 220%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Zebulin, Vanilla Townie</div> IS ENDGAMED</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 220%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Saul Goode, Vanilla Townie</div> IS ENDGAMED</div></div></div></div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Apr 20, 2015 11:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61070&start=2800", "forum": "53", "thread": "61070"}
