Sorry I was away for Valentines Day with my lovely Fiancee'. I shall get to addressing everyone's concern with me, however I might skip over some that I don't feel require a response, just for the sake of not trying to leave a huge text wall for everyone to read. If there was more points against me, or something that really stood out, I'd have no problem spending my time defending against that. (P.S. It's probably going to end up a text wall anyways... sorry.)<br><br>So with that said, let's travel down our journey together of Page 2, 3 and 4.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>BJC wrote:</cite>What do you think of my vote, Neil?</div></blockquote><br><br>I feel like your vote isn't worth much of a response. Confirmed scum on page 1 /  2? I've never seen that happen in the history of my playing here. However, if you're so convinced that I am scum, then I think your vote is positioned correctly. Unfortunately, I have yet to see any real case you have to make, so I cannot say rather your vote is opportunistic scum, or confused villager (like I believe SiX said.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pisskop wrote:</cite>not RQS if you only expect me to answer.<br><br>1) I look for inconsitencies, partner interactions, and trust my gut. once it finally locks in Im sold.<br>2) my first game I tunneled as scum. As town I may be now. Im too paranoid to tunnel, imo. as for not getting caught, im not worried.<br><br>why didnt you answer thesp's question, neil?</div></blockquote><br><br>I was planning on answering my own questions after you did. Also, as for not answering Thesp's question, it appeared he directed it towards one person in specific in a later post. I didn't really want to jump into someone else's conversation. It wasn't till later in my reread that I saw him mention being disappointed because nobody else was responding. If Thesp is still asking, I wouldn't mind answering.<br><br>As for my answers to my questions to you:<br><br>1. I'd like to think my gut is just confirmation to my reads, but sometimes my gut plays a little more into my reads than actual evidence. And that can be bad, or that can be good depending on the flip. However, the one thing I would say could be a major focus when I read others posts, is the motivation aspect. Why are you (figuratively) posting what you're posting, and what do you hope to gain from it? Is the information derived from your post helpful to the town, or distracting?<br><br>2. I've tunneled to the death of somebody that I was positive was scum, and turned out to be town... when I was town. That's a terrible feeling. Now while when I find something that catches my eye, I will attack it aggressively, I take measures to make sure I read others posts and not be isolated on just one person. I'm careful to make sure I am developing my reads, and not only confirming one.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Terminal Apathy wrote:</cite>That was more of a joke just to keep things moving, but Neil seems to have taken it a lot more seriously than I intended.</div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't really take it too serious. I questioned the intention and I questioned in my mind how quickly that wagon formed. But I was not / am not seriously concerned. Now if this was day 4 or 5 (real life, not game day) and I was the only person being questioned / looked at, then I would be concerned because then the whole town would be tunneling one person and in my experience, thats usually very ineffective and is more likely than not going to end up badly for them. In this case, knowing the alignment of the questioned, I would concur that my experience would be correct.<br><br>I cannot read bjc. He's either pushing a really hard scum-tell, or a really hard town-tell, depending on my view of his level of intelligent play. It's really difficult for me to figure out until he posts more.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>BoKnowsSomething wrote:</cite>Did you really think I was serious when I asked you if you thought Thesp was scum?<br><br>This is a good wagon.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why do you feel like I am a good wagon? And I address the question jokingly. My concern seriously, was if you were in fact being serious, which is why I addressed it in that manner. I have never played with you before, I do not know your sense of humor, and I have not done any real meta research on you yet.<br><br>Oh and another one from you:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Neil when you get the chance, mind telling us why the questions you asked recently will help you read people?<br><br>I don't think bjc sounds desperate.</div></blockquote><br><br>Sure: the first question inquires about scum hunting technique. It will help me see if you stray away from what your normal response would be to scum hunt (or you change your style) which normally would account for a lack of scum hunting. If you are not trying to hunt scum, chances are it's because you are one.<br><br>The second is about tunneling, and this was mostly a question that derives from previous games I have been in where I've seen tunneling end almost every time in a bad manner. I was seeing if my conclusion from my games matched others views.<br><br>Now that I'm done with Page 2...<br><br>Thesp, in your post #54, why is your vote on TvK? Do you have actual suspicion? Or did you vote for him because you disagreed with one of his conclusions? My concern here is simple, that you're buddying / defending. A potential scum team could be seen here between yourself, Pisskop, and Terminal should one of you flip scum. Not only myself, but everyone here should make a mental note of this post for future reference.<br><br>Another question about your post 54 Thesp, why did you assume there was a vig?<br><br>In your post 60, Thesp, how / why did you draw the conclusion of THAT scum-team, rather than say, Terminal or Pisskop?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>4nxi3ty wrote:</cite>I find bjc's start to this game extremely town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Really???? You explain in a few posts later that it's because he's pushing for lynches and you wouldn't expect that from scum. Why wouldn't you expect that from scum? It seems like you're talking about a specific scum playing style, but do you not account for the many playing styles scum could potentially have? To negate playing style as a vindication for a \"town-read\" is dangerous, and almost stretching. You're definitely one of my scum reads from this post so far.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pisskop wrote:</cite>I ignordd him until he found fault with me. because it was just RVS nonsense. until he dug hard for a fault. in RVS. <br><br>do you think his reaction to me is natural and unforced?</div></blockquote><br><br>You mean, I questioned your response in an RVS post. I challenged you from it to help promote discussion. Do you think that would constitute as a scum-tell, and if so, why would scum push the RVS period past where it was at that point by challenging you? Just curious to see where you're coming from here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SiX wrote:</cite>My main question is however, how many mafias are there supposed to be?<br>From former experiences the ratio tends to be approximately 1:4.</div></blockquote><br><br>In my own experience, as a heads up, speculating on roles (unless the Mod posts them as an open game), can be dangerous. Especially in desperate situations, and you convince yourself say there are 3 mafia and there are actually 4, then you could wind up trusting a mafia member and be swayed in very wrong paths. Mislynches can be caused pretty simply by mis-speculating the roles. I'm sure others might have differing views, but that's my own.<br><br>As for TvK, in your post #37 (found [url=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5686300#p5686300\"]here[/url]) while I enjoy the fact that you called out Thesp for not using his vote now that we are out of the RVS stage:<br><br>(Which Thesp, if you're reading this, I'd like an answer to that question. Why did you originally withhold your vote? You had to have read the question, because it wasn't shortly after, in fact it was your very next post, that you placed it. So why did you ignore the question?)<br><br>It seemed like you were trying desperately to get the attention off of you and onto anybody and anyone else that could possible have been a viable lynch subject. Doing so, instead of actually addressing why his mindset on you was off (or further questioning it.) Why did you cast suspicion onto so many different people? Was it truly because you were curious about his motives in not liking you comparatively?<br><br>In your post #51, you change your vote to Bjc. While I understand your reason for doubting his town-alignment, he's given you that reason way before you placed your vote for Pisskop. It was the same Bjc that started at the beginning with his VI tendencies that showed up after you placed your vote. What did Bjc do to solidify that vote? Was it the quote you posted about him threating either you join him on his quick lynch, or you're scum? My concern: That you're taking an easy vote route. It's not hard to make a case for Bjc, but is it because he's scum or VI town? That's the decision I'm having troubles making, and one you should consider. If you have a response that can shed light on that question, I'd love to hear it.<br><br>Also, if I missed anyone's post or question to me, which is entirely possible, feel free to resubmit it to me. As for my vote, I'm not sure if I'm more comfortable voting TVK, 4nxi3ty, Pisskop, or Thesp. I'll wait until they respond before I submit my vote."}

Yet you have your vote on me. I don't understand.<br><br>During my read through, I see Squirrel and BJC both made this point as well. BJC finding and being able to make this point shows me he's not a VI, and he's not stupid.

A lot of people assume playing styles, and that is their justification for their town read. That is simply a false method to approach systematically finding scum. 2.

As for pisskop, he appears to be town-motivated with his questioning and his pushing. I've lost my scum-read on him, so for the moment he reads null-town. I've also looked at Pisskop's points, he's really not trying to stretch anything to make a point known, which shows me he's not looking to just bury anyone. That's definitely not scum-motivated.<br><br>With all that I've said, my vote stays where it is because he's my biggest scum-read right now."}

No. I am not justifying a read of anything on you, because of your playing style. Hence the fact that I cannot read you yet, (which you've conveniently ignored in trying to twist what I said). Using your play and pointing out that it is invalidating your opinion to have any real backbone or pressure, is not the same as comparing your play being town or scum aligned. Contradicting? No.<br><br>2. Your playing style is definitely different, regardless. Bullcrap? No. But you're right, I should not have brought that point up seeing in order to prove it, I'd have to break the laws of the site. Which I won't be doing.<br><br>3. I wasn't comparing which was worse, this point is addressing points that neither I, nor ANYBODY has made. This is yet another comparison of yours that has no substance and is literally \"made-up.\" It's not about which is worse, it's the idea of a quick-lynch with no substance behind the lynch (or in other words, that would provide little to no evidence) is in no way a town-favored move. Eliminating a townie with no information behind their lynch to go with it, will only help serve the scum's win con, not the town's.<br><br>4. No misrepresentation noted. Everything I said, was either quotes from you (and posted under your quotes for the pure fact of making sure it wasn't misrepped) or it was me addressing what you said. No offense, but you can't really misrep something that you put in front of EVERYONE to see. Are you really this naive?<br><br>As for another point you made that I didn't bother to quote just because it's laughable, is \"do you think I'm stupid?\"<br><br>Did you actually read my post?

However you must also understand, nervous / anxious scum play according to the playing style of people. I've been scum, and I've done the very thing BJC is doing (even with better points, made-up as they might have been) so I can personally say, playing style has a lot to do with it. And to me, playing style (not meta, but general playing style) is neither a scum nor town tell by itself. I say that so that to slow those who have BJC as a town because of his own playing style not matching up with what you would assume the \"normal\" scum style is, and get them to rethink their play. If you see BJC (or anyone has a case) for BJC being town besides his playing style, I'd love to hear it."}

My exacts words were: \"A \"weak vote\" by your definition is on you, and you're paranoid about a mislynch, yet you throw your votes around (and were at the beginning specifically) like it was no ones business, and you weren't nearly seemingly as paranoid putting the votes on others, as you are someone putting them on you.\"<br><br>That's exactly what happened. \"He said experience alone wasn't enough to lynch, but enough to vote me which could turn into a mislynch.\" You have one vote on you from him, to worry about a mislynch (which you need 7 votes for it to be a lynch) is a pretty big stretch. Why would you be worried about a mislynch? Unless you're paranoid. That is a logical conclusion drawn from a logical hypothesis made with the basis of the evidence given to me in your posts.<br><br>I said you're considering his reasoning behind voting you weak, (hence what a weak vote is...), and you're worried about a mislynch. Which is hypocritical, because all you've given the entire time you've been in this game are weak votes, and you weren't worried about mislynches then? Paranoia at it's finest. I didn't misrepresent you, I said exactly what you said, and then I responded to it. You truly are remarkable at trying to say people are misrepping you. I quoted <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">YOUR OWN FREAKING WORDS</span> and responded accordingly. I didn't misrep anything. Even Pisskop saw through your little charade of pretending. You're remarkable.<br><br>And oh, you want me to clarify something BJC says? That's going to be impossible, as nobody can follow his logic. As I said before, it's coming from either a VI, or a stupid scum. Which I'm now being more and more convinced it's the latter."}

I think TvK is more likely to be scum than 4nxi3ty, but if TvK is scum, the likelihood of 4nxi3ty being scum triples. (I scientifically calculated that amount of scum increase through exacting experiments.) I could totally go with TrevorP as scum, but I'm doubtful of all 3 of TvK/4nxi3ty/TrevorP being scum, because I don't think 4nxi3ty would mention two scum buddies (and only two people) in an early post like that. Garmr comes off as incredibly weird to me, and would be next on the scum list (if not higher, actually - I'm more interested in the aforementioned connections with other players, and I don't see a Garmr connection with anyone, though I think he's reasonably likely to be a baddie). I don't have strong scum reads on anyone else - notably I have more town-reads than scum-feels so far.<br><br>(As an aside, I apologize to anyone for the misspelling I've been doing so far of various screennames - I'm trying to keep them consistent, but I have not always been successful at it.)"}

At that point, TvK's sole post was the single vote on Neil, which ignored my immediately prior post which requested particular participation from everyone. 4nxi3ty not only gives TvK an explicit pass on this, but he also attacks another player (in this case, Terminal Apathy) for doing the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">opposite</span> of what TvK did. 4nxi3ty's subsequent response to me (\"also don't see why everyone needs to answer one question from one individual for the game to move forward.

It feels like she isn't taking the time and consideration she was last game.

It's all about what people say that I'm looking at. Although I do tend to get scumreads on absolute lurkers. Why I think they are scum arguing? Because Bjc had his vote on Neil (could be scum distancing from buddy), calls him outright scum (not even possible scum, or nullscum) and a couple of posts later just unvotes him to vote DBK, even though Neil was still on top of his lynch pool. Calls \"I just want to go with the highest bidder\" as an excuse to unvote again. Right after another argument with Neil he says that he \"looks better\", without giving reasons and goes on to vote me (while I still thought that I was scum for not joining the Neil wagon, but feel free to find his real reasons...). Some time later, around post #201, Neil is so called misrepping Bjc again, but still he sees no reason to move his vote from me (I'd love to hear reasoning) to Neil. And he even calls Pisskop obsessed with him, but that's also a lot less worse than the apparent reasons that he's voting me for.<br><br>Then from the other side. Neil starts off saying that Bjc's initial vote doesn't mean much. Then goes on to vote 4nxi3ty because he's opportunistic scum (didn't think much of reasoning back then). Next, his argument with Bjc starts and goes on for a couple of pages. All this time it seems like he's scumreading Bjc, but still he holds his vote on 4nxi3ty, who he hasn't mentioned since the time he voted him, only saying he likes his vote. Then later he sees his chance to hop onto the Bjc wagon, saying that he finally became his top scumread because of OMGUS? I constantly have the feeling that their argument is fabricated.<br><br>Now that I'm looking at Bjc's ISO again, it strikes me that Bjc is doing pretty much what you're accusing me of. Nothing and then hardcore defending when he gets voted. Also, Bjc doesn't answer my questions, so I don't see any reason why I should answer his.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5696125#p5696125\" class=\"postlink\">post 272</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>tvk wrote:</cite>THen once again, discussion between Neil and Bjc starts.

Asking the question \"why do you like questions?\" is fluff by my book. Answering RQS is completely null. Arguing about enjoying questions that he needs to think about is really cool to know and stuff, but fluff to me. Going back to asking why someone else is asking questions and discussing why he is asking questions about someone asking questions is still fluff to me. And then once again answering to RQS questions is completely null. I really hate fluff and filler posts and back then that was enough for me to put my vote on him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5696125#p5696125\" class=\"postlink\">post 272</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span class=\"noboldsig\">How is that scared?

Same for town.<br><br>Obviously, I have seen many players call others outright scum, whether they backed it up by a solid case or not.

I'm trying to stop people from tunnelling on me. Tunnelling is anti-town in my opinion. I hate it when other players are allowed a free pass because the town leaders are focusing on the wrong player.

Not because I hate pressure, but because it takes pressure off people that need to be pressured.<br><br>I also thought a big part of your case against me was that I didn't answer questions and only attacked people.

I enjoy being a bit silly amongst all my serious-business-mafia-playing, and try to toe the fine line. Some of that comes out naturally as buddying, particularly when I agree with someone. I think a game should be fun and light-hearted for all, even when I am trying to string you up by the neck until you die from it.

I believe Bjc is scum, for simply pushing people to follow his ideas without giving reasoning and when asked to form a case or something, he calls laziness as an excuse. From that point of view, I am trying to look at interactions. And I find the discussion between him and Neil odd. So, the bottomline is that I think Bjc is scum.

But I don't see how facts are the right things to look at here. Every game of mafia is different. You cannot say that the game where you and Fitz had an argument can be used as a fact that there will be a big town vs town argument in this game as well. If mafia was in theory a game you could play using facts, than the outcome would be the same in every game. I don't really believe in facts. Instead, I offer you my opinion. With which you disagree. Fair enough, I have noticed that am unable to convince you of my opinion. Does me having a different opinion make me scum? I don't think so.<br><br>You do see someone who is frustrated, indeed. I hate it that I have 5 votes on me. I especially hate Pisskop's vote. But you shouldn't only look at me for the case on Bjc. There are four others that are voting Bjc as well. You will call this deflecting again, and I don't care anymore if you would, but this is my playstyle and I'm going to keep doing it. If you need more insight on the Bjc case, than I'm afraid I won't be able to help you any more than I have already done, and I request you to ask any other player voting Bjc why they are doing so.<br><br>Also, Garmr made the initial push to get out of RVS. DBK was the first one actually following."}

I think TvK is more likely to be scum than 4nxi3ty, but if TvK is scum, the likelihood of 4nxi3ty being scum triples. (I scientifically calculated that amount of scum increase through exacting experiments.) I could totally go with TrevorP as scum, but I'm doubtful of all 3 of TvK/4nxi3ty/TrevorP being scum, because I don't think 4nxi3ty would mention two scum buddies (and only two people) in an early post like that. Garmr comes off as incredibly weird to me, and would be next on the scum list (if not higher, actually - I'm more interested in the aforementioned connections with other players, and I don't see a Garmr connection with anyone, though I think he's reasonably likely to be a baddie). I don't have strong scum reads on anyone else - notably I have more town-reads than scum-feels so far.<br><br>(As an aside, I apologize to anyone for the misspelling I've been doing so far of various screennames - I'm trying to keep them consistent, but I have not always been successful at it.)</div></blockquote><br><br>This kind of post is ergh.  He drops just enough information to justify his reads and then some more nonsense (yes, imo nonsense) about the likelihood of a scumbuddy defense.

But rather null, yes.  He is clearly experienced, and probably dos have some supporting data, but without more data /flips and their read-changes he's mostly untouchable.</div></div></div>"}

His play has been all over the board and he continues to make vague allusions to justify his actions.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why not start with 2 scumreads and a town?  Take it right from noob?"}

I was not really talking about people following you to DBK, but more about the people that were pressuring me when you were pressuring me.

After all, scum love to just follow the town leaders around as quietly as possible.<br><br>My scum suspects are Bjc and Pisskop for the reason I listed above, plus the reasons I gave before about why I think Bjc is scum. He's done practically nothing that would change my mind about him. And actually, I'm having very bad feelings about SiX as well. Squirrel Girl brings up some really good points and I'm definitely willing to follow her on this. Also, I would love to see Garmr do somewhat more than what he's doing right now. I'm definitely wary about Thesp as well, he's coasting way too much. Neil, Anxiety, Lobster and Trevor are null.

I have no idea how Pisskop and DBK find enough evidence to vote me in my 100% town meta. And hell, I don't have a single clue why Bjc is on me, but this town doesn't seem too have an issue with that. I can see where Thesp and Farside are coming from, and that's the reason why I'm townreading them both at the moment, but I'm surprised that of all the players in here, I am the one that came out the scummiest. The whole deflecting questions thing is a good reason to start pressuring me, but I don't see the scumminess in it. I try to make sure that people don't forget about other stuff when they are tunnelling on me and I still try to answer any question people have as good as I possibly can.<br><br>Anyway, my final reads are from town to scum: Squirrel Girl - Farside - Thesp - 4nxi3ty - DBK - TrevorP - Pisskop - Garmr - Neil - Lobster - SiX - Bjc"}

I'm happy enough that Farside is also happy with your lynch, but I have reasons for it as well. I tend to town read BJC for the reasons I stated earlier, I don't think his playstyle feels like he has scumbuddies. Yes, he has aggressively wagoned pretty much everyone...I think that's because he practically doesn't care who is lynched. That makes him town or 3rd party to my mind.

TvK is basically assured dead at this point unless a sudden strong counter wagon shows up. Of TvK's scumreads, the only one I'd support is SiX, who is also a pretty solid town read for me. You seem to really not want TvK lynched, but also appear to townread SiX - as you answer my question about SiX could you also assess your willingness to vote SiX as a 'save TvK' move? Because I would probably vote SiX over TvK, but I can't see any other slot I would make the same claim about - and unless people who oppose TvK are willing to move to SiX I'm not sure what wagon is likely to appear to prevent the lynch."}

Again, not buying it.<br>Is playing in a way to specifically avoid giving reads on others, even TvK has been more forthcoming than him.<br>Yet he also claims that attacks and defenses are what will be able to be read later to figure out scum/towniness - meaning he knows he's playing in a way to make himself hard to read and is okay with that.<br><br>Got a nut for me to chew over as regards those two?"}

Before BJC, quick hammering wasn't talked about. But it was before TvK.<br><br>Also you have to take into consideration two different playing styles. And the fact that it was at two different points of the day. If scum TvK is watching town go in circles, it would be smart play to let the town continue down the wifom path of hell instead of ending it and giving them time to think about it. BJC's playing style imo is not that smart. For BJC, quick hammering on himself as scum would be the optimal play I would assume he would do given his play-style / meta research. TvK on the other hand, I would give credit to as scum and assume he would play it out instead of self-hammering. TvK is not a VI, by any means.<br><br>It's all about reading playing styles and how people act / respond when they post. Two seemingly same actions, can create two very different perceptions.

In post 140 pisskop complains about the discussions at that time, that it was too tunnely. So why didn't you call them out or try to change the subject?<br>3. The whole SG meta thingy. First calling her out for a different meta, than comparing it to her scum game, but still on the fench. When caled out by SG after she showed her games, he drops it, without having looked at it. And last he has looked it and is not fully convinced, but drops it anyway for different reasons.<br><br>DBK<br>1. Agreed with SG's twitch. You wanted to know bjc's suspicions, but the way he answered it, you knew nothing. Only when pointed out, you wanted to know more. So what did you learn from bjc's original answers? And in post 92, you explained a thought proces which I disagree with. True, when someone attacks a player, he should be able to explain it to players who don't understand. But players who disagree with the attack should be able to explain why it's not scummy.By using this, you gave TvK a free pass.<br>2. I missed it myself, but I'm glad SG and Farside pointed it out (the neil vote, whike having TvK as town for not voting neil). Post 380 is the 'explanation'. I find it scummy as it's a 'oh, you are right. Thanks for pointing it out'. There's no sincereness in it. Also, bjc was at L-1. Why didn't you ask for a claim?<br>Continuing, instead of the 'oh, I was wrong', it's changed into an attack against TvK, without looking back at the time he townread TvK. And even worse, a list of scummy players, without the reason as he'd be attacked by Farside (boo), but still no explanation.<br><br>Trevor<br>1. Attacks thesp for not explaining his vote (which he did in a later post) and SG for sheeping (while she explained her reads and was looking at bjc with the comment). It seriously makes me wonder if he has read anything instead of taking things out of context.<br>2. Another post about thesp and SG. Trevor finds thesp's obv-town on SG scummy as it looks buddy-buddy and he knows SG is town due to it, but trevor has both thesp and SG as scummy. This is not how it works.<br><br><br>Six, domo and thesp are null-town. I need to see more from them as they haven't posted much (six and domo) or ignoring important things (thesp).<br>Which is why I'll get back to Thesp later.<br><br>bjc, anxiety, farside and SG look town to me.

Pre-game. I disagree with you fence-sitting on thesp, but you did fence-sit on pisskop in post 24. And in response you ask him questions which had nothing to do with you being uncomfortable. Strange for someone who said to Farside that you'd keep duscussing when someone bothers you. And one of the questions is weird. You asked pisskop what he'd do not to get caught tunneling again. When you answered this question, you answered what you'd do not to tunnel (post 80). That's not what you asked though.<br>Post 80 is also scummy. First a 'smart' answer: 'if you think i'm scum, your vote is on the right player'. And secondly, the feeling I get. You point things out, instead of discussing things. If we look at your points against farside or me, we get a very aggressive side with discussion. Not this.<br>2. Post 134 shows another 'pass'. Bjc is scummy for pushing players, but pisskop is town for pushing. And no, your playstyle argument won't work as defence. Here, you also mention meta on bjc. That he's different. And you're on the fence. Last, boo snarky comment on post 137.<br>3. Post 201 is bad. First of, bjc is pushing players (attacking others) and defending himself. How's that thinking about yourself? This is how most players act when scumhunting ._. And your questions are bad. The questions towards trevor and farside say nothing about their allignment as it's not looking into their reads. Lobster's question is whom we should focus on? It's like you want 1 player to get the attention. And last, six. He was attacked for not giving reads. But after that he hadn't posted. Of course, he couldn't respond. But when he's back, you barely mention him if you mention him at all.<br>4. Post 232 ilooks also to be a 'point-out' post. My gut tingles everytime I read this post.<br>5. The Farside discussions. If you want I can give examples. And what i pointed out yesterday.<br><br>TvK<br>1. Post 37 in which you respond to Thesp's vote. It's very overdefensive. Especially as you respond to Thesp, but vote pisskop instead. And the reason you give is different than what I see. Pisskop was looking into neil and you call it fluff. Also, it was shown that TA had more votes than pisskop, who you didn't like for the same reason you didn't like pisskop.<br>2. Next posts 51/52. First, why would bjc 'threaten' you to vote neil as scum? But more interesting is the last bit. Why mention that you don't find neil scummy, so you're going to vote someone else? That's just normal... and 52 is defensive evasiness again.<br>3. And again, pointing to others in post 263. Farside has stated why she doesn't like you and votes you. There can be multiple reasons why she likes you more for scum than her other suspects. The same happens with Neil VS bjc. Just because they discuss, doesn't mean they are each other top suspects.<br>4. The null-town thesp... you make a big deal out of thesp not discussing his targets and his vote on you, but he's null-town. Why? <br>5. Post 416, 482 and 508 are a combo. First, you unvote bjc. Because you don't feel comfortable being one of the few votes with 2 'lurkers'. But with this argument, you should have been on the right wagon as he was almost lynched, right? Other than that, you mention the sheeperz in post 482, so it seemed you wanted to look at them. But in post 508 you go back to bjc, without looking anyone (except six).<br>6. You commented that bjc was keeping his options open with all his targets. In post 548 you mention 5 players to look at. Is this the same as bjc or does it all change, because bjc actually voted them?<br><br>P.S. apparently, my iso numbers don't always match. In those cases, use my numbers - 1 for the real number."}

The program ignores votes without a colon in them, and really likes seeing \"official\" vote tags. This is just a favor, and will not affect how scummy you actually happen to be.

How is threatening someone to vote someone ever town, except if you've got a guilty on someone? The last part is simple. Bjc wanted me to vote Neil. I said I didn't scumread Neil.

That doesn't answer how it comes from scum <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> the opposite of doing something towny, is doing something anti-town. And anti-town isn't scummy perse. So I want you to answer this part again.<br>And the last part was something weird. I got what made you say it. I don't get why anyone would say that. If you think someone isn't scummy, you'd of course vote someone else.<br><br>3. You weren't asking why farside was scumreading you. You were asking why farside wasn't scumreading other players. That's a huge difference. The first is normal, it's to get an explanation. The second is either an attack or a deflection. As you state yiu're town-reading farside, then I read how you decide not to respond to farside, but try to get her attention somewhere else.<br>I'll look later where you mentioned that you thought bjc and neil had each other as top suspects.<br><br>4. Easy question: were you satisfied with thesp's opinion? If not, we also get back to this point. Especially as I never got the impression that you thought thesp was null-town.<br><br>5. But you never looked at the sheepers. This is a huge point as I've barely got the impression that you have been scumhunting. The only one I thought 'well done' was Thesp's not posting an opinion. But you state that he's null-town. And this adds with 6. You mentioned bjc (whom you have questioned), pisskop (you may explain why), six (sheeping SG), garmr (nothing) and thesp (light town-read? Not in post 271) but you did nothing."}

This is demonstrated by her twice (that I've seen) not taking the opportunity to scumread someone when she would be justified in doing so. Scum simply do not do that because they need mislynches. Squirrels' first post is a wall, I mean what is scumhunting if it's not reading the thread, quoting, asking questions, responding to questions etc. I don't see squirrel constantly defending herself, she's making clear who she finds scummy and why. <br><br>You're saying I'm not posting content, you're saying squirrel isn't scumhunting, you are basically full of shit and I find it incredible that there's not enough support for your lynch today.<br><br>Why is #59 weak?

It feels like frustration that he doesn't think he'll ever be able to get me lynched. (I acknowledge there may be OMGUS in this - I don't have any way to divorce myself from such thoughts.

('This one was eaten by the Great Board OM NOM of '014.) He expressed some uncertainty with me, but didn't actually vote me until he thought I'd left his vote against me off an unofficial votecount I'd posted. That seems a weird straw to break the camel's back.</li><li>I really, really don't like the DOMO vote. Especially when we're 2 days from a deadline and he's the only one on it. He's abandoning the TvK lynch. At the point he unvoted, there were 5 voters on TvK, as neil1113 had unvoted to make sure we got an official votecount, and expressed how he thought TvK was still likely to be scum. pisskop's vote shift moved it down to 4, while he said \"Still want TvK\". Does Bo Know moves off of TvK (and onto pisskop) thereafter, TvK then hops back on, and bjc joins Does Bo Know in moving to pisskop, and the TvK wagon falters. I am still pondering what that means in the grand scheme of things.</li><li>As implied in the post just prior to this, I am not comfortable with how TvK has gone from wanting a TvK lynch in #731 to predicting how obviously bad a TvK lynch will be in #805.</li></ul><br>There are things about him that make me think he could be town. (He does seem to be working hard on reads and meta.) Yet in all this, I find that outweighed by other factors I can't seem to ignore.<br><br>I'm happy with my vote.

Re: our off-voters, TrevorP hasn't posted in over a week, neil1113 is MIA, TvK is only posting just now, and SiX seems to have no desire to vote for anyone with more than 1 vote on them (despite his desire to see <span style=\"font-style: italic\">someone's</span> death for information). <span class=\"noboldsig\">Let's get to lynching, people.</span>"}

Pisskop noted the absence of his name. Thesp basically asked him what scumvantage he could possibly have in \"forgetting\" the vote. Pisskop's stated reasoning that I will admit that I don't recall well, but it was certainly along the lines of 'presenting false information' or something like that. Thesp literally did nothing else new or exciting in the missing posts, so if Pisskop *didn't* vote him for that reason then he must have voted him for the reasoning of his previous case on him and just randomly chose to do it at that time - which I don't particularly believe. I think he found something pseudo-surface scummy and opted to call Thesp on it and place a vote for the sake of appearing to scumhunt."}

I'm rambling? I just say it as I see it. You say you don't want to get personal, then you say stuff like this. I think you're scum dude, or at least I did until you claimed. And if you're not, then you have a very scummy town game which I assume is deliberate so you can play like this as scum.

DBK's claim might be a little spewy but whatever, vig can be bad as well as good so I'm not worried about it effecting our chances of winning.

I think TvK and neil1113 are each likelier to be scum than most other players. (I haven't examined whether this would be true together.) I think a TvK lynch is more likely to be securable, given the wagon that was on him previously. (There's also some very real concern I have with not wanting to pressure claims out of so many players today.) I am willing to pressure-to-lynch neil1113, though I think TvK is a better lynch today."}

Since jmo16mla set up the opening post with the correct votecounter info (other than a typo in Kreacher's name that I supplied to him), he can create up-to-date votecounts at that link. Feel free to check it out occasionally, but please don't repeatedly refresh it, as it crawls the game since Day 2 every time it's loaded (which can get intensive as the day grows).<br><br>And now, back to waiting for DisCode/SiX/Kreacher to return to action. =P"}

Well, obviously. But what's your best guess as to which is correct? Without indicating which one you think is more likely, your observation is worthless.<br><br>I understand reticence to be wrong. I really do. But you're not doing anything. At all. In Mafia, you've got to make some best guesses. And sometimes you're going to be wrong, it just comes with the territory. But if you never put yourself in a position where you might be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">wrong</span>, you're never going to be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">right</span>. Bandwagons don't form themselves. You've got to make best guesses and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do something</span>. It's hard to believe that at this point in the game, you can't make a best guess about someone. Why aren't you in a \"position to point fingers\"? How can you get in a position to point fingers? Isn't pointing fingers pretty much this whole game?"}

But I WIFOM living players like that when I'm scum, so at that point there becomes a debate as to which of us is closer to \"normal\" in attitude there, and in addition which of us is closer to however Pisskop plays if he's scum.

What I did do is look at Neil. I think the biggest stand out for me is that Neil bothered to try to paint a scum team connection of Thesp, Terminal Apathy, and Pisskop. Now, we're pretty sure TA is scum. I think it's unlikely that Neil would paint this picture with two scumbuddies.

Killing her would be of a huge benefit to them. Even I can say that why should they bother killing the vig when they laugh right at your faces seeing who you even consider to shoot?

However, analyzing the current round's kill further I think I've figured out what the real case was. I at least would never shooten Squirrel Girl if it would have putten me under suspicion and I'm sure even a child could understand that. Feels to me like some mafias are included in the current bandwagon which have risen up after Squirrel's death to get either me or Pisskop killed."}

As I've explained in other games a good way for a scum to begin is to make prank wagons where he would go unnoticed regardless if the wagon fails or succeeds.<br>On the same time I also questioned Neil's play to remain objective in the case since it was TOO early to decide at that point who were a wolf. I asked people to provide a background check on Neil's former games to compare them to his current play since people seemed to question him - Yet this never happened and I dropped the case when other things caught my interests.<br><br>The arguement between Neil and Bjc could in my opinion very well have been a chit chat inbetween them since this is something I've experienced in former games aswell. Two wolves bandwaging each other and the survivor remains as a sort of village hero. This is something I'd like you guys to take into consideration.<br><br>At the time I also questioned Bjc's play where he ALL THE TIME suddenly switched his vote from one person to another. He layed a vote and he withdrew a vote way too easy. Feels like he was going around seeing who he can strike down.<br><br>Afterwards I ended up in an arguement with <span class=\"noboldsig\">Squirrel Girl</span> accusing me of logicless reasons. Such as that my behaviour is too passive for a player coming from a Speedplay forum, Geezus.<br>For her to use such plain reasons as a reason to get me killed and in addition her stubborness smelled either wolfish or an idiot to town to me.<br><br>After DOMO's death my suspicions were at <span class=\"noboldsig\">Thesp</span>, Bjc and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pisskop</span>. DOMO protected Neil and could very well have been a posible lynch but instead he ended up shot. Why?<br>DOMO suspected all three of them to be potential mafias so either did someone set up a trap killing DOMO to intentionally put suspicion on them, OR some of those 3 felt threatened by DOMO's accusions. Here again Bjc is, the one I've suspected from time to time.<br><br>Last night I also had suspicion on <span class=\"noboldsig\">DBK</span> either being the Serial killer or if he really was the Vigilante. Let us not forget that you Farside were the one who suggested him to shoot Thesp who ended up as a villager. Personally I'm glad it was your suggestion over Squirrel Girl's, seeing both of you are seeming as core town players to me (I changed my mind about Squirrel later after examining her play closer). If there are a sort of peeker role such as the Deputy, I'd highly recommended to check it out.<br><br>This round Squirrel Girl got shot and Bjc was the first one to start his stubborn sherlock investigation on me with the majority being similar to DOMO's and the 3 Players case but in difference he didn't lift a finger trying to investigate that but when it's no longer related to him though the background of both Nightkills were the same he directly jumped on me having that + Other stupid reasons that when I tried to do a little research for once but ended up misunderstanding his content as a reason to get me killed.<br><br>So here you have my reads: Bjc, Neil, Thesp, Squirrel Girl are my scum read. Thesp, Squirrel girl cleared as town. Neil cleared as Scum. Bjc remains and scuum + DBK as SK:"}

It means Bjc could try to still follow his \"SiX&gt;Anxiety\" chain lynch with another reason.<br>- Ultimately, I forgot why Bjc was town, so I'll have to read Pisskop's reasons; I just dismissed that Bjc was town because Pisskop gave enough of a damn to defend him.<br><br>I don't know whom out of Anxiety/SiX the other one is.

Bjc is Town, SiX is mafia<br>- Bjc and I are both voting for Anxiety.<br>- That would make 1 more mafia somewhere out who could <br>A.) Vote Bjc to kill a villager.<br>B.)

He was obviously recruited by the Neighborizor and a main role amongst the village corporation.<br>Yet he's allowed to <span class=\"noboldsig\">chat with the Neighborizor</span> all night long to plan the next day, and heck even killing <span class=\"noboldsig\">2 Villagers</span> at a so early point where nothing was clear. Heck, he claimed Vigilante Round 1 when he yet didn't need to (5 was on lynching him).<br><br>On the same accord it also surprises me about <span class=\"noboldsig\">Farside not being shot.</span> Farside has imo been the <span class=\"noboldsig\">Townleader</span> throughout the game. Did the \"Vigilante\" not require killing her, due to the posibility of using her?<br>Or is it that the \"Vigilante\" is actually the Vigilante and the Neighborizor is a scum neighborizor taking advantage of the kills being made. Eg the suggestion of Thesp's death.<br><br>It's too freaking obvious this, yet it's too chaotic to figure out who's the mafia. Just as Bjc, I've been set up throughout the game. This isn't an excuese for my wrongful leads against eg Anxiety last round which was proven tonight.<br>Also, the Villager out there. Keep in mind that the following:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia shooting Anxiety</span> - Good, easier lynching Six over Anxiety.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia shooting SiX</span> - Bad, Six would be the winning mislynch since he's been suspected for a while just like Bjc.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia shooting the fellow Neighborizor</span> - Bad, he needs him / her to lynch SiX.<br><br>Throughout the game both of you have also lead multiple villagers to their deaths through lynching. The death on Neil was firstly(Good) voted by Farside but the <span class=\"noboldsig\">L-A-S-T(Bad)</span> vote were put by DBK. Did he posible wait to see what would come out of it but at last decided to put the vote? The villagers: Eg Kreacher R2, Huntress R3 and although I should mention Bjc at R4 I'm not going to be a hypocrite here since I tried the same the round before.<br><br>I really hope that the the last villager will make the right choice here..."}

(Though admittedly, since pisskop was pretty open about people he didn't trust who were also likely to be town, as well as who his very town reads were, it may have nerfed his effectiveness.) And the people who thought pisskop might be scum were the people they killed. (?)"}
