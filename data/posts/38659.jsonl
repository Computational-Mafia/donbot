I shall get to addressing everyone's concern with me, however I might skip over some that I don't feel require a response, just for the sake of not trying to leave a huge text wall for everyone to read. If there was more points against me, or something that really stood out, I'd have no problem spending my time defending against that. (P.S. It's probably going to end up a text wall anyways... sorry.)<br>\n<br>\nSo with that said, let's travel down our journey together of Page 2, 3 and 4.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>BJC wrote:</cite>What do you think of my vote, Neil?</div></blockquote>\n\nI feel like your vote isn't worth much of a response. Confirmed scum on page 1 /  2? I've never seen that happen in the history of my playing here. However, if you're so convinced that I am scum, then I think your vote is positioned correctly. Unfortunately, I have yet to see any real case you have to make, so I cannot say rather your vote is opportunistic scum, or confused villager (like I believe SiX said.)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pisskop wrote:</cite>not RQS if you only expect me to answer.<br>\n<br>\n1) I look for inconsitencies, partner interactions, and trust my gut. once it finally locks in Im sold.<br>\n2) my first game I tunneled as scum. As town I may be now. Im too paranoid to tunnel, imo. as for not getting caught, im not worried.<br>\n<br>\nwhy didnt you answer thesp's question, neil?</div></blockquote>\n\nI was planning on answering my own questions after you did. Also, as for not answering Thesp's question, it appeared he directed it towards one person in specific in a later post. I didn't really want to jump into someone else's conversation. It wasn't till later in my reread that I saw him mention being disappointed because nobody else was responding. If Thesp is still asking, I wouldn't mind answering.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my answers to my questions to you:<br>\n<br>\n1. I'd like to think my gut is just confirmation to my reads, but sometimes my gut plays a little more into my reads than actual evidence. And that can be bad, or that can be good depending on the flip. However, the one thing I would say could be a major focus when I read others posts, is the motivation aspect. Why are you (figuratively) posting what you're posting, and what do you hope to gain from it? Is the information derived from your post helpful to the town, or distracting?<br>\n<br>\n2. I've tunneled to the death of somebody that I was positive was scum, and turned out to be town... when I was town. That's a terrible feeling. Now while when I find something that catches my eye, I will attack it aggressively, I take measures to make sure I read others posts and not be isolated on just one person. I'm careful to make sure I am developing my reads, and not only confirming one.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Terminal Apathy wrote:</cite>That was more of a joke just to keep things moving, but Neil seems to have taken it a lot more seriously than I intended.</div></blockquote>\n\nI didn't really take it too serious. I questioned the intention and I questioned in my mind how quickly that wagon formed. But I was not / am not seriously concerned. Now if this was day 4 or 5 (real life, not game day) and I was the only person being questioned / looked at, then I would be concerned because then the whole town would be tunneling one person and in my experience, thats usually very ineffective and is more likely than not going to end up badly for them. In this case, knowing the alignment of the questioned, I would concur that my experience would be correct.<br>\n<br>\nI cannot read bjc. He's either pushing a really hard scum-tell, or a really hard town-tell, depending on my view of his level of intelligent play. It's really difficult for me to figure out until he posts more.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>BoKnowsSomething wrote:</cite>Did you really think I was serious when I asked you if you thought Thesp was scum?<br>\n<br>\nThis is a good wagon.</div></blockquote>\n\nWhy do you feel like I am a good wagon? And I address the question jokingly. My concern seriously, was if you were in fact being serious, which is why I addressed it in that manner. I have never played with you before, I do not know your sense of humor, and I have not done any real meta research on you yet.<br>\n<br>\nOh and another one from you:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Neil when you get the chance, mind telling us why the questions you asked recently will help you read people?<br>\n<br>\nI don't think bjc sounds desperate.</div></blockquote>\n\nSure: the first question inquires about scum hunting technique. It will help me see if you stray away from what your normal response would be to scum hunt (or you change your style) which normally would account for a lack of scum hunting. If you are not trying to hunt scum, chances are it's because you are one.<br>\n<br>\nThe second is about tunneling, and this was mostly a question that derives from previous games I have been in where I've seen tunneling end almost every time in a bad manner. I was seeing if my conclusion from my games matched others views.<br>\n<br>\nNow that I'm done with Page 2...<br>\n<br>\nThesp, in your post #54, why is your vote on TvK? Do you have actual suspicion? Or did you vote for him because you disagreed with one of his conclusions? My concern here is simple, that you're buddying / defending. A potential scum team could be seen here between yourself, Pisskop, and Terminal should one of you flip scum. Not only myself, but everyone here should make a mental note of this post for future reference.<br>\n<br>\nAnother question about your post 54 Thesp, why did you assume there was a vig?<br>\n<br>\nIn your post 60, Thesp, how / why did you draw the conclusion of THAT scum-team, rather than say, Terminal or Pisskop?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>4nxi3ty wrote:</cite>I find bjc's start to this game extremely town.</div></blockquote>\n\nReally???? You explain in a few posts later that it's because he's pushing for lynches and you wouldn't expect that from scum. Why wouldn't you expect that from scum? It seems like you're talking about a specific scum playing style, but do you not account for the many playing styles scum could potentially have? To negate playing style as a vindication for a \"town-read\" is dangerous, and almost stretching. You're definitely one of my scum reads from this post so far.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>pisskop wrote:</cite>I ignordd him until he found fault with me. because it was just RVS nonsense. until he dug hard for a fault. in RVS. <br>\n<br>\ndo you think his reaction to me is natural and unforced?</div></blockquote>\n\nYou mean, I questioned your response in an RVS post. I challenged you from it to help promote discussion. Do you think that would constitute as a scum-tell, and if so, why would scum push the RVS period past where it was at that point by challenging you? Just curious to see where you're coming from here.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>SiX wrote:</cite>My main question is however, how many mafias are there supposed to be?<br>\nFrom former experiences the ratio tends to be approximately 1:4.</div></blockquote>\n\nIn my own experience, as a heads up, speculating on roles (unless the Mod posts them as an open game), can be dangerous. Especially in desperate situations, and you convince yourself say there are 3 mafia and there are actually 4, then you could wind up trusting a mafia member and be swayed in very wrong paths. Mislynches can be caused pretty simply by mis-speculating the roles. I'm sure others might have differing views, but that's my own.<br>\n<br>\nAs for TvK, in your post #37 (found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5686300#p5686300\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>) while I enjoy the fact that you called out Thesp for not using his vote now that we are out of the RVS stage:<br>\n<br>\n(Which Thesp, if you're reading this, I'd like an answer to that question. Why did you originally withhold your vote? You had to have read the question, because it wasn't shortly after, in fact it was your very next post, that you placed it. So why did you ignore the question?)<br>\n<br>\nIt seemed like you were trying desperately to get the attention off of you and onto anybody and anyone else that could possible have been a viable lynch subject. Doing so, instead of actually addressing why his mindset on you was off (or further questioning it.) Why did you cast suspicion onto so many different people? Was it truly because you were curious about his motives in not liking you comparatively?<br>\n<br>\nIn your post #51, you change your vote to Bjc. While I understand your reason for doubting his town-alignment, he's given you that reason way before you placed your vote for Pisskop. It was the same Bjc that started at the beginning with his VI tendencies that showed up after you placed your vote. What did Bjc do to solidify that vote? Was it the quote you posted about him threating either you join him on his quick lynch, or you're scum? My concern: That you're taking an easy vote route. It's not hard to make a case for Bjc, but is it because he's scum or VI town? That's the decision I'm having troubles making, and one you should consider. If you have a response that can shed light on that question, I'd love to hear it.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, if I missed anyone's post or question to me, which is entirely possible, feel free to resubmit it to me. As for my vote, I'm not sure if I'm more comfortable voting TVK, 4nxi3ty, Pisskop, or Thesp.

First, I didn't say you mentioned \"playing styles.\" I stated it seemed like your basis of your stance was ON a playing style. Secondly:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>4nxi3ty wrote:</cite>@DBK: yeah <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">he's proactive in pushing people and taking stances</div>, not what I would expect from him if he were scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nYou very much did talk about him pushing people. Pushing people is what he was doing in fact, and by pushing people, he pushed lynches. By PoE, in order to address his \"pushing of people\" you'd have to be addressing his \"pushing of lynches\" as well.<br>\n<br>\n2. I already explained why it was dangerous.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>me wrote:</cite> It seems like you're talking about a specific scum playing style, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">do you not account for the many playing styles</div> scum could potentially have?</div></blockquote>\n\nIt's dangerous because if that is your train of thought, you're not accounting for different playing styles. You're assuming all scum play one singular way and follow one singular train of thinking.<br>\n<br>\nYour entire post #88 is the biggest fluff vote I have ever seen in my life. This is opportunistic scum. And you've confirmed my scum read on you.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Squirrel wrote:</cite>2. Why was BJC easier for you to get a familiar read on than, say, anyone else? I'm basically asking because I do see scum apply town reads to town players too easily sometimes because,w ell, they already know said player is town. I kind of feel you're doing this and are being dodgy in even explaining where the read came from and how in the first place which is adding to the feeling. Am I nutty or no?</div></blockquote>\n\nSquirrel also pointed out an excellent point that helps confirm my read as well. You've made a very fast conclusion about judging BJC as town, and when I went to question you (the one time I did), your very next post was a vote on me. I took a note of your post responding to Squirrel, and you basically admited it could look like that, and there's nothing you can do about it. You didn't even try to defend it.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: 4nxi3ty</span><br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DBK wrote:</cite>I still don't get how the second question helps find scum, unless you weren't trying to find scum with it?</div></blockquote>\n\nI wasn't trying to find scum with that question, admittedly it was specifically for my own train of thinking. I was wondering how other people dealt with it, as through my reread of my plays in other games, I was looking more for ways to improve in that area.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DBK wrote:</cite>I kinda defended TvK when BJC suspected him, but you didn't address that yet. Why?</div></blockquote>\n\nBJC has suspected multiple people, and judging based off of his play, will continue to do so throughout the entire game. I'll be shocked if we get to the end, and he hasn't called everyone here scum. His opinions right now, do not warrant much of a defense.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DBK wrote:</cite>Baaaaaaaa</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't understand your vote post? Is that your reasoning behind your vote? The reason I'm even more confused is this post:<br>\n<br>\n[quote=\"DBK]TvK isn't scum to me right now because he probably would've been safer leaving his vote on obvious-wagon Neil than going against it.[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nThat's a town-tell. Yet you have your vote on me. I don't understand.<br>\n<br>\nDuring my read through, I see Squirrel and BJC both made this point as well. BJC finding and being able to make this point shows me he's not a VI, and he's not stupid. This scares me, and should scare anyone assuming he wouldn't be \"smart\" enough to go and attack everyone and call everyone scum if he was scum... in fact, that could be very good play. (I've done it before, and it got us the win.)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>pisskop wrote:</cite>Im actually wary of bjc. A very strong start from him. And the sheepdog hasn't done that around me before.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is exactly what I was thinking and why I don't read BJC as simply town. 1. A lot of people assume playing styles, and that is their justification for their town read. That is simply a false method to approach systematically finding scum. 2. BJC was not like this in any of his other games, Meta wise.<br>\n<br>\nAfter all of this, I still don't know how to read BJC. I go one way or the other. As for pisskop, he appears to be town-motivated with his questioning and his pushing. I've lost my scum-read on him, so for the moment he reads null-town. I've also looked at Pisskop's points, he's really not trying to stretch anything to make a point known, which shows me he's not looking to just bury anyone. That's definitely not scum-motivated.<br>\n<br>\nWith all that I've said, my vote stays where it is because he's my biggest scum-read right now.", "time": "Sat Feb 15, 2014 1:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=38659&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "38659"}

Contradiction? No. I am not justifying a read of anything on you, because of your playing style. Hence the fact that I cannot read you yet, (which you've conveniently ignored in trying to twist what I said). Using your play and pointing out that it is invalidating your opinion to have any real backbone or pressure, is not the same as comparing your play being town or scum aligned. Contradicting? No.<br>\n<br>\n2. Your playing style is definitely different, regardless. Bullcrap? No. But you're right, I should not have brought that point up seeing in order to prove it, I'd have to break the laws of the site. Which I won't be doing.<br>\n<br>\n3. I wasn't comparing which was worse, this point is addressing points that neither I, nor ANYBODY has made. This is yet another comparison of yours that has no substance and is literally \"made-up.\" It's not about which is worse, it's the idea of a quick-lynch with no substance behind the lynch (or in other words, that would provide little to no evidence) is in no way a town-favored move. Eliminating a townie with no information behind their lynch to go with it, will only help serve the scum's win con, not the town's.<br>\n<br>\n4. No misrepresentation noted. Everything I said, was either quotes from you (and posted under your quotes for the pure fact of making sure it wasn't misrepped) or it was me addressing what you said. No offense, but you can't really misrep something that you put in front of EVERYONE to see. Are you really this naive?<br>\n<br>\nAs for another point you made that I didn't bother to quote just because it's laughable, is \"do you think I'm stupid?\"<br>\n<br>\nDid you actually read my post? I stated that I thought you were SMART... and it scared me on my read of you. Since you like to point out \"contradictions\" why don't you point out the only one that really WAS made?

I've been scum, and I've done the very thing BJC is doing (even with better points, made-up as they might have been) so I can personally say, playing style has a lot to do with it. And to me, playing style (not meta, but general playing style) is neither a scum nor town tell by itself. I say that so that to slow those who have BJC as a town because of his own playing style not matching up with what you would assume the \"normal\" scum style is, and get them to rethink their play.

My exacts words were: \"A \"weak vote\" by your definition is on you, and you're paranoid about a mislynch, yet you throw your votes around (and were at the beginning specifically) like it was no ones business, and you weren't nearly seemingly as paranoid putting the votes on others, as you are someone putting them on you.\"<br>\n<br>\nThat's exactly what happened. \"He said experience alone wasn't enough to lynch, but enough to vote me which could turn into a mislynch.\" You have one vote on you from him, to worry about a mislynch (which you need 7 votes for it to be a lynch) is a pretty big stretch. Why would you be worried about a mislynch? Unless you're paranoid. That is a logical conclusion drawn from a logical hypothesis made with the basis of the evidence given to me in your posts.<br>\n<br>\nI said you're considering his reasoning behind voting you weak, (hence what a weak vote is...), and you're worried about a mislynch. Which is hypocritical, because all you've given the entire time you've been in this game are weak votes, and you weren't worried about mislynches then? Paranoia at it's finest. I didn't misrepresent you, I said exactly what you said, and then I responded to it. You truly are remarkable at trying to say people are misrepping you. I quoted <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">YOUR OWN FREAKING WORDS</div> and responded accordingly. I didn't misrep anything. Even Pisskop saw through your little charade of pretending. You're remarkable.<br>\n<br>\nAnd oh, you want me to clarify something BJC says? That's going to be impossible, as nobody can follow his logic. As I said before, it's coming from either a VI, or a stupid scum.

Because that's <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">MY WIN CONDITION</div>. I understand you're not town this game, but think back to a game that you were town. Have you ever been town? Maybe that's why you don't know what the town's win condition is... 2. Insulting me, calling me a little kid, is not going to validate (or invalidate) what you said, and how I exposed you in any way... 3. I'm sure the others will see it. Which is why I changed my vote, I'm ready for you to be lynched and be gone. That simple. I never stated they weren't quality players... I don't get that add-on unless it's filler to try to make others assume I said the opposite? You know, that's called manipulation.

Or is a Vig and shoots you thinking you're scum faking Vig when otherwise they would have thought you as town?

(I scientifically calculated that amount of scum increase through exacting experiments.) I could totally go with TrevorP as scum, but I'm doubtful of all 3 of TvK/4nxi3ty/TrevorP being scum, because I don't think 4nxi3ty would mention two scum buddies (and only two people) in an early post like that. Garmr comes off as incredibly weird to me, and would be next on the scum list (if not higher, actually - I'm more interested in the aforementioned connections with other players, and I don't see a Garmr connection with anyone, though I think he's reasonably likely to be a baddie).

What did they say that you see as scum arguing? Why did you not answer this question:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In your experience does scum talk more or less?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>\n\nI thought I answered it by saying that you can't determine alignment from quantity. It's all about what people say that I'm looking at. Although I do tend to get scumreads on absolute lurkers. Why I think they are scum arguing? Because Bjc had his vote on Neil (could be scum distancing from buddy), calls him outright scum (not even possible scum, or nullscum) and a couple of posts later just unvotes him to vote DBK, even though Neil was still on top of his lynch pool. Calls \"I just want to go with the highest bidder\" as an excuse to unvote again. Right after another argument with Neil he says that he \"looks better\", without giving reasons and goes on to vote me (while I still thought that I was scum for not joining the Neil wagon, but feel free to find his real reasons...). Some time later, around post #201, Neil is so called misrepping Bjc again, but still he sees no reason to move his vote from me (I'd love to hear reasoning) to Neil. And he even calls Pisskop obsessed with him, but that's also a lot less worse than the apparent reasons that he's voting me for.<br>\n<br>\nThen from the other side. Neil starts off saying that Bjc's initial vote doesn't mean much. Then goes on to vote 4nxi3ty because he's opportunistic scum (didn't think much of reasoning back then). Next, his argument with Bjc starts and goes on for a couple of pages. All this time it seems like he's scumreading Bjc, but still he holds his vote on 4nxi3ty, who he hasn't mentioned since the time he voted him, only saying he likes his vote. Then later he sees his chance to hop onto the Bjc wagon, saying that he finally became his top scumread because of OMGUS? I constantly have the feeling that their argument is fabricated.<br>\n<br>\nNow that I'm looking at Bjc's ISO again, it strikes me that Bjc is doing pretty much what you're accusing me of. Nothing and then hardcore defending when he gets voted. Also, Bjc doesn't answer my questions, so I don't see any reason why I should answer his.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5696125#p5696125\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5696125#p5696125\" data-post-id=\"5696125\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 272</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>tvk wrote:</cite>THen once again, discussion between Neil and Bjc starts.

Going back to asking why someone else is asking questions and discussing why he is asking questions about someone asking questions is still fluff to me.

I have seen scum who try to lead the town, I have seen scum that lurk throughout the entire game. Same for town.<br>\n<br>\nObviously, I have seen many players call others outright scum, whether they backed it up by a solid case or not. I've seen both town do that to town or scum do that to their buddies. But when someone does that on page 2 of a game, I'm inclined to raise my eyebrows.<br>\n<br>\nI do not really think that switching your vote around a lot is a scumtell, as long as I can see the town motivation on the reasoning behind it.<br>\n<br>\nOfcourse I am concerned that Bjc is voting me. But I am a lot more concerned that some of the players I don't think are scum are voting me. And I really want to point out to them why Bjc is scum.<br>\n<br>\nYes, there are people that forget to change their votes, but that's just incredibly sloppy or bad play.

Both are incredibly anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not trying to deflect accusations. I'm trying to stop people from tunnelling on me. Tunnelling is anti-town in my opinion. I hate it when other players are allowed a free pass because the town leaders are focusing on the wrong player. I really don't mind you attacking me. What I do mind is that you're only attacking me. Not because I hate pressure, but because it takes pressure off people that need to be pressured.<br>\n<br>\nI also thought a big part of your case against me was that I didn't answer questions and only attacked people.

Also Garmr. I think I'd still be down with the TvK lynch. I hated Pisskop's move and would be down with his lynch as well. I think a BTC lynch is sillybad. I'd also be okay with the idea of a TrevorP lynch, though it's mostly for bad reading comprehension, but my thought is that maybe it was scummily skimming.

I believe Bjc is scum, for simply pushing people to follow his ideas without giving reasoning and when asked to form a case or something, he calls laziness as an excuse. From that point of view, I am trying to look at interactions. And I find the discussion between him and Neil odd. So, the bottomline is that I think Bjc is scum.

But I don't see how facts are the right things to look at here. Every game of mafia is different. You cannot say that the game where you and Fitz had an argument can be used as a fact that there will be a big town vs town argument in this game as well. If mafia was in theory a game you could play using facts, than the outcome would be the same in every game. I don't really believe in facts. Instead, I offer you my opinion. With which you disagree. Fair enough, I have noticed that am unable to convince you of my opinion. Does me having a different opinion make me scum? I don't think so.<br>\n<br>\nYou do see someone who is frustrated, indeed. I hate it that I have 5 votes on me. I especially hate Pisskop's vote. But you shouldn't only look at me for the case on Bjc. There are four others that are voting Bjc as well. You will call this deflecting again, and I don't care anymore if you would, but this is my playstyle and I'm going to keep doing it. If you need more insight on the Bjc case, than I'm afraid I won't be able to help you any more than I have already done, and I request you to ask any other player voting Bjc why they are doing so.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Garmr made the initial push to get out of RVS.

I think TvK is more likely to be scum than 4nxi3ty, but if TvK is scum, the likelihood of 4nxi3ty being scum triples. (I scientifically calculated that amount of scum increase through exacting experiments.) I could totally go with TrevorP as scum, but I'm doubtful of all 3 of TvK/4nxi3ty/TrevorP being scum, because I don't think 4nxi3ty would mention two scum buddies (and only two people) in an early post like that. Garmr comes off as incredibly weird to me, and would be next on the scum list (if not higher, actually - I'm more interested in the aforementioned connections with other players, and I don't see a Garmr connection with anyone, though I think he's reasonably likely to be a baddie). I don't have strong scum reads on anyone else - notably I have more town-reads than scum-feels so far.<br>\n<br>\n(As an aside, I apologize to anyone for the misspelling I've been doing so far of various screennames - I'm trying to keep them consistent, but I have not always been successful at it.)</div></blockquote>\n\nThis kind of post is ergh.  He drops just enough information to justify his reads and then some more nonsense (yes, imo nonsense) about the likelihood of a scumbuddy defense.

Just like I don't have anything specific against Lobster, but I'm also crazy paranoid every time he posts something. Why would I like to have you vigged? Because of my two top scumreads, you and Bjc, it's not looking like you are going to be the one lynched today. I hope SiX's activity will get better, especially if he makes it through the night, because he promised to provide a lot more input once the first day was over.

You have at least put some decent heat on me and I can at least follow your logic in moving your vote to DBK. But all the others were just like \"oh farside moved her vote, let's sheep\".

I was not really talking about people following you to DBK, but more about the people that were pressuring me when you were pressuring me. When you moved to another target, suddenly all the heat was off me. That' strikes me as odd. After all, scum love to just follow the town leaders around as quietly as possible.<br>\n<br>\nMy scum suspects are Bjc and Pisskop for the reason I listed above, plus the reasons I gave before about why I think Bjc is scum. He's done practically nothing that would change my mind about him. And actually, I'm having very bad feelings about SiX as well. Squirrel Girl brings up some really good points and I'm definitely willing to follow her on this. Also, I would love to see Garmr do somewhat more than what he's doing right now. I'm definitely wary about Thesp as well, he's coasting way too much. Neil, Anxiety, Lobster and Trevor are null.

I don't have a single clue how he went from sitting at L-1 to not being suspicious anymore. He didn't change the way he was playing, he's been scummy all game long. And the last time I pointed this out again (post is temporarily gone), he angrily shouted at me that I should stop whining about his playstyle and that I should just go on and die. Neil even said something about scum anger in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=336#p336\">#336</a>, and once again, this might just be me, but that sounded a lot like Example 2.

I have no idea how Pisskop and DBK find enough evidence to vote me in my 100% town meta. And hell, I don't have a single clue why Bjc is on me, but this town doesn't seem too have an issue with that. I can see where Thesp and Farside are coming from, and that's the reason why I'm townreading them both at the moment, but I'm surprised that of all the players in here, I am the one that came out the scummiest. The whole deflecting questions thing is a good reason to start pressuring me, but I don't see the scumminess in it. I try to make sure that people don't forget about other stuff when they are tunnelling on me and I still try to answer any question people have as good as I possibly can.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, my final reads are from town to scum: Squirrel Girl - Farside - Thesp - 4nxi3ty - DBK - TrevorP - Pisskop - Garmr - Neil - Lobster - SiX - Bjc", "time": "Wed Feb 26, 2014 6:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=38659&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "38659"}

I'm happy enough that Farside is also happy with your lynch, but I have reasons for it as well. I tend to town read BJC for the reasons I stated earlier, I don't think his playstyle feels like he has scumbuddies. Yes, he has aggressively wagoned pretty much everyone...I think that's because he practically doesn't care who is lynched. That makes him town or 3rd party to my mind.

Normally when I call someone out, especially if that person \"bothers me\", I'll make sure and put pressure on them, then continue to do so throughout my next post(s) to that person until I am satisfied.

Especially if said things contributed to a \"bothersome\" read... which I don't get it. Why not just call it scum? Why \"bothersome?\" Are you purposefully not taking a stance strongly, so you can have wiggle room to ease out of suspicion when you're inevitably wrong?

Before BJC, quick hammering wasn't talked about. But it was before TvK.<br>\n<br>\nAlso you have to take into consideration two different playing styles. And the fact that it was at two different points of the day. If scum TvK is watching town go in circles, it would be smart play to let the town continue down the wifom path of hell instead of ending it and giving them time to think about it. BJC's playing style imo is not that smart. For BJC, quick hammering on himself as scum would be the optimal play I would assume he would do given his play-style / meta research. TvK on the other hand, I would give credit to as scum and assume he would play it out instead of self-hammering. TvK is not a VI, by any means.<br>\n<br>\nIt's all about reading playing styles and how people act / respond when they post. Two seemingly same actions, can create two very different perceptions. It's not that difficult of a concept to understand, nor is it one I think you \"conveniently\" forgot about, but rather one that you purposefully ignored. Reaction-fishing? Perhaps, and I hope you got what you came for.<br>\n<br>\nOtherwise, you're reaching / manipulating and there's no real town motivation in that.

You wanted to know bjc's suspicions, but the way he answered it, you knew nothing. Only when pointed out, you wanted to know more. So what did you learn from bjc's original answers? And in post 92, you explained a thought proces which I disagree with. True, when someone attacks a player, he should be able to explain it to players who don't understand.

Why didn't you ask for a claim?<br>\nContinuing, instead of the 'oh, I was wrong', it's changed into an attack against TvK, without looking back at the time he townread TvK.

The issue I have is that I see town be illogical and hypocritical way too often. With what I've seen of Neil's play, I wouldn't be surprised if he would do that as town. At that point, I need to ask myself the motivation he would have to lie about that - for it to be scummy TvK has to be town and BJC/Neil have to be a scumteam. I don't think that's a sensible scumteam, so I don't find the catch too telling alignment wise.

And in response you ask him questions which had nothing to do with you being uncomfortable. Strange for someone who said to Farside that you'd keep duscussing when someone bothers you. And one of the questions is weird. You asked pisskop what he'd do not to get caught tunneling again. When you answered this question, you answered what you'd do not to tunnel (post 80). That's not what you asked though.<br>\nPost 80 is also scummy. First a 'smart' answer: 'if you think i'm scum, your vote is on the right player'. And secondly, the feeling I get. You point things out, instead of discussing things. If we look at your points against farside or me, we get a very aggressive side with discussion. Not this.<br>\n2. Post 134 shows another 'pass'. Bjc is scummy for pushing players, but pisskop is town for pushing. And no, your playstyle argument won't work as defence. Here, you also mention meta on bjc. That he's different. And you're on the fence. Last, boo snarky comment on post 137.<br>\n3. Post 201 is bad. First of, bjc is pushing players (attacking others) and defending himself. How's that thinking about yourself? This is how most players act when scumhunting ._. And your questions are bad. The questions towards trevor and farside say nothing about their allignment as it's not looking into their reads. Lobster's question is whom we should focus on? It's like you want 1 player to get the attention. And last, six. He was attacked for not giving reads. But after that he hadn't posted. Of course, he couldn't respond. But when he's back, you barely mention him if you mention him at all.<br>\n4. Post 232 ilooks also to be a 'point-out' post. My gut tingles everytime I read this post.<br>\n5. The Farside discussions. If you want I can give examples. And what i pointed out yesterday.<br>\n<br>\nTvK<br>\n1. Post 37 in which you respond to Thesp's vote. It's very overdefensive. Especially as you respond to Thesp, but vote pisskop instead. And the reason you give is different than what I see. Pisskop was looking into neil and you call it fluff. Also, it was shown that TA had more votes than pisskop, who you didn't like for the same reason you didn't like pisskop.<br>\n2. Next posts 51/52. First, why would bjc 'threaten' you to vote neil as scum? But more interesting is the last bit. Why mention that you don't find neil scummy, so you're going to vote someone else? That's just normal... and 52 is defensive evasiness again.<br>\n3. And again, pointing to others in post 263. Farside has stated why she doesn't like you and votes you. There can be multiple reasons why she likes you more for scum than her other suspects. The same happens with Neil VS bjc. Just because they discuss, doesn't mean they are each other top suspects.<br>\n4. The null-town thesp... you make a big deal out of thesp not discussing his targets and his vote on you, but he's null-town. Why? <br>\n5. Post 416, 482 and 508 are a combo. First, you unvote bjc. Because you don't feel comfortable being one of the few votes with 2 'lurkers'. But with this argument, you should have been on the right wagon as he was almost lynched, right? Other than that, you mention the sheeperz in post 482, so it seemed you wanted to look at them. But in post 508 you go back to bjc, without looking anyone (except six).<br>\n6. You commented that bjc was keeping his options open with all his targets. In post 548 you mention 5 players to look at.

What 5 players do you mean?</div></blockquote>\n\n1. You had a light town-read on thesp at the start of the game? Your post starts that you don't like him... and if you had a light town-read, why? Also, a question. When you look back, what in your opinion, brought us out of the RVS? Depending on your answer, we'll get back to point 1.<br>\n<br>\n2. That doesn't answer how it comes from scum <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> the opposite of doing something towny, is doing something anti-town. And anti-town isn't scummy perse. So I want you to answer this part again.<br>\nAnd the last part was something weird. I got what made you say it. I don't get why anyone would say that. If you think someone isn't scummy, you'd of course vote someone else.<br>\n<br>\n3. You weren't asking why farside was scumreading you. You were asking why farside wasn't scumreading other players. That's a huge difference. The first is normal, it's to get an explanation. The second is either an attack or a deflection. As you state yiu're town-reading farside, then I read how you decide not to respond to farside, but try to get her attention somewhere else.<br>\nI'll look later where you mentioned that you thought bjc and neil had each other as top suspects.<br>\n<br>\n4. Easy question: were you satisfied with thesp's opinion? If not, we also get back to this point. Especially as I never got the impression that you thought thesp was null-town.<br>\n<br>\n5. But you never looked at the sheepers. This is a huge point as I've barely got the impression that you have been scumhunting. The only one I thought 'well done' was Thesp's not posting an opinion. But you state that he's null-town. And this adds with 6. You mentioned bjc (whom you have questioned), pisskop (you may explain why), six (sheeping SG), garmr (nothing) and thesp (light town-read?

At my homesite, it's 3 days, but we don't need a majority to lynch, it's just whoever has most votes.

It feels like frustration that he doesn't think he'll ever be able to get me lynched. (I acknowledge there may be OMGUS in this - I don't have any way to divorce myself from such thoughts. And before anyone thinks I think too highly of myself, I have no illusions that I am unlynchable. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> )<br>\n</li><li>I really didn't like his post on me that came when he thought I had missed his vote on me in a votecount. ('This one was eaten by the Great Board OM NOM of '014.) He expressed some uncertainty with me, but didn't actually vote me until he thought I'd left his vote against me off an unofficial votecount I'd posted. That seems a weird straw to break the camel's back.<br>\n</li><li>I really, really don't like the DOMO vote. Especially when we're 2 days from a deadline and he's the only one on it. He's abandoning the TvK lynch. At the point he unvoted, there were 5 voters on TvK, as neil1113 had unvoted to make sure we got an official votecount, and expressed how he thought TvK was still likely to be scum. pisskop's vote shift moved it down to 4, while he said \"Still want TvK\". Does Bo Know moves off of TvK (and onto pisskop) thereafter, TvK then hops back on, and bjc joins Does Bo Know in moving to pisskop, and the TvK wagon falters.

I'm trying really hard to follow, but if I feel like I can say anything objectively against or for Pisskop, it would be one based off of confusion right now.

I just don't know enough about him and his play style to have a decisive opinion.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the last 100 pages of stuff that everyone has posted, there is so much potentially to comment on, to be quite honest, it's kind of overwhelming. :/<br>\n<br>\nMy vote for all extensive purposes right now would be between a couple candidates. Bjc, and DBK would be my more favorable lynches as they read the most scum in my eyes, while TvK, and SiX are both leaning scum to me (TvK still, SiX is specifically starting to lean scum after his few posts in the past pages since I've last commented about him). As of right now with my stance over the past skimming through Pisskop is that I would be comfortable with his lynch, only for the purposes of information. If he is town like I could suspect, then the information would be great for those who have been tunneling him to stop and focus on other viable subjects, meanwhile if he flips scum, it'd give us a whole new route to look at based on his posts.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I believe Thesp called me out for not responding earlier on, I hope I addressed that above but if not, feel free to question me. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">", "time": "Wed Mar 05, 2014 3:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=38659&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "38659"}

I'm rambling? I just say it as I see it. You say you don't want to get personal, then you say stuff like this. I think you're scum dude, or at least I did until you claimed. And if you're not, then you have a very scummy town game which I assume is deliberate so you can play like this as scum.

So tracking him would be a waste of power. I believe he's doc, but I'm not yet convinced he's town. If he is town, his claim makes sense because DBK was blatantly gonna shoot pisskop if he didn't get lynched, so I have no problem with pisskop's claim, that was gonna be needed. DBK's claim might be a little spewy but whatever, vig can be bad as well as good so I'm not worried about it effecting our chances of winning.

As of right now with my stance over the past skimming through Pisskop is that I would be comfortable with his lynch, only for the purposes of information.

If neil1113 dies and is shown to be scum, then I look worse (and possibly mislynchable) because I tried to steer away the neil1113 wagon.

Bandwagons don't form themselves. You've got to make best guesses and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do something</div>. It's hard to believe that at this point in the game, you can't make a best guess about someone. Why aren't you in a \"position to point fingers\"? How can you get in a position to point fingers?

But I WIFOM living players like that when I'm scum, so at that point there becomes a debate as to which of us is closer to \"normal\" in attitude there, and in addition which of us is closer to however Pisskop plays if he's scum.

What I did do is look at Neil. I think the biggest stand out for me is that Neil bothered to try to paint a scum team connection of Thesp, Terminal Apathy, and Pisskop. Now, we're pretty sure TA is scum. I think it's unlikely that Neil would paint this picture with two scumbuddies. So I think a Kreacher scum flip tends to clear both of the other names.<br>\n<br>\nHe also spent some time complaining that Thesp was protecting TvK. I don't feel that is particularly a scum/scum interaction.<br>\n<br>\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

I asked people to provide a background check on Neil's former games to compare them to his current play since people seemed to question him - Yet this never happened and I dropped the case when other things caught my interests.<br>\n<br>\nThe arguement between Neil and Bjc could in my opinion very well have been a chit chat inbetween them since this is something I've experienced in former games aswell. Two wolves bandwaging each other and the survivor remains as a sort of village hero. This is something I'd like you guys to take into consideration.<br>\n<br>\nAt the time I also questioned Bjc's play where he ALL THE TIME suddenly switched his vote from one person to another. He layed a vote and he withdrew a vote way too easy. Feels like he was going around seeing who he can strike down.<br>\n<br>\nAfterwards I ended up in an arguement with <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Squirrel Girl</div> accusing me of logicless reasons.

DOMO protected Neil and could very well have been a posible lynch but instead he ended up shot. Why?<br>\nDOMO suspected all three of them to be potential mafias so either did someone set up a trap killing DOMO to intentionally put suspicion on them, OR some of those 3 felt threatened by DOMO's accusions. Here again Bjc is, the one I've suspected from time to time.<br>\n<br>\nLast night I also had suspicion on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DBK</div> either being the Serial killer or if he really was the Vigilante. Let us not forget that you Farside were the one who suggested him to shoot Thesp who ended up as a villager. Personally I'm glad it was your suggestion over Squirrel Girl's, seeing both of you are seeming as core town players to me (I changed my mind about Squirrel later after examining her play closer). If there are a sort of peeker role such as the Deputy, I'd highly recommended to check it out.<br>\n<br>\nThis round Squirrel Girl got shot and Bjc was the first one to start his stubborn sherlock investigation on me with the majority being similar to DOMO's and the 3 Players case but in difference he didn't lift a finger trying to investigate that but when it's no longer related to him though the background of both Nightkills were the same he directly jumped on me having that + Other stupid reasons that when I tried to do a little research for once but ended up misunderstanding his content as a reason to get me killed.<br>\n<br>\nSo here you have my reads: Bjc, Neil, Thesp, Squirrel Girl are my scum read.

Granted, I hadn't done much either, but Bjc had been more annoying than helpful over the past few days.<br>\n- I think, realistically, that both scum wouldn't try to suspect Pisskop after his claim. That would bring too much attention to them if Pisskop were to flip (which he did just now). It means Bjc could try to still follow his \"SiX&gt;Anxiety\" chain lynch with another reason.<br>\n- Ultimately, I forgot why Bjc was town, so I'll have to read Pisskop's reasons; I just dismissed that Bjc was town because Pisskop gave enough of a damn to defend him.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know whom out of Anxiety/SiX the other one is.

The death on Neil was firstly(Good) voted by Farside but the <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">L-A-S-T(Bad)</div> vote were put by DBK. Did he posible wait to see what would come out of it but at last decided to put the vote?

(Though admittedly, since pisskop was pretty open about people he didn't trust who were also likely to be town, as well as who his very town reads were, it may have nerfed his effectiveness.)
