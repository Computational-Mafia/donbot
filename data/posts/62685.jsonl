A lot of things have meaning, probably most things. But certain behaviors, especially after you've played a lot of games, are just automatic regardless of alignment. I'm pretty much always going to be honest about reads and reasons early day one, as town because I'm town, and as scum because I've found it's the easiest way for me to act town. That honesty is automatic. Me backtracking implies that I did something that I didn't at the time have a justification for doing, and that's just not something I'd do regardless of alignment, even if that justification is as simple as \"I felt like it.\" I have no reason to lie or backtrack this early as scum. <br><br>I might \"backtrack\" in the sense that I need to (accurately) justify my past behavior if I'm bothered by the pressure regardless of alignment, because regardless of alignment I'd rather pressure be focused elsewhere. <br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br>Additionally note that in this post, NE dances around the issue of my alignment. He's commenting on the situation, and saying that I might backtrack maybe and that it's generally a scumtell, so he's sort of throwing a broad paintbrush stroke of suspicion towards me without actually committing to a read. That's scummy."}

You are far too defensive to be town imo. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: MarioManiac4</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't see what he has deflected, he has defended his thoughts on the whole suspect/lynch thing (not going into semantics). Aside from not answering N.Es question, he just seems like a Newbie. <br><br>I can't tell if you are purposefully not following his train of thought.</div></blockquote><br>I missed this the first time through.<br>I think the \"LOL what\" is yours, so I will go ahead and explain post 81 further. Other people seem to have understood it without explanation, but anyway...<br>He said if everyone agrees on one person, it's a bad sign, because scum would agree with that lynch. Now since the context was not an actual lynching of someone, but pressure put on that person with the intent to lynch, he was not (or should not have been) talking about an actual mislynch, but a potential one. If he really believed that everyone agreeing on one person meant that person was town, then he should have been all for an agreement on one person. Why? Because it would provide the information that said person was town. But he was against focusing on one person. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't see what he has deflected, he has defended his thoughts on the whole suspect/lynch thing (not going into semantics).

He started trying to say that he was talking about an actual, carried-through mislynch that everyone agreed on. This was not in fact the context of his post, as an actual mislynch was not taking place at the time, just pressure put on one individual. Again, my reasoning for him being scum is not that he's wrong about what we should be trying to do, but rather that he prefers to waffle and deflect rather than simply admitting he was wrong."}

I find it unreliable to find scum discussing hypotheticals such as this.</div></blockquote><br>It is very much not the foundation of my case, and I have taken great pains to point out that it is not. Your continual defense of Mario/Dominator looks to be very misguided, since you (seemingly intentionally) miss the point of what I'm saying. His statement was absolute, but your attempt to soften it to a \"more often than not\" doesn't do him any favors. The point is this: to the degree that agreeing on someone is \"a bad idea\" because scum will be on the wagon, it is in fact a good idea, because scum being on a wagon gives the town information. Now let us get back through your smoke and mirrors to the heart of the issue. Mario waffled, deflected, and then left the game when I pressed him and voted him over this issue. Who was right and who was wrong is irrelevant. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7068720#p7068720\" class=\"postlink\">post 267</a>, pisskop wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7064473#p7064473\" class=\"postlink\">post 176</a>, dragonspawn wrote:</cite>Not really seeing an objection with lynching Mario.

It seems like grasping to me. He criticizes pisskop's reasoning for unvoting that he's been lynched for not doing it before, as if only scum has a reason to avoid being lynched, which is just overtly wrong. Beyond that KK just criticizes things that I don't see much reason to find scummy. I feel like there are so many other things that have happened in this game that focusing and voting based on the quotes he brings up is odd in a somewhat scummy way. It just doesn't feel like genuine reasoning to me. <br><br>It baffles me that the entire town seems to strongly townread KK.

His posting seems to be rather fluffy as Boonskiies pointed out, but he has are some town tells, too. I'm just not sure. I thought GrayFoxxx was scummy before but his recent posts look like town.

I kind of see the case on pisskop, too, but I'm not sure.<br><br>The main problem right now is that we have a couple of players that haven't contributed much (FA_Q2 and StubbsKVM).

He doesn't want to call a bunch of people null because then it won't sound like he's giving concrete reads, so he says Woody is scummy but has some towntells, Gray was scummy but has also towntold, that he can see the case for one growing wagon, and that he can kind of see another case. That is just so overtly waffley. He's building in room to go in whichever direction is most convenient in an extremely underhanded way. <br><br>He then proceeds to vote a lurker for an opportunistic vote.

The fact that you find none of those people who post the most scummy is anti-town. That is not the same thing as \"you should scum read them because they post the most\".

Luckily, my #1 town read ended up being scum...so...yeah. You straight up want whoever will give the most information from a Day 1 lynch. Somebody slips on Page 2. Great. You are officially getting no information that day, and you will basically start Day 2 as a second Day 1 (minus potential night actions), but with a scum handicap, which isn't bad, but there are better things to do...like lynch the scummiest player who will gives LOADS of information and actually allows us to catch MORE scum."}

If you are killed Night 1, it means Scum doesn't want you in the game, be it by framing you or they see you as a threat. This is usually without a lot of information, so it is usually based on just you as the player in the game. I don't see Night 1 kills framing usually as a thing, because nobody in their right mind as scum would kill someone who they are in a deep 1v1 with, as it just creates pointless WIFOM in favor of Town."}

I haven't found any common ground, but not because I'm simply refusing. It's because Bulb and Woody have not been using logic and reason.

If someone made a real case about someone other than Dominator or me, I might find myself agreeing with it.

On the surface shazam looks to have valid reasoning but if you read the discussion shazam clearly distorts what mario is trying to say. post 79 mario says - town should grill their own scum reads instead of focusing on 1 player. post 81 shazam distorts that and says \"so you say town gains info by focusing on 1 player but you want us to do something else\" but NOWHERE in post 79 does mario say town gains info from focusing on 1 player. That is a blatant misrep in my opinion and his vote is just a continuation. It shows manipulation from shazam.<br><br>In post 249 he tries to explain why he's scum reading mario but it is very clumsy. The way I read it, he basically is still harping on the \"focusing on 1 person\" thing. Shazam is trying to argue that mario should actually be for people focusing on 1 person because it will ultimately give us info that the person is town or something. Again I don't really understand his logic and anyone who says they agree with him <br><br>Shazam claims he is also the most vocal person against mario, but his entire case is based on either a misunderstanding OR a misrep. I'm leaning towards misrep.</div></div></div><br><br>5th vote  FaQ<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">He votes sheeping shazam, which makes me really confused because the post that he sheeps is so bad.

Only 1 person had a \"legitimate\" reason for voting mario. I put legitimate in quotes because imo the reason wasn't actually legitimate at all.<br><br>Shazam's entire basis of attacking mario was based off what I interpret as a blatant misrep so I am good with my vote. I have also moved NE up the scum list a little, nothing about his push on mario felt genuine.<br><br>p.edit - see that is another example of a manipulative post. Shazam has to be scum because no way town is this manipulative"}

On the surface shazam looks to have valid reasoning but if you read the discussion shazam clearly distorts what mario is trying to say. post 79 mario says - town should grill their own scum reads instead of focusing on 1 player. post 81 shazam distorts that and says \"so you say town gains info by focusing on 1 player but you want us to do something else\" but NOWHERE in post 79 does mario say town gains info from focusing on 1 player. That is a blatant misrep in my opinion and his vote is just a continuation. It shows manipulation from shazam.<br><br>In post 249 he tries to explain why he's scum reading mario but it is very clumsy. The way I read it, he basically is still harping on the \"focusing on 1 person\" thing. Shazam is trying to argue that mario should actually be for people focusing on 1 person because it will ultimately give us info that the person is town or something. Again I don't really understand his logic and anyone who says they agree with him <br><br>Shazam claims he is also the most vocal person against mario, but his entire case is based on either a misunderstanding OR a misrep. I'm leaning towards misrep.<br><br><br><br>Shazam's entire basis of attacking mario was based off what I interpret as a blatant misrep so I am good with my vote. I have also moved NE up the scum list a little, nothing about his push on mario felt genuine.<br><br>p.edit - see that is another example of a manipulative post. Shazam has to be scum because no way town is this manipulative</div></blockquote><br>Post 81 used the word \"admitted\". I have already explained at least once why he was admitting that town gained information by doing what he didn't want them to do. He claimed that we would know scum were ok with the lynch. That would be information. He did not have to actually say those words to admit that. My vote is very clearly not just a continuation of this point, as I have very clearly explained already at least twice. My reason for voting him would hold whether he was right or wrong. I will not be going over any of the above again in this game.<br><br>RE: post 249<br>The way you read it is to me, and should be to everyone, irrelevant. You manage, however, to miss the second part of post 249, which clearly explains away every point that you are trying to make. Of course you don't understand my logic. If you think that my vote had to do with whether he was right or wrong about what we should all be doing, you haven't been paying attention.<br><br>Even if you thought I misrepresented him to achieve my goals, why can't you see that he attempted to change the context of the conversation, waffled, and then left the game because of what I was saying? Don't you think that this kind of caving under pressure is scummier than misrepresentation (since you can't determine for sure if it was intentional)? Again, I didn't misrepresent him, but seriously....<br><br>Please explain how a post of mine was manipulative. Since the goal of this game is to persuade others to do things (for both town and mafia) I'm really not sure what you mean."}

Gray, Boon, and I have all agreed that this makes no sense, and Bulb has not been able to explain this. 536 is clearly a response to 535 since the context was me saying people shouldn't scumread the players who haven't been posting much content (i.e. Bulbazoor). He was caught out saying something false in 536 and took an explicit opportunity to lie about his intent by saying it was directed at the only person who WAS scumreading him, Grayfoxxx. So please do one of the following: 1) Explain how 536 is a response to 508. 2) Explain how 541 and following could possibly come from town if 536 is a response to 535. 3) Vote Bulbazoor.

I don't think boon did either but at least boon was better able to articulate what about his meta, bulba didn't do as good imo</div></blockquote><br>I can't do much about this. Both of you need to get over it and admit that what Bulb did is not just bad, confused, or weird. It's indicative of scum in such a glaring way that if you don't vote him for this, you are willing to let him get away with anything. In which case we lose if he is scum."}

No one has criticized any of my <span style=\"font-style: italic\">reads</span> as of yet, so I haven't discussed any in-depth. I've given a number of townreads (dragon, woody, shazam) and a current scumread on NE; I gave a scumread on foxxxx which I've since retracted, and a weak scumread on Boon, which I've since retracted (he's now in the townread pile, foxxxx is null). I can go in-depth into any involved reasoning if desired. <br><br>Another point I have been harping on, and will harp on more: KK really has not towntold yet. Everything he's done so far is just pure reasoning; it isn't necessarily a towntell for him just because you agree with his reasoning.

He didn't want to \"waste\" his vote by voting for gray before he knew whether a wagon could start, but he didn't hesitate being the first vote on woody at the beginning or being the first vote on evil after giving this explanation. So why was voting first on gray a wasted vote but voting first on woody and evil perfectly alright?<br><br>I look this over and I see backtracking by someone who is caught making a mistake. It's a sign of a guilty conscience and bad reasoning. <br><br>If implosion flips scum we should definitely look closer at woody and Mario. Both have been resisting/defending the push on implosion. On top of that woody especially looks like a good buddy for implosion as scum because it explains why he wouldn't worry about the woody vote creating a wagon. He had no intention of it becoming a wagon.<br><br>Just some general thoughts right now.<br><br>I like boon so far. Reminds me of my best friend.

I get the feeling dragonspawn has entered tunnel-mode on implosion here, and he's making conclusions on things with the assumption that implosion will flip scum. he also mentions that he doesn't believe the reasoning implosion is using, which is something I value highly when scumhunting. overall this post just feels very genuine and from a town mindset.<br><br>other reads I have at this point are Shazam/GrayFox/Woodpecker leaning town, and I have my eye on Boonskiies and Mario."}

It just feels like an excuse to vote Woody and lead in to a Boon fos tomorrow. He talks about information from the lynch in the case that we get scum, but lynching scum is almost always going to give useful information.<br><br>I feel like taking this argument and framing it as \"there's probably scum amongst the two of them\" is a fairly likely scum tactic.

I am genuinely pretty confident that slot is scum, though, and I think you're simply among those who doesn't quite get why, no matter how much I explain. That's ok with me. <br><br>The irony is that you think I voted Mario when I should have just disagreed with him (or perhaps said he was a bad player), while you're voting me when you should have just disagreed with me. Again, if you thought I had a really good reason for voting Mario, you would not be surprised by my confidence. It's because you disagree with me that you find my confidence scummy. The central point is that you disagree with me, you've just added the smoke-and-mirrors \"confidence\" thing to it."}

The only things I find scummy about Dom's iso are contained in there. The first three quotes are the entirety of his case against me. Nowhere does he give further reasoning for his vote. So \"I don't like this\", \"Seems eager\", and \"looked scummy\" are the best he can do. And yet when Bulb votes me, he wants reasoning to be given for it. Further, in the last post above, he reveals inadvertently that he never attempted to understand the reasons why I voted Mario in the first place. He skipped over them and said \"Shazam seems awful eager to vote Mario\" and \"Scum are often eager to vote someone\".<br><br>All of this is to say that his scumread on me is ultra-bad and has been held onto and pushed by him in an ultra-bad fashion. Does that mean I would have a scumread on him if it weren't for Mario? Probably not."}

You're trying too hard.<br><br>@Annarchy<br>Meta aside, what traditionally scummy things would Bulb have to do for him to be scum in your eyes? Don't you think that if he can get away with what he did already, he can get away with anything? There comes a point at which we must stop making excuses for someone because we think they're bad. Otherwise, bad players will always win as mafia."}

I had to look up if we had any game history and we've only ever been in one game together and I was town.

I said if FA is scum, we could use some more info from him (which, yes, is true because he has said hardly anything in comparison to the rest of the game, having the lowest post count tied with the NE/spicer slot). however I ALSO said if he's town, leaving him alive will give us a chance to see that. basically while I do have him as the lowest person in my reads atm, I also think my reads are probably shit and I should gather more info to be sure of anything<br>3. literally the only thing I had in my notes regarding you was \"Bulba town - post #xxx. meta.\" for a few posts<br>4. well, let's look at your posts between you admitting you lied and me making that post:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: scumhunting?</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7075292#p7075292\" class=\"postlink\">post 700</a>, Bulbazoor wrote:</cite>Trying to get a reacton is antitown?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7076889#p7076889\" class=\"postlink\">post 760</a>, Bulbazoor wrote:</cite>Can you explain.

I do like your catchup post. I honestly am not sure what I was townreading dragonspawn off of. I think it was a gut town ping on 68 and some of his other early posts, and then since he was filed into the town pile I just completely ignored him since he was never saying anything of substance to look at.

I wanted to gauge if you would have already known what a watcher was from your role PM, but now I think you went and looked up normal roles on the wiki and decided on claiming watcher. Now I must admit this is also consistent with the mod copying the wiki's statement of the watcher into your role PM. But add the fact that straight-up watchers are generally considered too powerful, and you have yourself a fishy claim. I'm ok with lynching someone else because this is a confirmable role to some extent.

At first, she claims that I am a townread. Weak, but a read as town. Then, she claims that if FA is scum, wshe wants to keep him for more. That was the questionable part for me and I am wondering why she would want to keep someone if they are the scum? Fa latest post also shows that he is willing to join the wagon that is on me and that I have posted nothing. He was not here to read my posts I made right now. Back to anna...<br><br>Anna is being questionable to me right now as a player because I can barely understand how they quickly went from townreading me to \" convincing myself that he can do it as scum\" when that was already the obvious thing. How did she not notice it? And why did she claim meta as fast as she could when asked? For some reason, I am starting to see anna and FA as a possible scum team up.

He (Bulba) has a decision to make (say LYNCH X PlAYER TOMORROW about either town or scum) and there is no particular impetus to do one or the other.

I really don't like his take on things, and the way he goes about his pushes; it seems forced. With this, Woodywoodpecker, and Spicer have become my thoughts on who could potentially be part of the scum team due to their lack of placement on Bulb's wagon, which I believe because of the basis of that wagon, at least one scum was probably off of it, as it was an obvious bus. <br><br>\u2022 Pisskop has stayed pretty much the same. I can't seem to get a read on him. Finally, he's pushing something, which I do find town-lean, but I don't necessarily like the wagon right now. <br><br>\u2022 Implosion has leaped to the top for me; I flat out can't see Bulb/Implosion's interactions as Scum v Scum.<br><br>\u2022 Another shocking thing here is Dom has moved up, yet again. Like Implosion, I can't see Bulb actually outing his scum partner like that. That being said, maybe I just don't want to believe that is what happened, because honestly, I'd feel really bad for Dom...it's part of the game. The fact that it still could be a potential thing makes me feel a little uneasy about it, but I'll leave that until a little later, so for now I like thinking that didn't happen.<br><br>\u2022 Grayfoxxx moved down...I think the pressure on Pisskop is fine! I like it. Pisskop needs to have some pressure. I just don't understand what Grayfoxxx is trying to accomplish, especially since his vote is being abstained. I also don't necessarily like his interactions with Spicer. I feel if Grayfoxx is scum, most likely scum partner would be Khan, which is why Pecker/Spicer are Null-Scum; I wanna believe I'm right about Khan. Also, I can somewhat see Bulb vs Grayfoxxx as Scum v Scum, moreso than I can with Implosion. <br><br>Other Notes:<br><br>- I'd like to think both scum aren't on the Bulb wagon, but I do believe at least one is. <br><br><br><br>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><br>This has been another issue of....<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">B</span></span><span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">O</span></span><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">O</span></span><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">N</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">S</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">K</span></span><span style=\"color: #4000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">II</span></span><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">ES C</span></span><span style=\"color: #000080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">OLORFU</span></span><span style=\"color: #00BFBF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">L WH</span></span><span style=\"color: #000080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">EEL OF</span></span> <span style=\"color: #4000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">SCU</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MSK</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">IIES</span></span><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, a wond</span></span><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">erful</span></span> <span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">boon</span></span> <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">to the town of </span></span><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mini 1698</span></span></span><br><br>What will happen on the next episode of <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">B</span></span><span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">O</span></span><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">O</span></span><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">N</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">S</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">K</span></span><span style=\"color: #4000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">II</span></span><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">ES C</span></span><span style=\"color: #000080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">OLORFU</span></span><span style=\"color: #00BFBF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">L WH</span></span><span style=\"color: #000080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">EEL OF</span></span> <span style=\"color: #4000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">SCU</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MSK</span></span><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">IIES</span></span><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, a wond</span></span><span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">erful</span></span> <span style=\"color: #8000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">boon</span></span> <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">to the town of </span></span><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mini 1698</span></span></span><br><br>Will Grayfoxxx ever understand what Spicer is saying?<br><br>Will Khan make up his mind with his contradicting strong pushes?!<br><br>WILL IMPLOSION EVER STOP IGNORING THE BOONSPAWN????

Stop trying to twist it.  I am scum reading you because you came out self proclaiming that you were obvitown, pounding the table for the bullshit case that pisskop was lying, and how you have reacted to my questioning ever since.  The crystal ball idea you speak of has nothing to do with my scum read of you other than a counter to your IM OBVITOWN claim.  Stop trying to twist my words and suspicion around"}

I started thinking about this when I saw post 523, and while I could have make this observation earlier, I guess it finally clicked when I saw this: Shazam is pushing heavily on the Mario wagon for something that is essentially a weak-player-tell. it's not very appealing play no, but Mario's 10 posts could easily, EASILY be from a new, weak town player. I have ISO'd Shazam and seen his reasoning, and not only do I disagree that Mario's actions are telling, I also think Shazam is claiming far too much confidence in his read on the Mario slot.<br></div></blockquote><br>So you think that I'm far too confident that Mario is scum from actions that you see as just incorrect, not scummy. And my incorrectness (from your PoV) makes you think I'm scum. Oh the irony. And don't try to pretend that this \"far too much confidence\" is anything more than you seeing me as incorrect. If you thought I was correct, the confidence would just seem natural to you.</div></blockquote><br>I think the same flaw I had there is what spicer is having here.<br>and I'm sorry but I'm not even going to try reading into Boon's reasoning. he makes little sense to me. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> he's town though<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7102373#p7102373\" class=\"postlink\">post 1387</a>, implosion wrote:</cite>I wanna hear more thoughts from anna about kk/how strongly she feels he's town.</div></blockquote><br>I keep kind of answering my next question before I get to it lol<br>but KK has been moving up in my town reads to the point where I wouldn't be willing to lynch him today. I was originally wary of my reasoning for his \"you should lynch me\" post being town, but my town read on him is backed up in other places. it's mostly what I said in response to GrayFox, his reads look like they're coming from the mindset of town trying to honestly figure out what people are as opposed to pushing opinions. he seems slightly unsure of his reads atm like I am also. I have five townreads I'd claim good confidence in, and he's the fifth (the other four being you, Boon, dragonspawn, and spicer, in that order).<br><br>so you feel confident on GrayFox being town. thoughts on piss/Dom/the Woody slot? do you see any possibility of a scumteam between two of the three of them?<br>to be honest I'd love to see the Woody slot get vig'd<br><br><br>I know someone wanted more explanation on all my townreads, but that will have to come later.

I remember reading that Khan said he thought boon was town because he would have bussed bulb harder and at the time i was like \"yeah, that's pretty decent\" but it isn't a guaranteed kind of thing.

Of course I have reasons to think that each of these people is town because that's just how my reads typically work. So I'm by and large trying to figure out which of those reasons is the weakest. This is also why this comment from Khan is somewhat irrelevant:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>He's also currently voting for pisskop, whom he recently called a gut town read. </div></blockquote><br>Because, more or less, I have some degree of townread on everyone alive. <br><br>Woody is also just on hold until the replacement comes, which is unfortunate.<br><br>Spicer and pisskop reads both come largely from conventional gut towntells. I mentioned the posts from pisskop that felt townish. But I think that is relatively speaking one of my weakest reasonings for townreading. There are also some reasons to see him as scum (bulb largely ignored him, his vote felt somewhat like a bus). I guess that's why my vote is on pisskop right now. I think he has some of my weakest reasons to see as town. <br><br>I also explained the spicer read. His posting since then is pretty straightforward. The squabble with gray feels somewhat genuine, and I think the reasons I mentioned earlier are a bit stronger than those with regards to pisskop. <br><br>Dom I don't think bulb was bussing, probably. The way he gave early and consistent pressure largely guided by meta feels more likely to come from scum trying to misuse meta than scum trying to use accurate meta to bus. <br><br>KK I elaborated on recently.<br><br>I think my top two right now are KK and pisskop, after looking over everything again, with the Woody slot also needing more investigation when possible.<br><br>If someone wants to discuss either of those reads (or any others), today/tomorrow are probably best because next week will likely also be pretty tiring.

Thats it not a lot of other substance or explanation like that.  I as I have said I think not having explanations with your reads is a scum move as I believe that town like to explain so that other townies can understand where they are coming from and maybe share their point of view.  So far Dom has done none of this. <br><br> I also have seen a complete LACK of scumhunting from Dom.  Everything he posts is either reactive or updating you on what happened.  I have yet to see him ask GOOD questions and try to find scum.  He is basically the guy that sits in the background and adds his own commentary when he feels needed.  If he was town I think he would take some ownership and start digging.  He hasnt done that.<br><br>As for him being on the Bulb wagon I say so what to that.  Much like I said with Grey I dont think voting Scum within the first 5 pages of the means shit.  Ive played games as scum where we said we were going to vote eachother out the gate to create some distance.  I believe mario could have done that just like I thought it was possible Grey did.  So when people say that Dom being on the bulb wagon exonerates him I say absolutely not.  I mean look at this post from him.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7069123#p7069123\" class=\"postlink\">post 344</a>, TheDominator37 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7069115#p7069115\" class=\"postlink\">post 339</a>, Bulbazoor wrote:</cite>Can you explain your scumread on me?</div></blockquote><br>It's not a strong scum read tbh but to explain it you were a bit wish washy and were eager to jump on a wagon</div></blockquote><br><br>This is the ultimate pussy foot.  There is NOTHING behind this post.  This is a scum read that can be easily retracted at anytime but still keeps up appearances.  Shortly after this he pulled his vote and placed it on Shazam.  People forget about the bulb lynch that he scumslipped.  Once that happens scum cut bait with the guy and lynch him.  Why stick your neck for a guy thats already dead.  I think people are getting too wrapped up in who voted who, instead of looking at what people are saying an how they are saying it.  Towards the end of the day he voted bulb, then unvoted, then voted him again.  Text book scum move at the end of the day.<br><br>So because of all this Im changing my vote to Dom  <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dominator</span>"}

Thats it not a lot of other substance or explanation like that.  I as I have said I think not having explanations with your reads is a scum move as I believe that town like to explain so that other townies can understand where they are coming from and maybe share their point of view.  So far Dom has done none of this. <br><br> I also have seen a complete LACK of scumhunting from Dom.  Everything he posts is either reactive or updating you on what happened.  I have yet to see him ask GOOD questions and try to find scum.  He is basically the guy that sits in the background and adds his own commentary when he feels needed.  If he was town I think he would take some ownership and start digging.  He hasnt done that.<br><br>As for him being on the Bulb wagon I say so what to that.  Much like I said with Grey I dont think voting Scum within the first 5 pages of the means shit.  Ive played games as scum where we said we were going to vote eachother out the gate to create some distance.  I believe mario could have done that just like I thought it was possible Grey did.  So when people say that Dom being on the bulb wagon exonerates him I say absolutely not.  I mean look at this post from him.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7069123#p7069123\" class=\"postlink\">post 344</a>, TheDominator37 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7069115#p7069115\" class=\"postlink\">post 339</a>, Bulbazoor wrote:</cite>Can you explain your scumread on me?</div></blockquote><br>It's not a strong scum read tbh but to explain it you were a bit wish washy and were eager to jump on a wagon</div></blockquote><br><br>This is the ultimate pussy foot.  There is NOTHING behind this post.  This is a scum read that can be easily retracted at anytime but still keeps up appearances.  Shortly after this he pulled his vote and placed it on Shazam.  People forget about the bulb lynch that he scumslipped.  Once that happens scum cut bait with the guy and lynch him.  Why stick your neck for a guy thats already dead.  I think people are getting too wrapped up in who voted who, instead of looking at what people are saying an how they are saying it.  Towards the end of the day he voted bulb, then unvoted, then voted him again.  Text book scum move at the end of the day.<br><br>So because of all this Im changing my vote to Dom  <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dominator</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Good argument and presentation.

Her reads might have been accurate but she makes sense as a kill either way.<br><br>It is true that we had an investigative role flipped already. There are benefits and harms to massclaiming now. The harm is obviously that PRs are outed, and scum will be able to kill them. The benefit is that we get a sense of direction (assuming we get a vig claim and at least one other PR claim, which we should), and that we avoid having scum try to weasel into a late PR claim (which isn't actually a particularly big benefit but still). <br><br>I think that former benefit outweighs the harm. This town is going in literally every direction possible. There are single votes for me, dom, titus, and boon. My top fos is pisskop. That's 5 different primary fosses out of 7 people without even looking at the other two. We might as well be in RVS. We need more information."}

Dom moved up, obviously, and if you had been reading my posts, you would know I was VERY against Dom being wagon'd. I brought that up in the beginning of Day 2. The fact that Day 1 Dom has brought up his hard scumread on Shazam, and him not liking the FA wagon, along with FA being the counterwagon to Bulbazor along with being able to semi frame - Woody/myself with that death, made it fairly obvious to me that was the scum kill. There was no way Anna was going to be shot by a vigilante, so once again, it makes sense from nearly only Dom's perspective to shoot GF, besides maybe Dragon.

It just...yeah. Besides that point, Titus said yesterday either \"Spicer or Boon\", yet toDay has completely disregarded the spicer. Bus a buddy; vote a townie...CLASSIC. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Spicer/Pisskop -</span> GF started targeting Pisskop, and then Spicer stepped up and targeted GF. Could be buddy relieving pressure.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dragon/Spicer - </span> This is kind of something that fell under the radar for me, and I don't know why. They have been somewhat targeting the same people, and further than that, Dragon voted Titus yesterDay, who was showing suspicion of Spicer. They both were all for the GF wagon, although they both were off of the KK wagon, I think?<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dragon/Pisskop - </span> Mm...my everlasting paranoia. They seem to be on completely different sides of the spectrum perspective wise.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Titus/Pisskop - </span> I don't really have any reasoning for this one, there's just nothing against it.

That theory is that spicer is scum, and the mafia consist of bulb + spicer-gunsmith + x-doctor. Why would that make sense? Two reasons. One, the scum having a doctor seems likely in the event that boon is town. Two, more irrespective of boon's alignment: bulb's role. It's a weird role, isn't it? It's very unique but it doesn't really add anything to the game in particular... unless... both other scum have power roles.

It's honestly fucking impossible to scumhunt outside of spicer/boon apart from just reading and re-reading and re-reading which is a massive problem.<br>4) Additional power role claimants, if any, will give us additional information if we want to lynch outside of spicer/boon (which I am leaning ever so slightly towards right now). If there are none then we get the information that boon and spicer are likely both town because I doubt that gunsmith+rolecop+2-shot vig is nearly enough power to offset a scumteam with a watcher and likely at least one other role due to the nature of the watcher.<br>5) More personally, I feel pretty lost in light of the two claims that have been made without any additional information. I just don't know where to go that solidly because there are so many unknowns and focusing on the knowns might be wrong.<br><br>Desperate is a very accurate word. I am desperate for a massclaim. I feel very little solid way forward without one."}

Parts of my gut say scum is going to be found in Titus. But ultimately I think a full look at the evidence makes boon probably scum.<br><br>The claim screwup today is kind of unforgivable from a scumhunting perspective. If people are going to jump on bulb d1 for saying \"every night\" and then switching to describing himself as 1-shot then we should jump on boon for claiming he sent in a kill last night as a role that would have no kill (yet). It's similar. Bulb's had some ambiguity because his diction was generally ambiguous as a whole. This has some ambiguity because theoretically boon could have misread his role pm. But if he sent a kill in last night as a role with no kill he would have been told that he had no kill. <br><br>I think boon should die before titus. Setup spec is fallible because there are always unknowns. Besides, 1-shot backup vig is an extremely weak role; it can possibly confirm its existence and get a single kill, or possibly do nothing. Swapping it in for a VT doesn't change setup balance all that much. There also is always the possibility that my sense of balance is right and that boon has some kind of negative utility role, like a doctor enabler or something like that. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Boonskiies</span>"}

With the set-up speculation going on, and especially with Boon \"speculating\" a mafia doctor, it lost its function as a safe claim.

So I protested heavily at that ability interaction. I was perfectly fine with revealing the role PM at the flip, and I do not mind role cops getting full role PMs in general.. It just didn't work out for this particular role. It's not a problem for the other roles I have in my potential future set-ups, none of those have anything inherently alignment indicative.<br><br>Oh and thanks!"}
