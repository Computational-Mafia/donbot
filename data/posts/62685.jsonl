A lot of things have meaning, probably most things. But certain behaviors, especially after you've played a lot of games, are just automatic regardless of alignment. I'm pretty much always going to be honest about reads and reasons early day one, as town because I'm town, and as scum because I've found it's the easiest way for me to act town. That honesty is automatic. Me backtracking implies that I did something that I didn't at the time have a justification for doing, and that's just not something I'd do regardless of alignment, even if that justification is as simple as \"I felt like it.\" I have no reason to lie or backtrack this early as scum. <br>\n<br>\nI might \"backtrack\" in the sense that I need to (accurately) justify my past behavior if I'm bothered by the pressure regardless of alignment, because regardless of alignment I'd rather pressure be focused elsewhere. <br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\nAdditionally note that in this post, NE dances around the issue of my alignment.

Now since the context was not an actual lynching of someone, but pressure put on that person with the intent to lynch, he was not (or should not have been) talking about an actual mislynch, but a potential one. If he really believed that everyone agreeing on one person meant that person was town, then he should have been all for an agreement on one person. Why? Because it would provide the information that said person was town.

Your continual defense of Mario/Dominator looks to be very misguided, since you (seemingly intentionally) miss the point of what I'm saying. His statement was absolute, but your attempt to soften it to a \"more often than not\" doesn't do him any favors. The point is this: to the degree that agreeing on someone is \"a bad idea\" because scum will be on the wagon, it is in fact a good idea, because scum being on a wagon gives the town information. Now let us get back through your smoke and mirrors to the heart of the issue. Mario waffled, deflected, and then left the game when I pressed him and voted him over this issue.

The person you were quoting in post 79 was talking about SUSPECTS, who you yourself said we did not have to lynch. They made the point that it's better to have one suspect for increased pressure on that person, and then you said that we shouldn't agree on one person because mafia would be content with the lynch. Now you are waffling and saying that mafia can bus, so mafia being content with a particular suspect DOESN'T mean that suspect is town. In addition you are diverting attention away from your mistake by claiming that the context was about actually carrying through with a lynch, which it was not.<br>\n<br>\nThis is scummy not because you have a certain opinion about what everyone should and shouldn't do, but because when that opinion was challenged for being anti-town, you both waffled and deflected.

It's a personality thing. There are plenty of people who would do that kind of thing regardless of alignment (and even those who would be more likely to do it as town because of anger, although that pretty clearly isn't the case here).

If you are killed Night 1, it means Scum doesn't want you in the game, be it by framing you or they see you as a threat. This is usually without a lot of information, so it is usually based on just you as the player in the game.

On the surface shazam looks to have valid reasoning but if you read the discussion shazam clearly distorts what mario is trying to say. post 79 mario says - town should grill their own scum reads instead of focusing on 1 player. post 81 shazam distorts that and says \"so you say town gains info by focusing on 1 player but you want us to do something else\" but NOWHERE in post 79 does mario say town gains info from focusing on 1 player. That is a blatant misrep in my opinion and his vote is just a continuation. It shows manipulation from shazam.<br>\n<br>\nIn post 249 he tries to explain why he's scum reading mario but it is very clumsy. The way I read it, he basically is still harping on the \"focusing on 1 person\" thing. Shazam is trying to argue that mario should actually be for people focusing on 1 person because it will ultimately give us info that the person is town or something. Again I don't really understand his logic and anyone who says they agree with him <br>\n<br>\nShazam claims he is also the most vocal person against mario, but his entire case is based on either a misunderstanding OR a misrep. I'm leaning towards misrep.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n5th vote  FaQ<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">He votes sheeping shazam, which makes me really confused because the post that he sheeps is so bad.

Only 1 person had a \"legitimate\" reason for voting mario.

You manage, however, to miss the second part of post 249, which clearly explains away every point that you are trying to make. Of course you don't understand my logic. If you think that my vote had to do with whether he was right or wrong about what we should all be doing, you haven't been paying attention.<br>\n<br>\nEven if you thought I misrepresented him to achieve my goals, why can't you see that he attempted to change the context of the conversation, waffled, and then left the game because of what I was saying? Don't you think that this kind of caving under pressure is scummier than misrepresentation (since you can't determine for sure if it was intentional)?

He was caught out saying something false in 536 and took an explicit opportunity to lie about his intent by saying it was directed at the only person who WAS scumreading him, Grayfoxxx.

I actually like some of the things he's been coming out with, and really the only thing I see scummy in him was his predecessor.

You cannot simultaneously, from just this game, determine that I'm intelligent and reasonable, and that I haven't been using good enough reasoning. If I wasn't using sufficiently good reasoning, you wouldn't have determined that I was reasonable. This seems like you decided you wanted me dead, and then tried to come up with reasons for it.<br>\n<br>\nIt's easy to say something's a facade, so I don't have much of a response to that. I am genuinely pretty confident that slot is scum, though, and I think you're simply among those who doesn't quite get why, no matter how much I explain. That's ok with me. <br>\n<br>\nThe irony is that you think I voted Mario when I should have just disagreed with him (or perhaps said he was a bad player), while you're voting me when you should have just disagreed with me. Again, if you thought I had a really good reason for voting Mario, you would not be surprised by my confidence. It's because you disagree with me that you find my confidence scummy. The central point is that you disagree with me, you've just added the smoke-and-mirrors \"confidence\" thing to it.", "time": "Thu Jul 23, 2015 10:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62685&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "62685"}

The only things I find scummy about Dom's iso are contained in there. The first three quotes are the entirety of his case against me. Nowhere does he give further reasoning for his vote. So \"I don't like this\", \"Seems eager\", and \"looked scummy\" are the best he can do. And yet when Bulb votes me, he wants reasoning to be given for it. Further, in the last post above, he reveals inadvertently that he never attempted to understand the reasons why I voted Mario in the first place. He skipped over them and said \"Shazam seems awful eager to vote Mario\" and \"Scum are often eager to vote someone\".<br>\n<br>\nAll of this is to say that his scumread on me is ultra-bad and has been held onto and pushed by him in an ultra-bad fashion. Does that mean I would have a scumread on him if it weren't for Mario?

I had to look up if we had any game history and we've only ever been in one game together and I was town.

GrayFoxxxx towntold pretty hard in the first half of the game. Shazam gave a strong town-tell as well.<br>\n<br>\nI was never big on the MarioManiac4 wagon (I understand the reasons, but they aren't as strong as they are made out to be). TheDominator37 has been fairly townish, though a little milquetoast. <br>\n<br>\nimplosion is in the weak town because of a weird vibe that keeps him from being a full town read. Mostly it's the repeated motif where he has to constantly point out \"scum-Khan could do that\" which is weird that I'm the only one that gets this treatment. I had to look up if we had any game history and we've only ever been in one game together and I was town. If he could give me the reasoning behind this specific treatment I'd appreciate it, otherwise it feels a little like a \"smear/discredit the townie\" tactic. <br>\n<br>\nThe Annarchy weakscum read comes mostly from Necessary Evil. Necessary Evil's posts were lackluster and his read reasonings were vague. Though it could just be unfocused town. Annarchy has a totally different style, which is great, but I don't agree with many of her conclusions, which is bad.<br>\n<br>\nBulbazoor is a wildcard at the moment. His weird cadence/formatting, the backtrack, the (possible?) responding to old posts.. I can't even tell if english is his first language. <br>\n<br>\nspicer1209 is in the hole that StubbsKVM dug at the moment. StubbsKVM was a weak scumread. And spice1209 is a non-read.

I said if FA is scum, we could use some more info from him (which, yes, is true because he has said hardly anything in comparison to the rest of the game, having the lowest post count tied with the NE/spicer slot). however I ALSO said if he's town, leaving him alive will give us a chance to see that. basically while I do have him as the lowest person in my reads atm, I also think my reads are probably shit and I should gather more info to be sure of anything<br>\n3. literally the only thing I had in my notes regarding you was \"Bulba town - post #xxx. meta.\" for a few posts<br>\n4. well, let's look at your posts between you admitting you lied and me making that post:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: scumhunting?</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7075292#p7075292\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7075292#p7075292\" data-post-id=\"7075292\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 700</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25853\">Bulbazoor</a> wrote:</cite>Trying to get a reacton is antitown?</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7076889#p7076889\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7076889#p7076889\" data-post-id=\"7076889\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 760</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25853\">Bulbazoor</a> wrote:</cite>Can you explain.

I think it was a gut town ping on 68 and some of his other early posts, and then since he was filed into the town pile I just completely ignored him since he was never saying anything of substance to look at.

So why if he was scum would he partake in the killing of one of them.  It puts a target on him big time.  Its an easy frame job for the scum because he wasnt a strong or overly active player.  Doing a frame job on someone like Kahn for example is difficult for scum because 1. he would reason his way out of it and 2. no one would think he is  scum because it is the obvious scum move to try to kill the person who kahn had suspicion on.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso this is a Normal game so there arent any two faction scum.

He (Bulba) has a decision to make (say LYNCH X PlAYER TOMORROW about either town or scum) and there is no particular impetus to do one or the other.

I really don't like his take on things, and the way he goes about his pushes; it seems forced. With this, Woodywoodpecker, and Spicer have become my thoughts on who could potentially be part of the scum team due to their lack of placement on Bulb's wagon, which I believe because of the basis of that wagon, at least one scum was probably off of it, as it was an obvious bus. <br>\n<br>\n&#8226; Pisskop has stayed pretty much the same. I can't seem to get a read on him. Finally, he's pushing something, which I do find town-lean, but I don't necessarily like the wagon right now. <br>\n<br>\n&#8226; Implosion has leaped to the top for me; I flat out can't see Bulb/Implosion's interactions as Scum v Scum.<br>\n<br>\n&#8226; Another shocking thing here is Dom has moved up, yet again. Like Implosion, I can't see Bulb actually outing his scum partner like that. That being said, maybe I just don't want to believe that is what happened, because honestly, I'd feel really bad for Dom...it's part of the game. The fact that it still could be a potential thing makes me feel a little uneasy about it, but I'll leave that until a little later, so for now I like thinking that didn't happen.<br>\n<br>\n&#8226; Grayfoxxx moved down...I think the pressure on Pisskop is fine! I like it. Pisskop needs to have some pressure. I just don't understand what Grayfoxxx is trying to accomplish, especially since his vote is being abstained.

His arrogance over his own alignment feels genuine to me. <br>\n<br>\nI feel like a hipster when it comes to KK. I kept trying to tell everyone to stop when they were calling him obvtown, and then when there were some things that made me say \"yeah, i can see kk town\" he got wagoned.

I remember reading that Khan said he thought boon was town because he would have bussed bulb harder and at the time i was like \"yeah, that's pretty decent\" but it isn't a guaranteed kind of thing.

Of course I have reasons to think that each of these people is town because that's just how my reads typically work. So I'm by and large trying to figure out which of those reasons is the weakest. This is also why this comment from Khan is somewhat irrelevant:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>He's also currently voting for pisskop, whom he recently called a gut town read. </div></blockquote><br>\nBecause, more or less, I have some degree of townread on everyone alive. <br>\n<br>\nWoody is also just on hold until the replacement comes, which is unfortunate.<br>\n<br>\nSpicer and pisskop reads both come largely from conventional gut towntells. I mentioned the posts from pisskop that felt townish. But I think that is relatively speaking one of my weakest reasonings for townreading. There are also some reasons to see him as scum (bulb largely ignored him, his vote felt somewhat like a bus). I guess that's why my vote is on pisskop right now. I think he has some of my weakest reasons to see as town. <br>\n<br>\nI also explained the spicer read. His posting since then is pretty straightforward. The squabble with gray feels somewhat genuine, and I think the reasons I mentioned earlier are a bit stronger than those with regards to pisskop. <br>\n<br>\nDom I don't think bulb was bussing, probably. The way he gave early and consistent pressure largely guided by meta feels more likely to come from scum trying to misuse meta than scum trying to use accurate meta to bus. <br>\n<br>\nKK I elaborated on recently.<br>\n<br>\nI think my top two right now are KK and pisskop, after looking over everything again, with the Woody slot also needing more investigation when possible.<br>\n<br>\nIf someone wants to discuss either of those reads (or any others), today/tomorrow are probably best because next week will likely also be pretty tiring.

Thats it not a lot of other substance or explanation like that.  I as I have said I think not having explanations with your reads is a scum move as I believe that town like to explain so that other townies can understand where they are coming from and maybe share their point of view.  So far Dom has done none of this. <br>\n<br>\n I also have seen a complete LACK of scumhunting from Dom.  Everything he posts is either reactive or updating you on what happened.  I have yet to see him ask GOOD questions and try to find scum.  He is basically the guy that sits in the background and adds his own commentary when he feels needed.  If he was town I think he would take some ownership and start digging.  He hasnt done that.<br>\n<br>\nAs for him being on the Bulb wagon I say so what to that.  Much like I said with Grey I dont think voting Scum within the first 5 pages of the means shit.

You have 2 people scummier than gray and a week left in phase. You should have changed your vote to one of them, or put pressure on some other way.

Just because someone says they think I am town doesnt mean I am town.  To me that is a scummy mindset at worst or bad town play at best.<br>\n<br>\nYou call it tunneling I call it prying.  Am I just supposed to ask him a question and when he answers take his word on it and move on?  I wanted more informaton out of him and get a better read on him and I did that.  <br>\n<br>\nKK is my biggest town read and because of that of course Im going to buddy him.  We are on the same wavelength on a lot of things and almost everything he posts comes from a town perspective in my opinion.  If he posts or does something that I think is scummy I will call him out on it and dig further to get more information out of him.  Until then yea he is my biggest town read and I am buddying him.  Sorry.<br>\n<br>\nI waited 8 days to vote because I was still catch up reading the thread when lynched happened.

I still need to go through imps ISO but I havent had that much time as Ive been planning for a camping trip that Im going on tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I was interrogating Grey he was my biggest scumread so I was pushing that conversation until I got enough information in which I was satisfied.  Because I pushed that conversation he is now less scummy than I originally thought. After re-reading the interactions we had I feel he could be town because if he was scum he would have withdrawn a little with people voting him.  If you just said my reads list feels like town who tunneled and realized he messed up then why are you voting for someone who feels town?", "time": "Sun Aug 02, 2015 10:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62685&start=1475", "forum": "53", "thread": "62685"}

Thats it not a lot of other substance or explanation like that.  I as I have said I think not having explanations with your reads is a scum move as I believe that town like to explain so that other townies can understand where they are coming from and maybe share their point of view.  So far Dom has done none of this. <br>\n<br>\n I also have seen a complete LACK of scumhunting from Dom.  Everything he posts is either reactive or updating you on what happened.  I have yet to see him ask GOOD questions and try to find scum.  He is basically the guy that sits in the background and adds his own commentary when he feels needed.  If he was town I think he would take some ownership and start digging.  He hasnt done that.<br>\n<br>\nAs for him being on the Bulb wagon I say so what to that.

Her reads might have been accurate but she makes sense as a kill either way.<br>\n<br>\nIt is true that we had an investigative role flipped already. There are benefits and harms to massclaiming now. The harm is obviously that PRs are outed, and scum will be able to kill them. The benefit is that we get a sense of direction (assuming we get a vig claim and at least one other PR claim, which we should), and that we avoid having scum try to weasel into a late PR claim (which isn't actually a particularly big benefit but still). <br>\n<br>\nI think that former benefit outweighs the harm. This town is going in literally every direction possible. There are single votes for me, dom, titus, and boon. My top fos is pisskop. That's 5 different primary fosses out of 7 people without even looking at the other two. We might as well be in RVS.

Dom moved up, obviously, and if you had been reading my posts, you would know I was VERY against Dom being wagon'd. I brought that up in the beginning of Day 2. The fact that Day 1 Dom has brought up his hard scumread on Shazam, and him not liking the FA wagon, along with FA being the counterwagon to Bulbazor along with being able to semi frame - Woody/myself with that death, made it fairly obvious to me that was the scum kill. There was no way Anna was going to be shot by a vigilante, so once again, it makes sense from nearly only Dom's perspective to shoot GF, besides maybe Dragon. Scum wouldn't dare shoot GF unless it was from Titus' perspective. <br>\n<br>\n&#8226; The only other movement here really, is Dragonspawn moved down a little. This is based off of entirely POE, as I like most of his stuff. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOther Notes:<br>\n<br>\n- Titus slot/Spicer have stayed in the exact same spot as last time. I have completely believed from the beginning of Day 2 that there was at least 1 scum in KK/Woody/Spicer. <br>\n<br>\n- I believe the possible scum team possibilities are:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Titus/Spicer -</div> This one seems the most likely EXCEPT for the fact that I do believe at least one scum was busing Bulbazor. It just...yeah. Besides that point, Titus said yesterday either \"Spicer or Boon\", yet toDay has completely disregarded the spicer. Bus a buddy; vote a townie...CLASSIC. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Spicer/Pisskop -</div> GF started targeting Pisskop, and then Spicer stepped up and targeted GF. Could be buddy relieving pressure.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dragon/Spicer - </div> This is kind of something that fell under the radar for me, and I don't know why. They have been somewhat targeting the same people, and further than that, Dragon voted Titus yesterDay, who was showing suspicion of Spicer. They both were all for the GF wagon, although they both were off of the KK wagon, I think?<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dragon/Pisskop - </div> Mm...my everlasting paranoia. They seem to be on completely different sides of the spectrum perspective wise.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Titus/Pisskop - </div> I don't really have any reasoning for this one, there's just nothing against it. I don't believe they've put any kind of pressure on each other, though. So that's a bit odd.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAll this being said, I believe one of Titus/Spicer is scum, and one of Dragon/Pisskop are. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis has been another issue of....<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">B</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">O</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">O</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">N</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">S</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">K</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">II</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#400080\">ES C</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">OLORFU</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BFBF\">L WH</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">EEL OF</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">SCU</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">MSK</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">IIES</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">, a wond</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">erful</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">boon</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">to the town of </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Mini 1698</div></div><br>\n<br>\nWhat will happen on the next episode of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">B</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">O</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">O</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">N</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">S</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">K</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">II</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#400080\">ES C</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">OLORFU</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BFBF\">L WH</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">EEL OF</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">SCU</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">MSK</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">IIES</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">, a wond</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">erful</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">boon</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">to the town of </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Mini 1698</div></div><br>\n<br>\nWill Implosion ever get the Necessary Evil slot lynched?<br>\n<br>\nWill Titus slip up and contradict herself outing herself as scum?!<br>\n<br>\nWILL WE EVER FIND OUT IF GRAYFOXXX EVER FIGURED OUT WHAT SPICER WAS SAYING?????!!!???? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> <br>\n<br>\nFind out next time....on  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">B</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">O</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">O</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">N</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">S</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">K</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">II</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#400080\">ES C</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">OLORFU</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BFBF\">L WH</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">EEL OF</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000BF\">SCU</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">MSK</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">IIES</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">, a wond</div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">erful</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">boon</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">to the town of </div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Mini 1698</div></div>", "time": "Sun Aug 09, 2015 7:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62685&start=1675", "forum": "53", "thread": "62685"}

It's honestly fucking impossible to scumhunt outside of spicer/boon apart from just reading and re-reading and re-reading which is a massive problem.<br>\n4) Additional power role claimants, if any, will give us additional information if we want to lynch outside of spicer/boon (which I am leaning ever so slightly towards right now). If there are none then we get the information that boon and spicer are likely both town because I doubt that gunsmith+rolecop+2-shot vig is nearly enough power to offset a scumteam with a watcher and likely at least one other role due to the nature of the watcher.<br>\n5) More personally, I feel pretty lost in light of the two claims that have been made without any additional information.

Parts of my gut say scum is going to be found in Titus. But ultimately I think a full look at the evidence makes boon probably scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe claim screwup today is kind of unforgivable from a scumhunting perspective. If people are going to jump on bulb d1 for saying \"every night\" and then switching to describing himself as 1-shot then we should jump on boon for claiming he sent in a kill last night as a role that would have no kill (yet). It's similar. Bulb's had some ambiguity because his diction was generally ambiguous as a whole. This has some ambiguity because theoretically boon could have misread his role pm. But if he sent a kill in last night as a role with no kill he would have been told that he had no kill. <br>\n<br>\nI think boon should die before titus. Setup spec is fallible because there are always unknowns. Besides, 1-shot backup vig is an extremely weak role; it can possibly confirm its existence and get a single kill, or possibly do nothing.

On day one you tunneled me super hard and I tried to work with you and you refused to even consider that you could be wrong or even give a shred of reasoning. On day 3 your reasoning was also pretty opaque in general. Being on scum lynches or not, you need to work on having a more transparent thought process as town.

I insist on having my one allowed non-normal role.. But the first one was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">too </div>non-normal, and wasn't allowed. The 2nd one.. Well the reviewers weren't too enthousiastic, but didn't object either, then it got vetoed by N. The watcher variant was the 3 role. The rest of the set-up changed a bit, though most of the roles were there from the start. It didn't have a gunsmith though.. The reviewers thought it initially was scumsided, so the gunsmith got added. You can view all the drama in the review thread once its public, the link is in the OP.<br>\n<br>\nThe role cop could \"clear\" the doctor, but the watcher would have been an interesting find. As he would have to explain what the variance was.<br>\n<br>\nThe vigilante was straight forward.

I didn't think it would be too strong, as the most optimal kill is not the most optimal target for watching. Reviewers agreed.<br>\n<br>\nThe doctor was there to weaken the vig, but more importantly it was there to function as an actual safeclaim. The role cop could clear him, the gunsmith could clear him, and a mafia doctor is not a common thing. It didn't work out that way in the game though. With the set-up speculation going on, and especially with Boon \"speculating\" a mafia doctor, it lost its function as a safe claim. Like I said in the dead thread, I personally though Piss had to bus Boon late-game, if he had the chance, but he didn't. He would have had to claim vanilla townie, and get investigated by Spicer, who could \"clear\" him.<br>\n<br>\nI thought the balance was fine, although it's a little bit hard to tell, with most of them dying early. I also find it funny that 2 power roles replaced out.<br>\n<br>\nFor those curious, the first set-up that got rejected had a town \"magnet\", someone who would redirect to himself. The 2nd rejected set-up had an anonymous voter for the mafia.

I forgot to mention. But no, role cops.. originally only got the roles, just like you're used to. The normal guidelines you quoted are new, and I was exempt from those. But guess who caused those rule changes? Again, if you want the drama, you should check out the review thread once its public.<br>\n<br>\nIn short:  the role cop would simply get the report \"watcher (variant)\", when targeting the watcher. As that was simply the name I've given him, I didn't have a fancy name for it. Ether wanted it to be a more incriminating name or just give the role cop the full role PM, but I really didn't want to, because, in this case, this would all but confirm the watcher as mafia, which is not something I'd want for a role cop. So I protested heavily at that ability interaction. I was perfectly fine with revealing the role PM at the flip, and I do not mind role cops getting full role PMs in general.. It just didn't work out for this particular role. It's not a problem for the other roles I have in my potential future set-ups, none of those have anything inherently alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nOh and thanks!", "time": "Sun Aug 16, 2015 4:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62685&start=2050", "forum": "53", "thread": "62685"}
