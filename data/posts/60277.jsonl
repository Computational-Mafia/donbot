Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action ranging from a warning to being force-replaced or modkilled.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">i.</span> This is a game so try and have fun! Don't be mean to other users by flaming, trolling or calling names. Remember the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=14372\" class=\"postlink\">general site rules</a> apply at all times!<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ii.</span> No trickery: No invisible, encrypted, or small text in thread. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">iii.</span> You may not edit or delete any posts, if you have the power to do so.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">iv.</span> Don't discuss this game outside of the main thread, unless your role specifies you have the permission to do so.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">v.</span> Do not quote role PMs or any information said in PTs/QTs outside the related threads. Paraphrasing is allowed, but I would recommend you run it through me first before you do so.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vi.</span> Do not impersonate the mod in-thread. Do not use my mod colour, #0033ff. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vii.</span> Faking a violation will give you the same penalty as actually committing it. <br><br><br><span style=\"color: #0033ff\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Game Mechanics</span></span></span><br><span style=\"font-size: 90%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">The information below describes how the game works. Some of these modified from various other people. </span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">i.</span> Votes must be <span class=\"noboldsig\">bolded</span>, or made using the vote tags. Either <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Riddleton</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Riddleton</span> is acceptable. On the other hand, if it looks vaguely like a vote, I'll count it.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ii.</span> Lynches require a majority of votes. If a majority is not reached by deadline no lynch occurs.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">iii.</span> Once a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight and players may continue to talk in thread until the death scene has been posted. No votes/unvotes will be counted during this period.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">iv.</span> Once you're dead, you're dead. No more talking. No 'Bah' posts.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">v.</span> All actions will be resolved using the Natural Action Resolution system.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vi.</span> Each Day will have a two week (14 day) deadline. Deadline extensions don't happen unless on extraordinary circumstances.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vii.</span> Each Night will have a 48 hour (2 day) deadline. All night actions must be submitted to me (Riddleton) by PM during that time.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">viii.</span> If you're going to be V/LA, please notify me in thread (preferably bolded with <span class=\"noboldsig\">@mod</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Riddleton</span>, or <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Riddle</span>).<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ix.</span> Players must post every <span class=\"noboldsig\">48</span> hours or they will be prodded. More than three total prods during the game will result in a replacement. If a player fails to pick up on their prod and post in-game within 24 hours, they will be replaced also. Players who are V/LA are exempt from this.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">x.</span> All flavour is provided purely for entertainment purposes only and has no bearing or relation to the game. <br><br><br><span style=\"color: #0033ff\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample Role PM</span></span></span><br><span style=\"font-size: 90%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">At least one player has received a 'vanilla town' PM like the one below:</span></span><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span><br><br>Welcome to the game, Riddleton!

Will and potential, and I daresay the ability to adapt to anything. At times I can be very forceful, and I quite like the mental swordplay that comes about now and again. Also, I tend to watch out for any players that use hyperbole, or take words out of context. Those to me scream of Scumminess, and I'm apt to tear at the throat whenever someone attempts to do so with me in these games. I've caught a few this way. Thorough, analytical reads are another strong weapon in my arsenal. Intense, unceasing curiosity and scrutiny round it out, but this doesn't mean other things are being improved upon as well. If I'm Scum you have to either NK or investigate me; very rarely as Scum do I get lynched; it's been well over a year.<br><br>My friend, what do you think are some good things to strive towards within these games of Mafia? Also, how long have you been playing Mafia? I am simply curious.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> <br><br>Aneninen, being unpredictable is the 17th Law of Power.<br><br>Guys, I'd like to hear more from you. Please speak up and get these discussions rolling. Hearing more from you would be splendid, and, if you would, please toss out more reads and accusations. Lob some questions my way too, please. I don't bite, and will not rip your head off unless I sense you're being deceitful. From a cost-benefit analysis, you have nothing to lose if you're Town, because as Town you should have absolutely no reason to lie to me about anything in this game. Some have told me I have a very sharp sense of perception, and can usually discern traits and patterns in the behaviors of others. You have literally nothing to fear if Town, and everything to fear if Scum, so, by all means, please do engage with me.<br><br><img src=\"http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/happy-alligator-21649555.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">"}

Never played with this chap before, so from my perspective his somewhat dopey behavior isn't really indicative of alignment. Although I would say being difficult to read isn't pro-Town at all. Though I'm not at the point of committing my vote just yet, I do agree a bit with Luca's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492479#p6492479\">64</a> on Lapsa being ironic regarding fluff. ...he cited his reason for voting Anen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6491133#p6491133\">8</a> was because of fluff according to his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492220#p6492220\">37</a>.

While it is a fascinating question to weigh, why exactly is he asking me it? What is the underlying intent of it all? It does, to me, feel as if he is trying to redirect my attention.

If you are trying to fool us, I can assure you it's not working. If people are misunderstanding your posts then that is your fault for not being transparent and understandable. And your counter-vote against Luca in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492516#p6492516\">70</a> leaves me wondering what's up with that. Also, regarding your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492531#p6492531\">73</a>, from a Town standpoint, it is always best to assume the worst when it comes to what and how many enemies we will have... within reason. 10:3 is the worst reasonable possibility. No crosskills; three Scum. I'd rather assume we're looking at three enemies and feel relieved if there are only two, than assume there are two and then lose if it's revealed there's one more. Anyways, Luca is correct in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492536#p6492536\">75</a>.<br><br>As for <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #80BF80\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">sthar8/KatieB</span></span></span>, do you only impersonate female alts, or do you take it further?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">J/k</span> Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492571#p6492571\">78</a> leaves me wroth. It's the part where you say you'd wagon either me, Luca, or Anen. So, why? And does anyone else find it odd how he says Lapsa is probably Town in spite of his postings that really haven't been all that Townish to begin with? Guess I don't understand where KatieB is finding this confidence that Lapsa is probably Town, when it's so early into this game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Up to 78</span>. Going to a party.

I would guess there is some consensus among other players about that too. So let's assume that droog is not actually misrepping but to give you the benefit of the doubt let's say that your posts just came off poorly. Please clarify what you were trying to say and how there is town intent behind it. Also notice that droog did not vote you but you voted him instantly. That is very reactionary and easy to read as scummy defensiveness. So let's hear about that too please."}

His only 'scumhunting' this game has been Monkey - it is an easy option, and I don't like it. He has virtually ignored many of the big players in this thread.<br><br>He doesn't participate in RVS himself- instead choosing to question Monkey's question of Anen's vote, over whether it was random or not. Pacman's question was pretty counter-productive, and even if Monkey's question was pretty stupid, why not just let it play out?

I would also like Pacman to elaborate on why Wake's 67 needed to take context into consideration, when he was asked a general question, and why this makes him scummy, because Pacman says he scumreads Wake, presumably because of this issue.<br><br>You say you are glad Aeronaut recognised CKD's questions as bullshit, but again this doesn't make sense to me - these questions caused you to townread CKD, and scumread Wake, so they couldnt have been that bad?<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6498286#p6498286\">253</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6498444#p6498444\">257</a> - I'm asking myself what is Pacman trying to achieve with these posts. Droog says Pacman is playing 'peace-maker', but it looks as though he is stifling things, and I'd rather see Monkey v Droog play out here without his interference. These posts feel like an attempt to blend in - they come across as helpful, but really do nothing, apart from make Monkey look bad, which clearly suits Pacman's agenda.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6499716#p6499716\">283</a> - Oh, so basically you were trying to set Monkey up with 253 and 257?

Why are you only focusing on Monkey?<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6504974#p6504974\">374</a> - He makes sure he puts something about Monkey being right in here, just so it looks like he isn't completely tunneling, which he clearly is, which is apparent when you read his ISO. <br><br>Is you 'let's lynch Anen' here a joke? I can't tell, as you have barely spoken about anyone other than Monkey, so I don't know how you feel about him.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6504982#p6504982\">378</a> - And here it comes, the easy vote on the lynchbait he has been tunneling on all game. There was never gonna be any other outcome - Pacman has been building all game for that moment.<br><br>I'm getting strong scum feels off of Pacman. I hate Katie B's posting, but I would be willing to compromise here.<br><br><br>P;Edit: You're right, he didn't switch vote. I guess 'direction switch', would have been more appropriate."}

I know you won't be happy about this vague answer but I remember opening two of his former games randomly, one of them was a town-game and another one was a scum-game.

Unfortunately (because I didn't expect that someone would ask more about this topic <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> later) I don't remember which those two games were. (All I can remember is that in his town-game his post were a bit longer and usually contained \"straightforward\" reads and interactions and in his scum-game he had short posts, many of them full of with theoretical content. Though, it's possible that I've just misguided myself since I've been trying to find those games. But I think I've checked different games now.

Do you expect anybody to not post when they come on?? Like how is it town to say \"oh I'm here but let me not contribute to the conversation because I should let it play out between other people\" let alone expect someone else to do that. And your comments on 283, besides their clear misunderstanding of what I said regarding CKD/Wake, also clearly misrepresent the fact that I tried to let Monkey help himself by being moderate and reasonable, and he chose not to. It wasn't a trap, it was just questions and like any question in mafia there's a town-seeming way to answer and a scum-seeming way to answer and he answered the scum-seeming way. It's only a trap insofar as any question is a trap so to call it that is, again, misrepresentation."}

Monkey's reaction to Aeronaut's \"so who benefits from that\" is as snarky as that horrible post deserves and I think it's also very town so sorry for almost being part of that mislynch... shoulda read. Anyway the other bad thing about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6529676#p6529676\">699</a> is that it asks a question without having any suggestions for an answer, Aeronaut seems completely uninvested in actively searching for an answer for his own question and so it comes across as the question being the point of that post, not the answer. And there's no town intent behind that. Monkey and droog both look town in their opening D2 posts and Anen's is weird and idk how I feel about it.<br><br>Monkey how do you feel about 699 given that in 707 you say that you find \"overreliance on other players\" scummy?<br><br>I maybe don't agree with Monkey's original argument against Wake but I don't like how Wake reacted in response to Monkey's accusation, particularly 714, which tries to disrupt the pretty clear train of logic in Monkey's three linked posts in it.<br><br>Gendaberry seems town just for starting a new wagon with new reasoning at a point in the game where apathy would have been the best scum tactic. Like just letting us lazily lynch some random town because we don't care. I do think IIII is town though, if anything because switching a vote within 40 minutes or whatever Genda's accusation is looks annoying and anti-town but is usually indicative of lack of certainty which is of course super town. So now the IIII wagon looks bad and I'm thinking maybe droog and Aeronaut are scum buddies.<br><br>Anyway that's only to like the middle of page 31, I'll do more tomorrow.

HE HAS DONE NO SCUM HUNTING.  NONE.  Why?  <br><br>4.) He said Wake was scum because he left the game (couldn\u2019t handle the pressure?).  I asked him (3 times) to provide a game where he developed this theory.  He gave a newbie game (that he was in) from 2012.  Really?  This is the game you have based this bullshit theory?   He has been around since 2008.  If MM was really trying to find scum, why didn\u2019t he meta Wake to see if this was a common problem with his other current games?  (Hint: it is a common problem).  No, instead he just throws that crap out there to see if it will get started.  MM, why didn\u2019t you see if Wake was having problems in other threads?<br><br>5.) he voted IIII today (the wagon that countered his own) ONLY when the wagon started gaining steam, stating his wagon switch yesterday was scummy.  Really?  If it was so scummy why didn\u2019t you vote him when the day started, versus now? I have asked him why he didn\u2019t vote him at the start of the day 3 fucking times, he has seemed to \u201cmiss\u201d the question every time.

Aeronaut goes from scummy to ehhh off of \"Day 3 Paranoia\" which really doesn't mean anything. Same goes for his read on ||||, who goes from town to the most likely player to have bussed Monkey for similar vague shitty reasons.<br><br>I also think he looks a lot worse with Monkey being confirmed as scum. He was always fine with the Monkey wagons at the start, however as soon as the monkey lynch started gaining traction, he hopped off of them for stupid reasons. Day 1 despite scumreading him for most of the day and being on his wagon, he unvotes for pretty much no reason when the wagon hits a decent size. Day 2 comes along and a similar thing happens. Wagon on Monkey starts, EPM hops on it, then he suddenly townreads Monkey and drops it with little explanation because droog somehow convinced him not to be lazy?<br><br>Overall, I think it's really weird that despite it being day 3, EPM has still done pretty much nothing in the way of trying to get scum lynched. He scumread droog and aeronaut, but hasn't really done anything with it apart from saying that they might be scum, and later saying that Aeronaut is becoming more null. His longest held vote is Monkey, and even then he doesn't really pressure him at all, and instead defended him for half the game. Seriously the closest he's gotten to trying to get scum lynched has been promising that he's going to do it in the future in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6520249#p6520249\">666</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6543935#p6543935\">783</a>. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6543935#p6543935\">783</a> is pretty funny to me too seeing as how he seems to think that if Monkey were to have fliped town that we must lynch Anen, but he never brings Anen up after that, even after he starts townreading Monkey.<br><br><br>On a side note, I agree with Katie that Wake's entry today wasn't very good."}

Either he is scum, or he is a village idiot. Disappearing for most of Day 3 so far is also kind of scummy, given how he's not exactly Mr. Popularity right now.<br>- Pacman was voted by Aeronaut and Aneninen yesterday. Aneninen turns up dead, and in his first post today, Pacman expresses support for Droog, and support for Pacman. Pacman then expresses suspicion of llll, and suspicion of Aeronaut (how convenient). Pacman did not care to elaborate in detail on these opinions and allegations. Furthermore, I disagree on every single one of these 4 opinions.<br>- The quality of Katie's postings are getting worse and worse. Katie finished up Day 2 by defending the Droog and Monkey team, and then casting a Gendaberry vote. I do not like the Gendaberry vote, but at least Katie provided justification for it. Then for Day 3, Katie comes out naked voting Aeronaut with only the obnoxious \"thoughts?\" posted in place of justification. After a mediocre post in 1049, (and mediocre is certainly an improvement for Katie), Katie's three other posts, chronologically, are a one line incomprehensible insult about short pants, a one line promise of future commentary, and a one line refusal of commentary (due to politeness, of all things! Katie, you're anything <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but</span> polite). Katie, please try to be less of an asshole, post some fucking content when you post, and stop playing so cavalierly. Quoting full page posts with a pointless contentless response decreases the readability of the thread, is quite obnoxious, and fools absolutely no one into thinking that you are not active lurking."}
