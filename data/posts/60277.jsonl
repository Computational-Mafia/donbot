Will and potential, and I daresay the ability to adapt to anything. At times I can be very forceful, and I quite like the mental swordplay that comes about now and again. Also, I tend to watch out for any players that use hyperbole, or take words out of context. Those to me scream of Scumminess, and I'm apt to tear at the throat whenever someone attempts to do so with me in these games. I've caught a few this way. Thorough, analytical reads are another strong weapon in my arsenal. Intense, unceasing curiosity and scrutiny round it out, but this doesn't mean other things are being improved upon as well. If I'm Scum you have to either NK or investigate me; very rarely as Scum do I get lynched; it's been well over a year.<br>\n<br>\nMy friend, what do you think are some good things to strive towards within these games of Mafia? Also, how long have you been playing Mafia? I am simply curious.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> <br>\n<br>\nAneninen, being unpredictable is the 17th Law of Power.<br>\n<br>\nGuys, I'd like to hear more from you. Please speak up and get these discussions rolling. Hearing more from you would be splendid, and, if you would, please toss out more reads and accusations. Lob some questions my way too, please. I don't bite, and will not rip your head off unless I sense you're being deceitful. From a cost-benefit analysis, you have nothing to lose if you're Town, because as Town you should have absolutely no reason to lie to me about anything in this game. Some have told me I have a very sharp sense of perception, and can usually discern traits and patterns in the behaviors of others. You have literally nothing to fear if Town, and everything to fear if Scum, so, by all means, please do engage with me.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/happy-alligator-21649555.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">", "time": "Tue Dec 30, 2014 4:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60277&start=25", "forum": "53", "thread": "60277"}

From a cost-benefit analysis, you have nothing to lose if you're Town, because as Town you should have absolutely no reason to lie to me about anything in this game. Some have told me I have a very sharp sense of perception, and can usually discern traits and patterns in the behaviors of others. You have literally nothing to fear if Town, and everything to fear if Scum, so, by all means, please do engage with me.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/happy-alligator-21649555.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></blockquote><br>\nI love Wake.

Never played with this chap before, so from my perspective his somewhat dopey behavior isn't really indicative of alignment. Although I would say being difficult to read isn't pro-Town at all. Though I'm not at the point of committing my vote just yet, I do agree a bit with Luca's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492479#p6492479\">64</a> on Lapsa being ironic regarding fluff. ...he cited his reason for voting Anen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6491133#p6491133\">8</a> was because of fluff according to his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492220#p6492220\">37</a>. Lapsa's voting him for fluff, yet Lapsa continues to post fluff. That is hypocritical. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why the hypocrisy?

While it is a fascinating question to weigh, why exactly is he asking me it? What is the underlying intent of it all? It does, to me, feel as if he is trying to redirect my attention.

And your counter-vote against Luca in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492516#p6492516\">70</a> leaves me wondering what's up with that. Also, regarding your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492531#p6492531\">73</a>, from a Town standpoint, it is always best to assume the worst when it comes to what and how many enemies we will have... within reason. 10:3 is the worst reasonable possibility. No crosskills; three Scum. I'd rather assume we're looking at three enemies and feel relieved if there are only two, than assume there are two and then lose if it's revealed there's one more. Anyways, Luca is correct in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492536#p6492536\">75</a>.<br>\n<br>\nAs for <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#80BF80\">sthar8/KatieB</div></div>, do you only impersonate female alts, or do you take it further?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">J/k</div> Your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492571#p6492571\">78</a> leaves me wroth. It's the part where you say you'd wagon either me, Luca, or Anen. So, why? And does anyone else find it odd how he says Lapsa is probably Town in spite of his postings that really haven't been all that Townish to begin with?

His only 'scumhunting' this game has been Monkey - it is an easy option, and I don't like it. He has virtually ignored many of the big players in this thread.<br>\n<br>\nHe doesn't participate in RVS himself- instead choosing to question Monkey's question of Anen's vote, over whether it was random or not. Pacman's question was pretty counter-productive, and even if Monkey's question was pretty stupid, why not just let it play out? It feels like he is finding an easy way to settle into the game, as RVS can be awkward for some as Mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6497766#p6497766\">230</a> - I don't get your stance here: you say CKD's two questions to Wake were 'shitty', yet you say CKD should have done more with Wake's answers, and then say the first works well as a trap, so unless I've misunderstood here you appear to be contradicting yourself.<br>\n<br>\nIn what way was the first question a trap, and how did Wake fall for it?<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6497820#p6497820\">232</a> - I've already pointed out the ridiculous part of this post, which Pacman needs to answer.

Droog says Pacman is playing 'peace-maker', but it looks as though he is stifling things, and I'd rather see Monkey v Droog play out here without his interference.

In the first one I replaced in and I fluff less when I'm a replacement. Also, I killed you Night1 so we didn't have too much time together. In the second one I was the IC and it's obvious that I don't fluff a lot as an IC. (Especially in my first IC game.) You can check any of my non-Newbie games and you'll find the usual \"Fluff-eninen\" everywhere, including my scum game. This goes for my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6492128#p6492128\">29</a> too.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6493086#p6493086\">168</a> &#8211; that was a catch-up and by the time I finished it I realized that my post wasn't useful at all. Should I have admitted the opposite?<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6494513#p6494513\">200</a> &#8211; I'm still at a loss about Lapsa. Don't know what to say. My Aeronaut read changed later (as far as I can remember I posted that.) Even if you disagree, I don't think very early pro-town reads are too useful (unless there's a blatant townslip or a claim or something like that). They may be early-buddying attepmts, in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6498976#p6498976\">278</a> &#8211; as for MonkeyMan. I know you won't be happy about this vague answer but I remember opening two of his former games randomly, one of them was a town-game and another one was a scum-game. I ISO-ed him in both and found out that as town his posting style was entirely different. Unfortunately (because I didn't expect that someone would ask more about this topic <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> later) I don't remember which those two games were. (All I can remember is that in his town-game his post were a bit longer and usually contained \"straightforward\" reads and interactions and in his scum-game he had short posts, many of them full of with theoretical content. Though, it's possible that I've just misguided myself since I've been trying to find those games. But I think I've checked different games now. The scum game I've checked was \"Lord of the Rings\".)<br>\nIf you're particularly interested in this topic, I'll try to find those games I found before.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6500984#p6500984\">309</a> or so. You can check it: there was almost nothing happeneing since I had my previous long post. That's all.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Druuge. Because of the site rules I'm not allowed to explain my townread.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the change on EPM. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6504974#p6504974\">374</a> he suggested lynching me. That's WTF in itself. But in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6504980#p6504980\">377</a> he backpedalled and in his next post jumped on the leading wagon. That'swhy the FoS on him.<br>\n<br>\nSide-note. I'm also not allowed to explain this but if EPM flips scum later <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> it turns out that the scums have a kind of daychat (eg. there's an Encryptor), Druuge is scum too.

I was curious what he deemed scummier, a post with fluff or someone who isn&#8217;t posting in here, but is elsewhere on site.   Fluff on day one is nothing.  It is the majority of posts in the first 10 pages. But what Ollie was doing WAS scummy in my book.  <br>\n<br>\nWhich leads me to the next question somebody asked (not going back all the way to find who).  Do I want to lynch lurkers&#8230;.short answer&#8230;yes.  Long answer, no?   Meaning, Ollie wasn&#8217;t just a lurker.  He wasn&#8217;t posting at all here AND he was very active in other games.  I find that day 1 scum DO that.  They will lurk and let a shitty wagon build on someone and jump in just a little and not commit to very much so they cant be ISOed later&#8230;.I recently nailed scum for doing the EXACT SAME THING.

I do not, and I don't think it's too much to ask the other twelve players to give a brief summary. If anything's lazy, it's refusing to even provide a sentence or two i response when you have more time than the person asking. BS on it being anti-Town, BS on it being scummy, and BS on it being lazy. I'm not asking everyone to provide walls of text doing my own work. I'm asking the other players (not all, but at least one) to help me catch up with a sentence or two. What's so difficult about it? Are you trying to fabricate reasons to cast suspicion on me? I think the route you're taking is horrible if you're Town, because if you're Town we are a team, and we help each other out if we are able. There's a chance that one of the people providing a response is Scum, but hey, that's the risk you take in a game of Mafia. People don't suddenly stop asking others for reads because, *gasp*, the person being asked could be Scum.

I perceive you as being dishonest and fabricating excuses to cast an extremely weak vote.

{"number": 892, "id": "6557578", "user": "evilpacman18", "user_id": "14166", "content": "So the reason for my earlier preface about how this is gonna sound OMGUSy was because Aeronaut has started looking really scummy to me, since I'm still wary of anyone who tried to read into the death of Luca. Monkey's reaction to Aeronaut's \"so who benefits from that\" is as snarky as that horrible post deserves and I think it's also very town so sorry for almost being part of that mislynch... shoulda read. Anyway the other bad thing about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6529676#p6529676\">699</a> is that it asks a question without having any suggestions for an answer, Aeronaut seems completely uninvested in actively searching for an answer for his own question and so it comes across as the question being the point of that post, not the answer. And there's no town intent behind that. Monkey and droog both look town in their opening D2 posts and Anen's is weird and idk how I feel about it.<br>\n<br>\nMonkey how do you feel about 699 given that in 707 you say that you find \"overreliance on other players\" scummy?<br>\n<br>\nI maybe don't agree with Monkey's original argument against Wake but I don't like how Wake reacted in response to Monkey's accusation, particularly 714, which tries to disrupt the pretty clear train of logic in Monkey's three linked posts in it.<br>\n<br>\nGendaberry seems town just for starting a new wagon with new reasoning at a point in the game where apathy would have been the best scum tactic. Like just letting us lazily lynch some random town because we don't care. I do think IIII is town though, if anything because switching a vote within 40 minutes or whatever Genda's accusation is looks annoying and anti-town but is usually indicative of lack of certainty which is of course super town. So now the IIII wagon looks bad and I'm thinking maybe droog and Aeronaut are scum buddies.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway that's only to like the middle of page 31, I'll do more tomorrow.

I mean nothing.  <br>\n<br>\nSo here is why I think that MM has got to be scum.<br>\n<br>\n1.) Day 1, His &#8220;scum is defensive/emotional&#8221; .  This is a load of shit.  This is a tactic scum uses to explain bad votes.<br>\n<br>\n2.) He is jumping on ANY wagon that gets going, for no reason.  Think I am wrong?  Just check out his voting&#8230;and WHEN he votes.<br>\n<br>\n3.) HE HAS DONE NO SCUM HUNTING.  NONE.  Why?  <br>\n<br>\n4.) He said Wake was scum because he left the game (couldn&#8217;t handle the pressure?).  I asked him (3 times) to provide a game where he developed this theory.  He gave a newbie game (that he was in) from 2012.  Really?  This is the game you have based this bullshit theory?   He has been around since 2008.  If MM was really trying to find scum, why didn&#8217;t he meta Wake to see if this was a common problem with his other current games?  (Hint: it is a common problem).  No, instead he just throws that crap out there to see if it will get started.  MM, why didn&#8217;t you see if Wake was having problems in other threads?<br>\n<br>\n5.) he voted IIII today (the wagon that countered his own) ONLY when the wagon started gaining steam, stating his wagon switch yesterday was scummy.  Really?  If it was so scummy why didn&#8217;t you vote him when the day started, versus now? I have asked him why he didn&#8217;t vote him at the start of the day 3 fucking times, he has seemed to &#8220;miss&#8221; the question every time. Why?  <br>\n<br>\nThis guy is so scummy it hurts.<br>\n<br>\nIf you guys don&#8217;t hang him today and I get offed tonight&#8230;PLEASE MAKE HIM ANSWER TO THIS CASE.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nhere is the case droog, thoughts?

I do not, and I don't think it's too much to ask the other twelve players to give a brief summary. If anything's lazy, it's refusing to even provide a sentence or two i response when you have more time than the person asking. BS on it being anti-Town, BS on it being scummy, and BS on it being lazy. I'm not asking everyone to provide walls of text doing my own work. I'm asking the other players (not all, but at least one) to help me catch up with a sentence or two. What's so difficult about it? Are you trying to fabricate reasons to cast suspicion on me? I think the route you're taking is horrible if you're Town, because if you're Town we are a team, and we help each other out if we are able. There's a chance that one of the people providing a response is Scum, but hey, that's the risk you take in a game of Mafia.

Aeronaut goes from scummy to ehhh off of \"Day 3 Paranoia\" which really doesn't mean anything. Same goes for his read on ||||, who goes from town to the most likely player to have bussed Monkey for similar vague shitty reasons.<br>\n<br>\nI also think he looks a lot worse with Monkey being confirmed as scum. He was always fine with the Monkey wagons at the start, however as soon as the monkey lynch started gaining traction, he hopped off of them for stupid reasons. Day 1 despite scumreading him for most of the day and being on his wagon, he unvotes for pretty much no reason when the wagon hits a decent size. Day 2 comes along and a similar thing happens. Wagon on Monkey starts, EPM hops on it, then he suddenly townreads Monkey and drops it with little explanation because droog somehow convinced him not to be lazy?<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I think it's really weird that despite it being day 3, EPM has still done pretty much nothing in the way of trying to get scum lynched. He scumread droog and aeronaut, but hasn't really done anything with it apart from saying that they might be scum, and later saying that Aeronaut is becoming more null.

Disappearing for most of Day 3 so far is also kind of scummy, given how he's not exactly Mr. Popularity right now.<br>\n- Pacman was voted by Aeronaut and Aneninen yesterday. Aneninen turns up dead, and in his first post today, Pacman expresses support for Droog, and support for Pacman. Pacman then expresses suspicion of llll, and suspicion of Aeronaut (how convenient). Pacman did not care to elaborate in detail on these opinions and allegations. Furthermore, I disagree on every single one of these 4 opinions.<br>\n- The quality of Katie's postings are getting worse and worse. Katie finished up Day 2 by defending the Droog and Monkey team, and then casting a Gendaberry vote. I do not like the Gendaberry vote, but at least Katie provided justification for it. Then for Day 3, Katie comes out naked voting Aeronaut with only the obnoxious \"thoughts?\" posted in place of justification. After a mediocre post in 1049, (and mediocre is certainly an improvement for Katie), Katie's three other posts, chronologically, are a one line incomprehensible insult about short pants, a one line promise of future commentary, and a one line refusal of commentary (due to politeness, of all things! Katie, you're anything <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but</div> polite).

Also, I tend to watch out for any players that use hyperbole, or take words out of context.

And despite all reason telling me not to, I added another kid to the bunch because he just got out of a group home and isn't back in school yet.

Surely you must have better reasoning than just not believing it.
