This is a setup theory, or \"outguessing the mod\" post. Those are inevitable... Around D3 or D4, when we have a decent amount of flips. Right now, this is pointless at best, distracting at worst. Actually, this whole \"Wolfy\" thing (which was the topic in post 119) is incredibly silly, and I cannot believe some people are actually wasting their time and energy on this. Werewolves is an alternative name for a game we're playing here. Wolf is another word for Scum. I'm hailing myself from the Werewolves games background (Giant in the Playground game-forum), so this terminology is completely normal to me, and so will for Shinobi, who apparently also played a game of Werewolves in his life.

Scummy as hell, but there is a slight chance, he's just confused with the conversation. <br>\n<br>\nNow Drixx, if you'll note, he's actually participating in the discussion... That's not relevant to finding scum, while avoiding any form of serious questioning. Note, that the only question he asked in this game so far was completely shrugged off by Shinobi. He had all the reason to go down on him on any point, starting with \"you're avoiding my question\". Instead, he dropped it completely, as if he didn't care about it himself, or even silently admitted, that it was worthless... And instead makes some off-hand comments about random banter and game setup. He reads the topic, that is clearly visible. He knows what's going on. As I said before - he's here around, he just doesn't want to participate in scumhunting. That's why it's more damning in his case.<br>\n<br>\nActualy, I re-read the thread in the meantime, and noticed that most things mentioned in this post also applies to Taly.

This is a setup theory, or \"outguessing the mod\" post. Those are inevitable... Around D3 or D4, when we have a decent amount of flips. Right now, this is pointless at best, distracting at worst. Actually, this whole \"Wolfy\" thing (which was the topic in post 119) is incredibly silly, and I cannot believe some people are actually wasting their time and energy on this. Werewolves is an alternative name for a game we're playing here. Wolf is another word for Scum. I'm hailing myself from the Werewolves games background (Giant in the Playground game-forum), so this terminology is completely normal to me, and so will for Shinobi, who apparently also played a game of Werewolves in his life. It's like a difference between American and British English (movie theater vs cinema etc.).

I can't talk about ongoing games but I'm sure if you looked at my profile and my posts you would very quickly understand. <br>\n<br>\nFurther, the game was kind of not really going anywhere and there was nothing worth talking about the last time I checked in. I lecture four classes of 75 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday, so you'll notice a pattern in my posting where Tuesdays and Thursdays my posting drops way off. It's never going to be alignment indicative. Further, I frequently am busy on Wednesday grading homework/quizzes/exams so that my students can get helpful information on what they need to work on as quickly as possible. Since I teach a dead language that hasn't been spoken in around 1700 years, I've found that my students do better by having feedback as quickly as possible after they are tested on new material. <br>\n<br>\nSo now the question I have for you is: why are you going around looking for low hanging fruit? Do you think that everyone should somehow magically have substantive posts coming out of RVS, regardless of other commitments and regardless of whether or not there is anything worth talking about? I pointed out the one thing that struck me as odd so far, and then went to work on grading exams (Koine Greek 3rd Declension nouns plus all preceding content, for anyone familiar with the language). I actually spent so long grading exams yesterday that I went without sleep and lectured today on no sleep and napped afterward. Thankfully, exam review for 1/2 my classes made this doable.

It was lighter today, so I'm a bit more active. That doesn't mean anything. We all have our own lives outside of the game that limits us, sure. The important part is about showing what we can do with our actual spare time (which, to reiterate the point, you spend on posting \"Godwin's Law\" instead of addressing answer to your own question).

My attention changing from Shinobi to Freeko was to see if I'd get information that would clear the muddled waters on my stance on one of them.

One of the biggest problems with a slow day phase is that it allows scum to just easily hide and avoid leaving the vital clues necessary for us to win later on. Only by getting everyone to actually engage in the game and be active will we maybe find some actual slips or something to go on so that day one doesn't get dominated by obsession over non-issues. <br>\n<br>\nRealistically I know we can't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">force</div> people to say more than they want to, but applying pressure should force them to at least commit something to the game for later analysis, as day one usually becomes a source of lots of useful information later on. Poking the lowest activity players and possibly using some votes (hopefully others will help me) might force everyone to engage and commit to the game today though. <br>\n<br>\nTomorrow, if this weird activity thing hasn't sorted itself, I am going to use a less scattershot approach to prodding the lurkers into acting. Everyone who is currently skating by without really putting anything of note into the thread should take notice and start participating; be part of the solution instead of more of the problem for us to overcome. Lulls in activity like this aren't really something I expect when a game starts out so active and features a few players really driving the game (Col. Cathart comes immediately to mind). <br>\n<br>\nLurksacks, incidentally, are the players that I find myself really disliking a lot. Usually they have a negative impact on the game because they are either scum skating through until the late game, or they are useless town who scum can use for late lynches, especially when it comes down to MYLO/LYLO situations. Barring real life complications, everyone should be able to make some actual contribution to the game thread at least every day or two, if not more often. <br>\n<br>\nThis is probably the only time I'm going to direct this to the game in general instead of going after people who continue to be lurksacks.

If letting people know who you think is who gives way for easier communication and details, then what would it matter? If scum tried to manipulate the town, then it'd most likely be obvious since they wouldn't be so conducive to the towns thinking(inconsistencies in being genuine or truthful), furthermore - for them to preserve themselves for survival, they'd more or less openly detract from the towns ideas of revealing information. (Via, stalling, withholding info., quick to assume - etc.) In this case, anyone who doesn't say as much in the towns benefit - is most likely working against the town. Since this entails that they aren't doing much to keep the town together.<br>\n<br>\nThis is a theory I'm putting thought into myself - partially I use when looking at people for scum candidates - I'm just saying, practically, revealing both town and scum reads can be useful.

So I don't get why you're saying it was a negative that I didn't jump on it because I was unavailable and I later verified my position in part. What more would you want?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This shit doesn't even make sense.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt certainly does.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt;</div>You originally pushed me because I said very little about you in comparison to freeko and Shinobi.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt;</div>I explained my current position after a back and forth - a lot of it indicating that you wanted me to do some sort of action against you for whatever reason.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt;</div>I backed off of you, and now again when we are doing a back and forth:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt;</div>You tell me that my vote on you was an OMGUS, and everything in that post - that made YOU unvote and back off - is now something worthy to add into a case against me.<br>\n<br>\nSo unless you're digging up things either out of context, or not conducive to your cases thinking - I don't know how you're not trying to twist things in your favor. You already said people are going to start questioning me for your case, and you wanted this to happen. It may seem like you're trying to manipulate a town to see your notion on my posts versus them making their own input.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You go out of your way to be obvious about it.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nPlease tell me how obviousness is a scumtell - I'm pretty sure scum would most likely be far less overt in putting a notion in keeping the town together.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, how can you say I'm going out of my way? My post wasn't solely just dedicated to the very idea to point out \"OH, we are all doing this - town!\" - NO, I made my opinion on my general reads, and I made my unvote on you and did some digression as to why - as well as furthering my uncertainty towards freekos reactions at that time.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nI didn't mention freeko's name anywhere in my case against you. Nice misrep, brah.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI wasn't quite sure what cog diss meant. I interpreted that as you throwing some knives - that was misunderstanding. In any case, you were saying that I was going back and forth about freeko, when your press in this part of the case against me was about freeko and my position over him. The way you're conducting yourself in how you see my responses makes me think you're lacking care about this.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Another misrep. <br>\n<br>\nYou said you wouldn't unvote him regardless because he was too detrimental to town.

{"number": 451, "id": "6704328", "user": "freeko", "user_id": "10365", "content": "I dont really feel like helping the same jackasses that are so stupidly thumping their chests in an attempt to policy lynch me, when they all know I am town. For all I care they really can just shoot themselves in the foot. They set this up so basically no matter what I did or will do at this point simply will not be good enough. Whatever. Those elements caused this, not me.<br>\n<br>\nSo lets isolate everyone, and I will do it in alphabetical order just because.<br>\n<br>\nArcAngel9: Yeah, nothing. Literally nothing. Trying to defend Shinobi and attack texcat with the one post of value made so far. Possible scum, but holy hell there is really nothing to go with here.<br>\n<br>\nCol.Cathart: Tryhards early on and FoS'd me, then replaces out.<br>\nTitus: Less of a tryhard, unvotes the vote that was in play then does nothing. All told, for now null as there seemed to be no real stance taken by Titus. Could be scum just trying to stay away from the flashfire but I doubt it for now.<br>\n<br>\ndragonspawn: Go back to the newbie queue where you belong, seriously. Flounders about with about 20 useless posts then takes the bait to try to easily lynch me. Pretty sure between jerking about and everything else, his post #33 in isolation makes me think he is scum with Shinobi. Rest of his garbage is \"scumhunting\" by attempting to interact with me.<br>\n<br>\nDrixx: Blah, looks to be jerking about by posting nothing. His unvoted vote was on dragonspawn, so blah to his unvote too. It was meaningless.<br>\n<br>\nElbirn: Definition of a jackass. Probably even the picture example of it. Votes me knowing that I am town, so is just garbage. Either a giant jackass or scum, but cannot tell which. Likely a jackass though.<br>\n<br>\nFA_Q2: Coasting scum as far as I can see. Parking his vote while trying to look like he is doing something, which he is not. Between scum and being a jackass, I would say more scum than jackass but a heaping pile of either is likely. For now, null.<br>\n<br>\nHouse: You go last. Back of the bus with you.<br>\n<br>\nKlingoncelt: Jackass meter spiking. Ready to run off and lynch me at a moments notice while posting nothing of value in the interim. So useless.<br>\n<br>\nShinobi: This is the one that scares me. I cant help but think scum #1 is right here. Post #146 he \"seconds the motion\" for my policy lynch, but later avoids voting for me like the plague. Which is it? Yeah thats a scum trying to stay away from suspicion right here.<br>\n<br>\nTaly: So much tryharding, and the reason why I hate day 1 in mafia games. Someone that should be looked at later on in the game when context can be given toward what happened during this game day. Null to jackass reading for now.<br>\n<br>\ntexcat: Just about as useless as Elbirn. Though like Shinobi seems to be avoiding me like the plague as another scum not wanting to be held accountable for my lynch.<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon: Seemed real adamant about things early on, went v/la and felt like some others to just park a \"safe\" vote on me this morning. Alot of garbage here, yet no one calls him out for it. Mostly null, but the parked vote on me looks more scum than jackass.<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me to the main event, House. Originally voting me in post #100 for a joke post i made because I hate stupid images like the one being posted for no reason right before that vote. A brain aneurysm later, switches over to Taly. repeatedly said that Taly would be the person he is voting for between a few more brain aneurysms because I refused to bow down and cooperate with him. Will likely prove to be a giant jackass throughout the game, but I am not pleased with him. Literally starts and fans the flames, then cries to the mod because I pretty much dont care to give in to his bullshit. Pretty much the ringleader behind the whole policy lynch on me as he cant stop floudering about between \"giving me a chance\" and \"omg policy lynch him immediately\". In the end it was all a lie with giving me a chance, and Taly is likely a jackass with house being scum in my opinion as Taly would be no different of a mislynch than I am.", "time": "Tue Mar 24, 2015 10:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

Someone that should be looked at later on in the game when context can be given toward what happened during this game day. Null to jackass reading for now.<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me to the main event, House. Originally voting me in post #100 for a joke post i made because I hate stupid images like the one being posted for no reason right before that vote. A brain aneurysm later, switches over to Taly. repeatedly said that Taly would be the person he is voting for between a few more brain aneurysms because I refused to bow down and cooperate with him. Will likely prove to be a giant jackass throughout the game, but I am not pleased with him. Literally starts and fans the flames, then cries to the mod because I pretty much dont care to give in to his bullshit. Pretty much the ringleader behind the whole policy lynch on me as he cant stop floundering about between \"giving me a chance\" and \"omg policy lynch him immediately\". In the end it was all a lie with giving me a chance, and Taly is likely a jackass with house being scum in my opinion as Taly would be no different of a mislynch than I am.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSnipped out the parts I wanted.<br>\n<br>\n1. I like that bit about Shinobi and I've forgotten why I'm not voting for him.<br>\n<br>\n2. Regarding Taly. You seem pretty sure sure she would be a \"mislynch\" in that last paragraph there? Is it solely because of your House scumread? Your analysis of her above that paragraph doesn't sound like you're indicating that she's town, and it isn't until House is brought up that you propose a town-taly.", "time": "Wed Mar 25, 2015 5:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

All I've done thus far is combat your case with reasoning from what I've picked up throughout this game, and proceed to ask questions and confirm stances with other people. If you're going to call me scummy because I'm supposedly \"taking advantage\" of you and manipulating you, then you seriously need to go back and re-read some posts and re-evaluate your case on me.<br>\n<br>\nOtherwise, entertaining your remarks trying to dismiss my accurate responses only tells me you're stalling for any flame on me to pick up - and you're just going to love if it gets your way. Because you've made your intentions clear in quote wars - you just want the drama you've been throwing at me to pick up, and you seem to care very little on how it affects town... Want to know how I know that?<br>\n<br>\nYou're not taking me seriously. If I am your main scum read, then you should be the most in tuned with what I'm having to tell you - because I have just as much power as a townie. I got a voice, and a reason - where's yours?

I saw a note that I would be prodded soon. I gave the real life context for being busy, but you seem to have missed it so I will expand. In my profession I have many gaps of time that last for a few minutes at a time as I wait between class times after answering student questions and before the next class begins, or between student appointments during office hours, and many similar such things. It is rarely possible for me to get any significant work done in these times; certainly it's not really possible for me to allocate that time to my own research and writing endeavors. Thus, I found myself looking through free apps on my iPhone some months ago and came across an NBA themed one that connects with a game I play on my PC, and provides me some free currency daily that I would otherwise have to pay for. It also features short little \"card battles\" that take about 30 seconds, making it fairly perfect for the little spaces of otherwise useless times I have in my life. <br>\n<br>\nEvery so often, this app features something called a \"Rival's Clash\" pitting two teams against each other. The most recent one started yesterday and will continue through Sunday. I doubt I shall do this ever again, but I decided I would like to finish in the top 100 in the event's leaderboard, and get a nice reward in the app for doing so. <br>\n<br>\nSo, unless you lot get up to something truly interesting soon, I'm likely to keep watching and taking notes and doing my thing. My job is to pay attention and analyze what people say and try to figure out who the scum are so I can convince the rest of you lot to kill them. When I've got a solid case, you'll know it.", "time": "Fri Mar 27, 2015 7:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

In hindsight, it was probably too obvious a breadcrumb, but it's still very anti-town to take something that's not an actual claim and draw attention to it. I did my best to shrug it off and make out like I was joking, and then I put up the above breadcrumb so that observant townies would see I had crumbed it twice. <br>\n<br>\nSo now to lynch the scum ... probably starting with Dragonspawn. I'm fairly certain he's experienced enough to know that you don't point out hints and breadcrumbs.

If I want my role to be useful, I need to find a way for even a small handful of townies to see it and thus have a block of people who will help keep me from being mislynched, preferably without the scum catching on.

BP is one of the weaker town roles as you have to be able to attract a night kill attempt to get utility out of it, and I am not confident enough in dropping an obvious breadcrumb that I'm a doc or a cop or something without drawing out the actual people with those roles. Almost every role should be willing to gladly sacrifice 1-for-1 to get scum. You could make a good argument that a cop wants to get more utility than that, but any role that is unlikely to directly out scum should be willing to make that exchange pretty much every time (unless doing so would cost the game, obviously). <br>\n<br>\nI'm confused why this doesn't make sense to you.", "time": "Tue Mar 31, 2015 4:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

I mean for serious there are people here on this site who <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">routinely</div> hammer people without giving them a chance to say anything, and they do it so frequently it's not alignment indicative of them. I'm a bit confused at why I'm being pre-crucified for accidentally hammering. <br>\n<br>\nIf you are seriously scum reading me for the hammer, then what was my motive? It's not like Shinobi had claimed and I was swooping in to ensure he would die. I saw someone claim an investigative guilty on him. I voted for him. It's that simple. If I had realized there were so many on his wagon, I wouldn't have done it. It's not my style no matter my alignment. And yes, the obvious best play would have been to get the claim and then do as you suggested.

If anything, town having Tracker, Doctor, Cop and BP (at least) should scare the crap out of us.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, my \"theory\" of the crime with Varsoon giving a false guilty on Shinobi looks a lot more accurate with KC flipping as a role cop. It seems like a scum team with daytalk might make that play. If Varsoon actually has the history of making really risky plays as town, then he has his meta to fall back on as a way to talk himself out of getting lynched. <br>\n<br>\n@Titus - Yesterday was always going to be between Varsoon and KC, so again there's literally zero reason for a town Varsoon to mention Miller in the post that he did. If KC had claimed Miller first, I could see him mentioning it. Otherwise, there's just no town motivated reason to say \"I'm a miller, and oh by the way sorry about yesterday. I'm town guys, honest, and I faked a guilty result because I thought that guy was scum and oops he was town cop ... my bad. You should totally not lynch me though because it's perfectly reasonable for me to gamble the entire game on a roll of the dice. Oh, and did I mention I'm a miller, so if there's a 2nd cop don't bother investigating me because it will say I'm scum, but that's just because I'm a miller.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe most likely motive for mentioning Miller in that post was to have a ready made explanation for a guilty result on him if he managed to talk his way out of being lynched and town has a 2nd cop who investigated him. You seem to think that there's town motive there because the <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">result</div> was a 1v1 choice of lynch ... but that only even occurs to you in hindsight. The whole thing yesterday looks like a mafia orchestrated attempt to confuse the town. Consider:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>We <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">know</div> scum had a role cop, and thus could have known Shinobi was a town cop <br>\n</li><li>We <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">know</div> scum have daytalk, so KC's play yesterday should be evaluated with that in mind<br>\n</li><li>We <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">know</div> that Varsoon lied about having a guilty result and cost us a/the town cop<br>\n</li><li>The <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">only reason</div> Varsoon has given us not to lynch him is some story about how he was sure enough that Shinobi was scum to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">LIE</div> about having a guilty on him, despite barely appearing to be involved in the game at all prior to that. </li></ul><br>\n<br>\nThe most simple explanation is usually the correct one. The most simple explanation is that Varsoon is scum, the scum team rolecopped Shinobi, Varsoon made the play to get him mislynched with some plan to avoid getting lynched the next day. If you assume Varsoon is scum, then everything we saw yesterday from Varsoon and KC looks like a daytalk coordinated attempt to confuse town and try and convince town that one or the other of them was not actually guilty. Both claimed miller (if KC had been believed, that makes her safe for a long time). Varsoon's entire argument not to lynch him is a \"my bad, I screwed up on a gambit\" excuse, which is total weaksauce. His miller claim looks like it was dropped into that post in order to let KC counterclaim him and hopefully get KC viewed as town for at least a day or two. <br>\n<br>\nThe most probable result of everything we've seen is that Varsoon is scum. His whole \"I knew we had a cop because I was a miller\" is patent bullshit. This is a mafia game. In what universe does a \"normal\" mafia game lack a cop? The miller claim from him was there <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">solely</div> to provide KC the opportunity to \"counterclaim\" and try to buy her town credibility. If you all let Varsoon off the hook, then we deserve to lose. The entire chain of events makes perfect sense and has logical motivations from all parties involved if Varsoon is scum. If you assume Varsoon is town, you have to make all sorts of irrational assumptions and strange motivations to try and make what we've observed make sense. <br>\n<br>\nIf you have to make a bunch of excuses for the evidence being wrong in order to believe something ... that something you are trying to believe is probably false. Let me quote a good author's explanation of the concept, as written in a fictional story:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'll prove it to you. Imagine that someone tells you they're keeping a dragon in their house. You tell them you want to see it. They say it's an invisible dragon. You say fine, you'll listen to it move. They say it's an inaudible dragon. You say you'll throw some cooking flour into the air and see the outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable to flour. And the telling thing is that they know, in advance, exactly which experimental results they'll have to explain away. They know everything will come out the way it does if there's no dragon, they know in advance just which excuses they'll have to make.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Varsoon</span>", "time": "Sat Apr 18, 2015 6:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=1250", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

Something <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">intended</div></div> or serving to convey a false impression; {emphasis added}<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSince Varsoon used the word as a noun, I won't go into the verb forms. The key requirement for something to be a lie is intent to deceive. Varsoon's first claim was that he was an investigator and had a mod confirmed guilty on Shinobi. That was a lie. He had intent to deceive, and succeeded, seeing as how we lynched Shinobi in the space of a single page. If Varsoon were scum, he would have no way to know my alignment, and thus he cannot characterize anything I say as a lie, because he doesn't know my alignment and therefore cannot charge me with intent. If he were town, he could argue that my suppositions are incorrect, or that my logic is in error somewhere. He has chosen not to respond to my case in any substantial way. He has simply reiterated his \"claim\" from yesterday. He hasn't even attempted to point out any errors in logic in the case I've made against him. <br>\n<br>\nNow he's down to the last resort of caught and cornered scum. \"Why are you guys lapping up Drixx's lies?\" - I haven't claimed that any of my supposition or logic is confirmed truth. I haven't represented my case as being absolute reality, as compared to ... let's say ... how <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">you claimed to have mod confirmed guilty results against Shinobi</div></div>. <br>\n<br>\nIt's kind of like when you were a kid and you played the game Clue. You could say \"I suspect that X did the murder in Room Y with Weapon Z\" and if anyone could prove that suspicion wrong they were obligated to do so. But at the end of the game when you were sure you had all the right answers, you would make an accusation and look inside the little evidence envelope and see if you were right and had won or if you were wrong and had to sit in shame and watch the rest of the kids finish playing the game. <br>\n<br>\nIt's really quite amusing to watch you squirm and see how small your bag of tricks really is.

I'd rather people not crucify me because they don't know the difference between whether something is logically valid or logically sound.

If you didn't, hopefully this will help you in future games {and this one?} to sort through things which you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">know</div> to be true, and things which <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">might</div> be true.", "time": "Sun Apr 19, 2015 3:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

I'm not inclined to lynch him. He is the closest we have to a confirmed town and although I'm not enjoying his play at all. I find it very anti town, he really hasn't participated enough to make me confident in a scum read. If he is scum, chances are the scum are going to kill us this game. Town read for him.<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon - fake claims cop and gets our cop killed. And if this wasn't mylo I'd say lynch him so we don't have a question. He also hammered quickly to end day 2. Possible scum. But as I've mentioned before over been playing several games where a townie fake claims cop and a guilty on another townie. One I recently finished Nero Cain claimed a guilty,lynched a townie and ended up surviving to the end being the most valuable town player. Needless to say my recent experience leads me to be a bit cautious to lynch Varsoon in a mylo situation. Especially with the Miller claim. Why would scum who wasn't investigated claim he is a miller only to have his partner counter claim. It makes no sense to me and I hate when things make no sense. He definitely one of the top choices to look at though.<br>\n<br>\nDrixx - claimed bulletproof day 1. I believed him initially. not as sure now. Hammering the cop without a chance to claim is highly suspicious. I know how drixx is going to respond but it is no matter the reasoning, it looks suspicious. It looks like he was trying to the thread locked before shinobi could respond. If it had succeeded, we would not have had a guilty on grandma and the scum may have won already.<br>\n<br>\nI have considered the fact that Varsoon and drixx were partners. It's possible they knew shinobi was a cop from Klingon investigating and saw shinobis's naked vote for Klingon as a suspicion that shinobi had a guilty on her. Thus a gambit to end the day before the guilty comes out officially and a chance to keep their role cop alive longer.<br>\n<br>\nBut would their risk a gambit on that? And why kill house when he was focused elsewhere unless they knew his role too and deemed it as a threat? Leaning scum on drixx too. Either with Varsoon or not. It seriously looks to me that he wanted to shut down that days discussion and found an opportunity. <br>\n<br>\nTaly is someone I've been wanting to townread.

When you get back ... are you familiar with the difference between Deductive and Inductive reasoning? What you've done looks much more deductive (start with a theory and look for evidence that can support or invalidate it) than inductive (start by examining the evidence and letting it take you to the theory). The problem with deductive reasoning in mafia is that you cannot rely on everything you see in the game to be true or accurate. A second problem with deductive reasoning in mafia is that it's not easy to distinguish a townie making an honest effort to evaluate the various possibilities (as your post appears to do) from a scum who has a particular theory he wants to try and sell to the game. Both the townie and the scum will put up posts that appear to be deductive (excepting cases where <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very</div> good scum can make their case look inductive). <br>\n<br>\nThe best approach for a townie is always inductive. Don't theorize anything on your first pass. Go through the game and interactions and see what they tell you. This should generally give you some competing valid theories. The second pass is where you test those theories by whichever method suits you. My approach is twofold. I first try and find something that makes a particular theory unlikely or something that causes confusion. If I can cross out a theory for good reasons, then that helps me narrow things down. I also try and do a very honest evaluation where I assume someone is town and see if his posts and actions make sense from a town mindset, and then assume that the same person is scum and see if the posts and actions make sense from that mindset. I've caught a lot of scum by assuming they were town and having a lot of posts and actions that didn't make sense or were not consistent with other parts of their play. I've also cleared people I was <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sure</div> were scum because there was no viable scum motive that made sense of their posts and actions, but being a townie in the dark totally made it all make sense. <br>\n<br>\nThis approach is why I'm so sure of my theory explaining what we saw yeSterday (someone recently introduced me to this: yestderday = real life yesterday while yeSterday = the prior day phase yesterday; same with toMorrow and tomorrow).", "time": "Sun Apr 19, 2015 5:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

Neither of you addressed the fact that we had a no kill night that I initially speculated might have been a test of my BP claim, but which now seems just as likely to have been a doc save. The reason it's scummy that neither of you (more especially Titus) responded is because that's the sort of thing that Titus usually jumps all over. She ignored it when it happened. She ignored it when I pointed it out again. The original situation was kind of hectic and scum could easily have read me speculating but dismissed it because they knew they didn't target me and had likely just gotten the rolecop result on Elbirn (him dying the following night makes it pretty clear they found him as I'm pretty sure he didn't crumb or give off any indications he was doc). <br>\n<br>\nIn context, it makes sense for scum to just gloss over my speculation. It doesn't make sense for town!Titus to ignore that though. It also doesn't make sense for Varsoon to have ignored it both times. <br>\n<br>\nFurther, the Varsoon + Titus pairing gains steam when you realize that Titus is who put Shinobi at L-1 without saying so, leaving me there to derphammer without realizing I was doing it. I asked before some questions and I'll re-iterate:<br>\n<br>\nWhich is more scummy: hammering (intentionally or not) someone without first giving intent and demanding a claim <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">or</div> putting someone at L-1 and not noting that you have done so?<br>\n<br>\nWhere are scum more likely to be found? (The wiki and theory threads say that scum generally don't like to start wagons or hammer them(unless they have a guilty claim to hide behind)). <br>\n<br>\nSo Titus looks scummy for acting out of character and for putting Shinobi at L-1 without saying anything. <br>\n<br>\nVarsoon looks scummy because the critical part of the game (from the guilty claim through yesterday's stuff) makes complete sense if you assume a scum motivation for Varsoon, and becomes completely confusing if you assume he's town. He gets additional scum points for trying to prosecute me for hammering Shinobi (with a claimed guilty result on him!), but hasn't given Titus even a smidgen of grief over putting Shinobi at L-1 without saying anything. <br>\n<br>\nI could be wrong, but when I try and assume Taly or Dragon or AA9 are scum, I can't really make sense of the game and people don't seem to have proper motives or behavior for the posited alignments. Varsoon pointed out that sometimes you can evaluate things rationally and get it wrong, and that's true, but this is how I work games. I look for inconsistencies. I look for things which make sense if I assume someone is scum but make no sense if I assume they are town, etc... and that has resulted in a really high win rate for years and years. I came to MS to get better and to expose myself to different playstyles and to learn new stuff. In this case, either what I already know how to do has worked, or scum did a very good job making it look like they're town. <br>\n<br>\nEven good scum usually get caught when you start evaluating for consistency and motive and matching up actions with events. The longer the game goes on, the more PoE you can do using that kind of rational evaluation. If, by some slim chance, I am wrong ... then I'll have a lot to learn from this game. But I think I've got it nailed, and the reactions (and lack thereof) seem to confirm my thinking. <br>\n<br>\n--------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nSince it has been brought up a few times, let me give my thoughts about the whole \"no lynch\" thing. The upside is that if we are truly in MYLO we should see another kill flip which might help us. Presumably scum would kill AA9. So if we just assume AA9 is dead, does that make the decision any easier? I don't think so. <br>\n<br>\nDownside? It's much easier for scum to get a mislynch in LYLO than MYLO. I think we need to try and lynch scum today. There doesn't seem to be a realistic upside to giving initiative to scum and letting them make a move that either gives us nothing new to go on or potentially confuses us more, while also making it easier for them to get a mislynch and win.", "time": "Mon Apr 20, 2015 6:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61108&start=1350", "forum": "53", "thread": "61108"}

Why did you feel the need to attempt a character assassination? You can look at my completed games for a priori evidence that I look at people's profiles and get a feel for them. As you so helpfully pointed out, we have no completed games together, so how on earth could I have any actual idea how you behave as town or as scum if I hadn't gone and did some reading? First, you imply that I'm skirting the rule about making specific reference to incomplete games, and then you defeat that argument by pointing out that only a complete moron would try and make any sort of rational analysis or reach conclusions based upon such information. I'm super confused. {Before you point out what I said earlier concerning civility, please note that I was already warned that even that sort of very broad and general reference is outside the rules, so it borders on the asinine to imply that I would make that mistake again after having been warned about it}<br>\n<br>\n2.) #1470 simply isn't an actual response to the post Taly made linking to dozens of your posts spanning several game days.
