Vote counts will be as close to the top of the page as humanly possible.<br>\n4. If I make a mistake, tell me.<br>\n5. Don't discuss the game outside the thread or designated quicktopics. Round these parts we call that cheatin'.<br>\n6. Don't quote mod&lt;-&gt; player interactions.<br>\n7. Day deadlines are 14 days. Extensions are rare.<br>\n8. Send me a PM or post in thread if you are gonna be V/LA. Don't just post in the V/LA thread, I'm not a regular subscriber.<br>\n9. Prods are 48 hours of inactivity. Another 48 hours without a response and out ya go. I'll replace ya.<br>\n10. Majority rules. It takes a majority to lynch. That's over 50%, not exactly 50%. If by deadline there is no majority, than there is no lynch.<br>\n11. Once you lynch, we go into night. Nights will be 48 hours long.<br>\n12. No bah posts. Sorry.<br>\n13. Blue is my color, not yours. That means all the blues are mine. Don't use them.<br>\n14. Anything illegal to do is illegal to fake.<br>\n15. These rules are subject to change by yours truly.<br>\n16.

I skimmed a couple of day one's from you, Parama, and generally you are a bit of of a boy in those. What I mean by that is that you are a tad aggressive, a bit trying to work your way up the pecking order. Here, you either got outbluffed by (amongst other actions) petapan's fakeclaim, or you simply didn't bother. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know if I have to see your random vote for crypto in this light, since you never pressed it. What is clear from that is that right at the start you were aware of crypto playing in this game and if you hated playing with him I think you'd have replaced out right then. The fact that you waited till now to request replacement seems to show that the game wasn't going your way. I could expatiate on that, but regardless of how I do that, the only way in which you could know already at this point that the game isn't going your way is if you are scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote parama</div>", "time": "Fri Jun 29, 2012 3:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}

Your behaviour in the first couple of pages was just very jumpy and quick to draw conclusions, not really what I'd expect out of a town player. Worryingly, you were willing to support, if I get your sentiments right, a quicklynch of bvoigt without a proper claim from or input from a lot of players.<br>\n<br>\nTo be honest, the only reason the above paragraph isn't in red is because, having checked, it appears to mirror your meta too.<br>\n<br>\nYou call Gregory \"obvtown\" for appearing enthusiastic to hunt scum.

Was the wording simply for effect, or were you actually worried at bvoigt being at -2?<br>\n<br>\nand then incredulity at people believing Peta's claim, fluff.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">flinter</div><br>\nLots of content in her posts, she generally seems quite town to me, so far, but, a couple of things do catch my eye. Her opinion on the reaction test. The theory is solid enough, but doesn't take into account that a lot of players hadn't posted up the that point, and wouldn't have had the chance to bus bvoigt were he to be scum. Also, me and evilpacman did vote for bvoigt based upon Peta's fakeclaim, which could have been bussing too. Up to this point, 3 people hadn't posted, and, there was just less than 3 hours between the initial claim and Peta retracting it, it's absolutely possible that quite a few players had no chance to post between then. While it is slightly more likely, using your theory, that bvoigt is town rather than scum, taking what I said into account, the difference in chance could well be negligible at best. Furthermore, using the rest of us as a bellwether for whether you think bvoigt is scum or not does absolve you of responsibility there.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, why were you so keen to know scumhunter better? I'm sure there are other players here you don't know very well either. And, why would you trust crypto's opinion alone on this? He might have reason to deceive you.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">FuDuzn</div><br>\nWhy did you ask why bvoigt felt obliged to answer Parama's question?<br>\n<br>\nHe called for a Policy Lynch on Sleepy. Well, I guess your opinion on them may legitimately differ to mine, but, far as I'm concerned, Policy Lynches are inherently bad and antitown. Why do you feel a Policy Lynch on Sleepy would be acceptable?

It's interesting. I think it's potentially a legitimate opinion (not an opinion that I agree with, but it is one) just because crypto is a one-line poster and that doesn't sit well with a lot of people. Servanto's quite the one-line poster himself so far though, and so it's hypocritical. Plus his one lines, ignoring the fact that there's far fewer of them than crypto's, have an average of less content, see iso 0, 2, 3, and 4.  That's a nice 66% contentless posts. It's a bit early for this cuz he probably hasn't really read the game yet. Another thing that caught my eye was the exchange in 275 and 276. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gregory didn't go out of his way to welcome any of the other replacements, and so the interaction seems to me like there's some sort of solidarity going on in between them.</div> This is a bit of a stretch, I know, but considering Gregory is one of my scum reads, I think it will be more relevant when we actually have a flip from him. That being said:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Gregory</div><br>\nI notice peta said the same thing I just did in 287 so that makes me feel a bit better about my opinions, although I think with a little more of Servanto's posts since that point, it helps to add that he's being hypocritical.<br>\nScumhunter, I don't know what you want from me. Yes some of my posts aren't serious. So? I post content when I post content and if I seem noncommittal for any reason it's probably because my scum reads aren't as strong this game as they are or have been in other games, but that just happens. I can't be 100% sure I have the scum team in 15 pages every game. 5 and 8 were a semi-joke and an indication that I might read Armageddon as scummy but without actually saying I think he's scum just yet. Maybe you didn't like the wording of 9 but I'm still leaning scum on Manju for that, so from my POV it's not fluff. Oh and hey, you just admitted in 303 that your reads are especially weak this game, so I'm thinking it might actually be an indication that you, peta, and I are all town if we're all having a weirdly weak game.<br>\nbvoight: no, because I'm leaning town on SH now. His case on me was weak and mildly scummy I thought but I didn't wanna call him scum because I might just be biased from the fact that he thinks I'm scum. In light of his more recent posts, I'd guess I was right to hold back on that.<br>\nI actually kinda agree with a lot of 317 even though I'm still concerned about Jordan.<br>\n<br>\nI'm stretched for time, so I skimmed the last page and hardly read this one, I don't think petapan vs. scumhunter has much for me to discuss in it anyway.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe bolded is &#252;ber weak. I posted \"sup\" and he said \"welcome\" and you give that enough credence to vote for him? Pfft<br>\n<br>\nAnd as far as being a one line poster, I'm fine with it, as long as it appears to be posting that is going towards finding mafia. Cryptos posts have been short bouts of anger for the most part with a few that have givin some insight to his thinking. <br>\n<br>\nFunny you mistake substance with amount of words you can jot down.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis post is good, I agree with everything it says.

Now that's a much better question.<br>\n<br>\nGregory: I cover Jordan and Servanto in greater detail below. Armageddon's reads are bad but he showed signs of good posting and had some original thoughts, and didn't post enough to merit being lynched. Jordan contributed a good amount before his disappearance from post 181 to whatever his last post was and is really scummy. Servanto has contributed a little but is also very scummy in those few posts. Armageddon has contributed a little and is mildly scummy.<br>\n<br>\npetapan:<br>\nedit - Since writing the first paragraph below, I've decided that Jordan is my top scum read. I'll leave it intact so that the stream of consciousness is still visible.<br>\n<br>\nIn most games, I, and probably everyone, have that person or people who we are certain about being scum. But this game I don't. I've alluded to the fact that I'm having a harder time getting reads in this game than normal and I think it's safe to say I'm not the only one. I don't have a top scumread. That being said, I'm starting to form some connections and seeing a team that could work and I do have multiple people I'm leaning scum on I'm just not as convinced about it as much as normal. Here's a list of them, and some reasons why but I don't have enough specific information on anybody to form a full-fledged case. These are all based on isos, which as I just found out reading Gregory's, reading an iso can change my opinion quite a bit. I'm not sure if that's good or bad but here goes.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Servanto</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">spot is scummy but there's hardly enough content to judge. iso 1 is interesting because in his first post he becomes the only person in the game to attack you and crypto iirc. it's a bit ignorant but that brashness is probably the towniest thing he's done, if only because it's new. The problem with it, and part of why I think he's terribly scummy, is that after saying he doesn't think you're trying to hunt scum, he never follows up. Not only that, but his perceived lack of substance in crypto's posts can't have been a huge deal because his one liner posting style, if he'd maintained it a bit better, is pretty comparable to crypto's. So what I would EXPECT from the sort of stream of consciousness that would flow out of a town player posting 282, is a vote for you in 338. The vote for crypto over you requires more explanation, and only feigns consistency because he mentioned crypto in his first content post. Then in 349 his attack on my posit in 347 asserts, that it's weak, which isn't a good attack because I knew it was weak and said that. At this point his posting style is pretty obvious too and his attack on crypto for lack of content seems more like a generic attack using established scummy actions than something he legitimately believes, because there's hypocrisy there.<br>\nAfter looking through flinter's iso I noticed something interesting. Servanto and flinter both use the word \"odd\" to describe the events surrounding your daycop on bvoigt. Subconscious connection? I think it's more possible than probably anyone is willing to accept.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: flinter</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I've played with flinter in two games - <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15655\" class=\"postlink\">Mostly Mountainous</a> where we were both town (she replaced your hydra actually) and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=14983\" class=\"postlink\">NY 118</a> which was my first game on MS I think and one of the best games, if not the best I've ever played to this day. I was scum. We would have been scumbuddies if you hadn't replaced out. Anyway. First thing. Flinter has a history of reading me incorrectly. I suppose this is only relevant if she turns out to be town. In both games she was consistent but open minded and as such, interacted with people a lot. She's at least as consistent as she is in her town games here, but it looks like she's more closed off to the evolution of her reads, which haven't changed since pretty early on, and she's mostly quoting posts she thinks are scummy and saying why. In her town game, she seems to hold conversations with people, instead of quoting them and talking about them, whereas in this game, she's not speaking with people, but rather about people. It seems like she's simultaneously forcing her scumhunting while avoiding the interactions she normally has with people.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: bvoigt</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">This original read was based on his reaction to the daycop, which I didn't like and there was some inconsistencies in his read on you that stemmed from it. I think he just sees it differently than I do. On a second look, I actually like his posts. It seems like he has really natural town reactions to posts, and he plays with this style that sounds a lot like gut to me. He's also pretty dynamic in his reads, which could be scum flailing but is more likely to be open town. bvoigt, could you link me to a scum game of yours? Until I take a look at that, he's kind of swung to a town lean right now.<br>\nOh I forgot to mention, he follows up on questions, which is a big town tell for me because I notice a lot of the time that when scum ask questions, they don't necessarily care about the answers and so they don't follow up or they over react to someone ignoring it and start calling them scum.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Jordan</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">random.org RVS vote. I couldn't find any other example of him doing this in his other games. It's a free ticket out of RVS basically, I've seen people who it's part of their meta to use a RNG to vote in RVS every game but a one off thing seems like a good way to avoid making the wrong decision in RVS and getting caught right away (this happened to me once). Then take a look at his post #44. In it he asks petapan a question about the fake dayvig, which you ignored apparently, then you claimed daycop, then Jordan hopped on that wagon without a second thought. It's not the hopping on the wagon that bothers me, though he would be a bit dull to  neither leave it alone nor question it, but just the fact that he dropped the line of questioning he started in 44 within like 7 game posts is scummy as hell to me. He asks other questions later but doesn't follow up on all of them. Certain ones he does, in 154 particularly, he asks FuDuzn to answer his questions. That doesn't necessarily get him any town points though just cuz it looks like he's trying to set up the beginnings of a case on FuDuzn. He comes back in 317, having abandoned pretty much everything he thought 150 posts before. (to stick with my chronological order thing, I'll input here that there's an interesting defense of FuDuzn's claim of being stupid cuz he was drunk, possible connection) Well not everything, but there's a lot of holes in between his opinions from 181 and before to his opinions in 317 which doesn't make any sense, because 317 is basically a review of everything up to page 6, so he should have said it before. There's a huge discrepancy in the amount of information he garnered from the first time through to the second. The scumhunting seems forced. He doesn't seem to have any feel for peoples' posting as a whole. His game is targeting specific things and deciding if they're scummy or not. I think town (and maybe I'm just wanting him to play more like I play but I don't think so) in general are more prone to talk about an overall read they have on people, based not on specific things but an aggregate of all any given person's posts. I read his iso in Open 242, where Jordan was a VT until he replaced out, and it agrees with my theory that if he was town, he would be reading people with a more overarching approach.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSo like I said, Jordan is my top scum read and I'd vote him if he weren't currently being replaced.

So, which one of you on my wagon are scum pushing for the easy lynch of the new guy?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'd like to attempt to answer this question, if I may. With Bvoigt as town from the reaction test, Peta and Crypto as townreads, I really have trouble to believe the wagon on you is pushed by scum. Naturally, wagons pushed by town can be wrong as well, but when your first 5 posts have 3 posts that only say \"But I'm really town!\", I'm having more and more trouble to believe I'm on the wrong wagon Tammy. Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate you putting in the effort and replacing into a slot that has a lot of votes, but I think you are scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHmm...interesting.  My first post was a response to question asked to my predecessor.  \"Why shouldn't I hammer you?\" for a post he made.  I can't answer for my predecessor, so my only response for why he shouldn't hammer me, the replacement, is that I'm town and that I have work to do but will be reading and giving thoughts soon.  My other response is to another question and the third is to try to figure out who is on my derpwagon and why.  They don't only say \"But, I'm town\" and for you to characterize them as that and use it to say that's why you're still on my wagon doesn't make me feel any better about you and the flimsy reason you got on the derpwagon anyway.<br>\n<br>\nSure, it's entirely possible that an indecisive town got on Armageddon for lack of knowing what else to do, but it's also highly likely scum is there as well.  No one will have to answer for that lynch and as long as people pull the lame ass \"she doesn't have a town mindset\" they can stay there with impunity.<br>\n<br>\nYou say later you read my games.  I did the same thing upon replacing into NY146 when they were making the case that my slot was the serial killer.  Sure it annoyed the hell out of Magua, but whatever.  If I did nothing else, sure I can see you having an issue with it, but that was hardly the case.  I interacted with the people who were around before I had a chance to skim the game and give some of my thoughts.  Today, I'll iso people and give some more solid reads.  That's hardly me running around doing nothing but going \"I'm town\" which I am but whatever.<br>\n<br>\nWhy do you have bvoigt as town from the reaction test?  I didn't see anything town about the way he reacted.  I agree with you on Crypto; he's probably town.  The jury is out on peta though.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Flinter wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4186466#p4186466\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4186466#p4186466\" data-post-id=\"4186466\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 549</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18197\">Tammy</a> wrote:</cite>Oh Shinori!

In the end it's the town that decides, not an individual. All I can do is try to work in the town and try to make the right lynch happen.

A little above that, I wrote about what manju said, which applies to the case where you are town. It's not more then fair to write about the other case as well, which happens to be the one I believe in. So no, I don't mean to say that. I hope we'll lynch scum this way. I didn't randomly pick you, I think we have a good chance of getting scum day one and that would be cool!</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt would be cool if we lynched scum day one!  Now, join me in trying to find out who they are!  (Hint: If you want to hit scum day one, you're on the wrong wagon.)<br>\n<br>\nWell, of course you didn't randomly pick me.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around people thinking that Armaggedon had a good chance to flip scum.  </div></blockquote>Wait, this was never a spree. Apart from this vote I have always made a neat case trying to convince other people to join me. Bu tin the end, there are only a few that can ask for a certain lynch, most players have to actually answer that call to make it happen. Further, I fear I haven't thought that far ahead, I'm not that busy with what happens tomorrow. Sometimes people get lynched and sometimes they don't. In the end it's the town that decides, not an individual. All I can do is try to work in the town and try to make the right lynch happen. If a majority of the town thinks they should lynch me, what more can I do? In the end, trying to avoid the lynch is a waste of time: people usually don't get a say in their own lynch. So why be preoccupied with that?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI have absolutely no idea what you're talking about here.  You are the scum on my wagon aren't you flinter?<br>\n<br>\nYou say you try to make the right lynch happen, but then you're openly admitting to being on my wagon opportunistically.  Oh, I forgot.  Hey!  It might hit scum!  Why not!<br>\n<br>\nAre you honestly suggesting that people shouldn't fight their own lynch?  I've yet to be lynched as town and it's because I fight.  The only reason I'm not fighting this mislynch as hard as I would normally be is because I replaced into a slot that was already at L-1.  Too many people have already made up their minds about my predecessor and me, others are scum and certainly aren't going to fight an easy lynch whether or not they're on my wagon, and the rest of town is too apathetic.  My mislynch while fucking derp and stupid might actually benefit town.  Well, not my specifically because you'd be losing the sparkling benefit of playing with me, but the lynch of my slot in any case.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>flinter wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Perhaps working assumed he would flip town because he actually read Armaggedon's posts and realized that he's a newbie who should be read that way.<br>\n<br>\nWhat does Parama replacing out have to do with anything?

Parama was bugging me, and now manju that never even considers you could flip scum. I don't know, it just doesn't feel good.

If that wasn't in question, and I was just walking around going guys look at me I'm town dont' you see it.  Then there'd be a problem.

I fully believe that you know that I'm not scum.  I fully believe that you know that Armageddon was not scum, and I believe you knew that when you got on the wagon.  Peta was insistent, so you got on a wagon you wouldn't have to take any responsibility for.  You've admitted this.  You were opportunistic.  You are still being opportunistic and your reasons for staying on my derp wagon are flimsier than when you got on.

This is weak reasoning and your parking your vote on my wagon reeks of scum who doesn't know what else she should do because this is still an easy lynch you don't have to take responsibility for and anything else would mean you would gain notice and have to make a decision for yourself.

Are you trying to say he's scum because he has a town read on someone?  I've fought against lynches of people I have strong town reads on all the time.  Sometimes I don't allow for the possibility that they are scum.  Do you never have strong reads?  Peta has a strong scum read on Armaggedon and was insistent about it.  Why did you not find it suspicious that he seemed to not allow for the possibility that my slot is town?  Wouldn't that presuppose previous knowledge on his account?  Why is only working suspect for this?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>flinter wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, peta has a town read on working.  If you have such a town read on peta, that you're willing to follow him on my wagon, why aren't you following his town read of working?</div></blockquote>Because I'm not a mindless player? I don't mind following his read onto you, there was nothing against your wagon. But in the end, following one town player isn't the way to victory. Discussion should take place, to sharpen each other reads. And at the end of it, as town, you have to make sure you agree with each other. Sometimes I'll follow peta, and sometimes peta will see sense in my thoughts.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOkay!  Did you have a discussion about Armaggedon?  Let's check!!!

Some people put more effort in as town than scum and vice versa.  It depends on people's alignment preferences.  Yes, but it's rather rare that scum will go root around in people's old games to do anything but try to find something they can use to exploit.  If someone reads someone else's previous games, and comes back with a more positive view of a player because they see they're acting in a similar manner, then that is indicative of town.

I'm still voting you because you read as scum.  I recently iso'd you just to be sure.  I notice that your scum reads are pacman, working, and now me.  Your insistence on working being scum even though he reads pretty town demonstrates a scum mindset.  It looks to me like you came up with a few scum reads and are sticking to them because you can't figure out how you should change those reads and who else you would choose to mislynch in the process.  <br>\n<br>\nIt speaks to a too-consistent mindset, which scum often have because they are unable to change their minds based on new posts and information.  I got busted as scum once this way.  Someone had behaved in an outrageously scummy way at the start of the day and I got a wagon going on him.  However, he started towntelling all over the place by mid day one, but because I was scum I was being stubborn and kept trying to get him lynched even though all the evidence suggested that he was town and everyone was reading him that way.  My over-consistency on my reads and my refusal to take into account new information is in part what ended up getting me lynched instead that day.  This is exactly the type of behavior I'm seeing from you.<br>\n<br>\nNot only that but the reasons for your reads are extremely shallow and kind of silly.  Your holding onto this idea that because I've told you I'm town or said things about me being town is evidence of scum or further confirmation is rather silly.  You can't really come up with any reason for why I'm really scum, you just think I am!  I've noticed your scum reads are like this with others.

I also don't get the feeling he's stupid. He has earlier made a post where he said you wouldn't be that stupid (I think he was implying you are scum, it would be nice if crypto could confirm that). I skimmed a couple of day one's from you, Parama, and generally you are a bit of of a boy in those. What I mean by that is that you are a tad aggressive, a bit trying to work your way up the pecking order. Here, you either got outbluffed by (amongst other actions) petapan's fakeclaim, or you simply didn't bother. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know if I have to see your random vote for crypto in this light, since you never pressed it. What is clear from that is that right at the start you were aware of crypto playing in this game and if you hated playing with him I think you'd have replaced out right then. The fact that you waited till now to request replacement seems to show that the game wasn't going your way. I could expatiate on that, but regardless of how I do that, the only way in which you could know already at this point that the game isn't going your way is if you are scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote parama</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAgain, I like her analysis on Parama as he legitimately fell flat on his face.

The way he comes into that vote is I think what's bugging me is the last line \"And f it, vote crypto\".

It's interesting. I think it's potentially a legitimate opinion (not an opinion that I agree with, but it is one) just because crypto is a one-line poster and that doesn't sit well with a lot of people. Servanto's quite the one-line poster himself so far though, and so it's hypocritical. Plus his one lines, ignoring the fact that there's far fewer of them than crypto's, have an average of less content, see iso 0, 2, 3, and 4.  That's a nice 66% contentless posts. It's a bit early for this cuz he probably hasn't really read the game yet. Another thing that caught my eye was the exchange in 275 and 276. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gregory didn't go out of his way to welcome any of the other replacements, and so the interaction seems to me like there's some sort of solidarity going on in between them.</div> This is a bit of a stretch, I know, but considering Gregory is one of my scum reads, I think it will be more relevant when we actually have a flip from him. That being said:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Gregory</div><br>\nI notice peta said the same thing I just did in 287 so that makes me feel a bit better about my opinions, although I think with a little more of Servanto's posts since that point, it helps to add that he's being hypocritical.<br>\nScumhunter, I don't know what you want from me. Yes some of my posts aren't serious. So? I post content when I post content and if I seem noncommittal for any reason it's probably because my scum reads aren't as strong this game as they are or have been in other games, but that just happens. I can't be 100% sure I have the scum team in 15 pages every game. 5 and 8 were a semi-joke and an indication that I might read Armageddon as scummy but without actually saying I think he's scum just yet. Maybe you didn't like the wording of 9 but I'm still leaning scum on Manju for that, so from my POV it's not fluff. Oh and hey, you just admitted in 303 that your reads are especially weak this game, so I'm thinking it might actually be an indication that you, peta, and I are all town if we're all having a weirdly weak game.<br>\nbvoight: no, because I'm leaning town on SH now.

I posted \"sup\" and he said \"welcome\" and you give that enough credence to vote for him?

Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate you putting in the effort and replacing into a slot that has a lot of votes, but I think you are scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4186466#p4186466\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4186466#p4186466\" data-post-id=\"4186466\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 549</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18197\">Tammy</a> wrote:</cite>Oh Shinori!

I realize that peta is going to get you guys to push through my mislynch today because I'm evil.  Whatever.  LOOK AT MY WAGON!!!!!!!!!  IT'S AN EASY LYNCH OF A NEWBIE AND SCUM ARE HANGING ON IT.

I see a chance and I'm trying to take it. I literally hop onto a then growing wagon, after peta and crypto. Manju calls me out, saying that I would supposedly blame crypto and peta for said lynch, should it be on town. <br>\n<br>\nAt that point I tell manju he's wrong in that reasoning: people should always blame me, if armageddon/tammy turns out to be town. After all, I hopped on with little reasons given other then that I trusted peta's judgement, and saw no scum on the wagon. <br>\n<br>\nThen why do I make this vote? Suppose armageddon/tammy is scum! Then suddenly my flimsy vote is no longer so flimsy, because which scum would hop onto a two man wagon with no reasoning? I'm opportunistic, I think the odds of armageddon/tammy ending up scum are good, and I'm trying to make that lynch happen.<br>\n<br>\nOn second thought, while I was writing this, a question entered my mind: why did working manju assume armageddon/tammy would flip town? <br>\n<br>\nThird thought: he did replace parama. I think I'm still up for that wagon as well, should it come.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBasically the rest of the quotes make me think the same thing.

Here, his last post was June 30. However, I only just saw that he flaked or replaced out of 2 other games in the past (and he flaked out of 1259). So I guess that point isn't valid. However, I have other reasons to think you're scum.<br>\n<br>\nI know Tammy always announces that she's town (pointlessly). But in this game, she goes above and beyond. It seems to me like she knows her town meta, and is trying to match it, but overcompensating. Again, I know it's part of her playstyle, but when you know your meta, you can manipulate it.

Pacman said in our dead qt that this game was in need of replacements and I replaced in to help out.  This game is pretty much a train wreck and if I'd read it first I might not have replaced in, so yeah, really don't care about whether I live or die.

That doesn't take time to answer and it could be as small as a sentence.  Is it bad that I want an answer from something considering I admitted to being lazy on reading for part of the thread (Pretty much skipped a few pages sand skimmed posts).<br>\n<br>\nAnd in response to the second part that was more or less a joke.  I don't believe I've ever seen something like that unless you want to bring SFMM2 Prims, whereas I was scum and the entire scum team was constantly trying to bus me to be lynched because I was permanently lynch-docced.

And you sound like a town one. Try to follow me here, because although I'm quite sure it makes sense, it's fiddly. <br>\n<br>\nWhen you are scum, at some point you have to fake you are scumhunting. As long as this game is subjective, this will be possible. You won't find scum not making a case. Everybody, everywhere will always have a way to call something scummy, whether it's actually done by scum or not. However, when things are fake or not, it's the motivation behind them that matters. Ultimately, it's the difference between believing you'll lynch scum or pushing a wagon while knowing it's on town. <br>\n<br>\nYou could abuse this in several ways, as there are several things different about them. In one, you are lynching someone, in the other you are pushing a mislynch. One is based on hope, the other on knowledge. What hope does tammy have with my lynch? Even if she'd <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">pushed</div> it for all the logical reasons, she doesn't believe I'm scum, and the results are here. Sure I can be lynched, but I very much doubt it'll happen here. Some people have expressed to see me town, some have expressed that they rather take a look at me after a night. It's a hopeless wagon, still she pushes it. She asks people \"what they think about me\", or how they can ever see this and that action as town. You are right in that someone is faking, because this tammy on this wagon is playing the shouting person who tells the town of what evil is about to come, and nobody listens. While logical reasons are called, at no point she throws herself in with all her soul, in the end she voted me because I didn't give a reason when I got on that wagon. And when I turn up town? Bvoigt is already ready as a substitute.<br>\n<br>\nBeyond the annoying \"I'm town\" calling, the love for endless questions \"why did you vote me\" and pushing two mislynches (because yes, bvoigt has been town all game), the fact that tammy completely fails to believe what she is doing, and I know that's hard to grasp, makes her scum here. Compare town games of her where she lynches people full of hope that they'll turn up as scum to how she plays here and you'll see the obvious difference.<br>\n<br>\nJoin me gregory, I wouldn't dare to fool you here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote tammy</div>", "time": "Wed Jul 18, 2012 5:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}

What's annoying is the total lack of ability to read anything she writes as it's so full of inane fluff I have no clue what she means half the time.  Did you understand the essay of hope and knowledge?  And, I'm trying really hard not to be insulting on the off chance that this is just her personality and she's not actually scum that is purposefully obfuscating her meaning and writing fluff to write stuff.  It's not about not having enough evidence either, it's about not even being able to follow a thought process.  And no a cloudy thought process isn't necessarily indicative of scum, it could be personality based, but it reads as someone who is trying to force a thought process rather than have a natural thought process.<br>\n<br>\nProbably one of the easiest ways to tick me off though is this stupid ass meta crap.  You guys depend on meta way too much around here.  I get that it's a bit useful in giving you a general idea of people's behavior and attitude, but this atmosphere where people think they can read one or two games and determine someone's alignment based off of differences or similarities is ridiculous and annoying.  Sure, it can't be helped to a certain extent when you've played with people and have personal experience with them - and it's something that I use as well to a degree - but even then it's nothing that is really certain.  So, for someone who has NEVER EVEN PLAYED IN A GAME WITH ME to say that I am not playing to my town meta is infuriating.  I am getting really sick of being town and being told I'm not acting like TownTammy by people who have very very limited experience with me.  <br>\n<br>\nIf someone wants to believe I'm scum, fine, but stop basing it off of crap that you can't possibly get right if you don't know how to read me or test me to get a proper read.  This meta thing is just annoying.  I come from a small site in which we play behind alts for nearly every game.  You can't out your alt nor can you use meta reasoning.  Sure, we figure out who is behind some alts at times and that influences our reads, but we can't use it as evidence.  Everything has to stay within the realm of the game as much as is possible.  Yes, I know site differences are site differences and I have to adjust but it does not change the fact that if you do not know me and you've only seen a couple of game you can not meta me with any degree of accuracy.

That's why I started the last post towards you, gregory, with something in the essence of \"please try to read this, it makes sense to me\". I think, if you want an accurate read on me, you have to try to find out if my heart is in what I do. I played one game knowingly as scum here, and it was different. People thought I was town for lying, which was fun to me for a while, but my heart wasn't in it. Playing scum is rather an empty business to me, there is no fun of discovery in it.<br>\n<br>\nI was slightly surprised that Tammy called pretty much anything I said in the conversation with her scummy. That hasn't happened to me in my games very often. Generally people try to understand. I thought, and still think, that that was rather influenced by the fact that I was voting her.<br>\n<br>\nWhile I was surprised about that, that's all in the game. It can happen. But I'm slightly annoyed that people would call me dumb, dense or anything alike. If you don't understand how someone is playing, there are two ways about it. Either you try to get a read on that person, or you call the player you don't understand dumb. I think it's incredibily shortsighted of people to simply call everybody they can't understand dumb. Unless you are scum, of course, then it doesn't matter. <br>\n<br>\nI kinda hope for you as well that you are scum, tammy. Then insults are all part of the game. I thought you were a nice person, and I think that town-tammy would try to get a read on me rather then insult me.", "time": "Wed Jul 18, 2012 11:01 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}

Now that Slaxx has vanished, I have time to talk my way out of a Yoshi wagon Greg.<br>\n<br>\nSince I started with Greg, I will address one of your earlier points. The reason I chose to ask the question about Pine`s slot is not to make myself look townie. That logic doesn`t hold since I picked a spot with a null read, not a town read. I was asking because if the other 2 replacements also didn`t pick Pine for the same reason, then there would be considerable support for a wagon and lynch there. However, the slot eventually got replaced and nobody answered as I expected, so it ended up becoming a moot point.<br>\n<br>\nOnto peta`s criticism of me: yes, I do judge rhetoric. WM said I should state which of Tammy`s points I agree with. The problem is that she is a wall poster and that would take too long.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><blockquote><div><cite>WM wrote:</cite>(I am using a crappy work computer, so all my formatting will be messed since I can`t add a quotation mark.

Playstyle attack on FuDuzn is nonsensical and strawman-y (\"You begin to tunnel vision on crypto. If your excuse for tunnel vision is drunk, then are to believe that you have played the entire game drunk? If you are always playing drunk, you are no help to town\"). Not to mention, he spends a decent sized post building a case on someone who he essentially ends with a null read on, fake scumhunting.</div></blockquote></div><br>\n<br>\nI wrote out the case on fu, realized he was town after I wrote it, but I am not going to just throw the post away that I spent some time on.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><blockquote><div><cite>shinori wrote:</cite>You refuse to look up her posts cause self meta blahhhh.

In fact, exactly what happened is what I predicted: Tammy denied everything and the case was over. What I said is that bvo`s case was pointless.

For quite some time he voteparks on crypto while being wishy washy about Fuduzn and Bvoigt.

{"number": 1191, "id": "4231293", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "AAAAANNNNNDDDDDD Scumhunter is once again ignoring my question about how he came to his poe.  Like this shouldn't be a difficult question to answer, you know?  If it's your method and you believe in it so much you should be able to quickly type out something or some bs.  I mean, something.  Likewise, my statement to flinter refers to you as well.  At least try to come up with some lame excuse for why I'm scum other than durroutburstsbeungenuinehurrdurr.  If you're town, scumhunter, you should probably start playing under a new alt.<br>\n<br>\nBut, you're right scumhunter I'm not totally indifferent.  I actually kind of want to be lynched, so it's not complete indifference.  I stated on the first day to flinter and to peta that it might be best to lynch me because of this slot.  I made it clear that if I would have read the game before replacing in, I probably wouldn't have replaced in even though you guys were in such need of replacements.  So, we've got Scumhunter, flinter, fuduzn, bvoigt who are each stuck with either scum motivation to keep calling me scum or are so full of confirmation bias that they've literally stopped looking for who the actual scum are in this game.  I can't be let anywhere near LyLo because town will lose ergo you need to get rid of me before then.  All of that combines to me believing it would do both me and town a favor for you to lynch me soon.  I don't know how much clearer I can make this.<br>\n<br>\nSo here you have:<br>\n<br>\npetapan - town, probably the one who is trying to most to figure out the game.  If he's scum here he's putting on a pretty good show about trying to actually find scum and would deserve to win it.<br>\n<br>\ngregory - town, pretty much right up there with peta.  When I said that my interaction with Shinori pretty much shows we're not partners, he immediately pulled up an example and said that it could be distancing.  He's right, it could be, not the type of distancing I normally engage in but from an outside pov it could be.<br>\n<br>\nmanju - town, but pretty inactive.  This is a little frustrating but he at least seems to have some sense and is interested in finding out who the scum are.<br>\n<br>\nbvoigt - most likely town due to the neighborizer thing.  I've seen scum neighborizers before and I suppose he could be but I doubt it.  So, he's town, but he doesn't really seem interested in finding who the scum are in this game.  Plus confirmation bias on me which blows.<br>\n<br>\nMe! - Town.  Frustrated and irritated town, but has good sense.  Doesn't care about this game as much I should and that's partly due to the lack of activity in the town, town apathy, and some irritations, so I'm pretty ready to take the train out of town whenever it's ready to leave the station.  Yep!  I'm putting in a read of myself cuz I can.<br>\n<br>\ndenis - who knows?  peta says troll town, so meh, follow peta I guess.<br>\n<br>\nevilpacman - Probably town.  He says just enough things that have me doubt sometimes, but I don't think he makes sense as scum.  I'm not going to read back over him though.  His trying to get me to obvtown myself in case peta needs to be lynched reads town to me though.<br>\n<br>\nscumhunter - might actually be scum here.  I thought town when I replaced in because his frustration over day one rang true and I could sympathize, but his total lack of actually looking for the scum in this game, combined with a faked poe that he can't explain, and extremely shallow scumhunting (ie - read anything he's said about me) make him actually fit the profile for scum.<br>\n<br>\nflinter - hope and glitter scum.<br>\n<br>\nfuduzn - might be scum.  I said that Pine saying that fuduzn was scum due to his reaction to bvoigt might make him town, but fuduzn doesn't really do anything to demonstrate a bit of townness.  His reads are extremely static and he's pretty one note.  He also seems to be playing up the derp which could be an attempt to make himself seem too derpy to be scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo, if my town reads are right and if peta is right about denis then scum will be found in Scumhunter, flinter and fuduzn.", "time": "Thu Aug 02, 2012 6:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}

I didn't AtE in my first post to you or at all during this damn game.  Whatever you're seeing or you're peddling is just an aspect of my personality so you know what fuck off.  I'm not trying to make any impression and I never once said I had great fucking reads.  I have reads; they can be wrong.  I don't know where the fuck you're coming off the bullshit you keep on writing in regards to me and why the fuck are you so stuck on me anyway?  You do know there are 8 other players besides me; why the hell do you have to run in here and discredit every single fucking thing I right and talk about my fake emotional outbursts that I'm not fucking having.  Until right now, and I'm pretty pissed off about this one, because I really was trying to not react emotionally to people being fucking stupid, but you have your head stuck so far up your own ass right now that you've annoyed the hell out of me.

If you know that you are likely going to be taken to LyLo because town is so full of people who aren't going to pay attention to the fucking game and will mislynch you it's best to go before then.  If you are also the focus of so much of town who aren't actually paying attention and letting the scum hide or whatever, it's also good for you to go.  Hence here.  If you lynch me, which I hope to god you will at this point because I want out of this town, then maybe town will take it's collective head out of its collective ass and will actually start looking for the scum in this game.  I said from the very start on day one that I didn't mind being lynched but that I was going to work for town for as long as I'm here.

You said I'm scum because I defended myself or did it too much.  Would you think I was town if I said I didn't mind being lynched but didn't defend myself or try to evaluate why people are willing to lynch me or anyone?  Me being okay with being lynched does not equal me being okay with crap thrown at me.<br>\n<br>\nYou say that I am actually worried about my lynch.  If that is true, why did I suggest it once again?  Also, why am I not actively pushing someone else if I'm so worried about being lynched?  I'm not even voting anyone.  I don't want to be mislynched, that sucks, but it also sucks to be taken into lylo with members of town who can't be objective and I'd rather not have town lose because of me.  As I said yesterday I don't want a repeat of mini1346...it still stings.<br>\n<br>\nPeta - I still really think that one of scumhunter/bvoigt/pacman is scum because these are the people Shinori identified as scum.  I think that Shinori is the type of player who thinks he has to name one of his partners as scum; that's about all I'll say about that until a game gets out of LyLo - which could be in a few rl days.<br>\n<br>\nI was thinking it was possible that two of them were there since I had been reading bvoigt as scum since replacing in and since scumhunter's been reading scum to me since yesterday.  However, I don't think that both of them are scum unless they're trying the \"let's have the same exact reads no one will expect a thing\" tactic, but neither of them read as that type of player to me.  I still don't like bvoigt's reaction to your cop guilty reaction test.  However, I just witnessed the worst possibly innocent reaction to a \"cop guilty\" I've ever seen that has me shaking my original assumptions about that reaction a bit.<br>\n<br>\nI can't get a decent town read on EPM and that bothers me.  He's dropped a few town tells, but nothing really strong overall.  I think that the one thing that bothers me the most is his scum read on flinter.  And, obviously not that it was a scum read on flinter, because hello, but the way he went about it.  Like him searching through her meta and claiming that her behavior didn't fit with previous meta.  I don't like his voting on denis and saying that anyone who doesn't agree is scum.  I don't know what to make of denis, but with his early claim that we should lynch no one or me, the denis vote feels out of place.  It almost feels like he's recognizing that I'm the default vote if I make it to MyLo and is setting that up.  I don't like it.<br>\n<br>\nI can see the suspicion on Gregory, but the fact that he's narrowed it down to just me and denis makes me wonder a bit.  He would know that I'm going to flip town, so narrowing it down to just two.  Meh.  Unless there's a line up for denis tomorrow/me tomorrow going on.<br>\n<br>\nI need to do some iso's that won't come until the weekend.  I never read games in night, so it's been a while and I won't have time to really iso and think until this weekend.<br>\n<br>\nGregory - You say it pretty much comes down to me and denis.

I also don't get the feeling he's stupid. He has earlier made a post where he said you wouldn't be that stupid (I think he was implying you are scum, it would be nice if crypto could confirm that). I skimmed a couple of day one's from you, Parama, and generally you are a bit of of a boy in those. What I mean by that is that you are a tad aggressive, a bit trying to work your way up the pecking order. Here, you either got outbluffed by (amongst other actions) petapan's fakeclaim, or you simply didn't bother. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know if I have to see your random vote for crypto in this light, since you never pressed it. What is clear from that is that right at the start you were aware of crypto playing in this game and if you hated playing with him I think you'd have replaced out right then. The fact that you waited till now to request replacement seems to show that the game wasn't going your way. I could expatiate on that, but regardless of how I do that, the only way in which you could know already at this point that the game isn't going your way is if you are scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote parama</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAgain, I like her analysis on Parama as he legitimately fell flat on his face.

It's interesting. I think it's potentially a legitimate opinion (not an opinion that I agree with, but it is one) just because crypto is a one-line poster and that doesn't sit well with a lot of people. Servanto's quite the one-line poster himself so far though, and so it's hypocritical. Plus his one lines, ignoring the fact that there's far fewer of them than crypto's, have an average of less content, see iso 0, 2, 3, and 4.  That's a nice 66% contentless posts. It's a bit early for this cuz he probably hasn't really read the game yet. Another thing that caught my eye was the exchange in 275 and 276. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gregory didn't go out of his way to welcome any of the other replacements, and so the interaction seems to me like there's some sort of solidarity going on in between them.</div> This is a bit of a stretch, I know, but considering Gregory is one of my scum reads, I think it will be more relevant when we actually have a flip from him. That being said:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Gregory</div><br>\nI notice peta said the same thing I just did in 287 so that makes me feel a bit better about my opinions, although I think with a little more of Servanto's posts since that point, it helps to add that he's being hypocritical.<br>\nScumhunter, I don't know what you want from me. Yes some of my posts aren't serious. So? I post content when I post content and if I seem noncommittal for any reason it's probably because my scum reads aren't as strong this game as they are or have been in other games, but that just happens. I can't be 100% sure I have the scum team in 15 pages every game. 5 and 8 were a semi-joke and an indication that I might read Armageddon as scummy but without actually saying I think he's scum just yet. Maybe you didn't like the wording of 9 but I'm still leaning scum on Manju for that, so from my POV it's not fluff. Oh and hey, you just admitted in 303 that your reads are especially weak this game, so I'm thinking it might actually be an indication that you, peta, and I are all town if we're all having a weirdly weak game.<br>\nbvoight: no, because I'm leaning town on SH now. His case on me was weak and mildly scummy I thought but I didn't wanna call him scum because I might just be biased from the fact that he thinks I'm scum.

I posted \"sup\" and he said \"welcome\" and you give that enough credence to vote for him?

Then suddenly my flimsy vote is no longer so flimsy, because which scum would hop onto a two man wagon with no reasoning? I'm opportunistic, I think the odds of armageddon/tammy ending up scum are good, and I'm trying to make that lynch happen.<br>\n<br>\nOn second thought, while I was writing this, a question entered my mind: why did working manju assume armageddon/tammy would flip town? <br>\n<br>\nThird thought: he did replace parama.

Now, they tried to kill him night one apparently, I'll have to look at peta's iso again but I'm pretty sure he said the kill was blocked on WM.

(The only caveat to this is that bvoigt went on v/la; I'll have to check to see if he was gone during this time as the rules state that a buddy can't submit an action for another buddy, so the only person potentially to make the kill would have been the third member who might be the roleblocker.  Who would definitely have made the kill night one because Shinori investigated and bvoigt neighborized.  Therefore, if he was a one shot roleblocker he would have had it for night three if bvoigt wasn't around to make a kill.)<br>\n<br>\nThey killed the tracker night three.

{"number": 1641, "id": "4293060", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "I know that a no lynch in this situation is smart play and you guys feel free.  I'm not moving my vote though, and you don't need to me to to go to night so it's cool.  In fact, I don't see any way I'll be changing my vote to anyone else besides pacman.  If I wake up tomorrow, which I fully expect to, my vote will immediately go there because it makes the most sense in the context of the game.<br>\n<br>\nIf you look at the stuff that I posted yesterday, the way that bvoigt and Pine interacted with one another and you look at how bvoigt originally started to suspect scumhunter when scumhunter used meta to defend pine but didn't use meta to defend pacman.  I would have to believe that in order for either one of you two to be his partner he did a few things that seem out of character.<br>\n<br>\n1.  pacman is the only one here that bvoigt defended.  He asked gregory why he was reading pacman as scum and said he was town.<br>\n<br>\n2.  he went after fuduzn when pine did, and I don't believe that both pine and fuduzn went after their partner for no reason.  Pine tried to claim that bvoigt looked good for his reaction to peta's reaction test and that fuduzn looked bad for trying to lynch him.  If pine were going to drop a partner here, it would be the one that made a terrible reaction to the reaction test not the one who seemed to suspect him for it.  Instead he tried to protect one partner, and I don't see him making the other look suspicious for no reason.<br>\n<br>\n3.  I also do not see fuduzn and bvoigt coming up with the plan for him to claim friendly neighbor that got blocked.  We had already been discussing the setup, and one it would make him look suspicious for claiming to be blocked and two it would bring attention to the neighborizer/neighbor claim.  I just really don't see this happening. <br>\n<br>\n4.  Likewise, I don't see bvoigt neighborizing his partner scumhunter.  I suppose he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> if he was nervous that he'd expose himself to a townie, but that would be a total waste.  The whole purpose of a scum neighborizor is to influence or get information from town.<br>\n<br>\n5.  Also, if you look at the day one wagons, when pacman was in the lead and was potentially going to be lynched, bvoigt moved off of fuduzn, who he had been claiming was scum the whole time, and moved onto my wagon and then later onto scumhunter's wagon.  Now, since I know it wasn't a distancing move on my end, I don't believe it was a distancing move on his end either.  And the way he played with pine leads me to believe that bvoigt is the type of scum member who is more likely to defend than bus.  Also, there wasn't any reason whatsoever to really bring attention to scumhunter in that way.  He could have easily gone after doomyoshi at that point.  It looked like he was following along with peta and crypto on the easy scumhunter wagon to keep pacman safe.<br>\n<br>\n(The only only thing that makes me a little nervous is Shinori's attitude to scumhunter.  I really do believe that Shinori has a bit of an honesty compulsion and the way he was like \"I'm not moving off scumhunter\" was odd.  But this is a small thing in the context of things so I'm just going to shelve that bit of paranoia.  Besides, denis told me yesterday that he believed 99% that scumhunter was town and I'm going to believe in him on that.)<br>\n<br>\n-------------<br>\n<br>\nI think that scumhunter would have made a completely different night kill if he were scum here too, which makes me feel even better about him.  (Now, I've been wrong at this point before thinking that people would do what I would do, but this is common sense...I think.)  Yesterday before lynch, pacman said it was either scumhunter or gregory and he'd been reading scumhunter as town all game so there was no point in changing that.  Well, gregory flipped town, so the logical assumption would be that pacman would suspect scumhunter.  I've expressed concern over scumhunter though I have him lower than pacman.  I'm not sure about fuduzn.  But, dennis told me that he was 99% sure that scumhunter was town.  Why the hell would scumhunter then kill denis last night?  He's got three people who've expressed concern and one who hasn't.  He would have a much better chance in lylo if he brings dennis there with him.  AND it wouldn't be out of the ordinary to bring denis as he's been largely absent all game and there have been negative feelings where he's concerned.  The fact that denis is dead makes me feel better about scumhunter.  (Again, this is me applying my logic here, I don't kill people who have town reads on me if I can at all help it and definitely don't when there are more people who suspect me - even when they're confirmed town - so I tend to apply this to everyone and have been wrong.)  But, still, this makes the most logical sense, so I'm going with it.<br>\n<br>\nIf you look at pacman's iso too, you'll see little things that stand out that aren't right.  He'll tell you he's not scum because he went after bvoigt and Shinori day one, but that's fluff.  He did go after Shinori at deadline, but...it was at deadline and after he became super scummy.  He did vote bvoigt but he unvoted him after a minor point in a way that looks like he was engaging in distancing.  He kept bringing him up as maybe being scummy but didn't put him in the teams of three he kept trying to put together.  His willingness to lynch Shinori after the watcher claim feels off and looks like posturing.  His attitude feels like scum trying to be in charge.  But, things like \"I fit my town meta according to others.  I have the town's best interest at heart in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4183091#p4183091\">Post 476</a> reads like a self-conscious attempt at fitting his town meta and fake town concern at the same time.  In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4192858#p4192858\">Post 688</a> he also appeals to past town play when he says he tries to draw connections early as I know.  This again looks like a self-conscious attempt to fit his town meta.  But, seriously, read his iso and look at how he talks about bvoigt/pine/shinori; it looks like very weak distancing.  Also note that he kept on going after fuduzn - just like pine and bvoigt did.", "time": "Mon Aug 27, 2012 1:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=1625", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}

Tammy is scum and still posting walls with heaps of content. When I think to myself \"why is Tammy town\" the most I can come up with is Bvoigt's interaction on her wagon/my read on her which is kind of weak in a way because Tammy wagon never really took off so its hard to read too much into his stance on it. I mean EPM does look a lot worse, but if you are saying Tammy is town for being emotional with reactions, I really really disagree. Regardless of if she's town in this game, Tammy is definitely calculated enough and enough of a volume poster to be able to fake those things imo. I mean I'm an emotional player at times and can act emotionally as either alignment when threatened. The whole \"I don't care if you lynch me\" card is one that I would almost never pull as town and to me is actually a moderate scum-tell especially from most experienced players. Mostly playing devil's advocate here, still leaning very much towards an EPM lynch, mostly saying these things to think out loud/make myself feel better if Tammy is scum that I actually considered it.<br>\n<br>\nCan't spend too much more time thinking about this game right now, need to sleep.", "time": "Mon Aug 27, 2012 7:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}

Heck in Lovers Mafia, I didn't even post for an entire week and prod dodged before that week.  If you also look at that you'll notice one other difference.  A pronounced lack of emotional play (In CN, I did get into a fight with my partner that was absolutely genuine; he pissed me off but that's about all the emotion you get).  You might think I'm able to fake emotions, but you don't know me so you're just basing this belief on something you've conjured up and not what is actually evident in any of my scum games.  In fact, me attempting to fake emotions got me busted before and the only time I was genuinely really emotional in a scum game was when my grandfather died in the middle of a game I played.  You should actually read those games because if you think that it portrays me as any way similar to here then I don't know what to tell you.  I have a very very hard time caring about scum games and have only put forth decent showings a couple times.  You should read GreyIce's last two things about me in the Closed Normal game.  He's barely had any game experience with me at all, but was able to describe me pretty well there.<br>\n<br>\nI did want to be lynched every day I said because I desperately did not want to be here in LyLo in a situation in which the only thing I could was town losing.

I agree I don't know your playstyle well (obviously having never played with you before) and I get that an actoin from one player can be a bonafide scum tell, while with someone else it could be a bonafide town tell. For example, \"I still worry you both won't get the conf. bias and up lynching me\", I mean from a lot of people that attitude/the one you've had all game is pretty dang scummy. I mean Fu doesn't suspect you at all and I'm saying I'm leaning towards an EPM-lynch so I don't get where that anxiety/worry would come from.

I still maintain that attitude is anti-town for a town player to have and reasonably easy to hide behind that meta as a scum player.<br>\n<br>\nYou do realize being lynched is the single worst outcome for your team's win condition no matter when it happens? In the end every lynch counts the same whether its d1 or lylo. Town only has so many mislynches and once one is gone, its gone. So I mean saying you wanted to be lynched for the betterment of the town is just plain not true.  You may actually believe that, but I mean its not true. If you are scum, you obviously have an agenda you are hiding behind by saying that and if you are town, you are saying that because you don't want the hassle of defending yourself/feel too much personal responsibility for being lynched. Mafia is a team game and when a townie is lynched its often as much fault for the people voting the townie as the lynchee themselves.

I'm actually quite good at towing myself when I'm town.  I've had people list me as their strongest scum read on day one and by day two have me in their strongest town reads.  I've never really worried about being a liability before.  I've, on occasion, thrown my hands up and in frustration told someone to lynch me near endgame but that's usually been when people get paranoid about me still being alive when they think I should have died days before and suggest lynching me even though I haven't done anything suspicious.  (and that's not the best reaction either, but like I've said several times this game, I'm really working on my emotional reactions and failing a lot.)<br>\n<br>\nI wish you would look at it from my perspective; I wasn't just suggesting my lynch as some sort of whimsical suggestion.  I hate being mislynched.  (it's only happened once, but still I hated it.). However, from my viewpoint over the past days it's what I thought would be the best outcome for town.  I came in at L-1 actually pretty confident that I'd be able to turn around most suspicion, but really wasn't.  I don't know if I've just had a really off game or something but it became pretty evident to me by the end of day one that the suspicion of me probably wasn't going to go away.  Flinter read me as scum, bvoigt read me as scum, PETA kept leaning scum, you started reading me as scum, fuduzn kept callying for me to be vigged, and things kept getting worse.  Looking ahead and the situation going on, I knew I wouldn't be night killed and if I got into the situation I am in right now, I would be brought here with the people who didn't seem to be giving me a chance or showing any doubts at all, and all I could see was town losing.  (it's a similar position I took in kh when I claimed at a bad time and the way I did made me look really suspicious and several people raised suspicion of me because of it.  I was night killed anyway because one scum team really thought they were taking out the opposition.)<br>\n<br>\nI understand your point about lynches and town, and I always advise people to fight against their lynch.  I just, if you look at it from my point of view, I hope you'll see where I was coming from.  Think about it, if I would have been mislynched instead of Flinter, wouldn't this be easier for you right now?  Sure the dynamics of end game would probably be different, but still.  Add to that having town lose because of me in lylo in another game, and I just didn't want to repeat that.  Youre right mafia is a team game, and when I suggested it I believed that removing the question mark of me would help the team overall.  It didn't feel good to do it or suggest it, but I couldn't have predicted at the time that you would start being objective about me or fuduzn or Gregory really.  Scum bring to lylo who they think they can win against, I wanted them to be forced to bring someone that people weren't already set on.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: pacman's latest post is laughably bad.  The people who've suspected me the most are still alive, with the exception of Flinter.  Peta started town reading me the day before he died, and if you think I would have killed him instead of someone else when he's the reason I didn't get lynched that day, you are insane.  In fact, several of confirmed town died attacking pacman, so now he's just throwing out whatever random crap he can.  The bvoigt distancing stuff is pretty funny actually, notice how he's trying to ignore the evidence I posted on which bvoigt voted both me and Scumhunter on day one to swing momentum to a wagon to save pacman.<br>\n<br>\nIf he is town, why doesn't he want to go to night now?<br>\n<br>\nIf he is town, why doesn't he suspect fuduzn in the slightest?  He'll tell you it's because he believes his claim, duh.  But do you just absolutely believe the claim of someone who've you've suspected all game?  And, it doesn't match with how he's reacted to the other claims made by his partners.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, thank you pacman for not showing one bit of hesitation on fuduzn being town, that just confirms for me that he is the town I already believed him to be.  <br>\n<br>\nI have no problem going to night and I never did.  I was pretty confident of my vote when the day started, as I had become pretty confident yesterday when gregory was lynched because the evidence speaks for itself, and if we do go to night, pacman is who I will be voting for if I wake up tomorrow.  His reactions today have pretty much confirmed it.", "time": "Tue Aug 28, 2012 8:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22540&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "22540"}
