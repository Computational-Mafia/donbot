Lynches require a majority of possible votes: (number of living players/2) + 1, rounded down.<br>\n4. If there's no majority at deadline, there's no lynch. <br>\n5. When the hammer vote is cast, all players, including the lynched may talk freely until the final vote count and lynched player's flip have been posted. I will lock the game thread at that time.<br>\n6. When you are killed, within the first 24 hours of the next day, you may make one \"bah\" post with no game-relevant information. <br>\n7. Deadlines are set at two weeks and extensions will only be given in the most extreme of circumstances.<br>\n8. You have about 48 hours to confirm your role and your alignment by PM. Game will start sooner if everyone confirms. Posting in a private topic counts as confirmation.<br>\n9. This game follows the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal%20Guidelines\">Normal Guidelines</a>. At least one player has the following role PM:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Vanilla Town PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Welcome, XXXX, to Mini XXXX, Machevillian mafia</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">You are a Vanilla Townie.</div><br>\n<br>\nYou have no special abilities.<br>\n<br>\nYou win when all threats to the Town have been eliminated and one town-aligned role is alive.<br>\n<br>\nThe game thread is <a href=\"here\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.</div></fieldset></div></div></div></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFBF00\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Night</div></div></div>\n<ul>\n<li>1. Night begins when I lock the thread and lasts about 48 hours<br>\n2. You may submit actions via PM or PT. If the actions are not submitted by the deadline then you do nothing. You can change your mind as many times before the deadline.<br>\n3. If I don't hear from you about your night actions, I'll PM you 24 hours before the deadline. This doesn't count as a prod. If I still don't hear from you, you will take no action.<br>\n4. If you will be V/LA through night you may submit actions to me ahead of time.<br>\n5. When the game has less that 7 players shortened nights are possible if every player pms me for a shortened night.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFBF00\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Prods and Replacements:</div></div></div>\n<ul>\n<li>1.

You will be replaced if you either do not respond to a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Prod\">Prod</a>, or need to be prodded more than 3 times total, which can be increased by mod&#8217;s digression in lengthy games. Prodges that contain no game relevant information will not reset the prod counter.<br>\n3. If you're V/LA, make sure I know. If a lengthy V/LA is adversely affecting the game (e.g., if you are not able to post minimally during that time), then your mod may replace you.</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFBF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Miscellaneous:</div></div></div>\n<ul>\n<li>1. Amber (#FFBF00) is the color I will use for mod posts. Please don&#8217;t use this color or otherwise try to make your posts look like mod posts.<br>\n2. You may not talk to each other about this game outside of threads I have created for this purpose. You may not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. This is a sitewide rule. <br>\n3. No editing, deleting, using invisible texts, small text (less than 70) or writing in code<br>\n4. provable randomness using dice tags are not allowed<br>\n5. Don't quote any mod-recieved PMs or your role. Your flavor will be randomized so I couldn&#8217;t care less if you talk about it.<br>\n2. This is my first modded game so I will make mistakes. If you notice I make one, please let me know.<br>\n6. All of these rules should be followed in spirit rather than letter. If you are unsure about something please ask me via PM instead of risking the integrity of the game. You can&#8217;t win mafia with OGI, you just ruin the game.<br>\n7. You must play to win.<br>\n8.

Just seems like something that would look pretty awful if Map flipped town. I could see it happening if Map was scum, especially if scum have day chat and Map told ira to do it or something. But it's just such an abrupt, unexplained turnaround that was guaranteed to draw attention.<br>\n<br>\nThen later we have ira hopping around to all these widely-townread (or at least town-leaned) players like Dwlee and Nero, while saying that players like BYF and Rosske look town. All this happening while we run up Rosske. Again, this would be a pretty brazen way to approach the situation if ira were partners with Rosske. So if ira is scum, then I think Rosske is most probably town.<br>\n<br>\nAt first I was reading ira's play as town because it seemed like he was trying to figure things out, pressuring players who didn't post much so that he'd have things to read them on, etc. But some stuff has just been weird. Like telling BYF that he should claim when BYF had very few votes on him (or zero?) Then later, this one:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8139557#p8139557\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8139557#p8139557\" data-post-id=\"8139557\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 517</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27091\">iraonavp</a> wrote:</cite>No, of course not, and you don't really care about the answer, you just want reasons to accuse me. Just like all of the other questions you ask...</div></blockquote>\n\nWhich was in response to Nero asking ira to provide examples for a theory he'd just given. It was a fair question; ira was using the theory (that the idea of \"wagon resistance\" comes from scum more often than town) to justify a scumread on Nero. Ira stated it like a fact, suggesting he'd seen it in the past. Pressed to give evidence, he acted like it would be ridiculous for him to have evidence and then tried to turn it back on Nero.<br>\n<br>\nAt that point, \"fake as shit\" starts to sound like a reasonable way to describe ira's read on Nero.<br>\n<br>\nBUT while everyone else was off pushing Map, ira was walling with BYF, only to later declare BYF town and hop onto the Map wagon with him. Then, while everyone else was off running up Rosske, ira was tearing away at Nero and Dwlee.<br>\n<br>\nIf ira is likely not partners with Rosske, and we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira is scum, that means scum was almost certainly on the Rosske wagon. And if we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira could be partners with Map, then my bet would be that the third scum wasn't on the Map wagon and may have been either lurking, not voting or otherwise just committed to another wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI know this is all a little premature but I'm hoping it becomes useful later and I'm hoping it'll help me get my bearings back.", "time": "Thu Jul 21, 2016 7:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

The \"fellow townie\" thing is some wonky wording for sure, but in my head if I'm treating BYF as scum then it makes sense both in the context of ira being town and ira being a partner.<br>\n<br>\nThat being the case, it raises some interesting questions based on the timing of it all. They started doing this as Map was being run up (ira was voting Map, he switched to BYF in the middle of their argument). So if anything the ira-BYF walling served to distract from the Map wagon. That could point to Map as scum too, it would kind of suck for scum to distract from a wagon on a townie only to make each other look worse.<br>\n<br>\nBut then we have the weirdness where both of them stop arguing and vote Map together:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132862#p8132862\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132862#p8132862\" data-post-id=\"8132862\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 309</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28273\">BigYoshiFan</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132853#p8132853\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132853#p8132853\" data-post-id=\"8132853\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 307</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20873\">Elyse</a> wrote:</cite>Still think Map Wolf is the best lynch for today.</div></blockquote>\n\nAgreed. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132906#p8132906\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132906#p8132906\" data-post-id=\"8132906\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 313</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27091\">iraonavp</a> wrote:</cite>I'm aware that this might make me look bad, but I think that I was wrong about BigYoshiFan being scum-aligned.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">(snip)</div><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote>\n\nWhich, if I'm gonna think about it in terms of BYF and ira being scum together and trying to distract from their partner Map, does seem like an awfully strange move. Ira's vote put Map at L-1. No, it's not just strange. It's sophisticated machinery. It's like a tactician's work, and I just don't know how many people would even think to do that.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then let's flip Map over to being town and BYF and ira are partners. That means that not only did BYF and ira wall with each other while distracting from the Map wagon, risking tearing apart a mislynch while putting scum in jeopardy, but they then coordinated with each other to vote a mislynch at the same time, and even put it at L-1. That also seems unlikely for scum to do.<br>\n<br>\nSo, long story short, I don't think that BYF, ira and Map are all partners together, and I actually don't think that ira is partners with BYF either. It could be possible that Map and ira are partners, or that BYF is partners with Map.<br>\n<br>\nBut thinking about it a bit more now, I'm not so big on the thought of map being scum. There's the eagerness to start the game, which is a little bit o' somethin', and then there's the VT claim, which is a little more o' somethin', and there's the way people approached the wagon, which is also somethin'. Altogether they make up a little bit more than a little bit.", "time": "Thu Jul 21, 2016 7:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

Despite a general sort of scumminess about them, there was absolutely no resistance to the wagon. That indicates either 1) an extremely calm and collected scum who doesn't panic at L-1 early in the game because they know that L-1 in the first week of D1 means nothing, which is very hard to do even if you understand it, or 2) their being town. If Map is scum, then I'd wager the smartest person in this game is one of their partners.

Just seems like something that would look pretty awful if Map flipped town. I could see it happening if Map was scum, especially if scum have day chat and Map told ira to do it or something. But it's just such an abrupt, unexplained turnaround that was guaranteed to draw attention. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Point taken. It does seem like an awfully sudden thing to do; but it looks scum regardless of how Map flips, really. It might just have been a self-preservation move.</div><br>\n<br>\nThen later we have ira hopping around to all these widely-townread (or at least town-leaned) players like Dwlee and Nero, while saying that players like BYF and Rosske look town. All this happening while we run up Rosske. Again, this would be a pretty brazen way to approach the situation if ira were partners with Rosske. So if ira is scum, then I think Rosske is most probably town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">But this \"butterfly\" playstyle isn't exactly good Mafia handiwork, is it? So if Ira is town after all that, what does it say about Rosske?</div><br>\n<br>\nAt first I was reading ira's play as town because it seemed like he was trying to figure things out, pressuring players who didn't post much so that he'd have things to read them on, etc. But some stuff has just been weird. Like telling BYF that he should claim when BYF had very few votes on him (or zero?) Then later, this one:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8139557#p8139557\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8139557#p8139557\" data-post-id=\"8139557\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 517</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27091\">iraonavp</a> wrote:</cite>No, of course not, and you don't really care about the answer, you just want reasons to accuse me.

It was a fair question; ira was using the theory (that the idea of \"wagon resistance\" comes from scum more often than town) to justify a scumread on Nero. Ira stated it like a fact, suggesting he'd seen it in the past. Pressed to give evidence, he acted like it would be ridiculous for him to have evidence and then tried to turn it back on Nero.<br>\n<br>\nAt that point, \"fake as shit\" starts to sound like a reasonable way to describe ira's read on Nero. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If fakeness isn't strong enough evidence for you, then what is? Fakeness is the entire point of scum play, and Ira just got owned in that department.</div><br>\n<br>\nBUT while everyone else was off pushing Map, ira was walling with BYF, only to later declare BYF town and hop onto the Map wagon with him. Then, while everyone else was off running up Rosske, ira was tearing away at Nero and Dwlee. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Which, I might add, is in self-defense; one might even go so far as to say it was OMGUS.

And if we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira could be partners with Map, then my bet would be that the third scum wasn't on the Map wagon and may have been either lurking, not voting or otherwise just committed to another wagon. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I don't see the point of this paragraph.</div><br>\n<br>\nI know this is all a little premature but I'm hoping it becomes useful later and I'm hoping it'll help me get my bearings back.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8143777#p8143777\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8143777#p8143777\" data-post-id=\"8143777\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 548</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28243\">Zap Rowsdower</a> wrote:</cite>Sorry for the post length.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132023#p8132023\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8132023#p8132023\" data-post-id=\"8132023\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 177</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28273\">BigYoshiFan</a> wrote:</cite>I'm sorry if I just want to see why a fellow townie has suspicion on me.</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't want to discount the possibility that this whole thing between BYF and ira was scum theater.

They started doing this as Map was being run up (ira was voting Map, he switched to BYF in the middle of their argument). So if anything the ira-BYF walling served to distract from the Map wagon. That could point to Map as scum too, it would kind of suck for scum to distract from a wagon on a townie only to make each other look worse. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">...Huh.

Ira's vote put Map at L-1. No, it's not just strange. It's sophisticated machinery. It's like a tactician's work, and I just don't know how many people would even think to do that. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nobody ever gets lynched within the first few days of the game on D1. Without exception, hammer occurs just before deadline; why throw away all that good scumhunting time? L-1 that early means absolutely nothing. It certainly helps your \"tactician's work\" paranoia, but... Come on, the prior improbability of Ira being a massive awesome mastermind is too low for this line of reasoning to work. Ira was trying to hurt BYF with that argument, but when that failed, Ira just moved on to an easier target. Nobody would fault Ira for betting on a Map BW then.</div><br>\n<br>\nAnd then let's flip Map over to being town and BYF and ira are partners. That means that not only did BYF and ira wall with each other while distracting from the Map wagon, risking tearing apart a mislynch while putting scum in jeopardy, but they then coordinated with each other to vote a mislynch at the same time, and even put it at L-1. That also seems unlikely for scum to do. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">More likely than the above scenario IMO.</div><br>\n<br>\nSo, long story short, I don't think that BYF, ira and Map are all partners together, and I actually don't think that ira is partners with BYF either. It could be possible that Map and ira are partners, or that BYF is partners with Map. <br>\n<br>\nBut thinking about it a bit more now, I'm not so big on the thought of map being scum. There's the eagerness to start the game, which is a little bit o' somethin', and then there's the VT claim, which is a little more o' somethin', and there's the way people approached the wagon, which is also somethin'. Altogether they make up a little bit more than a little bit.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8143865#p8143865\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8143865#p8143865\" data-post-id=\"8143865\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 554</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26193\">Dwlee99</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8143832#p8143832\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8143832#p8143832\" data-post-id=\"8143832\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 551</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28247\">MariaR</a> wrote:</cite>Ira's posts are so erratic and messy and so out there I don't know if I can sr him for it to be quite honest he has reads and he seems to be sticking to them I can't see Ira coming in the game and being like: \"I'm gonna fucking tunnel someone into the ground and then retract at the last second yeah go me!\"</div></blockquote>\n...<br>\n\"His posts are so scummy and random and erratic he CANT be scum\" -Someone everytime a person obvscums</div></blockquote>\n\n^----This<br>\nBy the way, randomness and confusion is more than enough for a policy lynch.

I wasn't planning on using that look into your alignment at all, really. I just wanted to test your proficiency at finding less-than-obvious logical flaws in other peoples' reasoning.

But I would advise you to read twice, speak once.<br>\nMy location, beneath my avatar, says \"solipsistic introjection\". It's a psychological term for the phenomenon wherein we create little \"characters\" in our heads of other people online. Were not talking to actual people, we're talking to the characters we've constructed; the closer to reality our characters are, the more meaningful our dialogue. Based on your interaction with Nero Cain, I got the distinct impression that your characters were wildly inconsistent with the people, so you couldn't pick up on when they themselves were inconsistent. Your characters just do whatever; it's impossible for them to be self-inconsistent, everything is part of their script.

No logic is terrible, but pretending like you have a reason while you present nothing is even worse. You've made a case against BYF previously, but that case is just plain insufficient to prefer a BYF lynch over an Ira lynch.<br>\nYou know what this feels like? You're using the momentum of Dwlee's unlynch to justify your own unlynch, for whatever reason. Unless you can offer a simpler explanation, this is the only way I can interpret this action right now. Somehow, Ira not being lynched now is personally advantageous to you. Do you even care if BYF is lynched or not? Otherwise, you wouldn't have joined a wagon with virtually 0% chance of reaching its destination.<br>\nThat is, of course, what this post <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">feels like</div>.

In my opinion, it was just a slip of the pen, nothing of any true import, but it did seem weird what with BYF fighting Ira so hard in that conversation.<br>\n-Everything peters out suddenly when Ira slams on the brakes and says he townreads BYF now, no hard feelings.<br>\n-Map returns, tries to explain some stuff, people unvote because lynching someone not even halfway into the first day is stupid, everyone is left with a lingering feeling of doubt and remorse surrounding Map. They remain the second most popular lynch candidate today.<br>\n-A wagon starts on Rosske for reasons I don't quite remember, but I do think his reaction to being wagoned was poor.<br>\n-I return with a super-long post where the most notable moment was my consolidating the case against Ira. I remain the biggest advocate for an Ira lynch now.<br>\n-Rosske wagon peters out, people try to draw logical conclusions.<br>\n-DW and Nero get in a meaningless two-page squabble  because a poorly worded post from DW looked like he was calling Nero as scum regardless of the Ira flip.<br>\n-A small movement to restart the wagon on Map is made, largely led by Elyse. This is discouraged by Maria's logic that Map can't be scum because nobody was resisting the Map wagon in the first place. Scum would have helped their buddy, right?<br>\n-Elyse argues that the wagon did have resistance, it must have, because it did run out of support in the end.<br>\n-Nero notes that this is confusing.<br>\n-Elyse clarifies, saying that nobody is actually lynched that early D1, which made it safe for the resistance to be implicit, quiet, being the last person to vote to ensure less townies on the wagon, and being the first to unvote to create anti-bw momentum. Also, I just realized something about a particular player.<br>\n-I test Elyse by asking if she scumreads me, because a pivotal logical foundation she used to justify this reasoning was that nobody is lynched early D1, and I was the only person in the game who had previously mentioned that logic. It was actually a test to see if she could level-two scumhunt, which I cannot do and it would be useful if some of us could.<br>\n-Elyse fails the test to find the logical inconsistency (I as scum wouldn't have publicly mentioned that logic in the first place), therefore reducing my faith in the Map wagon.<br>\n-DW unlynches Ira after Elyse suggests that mafia could quickhammer before we find a different lynch candidate.<br>\n-Rosske switches his vote from Ira to BYF.<br>\n-And here we are, I probably missed some important stuff along the way though.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8173024#p8173024\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8173024#p8173024\" data-post-id=\"8173024\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 909</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22272\">Wake1</a> wrote:</cite>What's the case on iraonavp?</div></blockquote>\n\nMakes suck pushes on people backed by lackluster logic, OMGUSes people when it is noticed their pushes are suck, was generally scummy during the interaction with BYF (personal opinion.

Also, I just realized something about a particular player.<br>\n-I test Elyse by asking if she scumreads me, because a pivotal logical foundation she used to justify this reasoning was that nobody is lynched early D1, and I was the only person in the game who had previously mentioned that logic.

Any town worth his/her grain in salt are going to have their reads change and flip flop as the game goes along. Only scum have need for staticy reads. It also doesn't help that what is a scumtell from one player might just be a derp tell from another.  For example, I was in a game not to long ago with a player faking a post restriction, even though it was clear (or atleast looked clear) that they were a PR, the scum asked, thus rolefishing. Its very similar to you asking Ross to hard confirm that he's a power role. So yes, I think its scummy but I'm more than aware that this could just be bad town play.  I think you've made some posts that are very scummy. You can read it here <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8175630#p8175630\">here</a> and it doesn't help that you aren't really responding to them.

Anyway if i may i will go explain a bit more on the two games i have finished (as town and scum respectively)<br>\n<br>\nIn <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67015&amp;f=11&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28042&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1721</a> i not only made helpful posts, but i seemed friendly and talkative in them, and i also made a lot more <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">direct</div> reads at people.<br>\n<br>\nIn this game <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a> happened because i tought that \"worst case is he is joking, and if so, then so what?\" I think the scummy thing about the post was the direct and just downright \"scummy\" tone in it. After <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a> i have been having hostile tones, and i haven't made nearly as good reads, which i think might be partly due to me being in \"defense\" mode - that is trying to get myself more trusted and make more \"towny\" posts. Anyway my towngame hasn't been nearly as good after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a> and its follow up (oh let me just blindly unvote and leave for 24hours).<br>\n<br>\nWhat about scumgame?<br>\nIn <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67479&amp;f=56&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28042&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Summer Waltz</a> i played as <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=94&amp;t=67480\" class=\"postlink\">Scum</a>. In this game the fact that there were so many posts, and players threw me off. I also got a bad entrance, and really didn't make any good impressions on anyone. I ended up really not contributing in the discussion, and basically would die as soon as my partner (theme setup) could leave. If you read the scum PT i didn't discuss any direct answers, and it was mostly \"how's it going\" if i had already gone through the main thread. Now in Summer Waltz i mostly made very random and weird moves in a somewhat desperate attempt to reach \"something\" which obviously failed. Now i ended up making an interesting move, which might've gotten my team a decisive advantage, but i was dead at that point.<br>\n<br>\nSo yes i agree that my responses, and overall towngame have been mediocore this game after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a>.

This is most commonly used when there is a claim of a Vanilla Townie to argue that that player should be lynched (if they are scum, well and good; if they are Town, no power roles were lost).<br>\nEBWOP or EBWODP: Edit By Way Of (Double) Post. Because actual editing of posts in mafia games is forbidden in most games, the only way to \"edit\" a post which contains an error is to make another post containing the correction.<br>\nFoS: Finger of Suspicion. Used to indicate that you find someone suspicious but are not going to vote them, for whatever reason (often because you are voting for someone even more suspicious).<br>\nFTFY: Fixed that for you. Usually said under quotes that have been altered for truthery.<br>\nGG: Good Game. Equivalent to \"Congratulations\".<br>\nHoS: Hand of Suspicion. This is used when an FoS is not enough to convey the extent of your suspicion.<br>\nIIoA: Information Instead of Analysis<br>\nIME: In My Experience<br>\nIoA: Information over Analysis. Similar to IIoA.<br>\nIso (or ISO): Isolation. Usually refers to reading a player's posts in isolation. You can view one person's posts \"in Isolation\" by using the \"Display posts from previous\" drop down boxes at the bottom of every page.<br>\nIGMEOY (or IGMEOU): I've Got My Eye On You<br>\nITT: In This Thread (or In This Topic)<br>\nJK: Jailkeeper<br>\nLAMIST: Look at me, I'm so town<br>\nL-1: Lynch minus one. This either refers to the second-to-last vote before a lynch is obtained, or a state where a player only needs one more vote to be lynched.<br>\nL-#: Lynch - number, The number indicates how many votes a player needs to be lynched. Eg, in a 9 player game, a player with 3 votes on him is at L-2 (5-3).<br>\nLyLo: Lynch-Or-Lose. This is a stage in the game where the town must lynch scum or they will lose the game.<br>\nMB : Multiball. A game with more than one scum faction.<br>\nMFoS: Middle Finger of Suspicion. Probably self-explanatory given what FoS means.<br>\nMyLo: Mislynch and Lose. A stage in the game where the town can no-lynch safely. However, should they mislynch instead, it is likely one of the town will die the next night, resulting in a scum victory.<br>\nNK: Night Kill, specifically the scum's factional kill.<br>\nNL: No Lynch, when no majority on a player is reached, or when a majority of players vote to not have anyone lynched.<br>\nOMGUS: Oh My God You Suck. While occasionally used on its own as an insult, it's usually used as an inferred reasoning for purely retaliatory actions. For instance, an OMGUS vote on someone is one made purely on the basis that they are voting for you.<br>\nPbPA: Point by Point Analysis. This is a detailed analysis of (usually one player's) posts.<br>\nPEdit: Preview Edit<br>\nPL: Policy Lynch<br>\nPM: Private Message<br>\nPoE: Process of Elimination<br>\nPOV: Point Of View<br>\nPR: Power Role or Post Restriction, depending on context.<br>\nQFT: Quoted for Truth(ery). Said after a quotation to express agreement/approval.<br>\nRQS: Random Questioning Stage, analternative to the Random Voting Stage for starting a game of Mafia. This has one player posing either a survey to all players or a separate question to each player.<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RTFT: Read the F*cking Thread. Self-explanatory.</div><br>\nRVS: Random Voting Stage. Most Mafia games start with a phase wherein people vote for silly reasons, until someone slips up or makes a legitimate accusation.<br>\nsus(s): Suspicious<br>\nSK: Serial Killer<br>\nV/LA: Vacation/Limited Access. A catch-all term for \"unavailable due to MeatWorld constraints\".<br>\nVCA: Vote Count Analysis.<br>\nVI: Village Idiot. Not to be confused with the player Vi.<br>\nVT: Vanilla Townie.<br>\nWIFOM: Wine in Front of Me.<br>\nYMMV: Your Mileage May Vary.

Town can be confident because they have a great case on someone, or a strong gut feeling; town can also be confident because they're just BSing and want to feel precious. Scum can be confident because they actually know someone is town; they can also be confident because they think they've made a good, genuine logical case. Perhaps you should specify which variety of confidence I display here.<br>\nB) Scum is as scum does. If someone does not fit the bill for scum, then they are not scum.

I just do not think scum would act this way in this situation. For one, the scum team would've discussed at night what his claim should be. Or during the day, even, if they have day chat. And on top of that, scum would have plenty of reason to claim now. Town would suspect them otherwise. They could out a town PR and possibly even get them lynched. If there wasn't a town counterclaim, the fakeclaiming scum (Rosske) could either skid by without suspicion or even manipulate town into doing the wrong thing, depending on what he claimed.<br>\n<br>\nSo.....guess I take back my insistence that he should claim, then.</div></blockquote>\n\nI concur. Someone who previously claimed PR should not claim their full role unless it becomes Plot Relevant, or if they are in imminent danger of being lynched. Because of this reason, it is foolhardy to force a PR into claiming <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">by lynching him</div>; it neutralizes part of town!Rosske's power by giving that information to the Mafia. Rosske claiming either hurts town or hurts mafia, and him not claiming maintains the status quo.<br>\nIf Rosske is mafia, forcing him into an early hardclaim is bad for him, but not debilitating; it makes manipulation that much harder, and leaves him vulnerable to an admittedly unlikely counterclaim. (Say he claims watcher--what percentage of standard closed normal have a watcher? Maybe 33%?) mafia!Rosske will thereafter use uncreative traditional mafia tactics such as \"well, darn, I was roleblocked, by golly oh poo\" which I propose as an official acronym by the name of BGOP. Of course, if mafia!Rosske wasn't very creative to begin with, this is little loss for him in the end. This is a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possible</div> loss for mafia.<br>\nIf town!Rosske were forced to claim, however, well, that information is made public, and they who conspire may then conspire further. This is a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">definite</div> loss for town, and its utility is difficult to predict.<br>\nIn essence, <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase;font-size:smaller\">danger of mafia definitely gaining an unkown level of advantage &gt; danger of maybe letting mafia get away without a possible handicap</span>.<br>\nI hate uncertainty and I love it all the same. If Rosske dies sometime along the game, and he flips town, remember those who wanted him to claim and think them scum. If he is mafia, then think the claim crowd to be town. It is partially for this reason that I believe Rosske is town; most of my scumreads (Ira, Ira, and Ira) want him to claim, so conditional on Ira being scum, Rosske is town in my eyes.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8199013#p8199013\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8199013#p8199013\" data-post-id=\"8199013\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1157</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28243\">Zap Rowsdower</a> wrote:</cite>It is pretty interesting to think about the reaction to all this if we think about Rosske as town.

But he's posting in almost literally the exact same way as you, only with far less chatroom-y questions and far more violent, immediate reaction. Almost half his posts are him saying something along the very basic lines of \"get off me\" or \"you're scum\". Who better than to lead the charge, work up the raw energy against Rosske?

Obviously me and he are both beating up on the poor, unassuming, adorable little Ira, ergo, Ira is town because we're beating up so badly on them, the implication being that scum isn't nice to town (surely you're not suggesting that town is overly nice to Ira, are you? Because that is both true, and exactly contrary to your wagon).<br>\nSo, you've made clear your dislike of DW; are you sure this isn't just me and DW being associated together on one issue, thus making me look bad in your eyes? Hillary Clinton is a salty bowl of suck, and that ends up making all Democrats look bad, despite them only being nominally related to her? There's a logical fallacy for that...<br>\nYou know, there's a reason I point out standard B-grade logical flaws when I somehow manage to be perceptive enough to catch them.

The one person you have scumread the most for the past 3 days <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You have no proof on</div></div></blockquote>\n\nI don't understand what you're not getting.<br>\n<br>\nDo we have different definitions of what proof is?<br>\n<br>\nAre we not both speaking the same kind of English, perhaps? Are you like Australian or something and our dialects slightly differ so we can't understand very specific sentences in the same way?<br>\n<br>\nOK, let me walk through this very, very slowly.<br>\n<br>\n\"Proof\" means evidence that something is true. Undeniable evidence, even. Evidence so convincing that you can't walk away with any other conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nAn example: A dude puts down a closed box in front of me and asks me to guess whether the cat inside is alive or dead. I listen carefully and I hear meowing and scratching coming from inside the box. So I say \"I think it's alive, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">but I don't have any proof.</div>\"<br>\n<br>\nIn this case, I don't have any proof because my evidence is lacking. There are other things that could be causing the scratching and meowing noises inside the box. A recording of a cat could be playing, for example. Or perhaps there's some other creature inside the box making noises that sound like a cat.<br>\n<br>\nSo this dude opens up the box, and sure enough, there is a cat walking around inside. I put my fingers on its skin next to its heart and I feel it beating. The cat bites me.<br>\n<br>\n\"Now I know the cat is alive,\" I say, \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Because I have proof.</div>\"<br>\n<br>\nWhat has changed? Instead of simply hearing something that may or may not have been a cat, I have seen a cat with my own eyes. I have judged the fact of its mortality by feeling its heart beating, by observing it moving of its own free will and by stimulating the creature so as to produce a response -- ie, I put my hand on it and the cat bit me.<br>\n<br>\nSo now, let's translate this example to the question of whether Elyse is town or scum. I have a lot of evidence for why I <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">think</div></div></div> she is scum, and I have laid it out multiple times now. But it's not proof.<br>\n<br>\nWhy is it not proof? Because my evidence is lacking. It could be that I'm simply misinterpreting the actions of Elyse and other players in this game. I have no way of knowing because, by virtue of my alignment (town), I only know for sure at the beginning of the game that one player is town -- myself.<br>\n<br>\nSo what would I count as proof? The mod telling me a player's alignment. That happens when a player flips. So now we have proof that CR was scum and Blackstar, Map and Rosske were all town.<br>\n<br>\nBut we don't have proof that Elyse is scum because we have no word from the mod yet.<br>\n<br>\nFuck's sake.", "time": "Tue Aug 16, 2016 11:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

The first one implies that CR thinks BYF is town, the second seems like he's trying to maintain suspicion of BYF, the third implies that BYF is null. It all just seems like the kind of stiff-arming I expect from scum partners.

Scum left Rosske alive N1, and on D2 Rosske came in with a vote on BYF (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8197238#p8197238\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>). Regardless of whether Rosske actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">did</div> get a result on BYF, it's possible that scumBYF/his partner might have seen this and been worried that Rosske got a result. So then they off Rosske the next night.

He kept arguing that the most likely things to have happened were the weirdest situations, the ones hardest to believe: That scum totally ignored the fact that they would need to address scumRosske's claim during the night, for example, or that scumRosske \"wasn't ready\" to claim yet (implying that after fakesoftclaiming D1, he had given zero thought to  how he would have to eventually back up his claim).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">4.

Traitor encryptor.<br>\n<br>\nTo explain to people still learning about either role, the scumteam would not have known that CR was their traitor.

It's a means of avoiding confusion about under what circumstances scum are able to talk to each other. For example, if an encryptor is the reason scum have daychat then it's only fair to let scum know that they might lose their daychat at some point during the game (scum lose daychat when their encryptor dies). As a mod, you don't necessarily have to tell scum that they have an encryptor (you can, but you don't have to), but you'll probably still say something to the scumteam like \"You have the ability to talk in this thread during the day phase <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">for now.</div>\" It's not hard for the scumteam to figure out why the mod tacked on the qualifier \"for now.\"<br>\n<br>\nHence, this post looks like BYF might have slipped his knowledge that scum had daychat.

{"number": 2223, "id": "8287542", "user": "MichelSableheart", "user_id": "7306", "content": "The first thing I want to highlight is CR's behaviour towards Ira. CR struch me as a pretty smart player. I don't think he would have attacked Ira the way he did if Ira is scum. Not only does tunneling scum risk a scum lynch and a traitor nightkill, the only way it would pay off is if scum Ira somehow stayed alive while CR died (because of the argument we're making now). There was no indication of a CR lynch before the wagon happened quickly at the end of day 2, so from CR's perspective, that payoff was unlikely to come.<br>\n<br>\nThe second thing of note was the Ira wagon that happened during day 1. Everyone on that wagon other then Nero has died, and flipped either town or traitor (votecount 1.10 and 1.11). It's really interesting to thing how mafia would have responded to that wagon. More thoughts on this to follow after I've received the answer to the following question: Nero, let's assume you're town for a moment. in that case, there were no normal mafiosi on that Ira wagon. What do you think is the reason for this?<br>\n<br>\nThe way Gerry responded to the traitor flip could have been set up by scum. However, if it was, I feel Gerry would have discussed it at night with his scumpartner, and I feel his scumpartner would have used the opportunity to feel him town for it. That means Gerry is extremely unlikely to be partners with BYF or Nero, who mostly ignored it, or with Maria, who disbelieved the tell. Elyse, is dead, Ira is likely town, so the only real possible partner I can see for him is zap. That being said, the tell didn't seem fake to me, particularly because even late day 2 after explanation he didn't show that he understood the implications (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271157#p8271157\" class=\"postlink\">#2097</a>). Besides, the defaitist attitude at the end of day 3 seems more likely to come from town then from scum. I think Gerry is highly likely town.<br>\n<br>\nGerry, please don't give up. We need you. Town needs all the help it can get.<br>\n<br>\nThe next topic I would like to discuss is zaps response to the second DW fakeclaim. His reaction there seemed to me like \"you're playing dumb, and it's costing me the game\". I really would like to hear others thoughts on how likely it is that zap fakes that reaction.<br>\n<br>\nThere are some oddities in his play, however. Zap, some questions for you. You seem like a pretty experienced player. I would expect you to know tht there can be some really weird vote switching to guarantee a lynch close to deadline. If you so strongly prefered an Ira lynch at the end of day 1, then why didn't you really make that clear before a map lynch became virtually guaranteed? Similarly, how could you miss that CR was at L-1 at the end of day 2?<br>\n<br>\nNot considering zap cleared yet, because I haven't looked into Elyse's posts myself, and because I haven't yet fully considered the possibilities of scum power roles. We did have 2 investigative roles, after all.<br>\n<br>\nMaria, could you please explain to me how communication between mafia members works in the places where you usually play? Do they communicate through private messages? A private chat? quicktopic? Can they even communicate at all? Do they have daytalk?<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to look into Elyse's posts again today, and should come back to you with my thoughts on that and on the current situation this evening.

I've been on a few, they just do not play like us. Day/night phases work differently (I've been on one site where days last like 48 hours). Customs are different (the fact that scum can only ever use their faction chat at night wherever Maria comes from is a good example). Roles are used differently.<br>\n<br>\nYou've been getting way, way, WAY too hung up on the \"newb\" wording and arguing semantics with it. What matters is not his level of experience. What matters is that there are only two explanations for Gerry's posting, and only one of them isn't batshit fucking crazy:<br>\n<br>\n1. Gerry is town, and because he's new <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">TO MAFIASCUM</div></div></div>, he didn't understand how the traitor role worked. In showing that he didn't know, he unknowingly exposed that he isn't scum. Michel brings up a good detail here -- it's not just that he didn't know, it's that he continued to misunderstand the role as practically everybody else in the fucking game told him he was wrong. That suggests a true lack of knowledge. Somebody who was pretending not to understand would've just said \"ohhhhhhhh lel kk thx guize.\"<br>\n2. Gerry is scum, and understood how the traitor role worked, and decided he was going to do all this work and write up this big fucking post explaining his reads on everybody where the premise of the post -- that scum knew who their traitor was -- was flawed. All in the hopes that somebody would townread him for it. And then, when several people pointed out how he was wrong about it, instead of dropping it he continued to act like he didn't understand for...some reason.", "time": "Mon Aug 29, 2016 5:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=2250", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

It's actually part of why I think you're town -- you've demonstrated so many times throughout this game that you not only believe other people are always trying to deceive you, but that it's the most likely explanation for their behavior. It's super duper paranoid. Plus, scum tend to be more centered than that in my experience. They might leave open a possibility that somebody did something crazy and manipulative, but it's almost always couched in skepticism. Partly because they know it's not true, and when you know something for sure it's hard to tell whether a person who doesn't know for sure is going to find that deceptive-manipulative explanation to be likely. As scum people tend to go with the safer bet, in other words.<br>\n<br>\nPersonally I think that at least on this site scum just do not gambit and outright try to manipulate people all that much. In my experience the better strategy, and the one scum teams usually follow, is to simply try to play like they're town. Not to pull crazy strategies to fake-clear themselves that might or might not work.", "time": "Mon Aug 29, 2016 6:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=2250", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

{"number": 2303, "id": "8289503", "user": "Zap Rowsdower", "user_id": "28243", "content": "Let's take a look at Nero's claim. He's claimed non-consecutive jailkeeper.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, there's the conflict with known town PRs. Rosske had a bodyguard shot, which is one protective role for town. Then there's Elyse's unlimited weak doctor ability, which is a protection as long as it lands on town. Then there's the possibility that scum had some sort of role-stopping ability of their own, which would explain why they left Rosske alive N1 and killed Blackstar instead. Why else would scum keep a claimed town PR alive if they had no way of stopping his night actions?<br>\n<br>\nWhich leads me to point number two: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Doesn't Nero's claim make a lot more sense if he's scum than if he's town?</div><br>\n<br>\nThe number of confirmed and presumed protection/blocking actions in the game makes a JK seem weird at this point, but it would make sense if Nero has the scum's blocking ability. Then we would have two protects from town and one protect/block from scum, instead of two protects and one protect/block from town along with one block from scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the \"non-consecutive\" part makes a lot of sense for scum too. It would explain the Blackstar kill pretty perfectly, actually. Because going into N1 all scum would have known as far as town PRs go was that Rosske was some kind of town PR. So if they have one blocking ability (JK) that can only be used on non-consecutive nights, they have three options:<br>\n<br>\n1. Jail the claimed town PR (Rosske) and kill somebody else (probably somebody they think is a PR, which we can use as the most likely explanation for killing Black). Plan on either getting Rosske lynched the next day or killing him that night <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because the non-consecutive modifier means they'll have no way to block him.</div><br>\n2. Jail some random person and kill Rosske. This would actually suck for scum because they'd be preventing themselves from using their JK on N2 and random odds are that they would be wasting their JK on a VT.<br>\n3. Save the JK and kill Rosske. This might appear enticing until you consider that N3 is almost always going to be a better night for scum to use a JK than N2, just because they'll have more info N3. This one is a big gamble, and one that scum don't need to take because they have option 1 instead.<br>\n<br>\nScumNero claiming his actual role as town makes sense because if he uses his own role he minimizes the chance of claiming something that town actually have.", "time": "Mon Aug 29, 2016 7:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=2300", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

If Maria is used to playing with mafia that has nighttalk, but no daytalk, then why is she asking this question? In face to face, mafia can communicate during the night using signals. Where she usually plays, mafia can chat during the night. There's no reason for her to assume mafia doesn't have nighttalk here. Where she usually plays, there is no daytalk. In FtF, mafia cannot communicate privately during the day. Unless she did the research on this site, there's no reason for her to assume daytalk even exists. And if she did the research, she wouldn't have to ask. <br>\n<br>\nFor scum maria, on the other hand, there's an important reason why she would ask this: she's looking for a traitor. Asking this question brings the topic to daytalk, allowing the traitor to drop some hints to her. Given that, I find it likely that Maria, if she is scum, would have believed ira to be the traitor. He mentioned the possibility of an encryptor, and played dubiously throughout day 1. This would explain why she defended ira the way she did. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, it makes Nero an unlikely partner for her. If he was told by Maria that ira was probably the traitor, I don't think he would have attacked ira during day 1 as hard as he did. There's not really much point in bussing or even distancing (scum doesn't know who the traitor is, after all), whereas saving a mafia member would benefit them greatly. I doubt Maria is partnered with Nero.<br>\n<br>\nBecause of the scum roleblocker problem, Maria also isn't partnered with zap.<br>\n<br>\nIf Maria is scum, BYF is almost certainly her partner.", "time": "Mon Aug 29, 2016 8:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=2325", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

{"number": 2349, "id": "8290026", "user": "MichelSableheart", "user_id": "7306", "content": "I have already explained why the Nero and BYF claims make a zap-gerry partnership unlikely. zap-ira and zap-maria can be dismissed in the same way. However, I'm not willing to fully clear zap just yet. If the mafia team has a roleblocker, which seems possible if either BYF or Nero is lying scum, I think it's quite likely that the scumteam would have picked up a powerrole reading on Elyse, and decided to block her night 2. That Elyse would consider zap confirmed town in that scenario would be a very welcome but unexpected bonus. Zap's play generally feels town though, and we do have the Elyse result. This worry is more something to keep in the back of our minds if we somehow end up in 3 player Lylo. Furthermore, Zap-Nero is far more likely then Zap-BYF, both because Nero actually has roleblocker as part of his claim, and because zap attacked BYF first in his \"let's lynch BYF, Nero and Maria\". Finally, if Zap-BYF is the pairing, there's no good explanation why they weren't on the ira wagon day 1.<br>\n<br>\nA Nero-BYF pair is quite possible as well. The two flipped powerroles are strong enough to not require more town power. Both of their claims are very convenient scum fakeclaims. The two of them were involved in every single wagon this game, which would explain the feeling I have that town was being led by the nose. Neither of them is emitting towntells like zap and maria are.<br>\n<br>\nTo summarize, I think the following pairings are possible, in order of likelyhood:<br>\n- Nero/BYF<br>\n- Maria/BYF<br>\n- Nero/Zap<br>\n<br>\nAnd I have not fully ruled out:<br>\n- Maria/Nero<br>\n- BYF/Zap<br>\n<br>\nI am not voting Ira or Gerry in any circumstances.<br>\n<br>\nI think I want a BYF lynch today, because if he flips scum, I feel I can clear zap as well.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BigYoshiFan</span><br>\n<br>\nI'm fine with the mass claim.

It can help you with your reads if you find somebody who's obviously a town PR, eg, my reads changed for the better after I picked up on Elyse's crumbs because I stopped pushing her and I cleared the Wake slot as a possibility.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8290221#p8290221\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8290221#p8290221\" data-post-id=\"8290221\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2409</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12589\">Nero Cain</a> wrote:</cite>*argues that I should be lynched over BYF b/c he's worried that I will be a hard lynch. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT A TOWN MINDSET</div></div></blockquote>\n\nI feel like I've seen town do this many times.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8290221#p8290221\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8290221#p8290221\" data-post-id=\"8290221\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2409</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12589\">Nero Cain</a> wrote:</cite>*knows that BYF will flip scum before the mod write up. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">INSIDE INFORMATION</div></div></blockquote>\n\nHardly.

The town completely misapplied the principles of setup spec here. It's not about what the roles technically CAN do, it's about what they are MEANT to do.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, so the game included three roles technically capable of protecting someone from a kill. But you have to ask yourself what the purpose of those roles is. Rosske's role sure as heck was not meant to be protective. And both Elyse's and Nero's roles had protective and investigative elements to them. An non-consecutive JK is not a lot of protective power, and the Weak Doctor is better used to get clears. So yes, if Rosske and Elyse had flipped normal Bodyguard and normal Doctor, you would be right to be highly suspicious of a JK claim of any sort. But you have to look at the setup as a whole and not just cherry pick parts of the roles to support your conclusion.", "time": "Fri Sep 02, 2016 7:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67506&start=2775", "forum": "53", "thread": "67506"}

{"number": 2781, "id": "8300731", "user": "Zap Rowsdower", "user_id": "28243", "content": "Listen, you had SCUM thinking that a town PR was fakeclaiming because of how many town PRs there were.<br>\n<br>\nLike, they're scum. They knew that Nero wasn't scum and they still couldn't be sure he was a JK because they didn't even have any active power roles.<br>\n<br>\nLet's consider some possibilities, based on this setup.<br>\n<br>\n-D1, town lynches the traitor encryptor. Scum shoot a VT. Town's weak doctor crumbs their target, then targets one of the two remaining scum and dies. Town JOAT follows the scum who performed the kill. On D2, town sees the weak doc's target and lynches scum. Meanwhile town JOAT gives their result that the last remaining scum targeted the VT who died. D3, town lynch scum and win. Best case scenario for scum, the last scum manages to eke out one more day with a clever fakeclaim -- but at that point, either the JOAT neapolitan role or the town weak doc would confirm them as scum the next day.<br>\n<br>\nThere are multiple ways for this scenario to play out because there are so many different ways for town to produce a result indicative of who scum is. Let's say scum get run up and fakeclaim VT. Neapolitan checks them that night and gets a \"not VT\" result. JK can jail the scum who make the kill. Weak doc, JK and commuter can all prevent kills from happening. Follower can produce a pretty high-confidence result that a certain player was scum. Weak doc produces high-confidence results. BG can even help clear a player because if the JOAT crumbs who they're going to protect and then they die, it suggests that person is town.<br>\n<br>\nBut ultimately I think you just have to consider numbers, too. It becomes so difficult for town to believe in PR claims when they see claim after claim, flip after flip, and then scum have nothing that's all that useful. If you'd even made one of the goons something dumb like a neighborizer it would've helped. Or like a one-shot blocking ability of some sort.<br>\n<br>\nYou say it's not about what power roles CAN do. I say you have to consider that. You have to plan for worst-case scenarios and mitigate where you can. I know because it's happened to me as a mod before. I had a role I was excited for, I MEANT for it to be used a certain way, and guess what?

I had completely failed to notify her before then, so my reaction post was literally designed to do nothing but dispel Nero's concerns and tip her off to my identity. I wanted to tell her I knew she was scum while still voting Ira, classic bus buddy lynch town, while distancing us from one another if I did die; from the looks of it, the later part worked.<br>\nI honestly don't know how I got lynched. Elyse and BYF voted me with absolutely no reasoning, and Zap had said I was an ambiguous figure earlier.

It was like watching a soap opera for me; I was removed from the drama, and thus enjoyed every moment of what was cancer for you guys.<br>\n<br>\nMVP mafia goes to Gerry; his only real threat in this game was Nero, and Maria indirectly exacerbated our early game play.<br>\nMVP town goes to Elyse for almost saving the game. Nero's gut reads, the people he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">knew</div> were scum but failed to admit to himself, were impeccable, but overall, his play was very... peccable, and I can't even blame him. The antagonistic environment that me, Ira, Dw, Nero, Elyse (to a lesser extent), and especially Gerry/Maria created waged a noticeable toll on his psyche. Zap silently withered, but Nero visibly rotted.<br>\n...In retrospect, this game was pretty terrible, wasn't it?<br>\n<br>\nThe only three people in this game whose play I really, really liked were Zap, Elyse, and Gerry.<br>\nZap had all the tools and all the brainpower necessary to come to correct conclusions, but there was always one critical variable he lacked that threw off his reads. Easily the best analytic mind in the game. IMO Zap's the most competent player here, but we ruined it for him.<br>\nElyse <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">frightened me</div>. She stopped talking mid-early game, so I had know idea what she was thinking, but she was right with astonishing accuracy. Every time she made a concrete read on someone, if I recall correctly, it was awfully close to true, if not completely correct. However, the fact that she never managed to nab a truly game-changing investigation N1 or N2 was unfortunate. She almost saved the game with the two clears, but it just wasn't enough; I don't recall her softing who she would visit N3 either, if she had done that, it probably would have been a town win.<br>\nAnd Gerry managed to go the entire game without messing anything up. If he ever did anything wrong, it was getting Ira to townread him, ironically, which, if I recall correctly, was one of the reasons Nero first started FOSing him, despite the \"townslip\" Nero realized was contrived.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, reluctantly, I have to admit that itlepip was right about this being a de facto balanced theme. Commuter is too situational, JOATs in general suck, non-consecutive JK and weak doctor were the only things that stood much of a chance of doing anything, really. If you reduce the practicality of it to just the JK and the weak doctor versus an encrypted scumteam, it's actually fairly balanced. All the other two PR's did was add an element of luck, while reducing the viability of scumhunting via claims. Rosske claiming PR caused such a panic partially because three other town members were already inclined to take his claim with a grain of salt.<br>\n<br>\nI would also like to issue a formal apology for being a jerkbag to Ira.
