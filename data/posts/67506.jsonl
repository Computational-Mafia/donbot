Unvote tags are not required to change your vote.<br></code></dd></dl><br>2. If I have no idea who you're voting for, then the vote won't be counted. <br>3. Lynches require a majority of possible votes: (number of living players/2) + 1, rounded down.<br>4. If there's no majority at deadline, there's no lynch. <br>5. When the hammer vote is cast, all players, including the lynched may talk freely until the final vote count and lynched player's flip have been posted. I will lock the game thread at that time.<br>6. When you are killed, within the first 24 hours of the next day, you may make one \"bah\" post with no game-relevant information. <br>7. Deadlines are set at two weeks and extensions will only be given in the most extreme of circumstances.<br>8. You have about 48 hours to confirm your role and your alignment by PM. Game will start sooner if everyone confirms. Posting in a private topic counts as confirmation.<br>9. This game follows the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal%20Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Guidelines</a>. At least one player has the following role PM:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Vanilla Town PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Welcome, XXXX, to Mini XXXX, Machevillian mafia</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">You are a Vanilla Townie.</span></span><br><br>You have no special abilities.<br><br>You win when all threats to the Town have been eliminated and one town-aligned role is alive.<br><br>The game thread is [url]here[/url].</div></fieldset></div></div></div><br></ul><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Night</span></span></span></span><br><ul>1. Night begins when I lock the thread and lasts about 48 hours<br>2. You may submit actions via PM or PT. If the actions are not submitted by the deadline then you do nothing. You can change your mind as many times before the deadline.<br>3. If I don't hear from you about your night actions, I'll PM you 24 hours before the deadline. This doesn't count as a prod. If I still don't hear from you, you will take no action.<br>4. If you will be V/LA through night you may submit actions to me ahead of time.<br>5. When the game has less that 7 players shortened nights are possible if every player pms me for a shortened night.</ul><br><br><br><br><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Prods and Replacements:</span></span></span></span><br><ul>1. Prods will be given if you do not post in 48 hours. Weekends count as a single full day in determining if a prod is due.<br>2. You will be replaced if you either do not respond to a <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Prod\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Prod</a>, or need to be prodded more than 3 times total, which can be increased by mod\u2019s digression in lengthy games. Prodges that contain no game relevant information will not reset the prod counter.<br>3. If you're V/LA, make sure I know. If a lengthy V/LA is adversely affecting the game (e.g., if you are not able to post minimally during that time), then your mod may replace you.</ul><br><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Miscellaneous:</span></span></span></span><br><ul>1. Amber (#FFBF00) is the color I will use for mod posts. Please don\u2019t use this color or otherwise try to make your posts look like mod posts.<br>2. You may not talk to each other about this game outside of threads I have created for this purpose. You may not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. This is a sitewide rule. <br>3. No editing, deleting, using invisible texts, small text (less than 70) or writing in code<br>4. provable randomness using dice tags are not allowed<br>5. Don't quote any mod-recieved PMs or your role. Your flavor will be randomized so I couldn\u2019t care less if you talk about it.<br>2. This is my first modded game so I will make mistakes. If you notice I make one, please let me know.<br>6. All of these rules should be followed in spirit rather than letter. If you are unsure about something please ask me via PM instead of risking the integrity of the game. You can\u2019t win mafia with OGI, you just ruin the game.<br>7. You must play to win.<br>8. Don\u2019t be a dick<br></ul><br><span style=\"font-size: 50%; line-height: 116%;\">Thank you Plotifrog and Fferyllt for having high quality stealable OPs, anything good is theirs, any mistake is mine.</span>"}

I think he is scum-aligned.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote><br><br>So, I'm not sure if scumIra would do this if Map is town. Just seems like something that would look pretty awful if Map flipped town. I could see it happening if Map was scum, especially if scum have day chat and Map told ira to do it or something. But it's just such an abrupt, unexplained turnaround that was guaranteed to draw attention.<br><br>Then later we have ira hopping around to all these widely-townread (or at least town-leaned) players like Dwlee and Nero, while saying that players like BYF and Rosske look town. All this happening while we run up Rosske. Again, this would be a pretty brazen way to approach the situation if ira were partners with Rosske. So if ira is scum, then I think Rosske is most probably town.<br><br>At first I was reading ira's play as town because it seemed like he was trying to figure things out, pressuring players who didn't post much so that he'd have things to read them on, etc. But some stuff has just been weird. Like telling BYF that he should claim when BYF had very few votes on him (or zero?) Then later, this one:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8139557#p8139557\" class=\"postlink\">post 517</a>, iraonavp wrote:</cite>No, of course not, and you don't really care about the answer, you just want reasons to accuse me. Just like all of the other questions you ask...</div></blockquote><br><br>Which was in response to Nero asking ira to provide examples for a theory he'd just given. It was a fair question; ira was using the theory (that the idea of \"wagon resistance\" comes from scum more often than town) to justify a scumread on Nero. Ira stated it like a fact, suggesting he'd seen it in the past. Pressed to give evidence, he acted like it would be ridiculous for him to have evidence and then tried to turn it back on Nero.<br><br>At that point, \"fake as shit\" starts to sound like a reasonable way to describe ira's read on Nero.<br><br>BUT while everyone else was off pushing Map, ira was walling with BYF, only to later declare BYF town and hop onto the Map wagon with him. Then, while everyone else was off running up Rosske, ira was tearing away at Nero and Dwlee.<br><br>If ira is likely not partners with Rosske, and we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira is scum, that means scum was almost certainly on the Rosske wagon. And if we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira could be partners with Map, then my bet would be that the third scum wasn't on the Map wagon and may have been either lurking, not voting or otherwise just committed to another wagon.<br><br>I know this is all a little premature but I'm hoping it becomes useful later and I'm hoping it'll help me get my bearings back."}

The \"fellow townie\" thing is some wonky wording for sure, but in my head if I'm treating BYF as scum then it makes sense both in the context of ira being town and ira being a partner.<br><br>That being the case, it raises some interesting questions based on the timing of it all. They started doing this as Map was being run up (ira was voting Map, he switched to BYF in the middle of their argument). So if anything the ira-BYF walling served to distract from the Map wagon. That could point to Map as scum too, it would kind of suck for scum to distract from a wagon on a townie only to make each other look worse.<br><br>But then we have the weirdness where both of them stop arguing and vote Map together:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132862#p8132862\" class=\"postlink\">post 309</a>, BigYoshiFan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132853#p8132853\" class=\"postlink\">post 307</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>Still think Map Wolf is the best lynch for today.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132906#p8132906\" class=\"postlink\">post 313</a>, iraonavp wrote:</cite>I'm aware that this might make me look bad, but I think that I was wrong about BigYoshiFan being scum-aligned.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">(snip)</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Which, if I'm gonna think about it in terms of BYF and ira being scum together and trying to distract from their partner Map, does seem like an awfully strange move. Ira's vote put Map at L-1. No, it's not just strange. It's sophisticated machinery. It's like a tactician's work, and I just don't know how many people would even think to do that.<br><br>And then let's flip Map over to being town and BYF and ira are partners. That means that not only did BYF and ira wall with each other while distracting from the Map wagon, risking tearing apart a mislynch while putting scum in jeopardy, but they then coordinated with each other to vote a mislynch at the same time, and even put it at L-1. That also seems unlikely for scum to do.<br><br>So, long story short, I don't think that BYF, ira and Map are all partners together, and I actually don't think that ira is partners with BYF either. It could be possible that Map and ira are partners, or that BYF is partners with Map.<br><br>But thinking about it a bit more now, I'm not so big on the thought of map being scum. There's the eagerness to start the game, which is a little bit o' somethin', and then there's the VT claim, which is a little more o' somethin', and there's the way people approached the wagon, which is also somethin'. Altogether they make up a little bit more than a little bit."}

That way we can minimize the info that scum get (let's assume Rosske is town, he could be a neighborizer or he could be a PGO or anything else allowed in normals) while ensuring that we don't lynch a PR.<br><br>We'd be giving up potential PR conflicts that could point us to scum, but we would hopefully be leaving PRs alive to do stuff tonight. Plus if somebody softclaims PR today then we get to hold them to that later.<br><br>Thoughts?</div></blockquote><br><br><br>This is dumb lol"}

Just seems like something that would look pretty awful if Map flipped town. I could see it happening if Map was scum, especially if scum have day chat and Map told ira to do it or something. But it's just such an abrupt, unexplained turnaround that was guaranteed to draw attention. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Point taken. It does seem like an awfully sudden thing to do; but it looks scum regardless of how Map flips, really. It might just have been a self-preservation move.</span><br><br>Then later we have ira hopping around to all these widely-townread (or at least town-leaned) players like Dwlee and Nero, while saying that players like BYF and Rosske look town. All this happening while we run up Rosske. Again, this would be a pretty brazen way to approach the situation if ira were partners with Rosske. So if ira is scum, then I think Rosske is most probably town. <span class=\"noboldsig\">But this \"butterfly\" playstyle isn't exactly good Mafia handiwork, is it? So if Ira is town after all that, what does it say about Rosske?</span><br><br>At first I was reading ira's play as town because it seemed like he was trying to figure things out, pressuring players who didn't post much so that he'd have things to read them on, etc. But some stuff has just been weird. Like telling BYF that he should claim when BYF had very few votes on him (or zero?) Then later, this one:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8139557#p8139557\" class=\"postlink\">post 517</a>, iraonavp wrote:</cite>No, of course not, and you don't really care about the answer, you just want reasons to accuse me. Just like all of the other questions you ask...</div></blockquote><br><br>Which was in response to Nero asking ira to provide examples for a theory he'd just given. It was a fair question; ira was using the theory (that the idea of \"wagon resistance\" comes from scum more often than town) to justify a scumread on Nero. Ira stated it like a fact, suggesting he'd seen it in the past. Pressed to give evidence, he acted like it would be ridiculous for him to have evidence and then tried to turn it back on Nero.<br><br>At that point, \"fake as shit\" starts to sound like a reasonable way to describe ira's read on Nero. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If fakeness isn't strong enough evidence for you, then what is? Fakeness is the entire point of scum play, and Ira just got owned in that department.</span><br><br>BUT while everyone else was off pushing Map, ira was walling with BYF, only to later declare BYF town and hop onto the Map wagon with him. Then, while everyone else was off running up Rosske, ira was tearing away at Nero and Dwlee. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Which, I might add, is in self-defense; one might even go so far as to say it was OMGUS. Most of Ira's actions can be comprehended from the viewpoint of them being incredibly self-conscious, afraid of each and every person who scumreads them.</span><br><br>If ira is likely not partners with Rosske, and we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira is scum, that means scum was almost certainly on the Rosske wagon. And if we want to assume for the sake of argument that ira could be partners with Map, then my bet would be that the third scum wasn't on the Map wagon and may have been either lurking, not voting or otherwise just committed to another wagon. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't see the point of this paragraph.</span><br><br>I know this is all a little premature but I'm hoping it becomes useful later and I'm hoping it'll help me get my bearings back.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8143777#p8143777\" class=\"postlink\">post 548</a>, Zap Rowsdower wrote:</cite>Sorry for the post length.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132023#p8132023\" class=\"postlink\">post 177</a>, BigYoshiFan wrote:</cite>I'm sorry if I just want to see why a fellow townie has suspicion on me.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't want to discount the possibility that this whole thing between BYF and ira was scum theater. The \"fellow townie\" thing is some wonky wording for sure, but in my head if I'm treating BYF as scum then it makes sense both in the context of ira being town and ira being a partner. <span class=\"noboldsig\">It makes even more sense if BYF is town and was just saying some adorably na\u00efve and innocent thing.</span><br><br>That being the case, it raises some interesting questions based on the timing of it all. They started doing this as Map was being run up (ira was voting Map, he switched to BYF in the middle of their argument). So if anything the ira-BYF walling served to distract from the Map wagon. That could point to Map as scum too, it would kind of suck for scum to distract from a wagon on a townie only to make each other look worse. <span class=\"noboldsig\">...Huh. I didn't think of that. Ira picked a fight to distract from the Map wagon. That's actually a good possibility.</span><br><br>But then we have the weirdness where both of them stop arguing and vote Map together:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132862#p8132862\" class=\"postlink\">post 309</a>, BigYoshiFan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132853#p8132853\" class=\"postlink\">post 307</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>Still think Map Wolf is the best lynch for today.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8132906#p8132906\" class=\"postlink\">post 313</a>, iraonavp wrote:</cite>I'm aware that this might make me look bad, but I think that I was wrong about BigYoshiFan being scum-aligned.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">(snip)</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Map Wolf</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Which, if I'm gonna think about it in terms of BYF and ira being scum together and trying to distract from their partner Map, does seem like an awfully strange move. Ira's vote put Map at L-1. No, it's not just strange. It's sophisticated machinery. It's like a tactician's work, and I just don't know how many people would even think to do that. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Nobody ever gets lynched within the first few days of the game on D1. Without exception, hammer occurs just before deadline; why throw away all that good scumhunting time? L-1 that early means absolutely nothing. It certainly helps your \"tactician's work\" paranoia, but... Come on, the prior improbability of Ira being a massive awesome mastermind is too low for this line of reasoning to work. Ira was trying to hurt BYF with that argument, but when that failed, Ira just moved on to an easier target. Nobody would fault Ira for betting on a Map BW then.</span><br><br>And then let's flip Map over to being town and BYF and ira are partners. That means that not only did BYF and ira wall with each other while distracting from the Map wagon, risking tearing apart a mislynch while putting scum in jeopardy, but they then coordinated with each other to vote a mislynch at the same time, and even put it at L-1. That also seems unlikely for scum to do. <span class=\"noboldsig\">More likely than the above scenario IMO.</span><br><br>So, long story short, I don't think that BYF, ira and Map are all partners together, and I actually don't think that ira is partners with BYF either. It could be possible that Map and ira are partners, or that BYF is partners with Map. <br><br>But thinking about it a bit more now, I'm not so big on the thought of map being scum. There's the eagerness to start the game, which is a little bit o' somethin', and then there's the VT claim, which is a little more o' somethin', and there's the way people approached the wagon, which is also somethin'. Altogether they make up a little bit more than a little bit.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8143865#p8143865\" class=\"postlink\">post 554</a>, Dwlee99 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8143832#p8143832\" class=\"postlink\">post 551</a>, MariaR wrote:</cite>Ira's posts are so erratic and messy and so out there I don't know if I can sr him for it to be quite honest he has reads and he seems to be sticking to them I can't see Ira coming in the game and being like: \"I'm gonna fucking tunnel someone into the ground and then retract at the last second yeah go me!\"</div></blockquote><br>...<br>\"His posts are so scummy and random and erratic he CANT be scum\" -Someone everytime a person obvscums</div></blockquote><br><br>^----This<br>By the way, randomness and confusion is more than enough for a policy lynch.

No logic is terrible, but pretending like you have a reason while you present nothing is even worse. You've made a case against BYF previously, but that case is just plain insufficient to prefer a BYF lynch over an Ira lynch.<br>You know what this feels like? You're using the momentum of Dwlee's unlynch to justify your own unlynch, for whatever reason. Unless you can offer a simpler explanation, this is the only way I can interpret this action right now. Somehow, Ira not being lynched now is personally advantageous to you. Do you even care if BYF is lynched or not? Otherwise, you wouldn't have joined a wagon with virtually 0% chance of reaching its destination.<br>That is, of course, what this post <span style=\"font-style: italic\">feels like</span>. Explain yourself.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8172986#p8172986\" class=\"postlink\">post 908</a>, Wake88 wrote:</cite>Is there anything important I should know?</div></blockquote><br><br>Main happenstances of the game so far (as far as I can recall from memory, add to this if I missed something):<br><br>-Right after game starts, Dwlee claims day cop and guilties I think Elyse, looking for reactions.<br>-People react, none of the reactions look particularly alignment-indicative.<br>-While that episode is at its apex, Map makes a soul-crushingly self-destructive post wherein he votes Elyse, promises to get Dwlee tomorrow if this doesn't work out, and tells people not to hammer Elyse.<br>-BOOM Map is at L-1<br>-While the wagon is mounting, Black \"reaction tests\" Elyse in such a bizarre way that it's clear it wasn't actually a reaction test, but him regretting something he'd said a few posts ago and wanting to erase it from our conscience.<br>-BYF and Ira get around to talking about Map, and things get salty<br>-BYF words a post extremely strangely, calling Ira a \"fellow townie\" as though he knew Ira was town. In my opinion, it was just a slip of the pen, nothing of any true import, but it did seem weird what with BYF fighting Ira so hard in that conversation.<br>-Everything peters out suddenly when Ira slams on the brakes and says he townreads BYF now, no hard feelings.<br>-Map returns, tries to explain some stuff, people unvote because lynching someone not even halfway into the first day is stupid, everyone is left with a lingering feeling of doubt and remorse surrounding Map. They remain the second most popular lynch candidate today.<br>-A wagon starts on Rosske for reasons I don't quite remember, but I do think his reaction to being wagoned was poor.<br>-I return with a super-long post where the most notable moment was my consolidating the case against Ira. I remain the biggest advocate for an Ira lynch now.<br>-Rosske wagon peters out, people try to draw logical conclusions.<br>-DW and Nero get in a meaningless two-page squabble  because a poorly worded post from DW looked like he was calling Nero as scum regardless of the Ira flip.<br>-A small movement to restart the wagon on Map is made, largely led by Elyse. This is discouraged by Maria's logic that Map can't be scum because nobody was resisting the Map wagon in the first place. Scum would have helped their buddy, right?<br>-Elyse argues that the wagon did have resistance, it must have, because it did run out of support in the end.<br>-Nero notes that this is confusing.<br>-Elyse clarifies, saying that nobody is actually lynched that early D1, which made it safe for the resistance to be implicit, quiet, being the last person to vote to ensure less townies on the wagon, and being the first to unvote to create anti-bw momentum. Also, I just realized something about a particular player.<br>-I test Elyse by asking if she scumreads me, because a pivotal logical foundation she used to justify this reasoning was that nobody is lynched early D1, and I was the only person in the game who had previously mentioned that logic. It was actually a test to see if she could level-two scumhunt, which I cannot do and it would be useful if some of us could.<br>-Elyse fails the test to find the logical inconsistency (I as scum wouldn't have publicly mentioned that logic in the first place), therefore reducing my faith in the Map wagon.<br>-DW unlynches Ira after Elyse suggests that mafia could quickhammer before we find a different lynch candidate.<br>-Rosske switches his vote from Ira to BYF.<br>-And here we are, I probably missed some important stuff along the way though.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8173024#p8173024\" class=\"postlink\">post 909</a>, Wake88 wrote:</cite>What's the case on iraonavp?</div></blockquote><br><br>Makes suck pushes on people backed by lackluster logic, OMGUSes people when it is noticed their pushes are suck, was generally scummy during the interaction with BYF (personal opinion.

Also makes a huge number of low-content posts."}

Any town worth his/her grain in salt are going to have their reads change and flip flop as the game goes along. Only scum have need for staticy reads. It also doesn't help that what is a scumtell from one player might just be a derp tell from another.  For example, I was in a game not to long ago with a player faking a post restriction, even though it was clear (or atleast looked clear) that they were a PR, the scum asked, thus rolefishing. Its very similar to you asking Ross to hard confirm that he's a power role. So yes, I think its scummy but I'm more than aware that this could just be bad town play.  I think you've made some posts that are very scummy.

Anyway if i may i will go explain a bit more on the two games i have finished (as town and scum respectively)<br><br>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67015&amp;f=11&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28042&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1721</a> i not only made helpful posts, but i seemed friendly and talkative in them, and i also made a lot more <span style=\"font-style: italic\">direct</span> reads at people.<br><br>In this game <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a> happened because i tought that \"worst case is he is joking, and if so, then so what?\" I think the scummy thing about the post was the direct and just downright \"scummy\" tone in it. After <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a> i have been having hostile tones, and i haven't made nearly as good reads, which i think might be partly due to me being in \"defense\" mode - that is trying to get myself more trusted and make more \"towny\" posts. Anyway my towngame hasn't been nearly as good after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a> and its follow up (oh let me just blindly unvote and leave for 24hours).<br><br>What about scumgame?<br>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67479&amp;f=56&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28042&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Summer Waltz</a> i played as <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=94&amp;t=67480\" class=\"postlink\">Scum</a>. In this game the fact that there were so many posts, and players threw me off. I also got a bad entrance, and really didn't make any good impressions on anyone. I ended up really not contributing in the discussion, and basically would die as soon as my partner (theme setup) could leave. If you read the scum PT i didn't discuss any direct answers, and it was mostly \"how's it going\" if i had already gone through the main thread. Now in Summer Waltz i mostly made very random and weird moves in a somewhat desperate attempt to reach \"something\" which obviously failed. Now i ended up making an interesting move, which might've gotten my team a decisive advantage, but i was dead at that point.<br><br>So yes i agree that my responses, and overall towngame have been mediocore this game after <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8131404#p8131404\">88</a>. Also the amount of posts is no excuse - in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67015&amp;f=11&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28042&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1721</a> there were more posts than this game so far."}

I just do not think scum would act this way in this situation. For one, the scum team would've discussed at night what his claim should be. Or during the day, even, if they have day chat. And on top of that, scum would have plenty of reason to claim now. Town would suspect them otherwise. They could out a town PR and possibly even get them lynched.

Rosske claiming either hurts town or hurts mafia, and him not claiming maintains the status quo.<br>If Rosske is mafia, forcing him into an early hardclaim is bad for him, but not debilitating; it makes manipulation that much harder, and leaves him vulnerable to an admittedly unlikely counterclaim. (Say he claims watcher--what percentage of standard closed normal have a watcher? Maybe 33%?) mafia!Rosske will thereafter use uncreative traditional mafia tactics such as \"well, darn, I was roleblocked, by golly oh poo\" which I propose as an official acronym by the name of BGOP.

That should be obvious to us.<br><br>In what universe does forcing a claim out of somebody who is moderately scumread take precedence over lynching someone who is almost unanimously scumread with only a few exceptions? You say, Gerry, that Ira's posting style is peculiar, as opposed to their actual content. But he's posting in almost literally the exact same way as you, only with far less chatroom-y questions and far more violent, immediate reaction. Almost half his posts are him saying something along the very basic lines of \"get off me\" or \"you're scum\". Who better than to lead the charge, work up the raw energy against Rosske? Ira's a cheerleader. BYF/Elyse/Maria are the players. And I am tired right now and this paragraph sucks bad so goodnight."}

WHy would I hard TR my traitor, when I would try to distance away from them. This is assuming that CR made a code or something that would make it easier for their partners to know they are tratoir. I read what an Encryptor Traitor is, and it's not even that good of a role? I mean, why would I as mafia hard defend my partner from a lynch like that.

The one person you have scumread the most for the past 3 days <span class=\"noboldsig\">You have no proof on</span></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't understand what you're not getting.<br><br>Do we have different definitions of what proof is?<br><br>Are we not both speaking the same kind of English, perhaps? Are you like Australian or something and our dialects slightly differ so we can't understand very specific sentences in the same way?<br><br>OK, let me walk through this very, very slowly.<br><br>\"Proof\" means evidence that something is true. Undeniable evidence, even. Evidence so convincing that you can't walk away with any other conclusion.<br><br>An example: A dude puts down a closed box in front of me and asks me to guess whether the cat inside is alive or dead. I listen carefully and I hear meowing and scratching coming from inside the box. So I say \"I think it's alive, <span class=\"noboldsig\">but I don't have any proof.</span>\"<br><br>In this case, I don't have any proof because my evidence is lacking. There are other things that could be causing the scratching and meowing noises inside the box. A recording of a cat could be playing, for example. Or perhaps there's some other creature inside the box making noises that sound like a cat.<br><br>So this dude opens up the box, and sure enough, there is a cat walking around inside. I put my fingers on its skin next to its heart and I feel it beating. The cat bites me.<br><br>\"Now I know the cat is alive,\" I say, \"<span class=\"noboldsig\">Because I have proof.</span>\"<br><br>What has changed? Instead of simply hearing something that may or may not have been a cat, I have seen a cat with my own eyes. I have judged the fact of its mortality by feeling its heart beating, by observing it moving of its own free will and by stimulating the creature so as to produce a response -- ie, I put my hand on it and the cat bit me.<br><br>So now, let's translate this example to the question of whether Elyse is town or scum. I have a lot of evidence for why I <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">think</span></span></span> she is scum, and I have laid it out multiple times now. But it's not proof.<br><br>Why is it not proof? Because my evidence is lacking. It could be that I'm simply misinterpreting the actions of Elyse and other players in this game. I have no way of knowing because, by virtue of my alignment (town), I only know for sure at the beginning of the game that one player is town -- myself.<br><br>So what would I count as proof? The mod telling me a player's alignment. That happens when a player flips. So now we have proof that CR was scum and Blackstar, Map and Rosske were all town.<br><br>But we don't have proof that Elyse is scum because we have no word from the mod yet.<br><br>Fuck's sake."}

I haven't been widely scumread or widely townread, so I'm a safe place for scum to build a backup scumread. And the reasoning didn't sit well with me. She said one of my posts looked fake, and I know what sentence she was talking about too -- it's the kind of sentence that looks surface-level scummy for sure. It's the kind of thing I would expect scum to pick on. Then later she says I'm posting stuff that looks like work but isn't. The implication being hat I was trying to look busy. In the process she ignored the more obvious explanation -- I'm not feeling very sure of myself and need to work out my reads.<br><br>Basically it just feels like Elyse is sneakily/intentionally working in the wrong directions.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8156339#p8156339\" class=\"postlink\">post 752</a>, Zap Rowsdower wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8155467#p8155467\" class=\"postlink\">post 734</a>, Comparing Realities wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kinda cheering?

The \"fellow townie\" thing is some wonky wording for sure, but in my head if I'm treating BYF as scum then it makes sense both in the context of ira being town and ira being a partner. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">It makes even more sense if BYF is town and was just saying some adorably na\u00efve and innocent thing.</span></span><br><br>...<br><br>And then let's flip Map over to being town and BYF and ira are partners. That means that not only did BYF and ira wall with each other while distracting from the Map wagon, risking tearing apart a mislynch while putting scum in jeopardy, but they then coordinated with each other to vote a mislynch at the same time, and even put it at L-1. That also seems unlikely for scum to do. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">More likely than the above scenario IMO.</span></span></div></blockquote><br><br>Proactive implies activity, not alignment. You can be proactive and also Mafia. In fact, Mafia who aren't proactive don't live past D2. If proactiveness is town, it must actually help town. You demonstrate how Ira's proactiveness has helped town so far, and I will gladly eat my underwear.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">As for BYF, I think his actions will become more apparent on D2, so I'm holding off on spending my time on him until later.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>The underlined sentences are the ones I want to highlight here because I feel like they present three different views of BYF (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Note: The first two sentences are from CR; he wrote them directly into my quote</span>. The first one implies that CR thinks BYF is town, the second seems like he's trying to maintain suspicion of BYF, the third implies that BYF is null. It all just seems like the kind of stiff-arming I expect from scum partners. If you don't want to outright bus them (which could be dangerous to do if you're a traitor), you just stay noncommittal on them and put off having to say anything substantial about them.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">2. Night kills</span></span><br><br>Blackstar died N1 and nobody really seems to know why. One possible reason is that Blackstar had good reads. One of his scumspicions was BYF (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8175653#p8175653\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>).<br><br>The Rosske NK might also point to BYF. Scum left Rosske alive N1, and on D2 Rosske came in with a vote on BYF (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8197238#p8197238\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>). Regardless of whether Rosske actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> get a result on BYF, it's possible that scumBYF/his partner might have seen this and been worried that Rosske got a result. So then they off Rosske the next night. Of course, that has to be tempered against the most obvious reason for scum to kill Rosske, which is that he was a claimed PR.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">3. The fight to get Rosske to claim</span></span><br><br>I find it hard to believe that scum wouldn't have hopped onto the bandwagon asking Rosske to claim. Here's a list of the people who were doing that even after Rosske refused and started telling people it would be a bad idea for him to claim: Gerry, ira, BYF, Elyse, Maria (sort of)<br><br>And BYF's reasoning was awful once I pressed on him to provide it. He kept arguing that the most likely things to have happened were the weirdest situations, the ones hardest to believe: That scum totally ignored the fact that they would need to address scumRosske's claim during the night, for example, or that scumRosske \"wasn't ready\" to claim yet (implying that after fakesoftclaiming D1, he had given zero thought to  how he would have to eventually back up his claim).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">4.

But they would have known that one player in the game was a traitor who was part of their team and couldn't talk to them.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">It's also likely that the main scum team would have known that their traitor was an encryptor.</span> This is because most mods, when giving scum daychat, will tell the scumteam <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> they have daychat. It's a means of avoiding confusion about under what circumstances scum are able to talk to each other. For example, if an encryptor is the reason scum have daychat then it's only fair to let scum know that they might lose their daychat at some point during the game (scum lose daychat when their encryptor dies). As a mod, you don't necessarily have to tell scum that they have an encryptor (you can, but you don't have to), but you'll probably still say something to the scumteam like \"You have the ability to talk in this thread during the day phase <span class=\"noboldsig\">for now.</span>\" It's not hard for the scumteam to figure out why the mod tacked on the qualifier \"for now.\"<br><br>Hence, this post looks like BYF might have slipped his knowledge that scum had daychat. As bonus evidence, here's BYF talking about scum having daychat as a means of justifying his push for Rosske to claim:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8200271#p8200271\" class=\"postlink\">post 1184</a>, BigYoshiFan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8200235#p8200235\" class=\"postlink\">post 1182</a>, Zap Rowsdower wrote:</cite>So you think scum, with Rosske on their team, would go into the night and not even address Rosske's softclaim?</div></blockquote><br>Of course, but it could be as simple as \"Don't full claim\" or they're still talking about it in day chat.</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">5.

Because I just feel like it goes against the grain of scum motivation, you know? Like, you draw attention to yourself by faking not one but two guilties? And then you call people town as a result? Just doesn't really help to get mislynches. Maybe if he's partners with Maria it'd make a bit more sense, but I still have a hard time believing Maria could be scum.<br><br>And then, I mean, think about what would've happened if Dw had stuck to the fake guilty on ira. It only makes sense if Dw and ira are partners together, because if ira flipped town then Dw would have to expect that we'd just turbolynch him the next day. And scumDw would know that ira was flipping town now that the traitor has flipped.<br><br>So then, what if ira <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> Dw's partner? They'd really pull that after losing the third member of their team? I know the automatic answer is \"yeah they'd do it because they knew you'd townread them for it!!!!\" but I just have a hard time believing that.<br><br>Not to mention the whole thing where I have a really hard time believing ira is scum anyway.<br><br>So the other option is that Dw is scum who's just flat-out lying right now about his intentions with the ira gambit. As in, he didn't really intend to get ira lynched when he fakeclaimed the guilty. That's the reason I'm still not totally willing to close the door on Dw being scum. The meta you claim exists might help me sort it out. Dw linked to some game where he was town but I lazily ctrl + f'ed his ISO in that game and couldn't find anything that looked like gambiting so I'm not sure what Dw was trying to show with it.<br><br>At any rate I just feel like there's so much more sketchy shit going on with BYF. He's bungling his reasons for scumreading me, he's sheeping the shallow reasoning that I'm scum because my reaction when I realized I'd accidentally hammered CR \"looked fake\" (I'd be sincerely interested to see an example of somebody realizing they'd accidentally hammered where nobody tried to argue the next day that the reaction \"looked fake\") and his actions in this game have largely benefited scum."}

Because I just feel like it goes against the grain of scum motivation, you know? Like, you draw attention to yourself by faking not one but two guilties? And then you call people town as a result? Just doesn't really help to get mislynches. Maybe if he's partners with Maria it'd make a bit more sense, but I still have a hard time believing Maria could be scum.<br><br>And then, I mean, think about what would've happened if Dw had stuck to the fake guilty on ira. It only makes sense if Dw and ira are partners together, because if ira flipped town then Dw would have to expect that we'd just turbolynch him the next day. And scumDw would know that ira was flipping town now that the traitor has flipped.<br><br>So then, what if ira <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> Dw's partner? They'd really pull that after losing the third member of their team? I know the automatic answer is \"yeah they'd do it because they knew you'd townread them for it!!!!\" but I just have a hard time believing that.<br><br>Not to mention the whole thing where I have a really hard time believing ira is scum anyway.<br><br>So the other option is that Dw is scum who's just flat-out lying right now about his intentions with the ira gambit. As in, he didn't really intend to get ira lynched when he fakeclaimed the guilty. That's the reason I'm still not totally willing to close the door on Dw being scum. The meta you claim exists might help me sort it out. Dw linked to some game where he was town but I lazily ctrl + f'ed his ISO in that game and couldn't find anything that looked like gambiting so I'm not sure what Dw was trying to show with it.<br><br>At any rate I just feel like there's so much more sketchy shit going on with BYF. He's bungling his reasons for scumreading me, he's sheeping the shallow reasoning that I'm scum because my reaction when I realized I'd accidentally hammered CR \"looked fake\" (I'd be sincerely interested to see an example of somebody realizing they'd accidentally hammered where nobody tried to argue the next day that the reaction \"looked fake\") and his actions in this game have largely benefited scum.</div></blockquote><br>ok well, both me and Elyse have done \"reaction\" tests and you have no trouble scum reading us so? <br><br>\"BUT DW DID TWO!\"<br><br>I think his \"tests\" are null and I'm having a hard time seeing you as town believe that he's townie but Elyse and I are not. Also I'm p sure that it was Elyse that fakeclaimed a guilty on Maria...not DW. I think DW's \"reaction\" test was fakeclaiming a guilty on Elyse.

CR struch me as a pretty smart player. I don't think he would have attacked Ira the way he did if Ira is scum. Not only does tunneling scum risk a scum lynch and a traitor nightkill, the only way it would pay off is if scum Ira somehow stayed alive while CR died (because of the argument we're making now). There was no indication of a CR lynch before the wagon happened quickly at the end of day 2, so from CR's perspective, that payoff was unlikely to come.<br><br>The second thing of note was the Ira wagon that happened during day 1. Everyone on that wagon other then Nero has died, and flipped either town or traitor (votecount 1.10 and 1.11). It's really interesting to thing how mafia would have responded to that wagon. More thoughts on this to follow after I've received the answer to the following question: Nero, let's assume you're town for a moment. in that case, there were no normal mafiosi on that Ira wagon. What do you think is the reason for this?<br><br>The way Gerry responded to the traitor flip could have been set up by scum. However, if it was, I feel Gerry would have discussed it at night with his scumpartner, and I feel his scumpartner would have used the opportunity to feel him town for it. That means Gerry is extremely unlikely to be partners with BYF or Nero, who mostly ignored it, or with Maria, who disbelieved the tell. Elyse, is dead, Ira is likely town, so the only real possible partner I can see for him is zap. That being said, the tell didn't seem fake to me, particularly because even late day 2 after explanation he didn't show that he understood the implications (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271157#p8271157\" class=\"postlink\">#2097</a>). Besides, the defaitist attitude at the end of day 3 seems more likely to come from town then from scum. I think Gerry is highly likely town.<br><br>Gerry, please don't give up. We need you. Town needs all the help it can get.<br><br>The next topic I would like to discuss is zaps response to the second DW fakeclaim. His reaction there seemed to me like \"you're playing dumb, and it's costing me the game\". I really would like to hear others thoughts on how likely it is that zap fakes that reaction.<br><br>There are some oddities in his play, however. Zap, some questions for you. You seem like a pretty experienced player. I would expect you to know tht there can be some really weird vote switching to guarantee a lynch close to deadline. If you so strongly prefered an Ira lynch at the end of day 1, then why didn't you really make that clear before a map lynch became virtually guaranteed? Similarly, how could you miss that CR was at L-1 at the end of day 2?<br><br>Not considering zap cleared yet, because I haven't looked into Elyse's posts myself, and because I haven't yet fully considered the possibilities of scum power roles. We did have 2 investigative roles, after all.<br><br>Maria, could you please explain to me how communication between mafia members works in the places where you usually play? Do they communicate through private messages? A private chat? quicktopic? Can they even communicate at all? Do they have daytalk?<br><br>I'm going to look into Elyse's posts again today, and should come back to you with my thoughts on that and on the current situation this evening. I would appreciate if there are no hammers before that, please."}

Roles are used differently.<br><br>You've been getting way, way, WAY too hung up on the \"newb\" wording and arguing semantics with it. What matters is not his level of experience.

Gerry is town, and because he's new <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">TO MAFIASCUM</span></span></span>, he didn't understand how the traitor role worked. In showing that he didn't know, he unknowingly exposed that he isn't scum. Michel brings up a good detail here -- it's not just that he didn't know, it's that he continued to misunderstand the role as practically everybody else in the fucking game told him he was wrong. That suggests a true lack of knowledge. Somebody who was pretending not to understand would've just said \"ohhhhhhhh lel kk thx guize.\"<br>2. Gerry is scum, and understood how the traitor role worked, and decided he was going to do all this work and write up this big fucking post explaining his reads on everybody where the premise of the post -- that scum knew who their traitor was -- was flawed. All in the hopes that somebody would townread him for it. And then, when several people pointed out how he was wrong about it, instead of dropping it he continued to act like he didn't understand for...some reason."}

It's actually part of why I think you're town -- you've demonstrated so many times throughout this game that you not only believe other people are always trying to deceive you, but that it's the most likely explanation for their behavior. It's super duper paranoid. Plus, scum tend to be more centered than that in my experience. They might leave open a possibility that somebody did something crazy and manipulative, but it's almost always couched in skepticism. Partly because they know it's not true, and when you know something for sure it's hard to tell whether a person who doesn't know for sure is going to find that deceptive-manipulative explanation to be likely. As scum people tend to go with the safer bet, in other words.<br><br>Personally I think that at least on this site scum just do not gambit and outright try to manipulate people all that much. In my experience the better strategy, and the one scum teams usually follow, is to simply try to play like they're town. Not to pull crazy strategies to fake-clear themselves that might or might not work."}

He's claimed non-consecutive jailkeeper.<br><br>First, there's the conflict with known town PRs. Rosske had a bodyguard shot, which is one protective role for town. Then there's Elyse's unlimited weak doctor ability, which is a protection as long as it lands on town. Then there's the possibility that scum had some sort of role-stopping ability of their own, which would explain why they left Rosske alive N1 and killed Blackstar instead. Why else would scum keep a claimed town PR alive if they had no way of stopping his night actions?<br><br>Which leads me to point number two: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Doesn't Nero's claim make a lot more sense if he's scum than if he's town?</span><br><br>The number of confirmed and presumed protection/blocking actions in the game makes a JK seem weird at this point, but it would make sense if Nero has the scum's blocking ability. Then we would have two protects from town and one protect/block from scum, instead of two protects and one protect/block from town along with one block from scum.<br><br>And the \"non-consecutive\" part makes a lot of sense for scum too. It would explain the Blackstar kill pretty perfectly, actually. Because going into N1 all scum would have known as far as town PRs go was that Rosske was some kind of town PR. So if they have one blocking ability (JK) that can only be used on non-consecutive nights, they have three options:<br><br>1. Jail the claimed town PR (Rosske) and kill somebody else (probably somebody they think is a PR, which we can use as the most likely explanation for killing Black). Plan on either getting Rosske lynched the next day or killing him that night <span style=\"font-style: italic\">because the non-consecutive modifier means they'll have no way to block him.</span><br>2. Jail some random person and kill Rosske. This would actually suck for scum because they'd be preventing themselves from using their JK on N2 and random odds are that they would be wasting their JK on a VT.<br>3. Save the JK and kill Rosske. This might appear enticing until you consider that N3 is almost always going to be a better night for scum to use a JK than N2, just because they'll have more info N3. This one is a big gamble, and one that scum don't need to take because they have option 1 instead.<br><br>ScumNero claiming his actual role as town makes sense because if he uses his own role he minimizes the chance of claiming something that town actually have."}

If Maria is used to playing with mafia that has nighttalk, but no daytalk, then why is she asking this question? In face to face, mafia can communicate during the night using signals. Where she usually plays, mafia can chat during the night. There's no reason for her to assume mafia doesn't have nighttalk here. Where she usually plays, there is no daytalk. In FtF, mafia cannot communicate privately during the day. Unless she did the research on this site, there's no reason for her to assume daytalk even exists. And if she did the research, she wouldn't have to ask. <br><br>For scum maria, on the other hand, there's an important reason why she would ask this: she's looking for a traitor. Asking this question brings the topic to daytalk, allowing the traitor to drop some hints to her. Given that, I find it likely that Maria, if she is scum, would have believed ira to be the traitor. He mentioned the possibility of an encryptor, and played dubiously throughout day 1. This would explain why she defended ira the way she did. <br><br>However, it makes Nero an unlikely partner for her. If he was told by Maria that ira was probably the traitor, I don't think he would have attacked ira during day 1 as hard as he did. There's not really much point in bussing or even distancing (scum doesn't know who the traitor is, after all), whereas saving a mafia member would benefit them greatly. I doubt Maria is partnered with Nero.<br><br>Because of the scum roleblocker problem, Maria also isn't partnered with zap.<br><br>If Maria is scum, BYF is almost certainly her partner."}

However, I'm not willing to fully clear zap just yet. If the mafia team has a roleblocker, which seems possible if either BYF or Nero is lying scum, I think it's quite likely that the scumteam would have picked up a powerrole reading on Elyse, and decided to block her night 2. That Elyse would consider zap confirmed town in that scenario would be a very welcome but unexpected bonus. Zap's play generally feels town though, and we do have the Elyse result. This worry is more something to keep in the back of our minds if we somehow end up in 3 player Lylo. Furthermore, Zap-Nero is far more likely then Zap-BYF, both because Nero actually has roleblocker as part of his claim, and because zap attacked BYF first in his \"let's lynch BYF, Nero and Maria\". Finally, if Zap-BYF is the pairing, there's no good explanation why they weren't on the ira wagon day 1.<br><br>A Nero-BYF pair is quite possible as well. The two flipped powerroles are strong enough to not require more town power. Both of their claims are very convenient scum fakeclaims. The two of them were involved in every single wagon this game, which would explain the feeling I have that town was being led by the nose. Neither of them is emitting towntells like zap and maria are.<br><br>To summarize, I think the following pairings are possible, in order of likelyhood:<br>- Nero/BYF<br>- Maria/BYF<br>- Nero/Zap<br><br>And I have not fully ruled out:<br>- Maria/Nero<br>- BYF/Zap<br><br>I am not voting Ira or Gerry in any circumstances.<br><br>I think I want a BYF lynch today, because if he flips scum, I feel I can clear zap as well.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BigYoshiFan</span><br><br>I'm fine with the mass claim.

It's a means of avoiding confusion about under what circumstances scum are able to talk to each other.

As a mod, you don't necessarily have to tell scum that they have an encryptor (you can, but you don't have to), but you'll probably still say something to the scumteam like \"You have the ability to talk in this thread during the day phase <span class=\"noboldsig\">for now.</span>\" It's not hard for the scumteam to figure out why the mod tacked on the qualifier \"for now.\"</div></blockquote></div></div></div>"}

The chance of me not getting lynched was near 100%. Do you really think that Maria and I have much of a chance in lynching Gerry over me? Zap is/was hard town reading Gerry, you are too. And its not like Gerry is going to lynch himself and Sable had a strong town read on him. So you think that Maria and I knowing this went into night to try to no kill Gerry when him and you and everyone is going to scream \"no kill gambit!\" No, if Maria and I were scum the ONLY chance we'd have is for her to bus me.<br><br>but then we have a big problem here. You are scum reading her and we have 2 \"confirmed\" town. Like the ONLY person she could push as scum is Gerry so she's not obviously killing him. So in your no kill maria-nero scum theory she goes into lylo with either two \"confirmed\" town or 1 \"confirmed\" town and you. Honestly, that is dumb as absolute fuck. You'd be dead or one of the \"confirmed\" town would be dead."}

The town completely misapplied the principles of setup spec here. It's not about what the roles technically CAN do, it's about what they are MEANT to do.<br><br>Okay, so the game included three roles technically capable of protecting someone from a kill. But you have to ask yourself what the purpose of those roles is. Rosske's role sure as heck was not meant to be protective. And both Elyse's and Nero's roles had protective and investigative elements to them. An non-consecutive JK is not a lot of protective power, and the Weak Doctor is better used to get clears. So yes, if Rosske and Elyse had flipped normal Bodyguard and normal Doctor, you would be right to be highly suspicious of a JK claim of any sort. But you have to look at the setup as a whole and not just cherry pick parts of the roles to support your conclusion."}

They knew that Nero wasn't scum and they still couldn't be sure he was a JK because they didn't even have any active power roles.<br><br>Let's consider some possibilities, based on this setup.<br><br>-D1, town lynches the traitor encryptor. Scum shoot a VT. Town's weak doctor crumbs their target, then targets one of the two remaining scum and dies. Town JOAT follows the scum who performed the kill. On D2, town sees the weak doc's target and lynches scum. Meanwhile town JOAT gives their result that the last remaining scum targeted the VT who died. D3, town lynch scum and win. Best case scenario for scum, the last scum manages to eke out one more day with a clever fakeclaim -- but at that point, either the JOAT neapolitan role or the town weak doc would confirm them as scum the next day.<br><br>There are multiple ways for this scenario to play out because there are so many different ways for town to produce a result indicative of who scum is. Let's say scum get run up and fakeclaim VT. Neapolitan checks them that night and gets a \"not VT\" result. JK can jail the scum who make the kill. Weak doc, JK and commuter can all prevent kills from happening. Follower can produce a pretty high-confidence result that a certain player was scum. Weak doc produces high-confidence results. BG can even help clear a player because if the JOAT crumbs who they're going to protect and then they die, it suggests that person is town.<br><br>But ultimately I think you just have to consider numbers, too. It becomes so difficult for town to believe in PR claims when they see claim after claim, flip after flip, and then scum have nothing that's all that useful. If you'd even made one of the goons something dumb like a neighborizer it would've helped. Or like a one-shot blocking ability of some sort.<br><br>You say it's not about what power roles CAN do. I say you have to consider that. You have to plan for worst-case scenarios and mitigate where you can. I know because it's happened to me as a mod before. I had a role I was excited for, I MEANT for it to be used a certain way, and guess what? It worked out a totally different way and tipped the scales heavily in favor of town."}

I procrastinated.<br>I knew that Ira was going to be the D2 lynch; all I had to do was tunnel them hard, then do a fake guilty on someone (I was leaning Zap, he creeped me out; I knew thatwhile he might not have been right at that moment, he was very likely to be right in the end) D3, try to take them out with me.<br>I was going to crumb traitor D2, but Maria said something completely absolutely bone-chillingly awful:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8199680#p8199680\" class=\"postlink\">post 1163</a>, MariaR wrote:</cite>WAIT WAIT WAIT <br><br>Scum have fucking day chat??? I thought it was only nightchat unless stated otherwise</div></blockquote><br>...I knew I'd have to go solo after that. I could not afford to die sooner than D3, that conversation would be fresh in town's memory.<br>Nero started a bw on me, and, of course, Ira hops on; what really freaked me out was Maria joining in. I had completely failed to notify her before then, so my reaction post was literally designed to do nothing but dispel Nero's concerns and tip her off to my identity. I wanted to tell her I knew she was scum while still voting Ira, classic bus buddy lynch town, while distancing us from one another if I did die; from the looks of it, the later part worked.<br>I honestly don't know how I got lynched. Elyse and BYF voted me with absolutely no reasoning, and Zap had said I was an ambiguous figure earlier. I thought I'd shot down all of Nero's talking points, but apparently not...<br>The Gerry townslip was ingenious; I literally LOL'd when I realized what he was doing (for a while there, I actually thought he legitimately didn't know what traitor did). Maria and Gerry's fighting made me so happy, I didn't contemplate what it felt like for you guys. It was like watching a soap opera for me; I was removed from the drama, and thus enjoyed every moment of what was cancer for you guys.<br><br>MVP mafia goes to Gerry; his only real threat in this game was Nero, and Maria indirectly exacerbated our early game play.<br>MVP town goes to Elyse for almost saving the game. Nero's gut reads, the people he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">knew</span> were scum but failed to admit to himself, were impeccable, but overall, his play was very... peccable, and I can't even blame him. The antagonistic environment that me, Ira, Dw, Nero, Elyse (to a lesser extent), and especially Gerry/Maria created waged a noticeable toll on his psyche. Zap silently withered, but Nero visibly rotted.<br>...In retrospect, this game was pretty terrible, wasn't it?<br><br>The only three people in this game whose play I really, really liked were Zap, Elyse, and Gerry.<br>Zap had all the tools and all the brainpower necessary to come to correct conclusions, but there was always one critical variable he lacked that threw off his reads. Easily the best analytic mind in the game. IMO Zap's the most competent player here, but we ruined it for him.<br>Elyse <span style=\"font-style: italic\">frightened me</span>. She stopped talking mid-early game, so I had know idea what she was thinking, but she was right with astonishing accuracy. Every time she made a concrete read on someone, if I recall correctly, it was awfully close to true, if not completely correct. However, the fact that she never managed to nab a truly game-changing investigation N1 or N2 was unfortunate. She almost saved the game with the two clears, but it just wasn't enough; I don't recall her softing who she would visit N3 either, if she had done that, it probably would have been a town win.<br>And Gerry managed to go the entire game without messing anything up. If he ever did anything wrong, it was getting Ira to townread him, ironically, which, if I recall correctly, was one of the reasons Nero first started FOSing him, despite the \"townslip\" Nero realized was contrived.<br><br>And, reluctantly, I have to admit that itlepip was right about this being a de facto balanced theme. Commuter is too situational, JOATs in general suck, non-consecutive JK and weak doctor were the only things that stood much of a chance of doing anything, really. If you reduce the practicality of it to just the JK and the weak doctor versus an encrypted scumteam, it's actually fairly balanced. All the other two PR's did was add an element of luck, while reducing the viability of scumhunting via claims. Rosske claiming PR caused such a panic partially because three other town members were already inclined to take his claim with a grain of salt.<br><br>I would also like to issue a formal apology for being a jerkbag to Ira. I got carried away with tunneling you, and personally insulted you. I'm... sorry about that, I just really wanted you dead. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\"><br><br>...Alright, that should be all I wanted to say. I did have two questions, though:<br>1) How did I do?<br>2) Zap, you should join the in-signups Desperation Day micro or Flavorless micro.<br><br>p-edit: For the love of crap, give it a rest, literally nobody played to even 50% of their full potential this game."}
