Originally an upscale district, over the past fifty years it has seen a drop in land value and now houses approximately 300 people of all wealth classes. Yet it still retains its xenophobic attitude with Whiffleburg at large, making it difficult for even prospective howeowners and emergency vehicles to gain access.<br>\n<br>\nFlitter Hills is now about to face one of its toughest challenges in years. The morning of August 5th 2013, Bruce Costello, landscape architect and the Chairman of the Flitter Hills Community Club, was found dead in Twill Park. Aside from the three bullet holes in his chest and two in his belly, a printed note was stapled to his forehead:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">So, one of you finally discovered our plot. That's fine with us. We'll just start killing people until you leave the doors of the Security Center open at night so we can take over your little world. Go ahead and try to stop us.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe Deputy Chairman, Buck Poston, immediately put out a call to all residents' homes. Beginning the next day, thirteen volunteers would convene at the Community Hall to form an investigation comittee. This comittee would comb the community and its members daily and attempt to ferret out the evildoers as fast as possible. If necessary, they would also have the right to execute one person per day, should they be convinced that they have found one of the baddies. To avoid interference from the outside world, the news of the deaths would be kept secret until the hunt was successful.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, Buck was known more for his cowboy diplomacy than his critical thinking. The next morning, as the thirteen volunteers came up to the Community Hall, his corpse was found duct-taped to the front yard's statue with another note stapled to his face:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Since this idiot didn't make his little witch-hunt a private affair, we've decided to infiltrate it and take it down. Good luck finding us before you're all dead.</div><br>\n<br>\nThe shaken citizens set up in the main conference room and took a headcount:<br>\n<br>\n<table style=\"border:1px solid black; \"><tr><td

one could be trusted. They would commit to executing one person per day via hanging and refrain from attempting to use outside sources (such as searching one's house) until each day's suspect was dead. They expected there to be two or three infiltrators, so after having killed three of them, they would stop any more executions unless there continued to be murders. And while everyone recognized everyone else, nobody really knew anyone else, so there was no favouritism involved - as far as anyone knew.</div></div></div><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Playerlist</legend>1. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Smudger</div><br>\n2. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Grimgroove</div> &#8592; <div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">yessiree</div><sup>1</sup></div><br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">beastcharizard</div><br>\n4. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bowser</div> &#8592; <div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RationalMadman</div> &#8592; </div><div style=\"font-size: 64%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kcdaspot</div><sup>2</sup></div><br>\n5. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">don_johnson</div><br>\n6. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Titus</div> &#8592; <div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ryhx</div><br>\n7. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elyse</div><sup>1</sup> &#8592; <div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">brjl</div><sup>1</sup></div><br>\n8. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Huntress</div> &#8592; <div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">runnerman</div><sup>3</sup></div><br>\n9. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Paperscraps</div><sup>1</sup><br>\n10. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sthar8</div><sup>1</sup><br>\n11. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Feel It</div><br>\n12. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">notreallygood</div><br>\n13. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">T S O</div><br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 70%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Bold: confirmed; Superscript: prods</div></fieldset><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Current deadline</legend>Game over.</fieldset><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Those who still live</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">3. beastcharizard, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00bf00\">Town Tracker</div><br>\n6.

Players may post in-thread something like <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Request Extension: X days</div> (not accepted by mod PM). Once 50% of players have requested an extension, one will be granted with a length equal to the most common choice.

This message should be treated as a role PM and therefore may not be quoted, only paraphrased. Force-replaced players may not necessarily be allowed to do this, depending on the nature of the force-replace.<br>\n</li><li>If a replacement occurs during Day with three days or less left in the deadline, the deadline will be suspended while the replacement is happening and reset to three days once it is completed.<br>\n</li><li>Replacements may ask for an extension of up to three days, but only in their first few posts.

As promised, this is an explanation of everything I've done in game so far, along with the conclusions I've drawn.<br>\n<br>\nEspecially because of the PBPA part, this is going to be a really long post.  I'll mitigate somewhat with spoilers, but I apologize in advance for the walls.<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Self-PBPA, through post 93</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">So, my plan here started with meta.  in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5202831#p5202831\" class=\"postlink\">post 18</a> charizard mentioned that he's played a game with TSO before.  I really like multiple metas because it saves a bunch of work and gives relevant interactions between the playstyles of the two players involved, so I looked it up.  In the game that they shared, a discussion of charizard's meta came up.  I followed the links to the other game, and found that charizard plays very similarly as town and scum.  He appears to like doing the \"super protown\"  thing as scum, which might make him very hard to read.  I did notice a potential tell (that I can't out right now, sorry) that required me to get a baseline on char's emotional state this game before it would be useful.  To that end, I determined that I needed to annoy charizard fairly early this game.  Specifically, from his meta he appears to dislike things he doesn't understand or can't reason out explicitly, so I picked that tone for my early posts.<br>\n<br>\nFeelIt has seen me employ that particular tactic in a different way before, but I noticed an opportunity for extra value.<br>\n<br>\nThe second thing I was worried about involved the rules in this particular game.  Specifically, I wanted to test the rules for voting.  Toomai's ruleset is a little vague on what counts as a vote, which of course is information that I needed ASAP.  I could have pm'd Toomai or posted in the thread asking for clarification, but the subtleties of the rule could be used in a trap later in the game and I didn't want to risk the ability to use the rule against scum.  Plus, it was easy to test while working on the other pieces of the gambit.<br>\n<br>\nThird, as of post 58 the game was very quiet.  We hadn't gained much information from RVS and I was ready for a wagon to analyze.  While I will maintain that I didn't do anything scummy during the course of this gambit, several others have pointed out that town are often willing to lynch players they don't understand even without any overt anti-town behavior.  Frankly, it's also easier for me to analyze a wagon on myself, since the sure knowledge that I am pro-town in motivation eliminates a significant portion of the variables.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I decided to a) place an abbreviated vote to test whether it would count b) give no explanation for my vote to annoy beast and c) ride the no explanation wagon until I had enough votes for proper analysis.

Paper, the brevity necessary for the tactic may have made my questions unclear.  I was actually asking, \"Why is what I am doing not very town?\" and \"Why is keeping things hidden suspicious?\"  Ideally, Paper would have answered these questions before I gave up the gambit.  I don't think town would have tolerated that though.  I'd still like the answers if possible.  I intended the questions to make town players strongly consider my motivations.<br>\n<br>\nMy third bit in that post was a semantic joke coupled with a horse laugh.

It's just controversial. Some people like it, some don't. Unfortunately, in the last game I played, some of the players encouraged it, and thus I ended up getting lynched.

TSO said that notreally asking for others' reads gave him a \"bad feeling.\"<br>\n<br>\nrunnerman- Almost no posting, but what he does give us demonstrates insight.

Having only three real posts by page 7 is not.  At the risk of devolving into theory, I'd still like to see the answers to the questions I posed.<br>\n<br>\nActive Posters (Active being a relative term):<br>\n<br>\nFeel It- One of the very few players actively examining my motivations.  This is not surprising, as he would have marked the difference in my play.  His play is consistent with my experience, which is quite meaningless as I do not know his alignment in that other game.<br>\n<br>\nnotreallygood- Questioning my motivations.  Cooperative.  Seems concerned with scumhunting.  I believe he wants to \"save me\" from being a VI, which is productive.<br>\n<br>\nElyse- Welcome to the game.  Good post.  I disagree with much of it, but it's solid reasoning. Keep doing that.<br>\nA couple points- \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>(I'm calling you star from now on)</div></blockquote>\nThat's fine.  My username was assigned to me by the Airforce almost 20 years ago, and I've been using it since.  It's the first two letters of my first name, the first three of my last name, and a numerical indicator that happens to have some significance to me.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why do you FoS him here if you meant to vote him before?</div></blockquote>\nTwo reasons:  As I noted before, I was provoking emotional reactions and beast appears to dislike things he cannot explain.  Also, I had come up with that misspelling of his name in case I needed to test the voting system any further and I didn't want to waste it  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> <br>\n<br>\nsthar8- Fuck this guy.  He's giving me a headache.<br>\n<br>\nAnd what's most importantly, my current scumlist, from weakest to strongest read:<br>\n<br>\nbeastcharizard- Just on the scummy side of neutral.  I'm not going to push him much today unless he gives me some really good tells because he's active and I think I'll be able to read him later.<br>\nHere's what bugs me about his play, from weakest to strongest:<br>\n1.  Directing town.  Pushing everyone to answer his questions and ask more of him, promising that he'd unvote me if I presented logic, announcing the end of rvs and stating that further jokes are now scummy, coaching other players to contribute.  Basically, charizard wants to be leading the town and so is attempting to manipulate others' behavior with his posts.  This is a very, very weak scumtell, particularly because <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I do that shit all the time</div> regardless of my alignment.  The difference is, of course, that I know why <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I'd</div> be doing that.<br>\n2. He seems overly concerned at his image.  Noting that he's serious, noting that he's \"giving out information,\"  offering to present meta on himself, insisting that he's been doing most of the scumhunting.  Charizard looks concerned with being perceived as town, as opposed to actually playing a town game.  He might just be self-conscious and I get the impression that he likes to see himself on \"townie\" lists regardless of alignment, but it's still worrying.<br>\n3. His hypocrisy regarding don.  Attacking me for not providing reasoning, then having no reasoning on don later suggests that he was looking for a plausible reason to attack me instead of attacking me for something he found scummy.<br>\n4. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213860#p5213860\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> sets off all of my scumbells.  I appreciate the joke, but he ignored a direct question (that he still hasn't answered) to make it.  Given beast's play so far, especially how concerned he's been with questions and answers, I see no protown reason from his perspective to ignoring my request for a case on me.  It looks like he thought I'd be an easy lynch, and if he could avoid giving any reasoning for voting me he could pass it off as policy or blame someone else for pushing it on day 2.<br>\n<br>\nT S O- I have no idea what TSO is doing this game.  A lot of little one liners are not conducive to either scumhunting or conveying your motivations.<br>\nWeakest to strongest again:<br>\n1. Coaching Charizard <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212680#p5212680\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.  Especially the first post, because he's helping someone make a case on a person <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">he's expressed no suspicion of</div>.  Related, his attacks on me could be indicative if charizard were to flip scum.  He attacks me for \"noise posting\" (to be fair, that's totally true, but he doesn't say how it's scummy) on the only posts with relevant questions that might pertain to charizard's alignment.<br>\n2. Mudslinging.  He's expressed suspicion of {notreally, sthar8, kcda, possibly yessiree} without voting for any of them.  His RVS vote is still active, despite having 14 more posts of discussion (?).  He refuses to give his own list of suspicions, but criticizes notreally on the quantity of his reads.  It appears that TSO is looking for an easy wagon but doesn't want to actually be seen on one.<br>\n3. I don't know what kind of manipulation TSO is afraid of, but having 15 posts with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">no actual reads</div> is scummy as shit.  Town should generally be more concerned with their information being available in thread and actually catching scum.  You do need more than just your vote, which means you'll have to convince others to share your opinion.  Additionally, shouldn't you be able to mitigate any manipulation based on your reads simply by being aware that you're susceptible to it?  It looks like TSO has priorities other than scumhunting right now, which is anti-town.<br>\n<br>\nKcdaspot- I don't know if my suspicions on kcda are actually the strongest, but I do think he's the best lynch right now.<br>\nHere's why I voted him originally (these are super weak but I felt they were enough for my purposes on page 3):<br>\n1. He jumped in during a semi-serious discussion but made sure to get his random vote in.<br>\n2. He then found a bad excuse to make his random vote serious, without having to post that.<br>\n3. He next post was joking and without content, giving him an out should his vote be questioned.<br>\n<br>\nHere's why I'll be voting him in a moment:<br>\n1. He was the third vote on my wagon and I don't think he's aware of the jeep tells.<br>\n2. He talked don into voting me using a game that (as far as I can tell) is irrelevant (though a fun read).  This looks like buddying to me.<br>\n3. After voting for me with no reasoning and convincing don to do the same he just... vanished.  Lurking is a particularly insidious scumtactic because it prevents the other players from getting a read on you.  It looks to me like kcda tried to set up a day1 mislynch and then disappeared hoping that the town would finish it off for him.  That way he can come back in and claim to have been joking/pressure voting/not ready to lynch when I flip town the next day.<br>\n<br>\nI think a scumlurker is a great lynch day 1, especially since my other suspects seem content to keep dropping tells.  I certainly don't want to let him lurk his way to a later day when he can be much more damaging.  Barring prods or replacement, I'm very happy with my vote on KCDA today.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nAs I said above, I'm going to<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: kcda</span><br>\n<br>\nQuestions?

A townie does not know the alignment of the other players in the game.  TSO has not even <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">suggested</div> that he finds don suspicious.  But, he's advising charizard, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">whose alignment he should not know</div> on how to better present a case against someone <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">he does not find suspicious</div>.  If he thinks don is scum, then why not make the case himself?  Why does TSO trust charizard?  <br>\n<br>\nPossibilites:<br>\nTSO is town with no reads, and wants charizard to present a case to help him get back into the game.  But why would TSO trust that charizard is not scum?<br>\n<br>\nTSO is scum, and wants charizard-town to push a case on a townie.  That makes charizard look bad and hopefully results in a mislynch.  This one fits.<br>\n<br>\nTSO and charizard are scum, and TSO thinks that charizard's unsupported suspicions on don are likely to draw their own suspicions (they have).  He warns charizard that if he's going to make a case, he should make a real case. This one also fits.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\" data-post-id=\"5216097\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 142</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20887\">T S O</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nYou're fueling a useless argument. Why?</div></blockquote>\n\nI freely admit that this one's harder to read because of TSO's characteristic simplicity.  By my reading, this post, directed at charizard, suggests that his argument with me is pointless, and that there's no reason to get don involved.  This comes from the same page on which TSO suggests that me asking him for reads \"felt forced\" and that I appear to be scum for my \"white noise\" posts.  So why is TSO trying to get charizard to back off?  If I'm so scummy, you would think that he'd be happy for someone to push my wagon to a lynch.  <br>\n<br>\nPossibilities-<br>\nTSO is town, and is expressing suspicion of charizard for continuing to argue with me.  This is unsupported by anything else in TSO's posts, but it does bring his potential list of expressed suspicions up to 5/13 players.<br>\nTSO is scum, and thinks I will be lynched today.  He wants to be able to point back at that post to show that he was not driving my wagon and felt charizard was suspicious for doing so.  This fits.<br>\nTSO and charizard are scum, and TSO doesn't think my wagon is going to go through.  He doesn't want his partner getting stuck in with a townie and making himself a potential target for night actions, as we're certainly drawing a lot of attention. This is a bit of a stretch, but it fits too.<br>\n<br>\n@ Everyone-  Also note how TSO only wants to argue <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">what I characterized as the weakest tell against him.</div>", "time": "Tue Aug 13, 2013 12:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

You have to have a clear mind when playing Mafia. <br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, It is <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">ME</div> who don't understand Kcdaspot. If you said his posts were so easy to comprehend, then why didn't you explain it to me? <br>\n<br>\nBesides, why do you think Kcda and runnerman are town? You haven't explained that either. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, Even though sthar was only L-3 at that time, I had to remind him of his behaviour. That's because I'd had similar experience, and I had a feeling that if he kept going on like that, he would get policy lynched. You may not understand, because that's something related to personal experiences and cannot be expressed by words.<br>\n<br>\nMoreover, I said \"Smudger is V/LA\" instead of simply \"Everyone else: can't read\" because I have a certain habit of explaining everything. Again, that's my style.<br>\n<br>\nLook, I love your spirit of finding the scum, but I see your posts are a little bit too subjective and discourteous. For example, When Paper said I wasn't fencesitting, you immediately disagreed with that and asked him \"How is that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> fencesitting?\", which is a little rude in my opinion. Besides, he had already given his reason in his post. <br>\n<br>\nAnother example is when you described Feel It as \"half-assed and scummy\" just because he had only given reads on four people. If you had read the posts coming after that, you would've known that he did that because those were the only people whom he could give opinions on. <br>\n<br>\nLady, don't push it too hard.

By my reading, this post, directed at charizard, suggests that his argument with me is pointless, and that there's no reason to get don involved.  This comes from the same page on which TSO suggests that me asking him for reads \"felt forced\" and that I appear to be scum for my \"white noise\" posts.  So why is TSO trying to get charizard to back off?  If I'm so scummy, you would think that he'd be happy for someone to push my wagon to a lynch.  <br>\n<br>\nPossibilities-<br>\nTSO is town, and is expressing suspicion of charizard for continuing to argue with me.  This is unsupported by anything else in TSO's posts, but it does bring his potential list of expressed suspicions up to 5/13 players.<br>\nTSO is scum, and thinks I will be lynched today.  He wants to be able to point back at that post to show that he was not driving my wagon and felt charizard was suspicious for doing so.  This fits.<br>\nTSO and charizard are scum, and TSO doesn't think my wagon is going to go through.  He doesn't want his partner getting stuck in with a townie and making himself a potential target for night actions, as we're certainly drawing a lot of attention.

People with fewer posts are not necessarily scum motivated. In fact, day 1 is where I would expect to find the most scum influence given that the scum can move the train to anyone.

Well day one to me is, generally about getting a feel for people, yes that is a \"No Shit Sherlock\" statement.  But hear me out, I do this by sitting back, obviously not too much or I get called out for lurking, and see who is active and what they are saying and who is calling out who.  I then of course take the answers to questions I may ask on board and this is generally the way I like play D1<br>\n<br>\n So what am I seeing? Well in no particular order<br>\n<br>\nElyse: - actually comes across to me as town, very active responding to questions and any challenges that are throwing their way (it is a Hydra yes?).  reasoning is coherent and nothing is now coming across as outwardly questionable or raises my eyebrows.<br>\n<br>\nSthar: - he obviously likes to take the lead and is very convincing in how he presents his reads and interpretation of the play so far.  His techniques are new to me in this game and the way he evaluates playing styles and personalities, At first read I it slightly threatening, but as I reread what was being said I realised what was going on.  I know I say threatening, and that some may now say \"hang on why would you feel threatened?\"  as i said, first glance made me stop and think hang on... as for Sthars alignment, I would like to think he is town I would like to think his approach is one I could trust,  but I reserve judgement.<br>\n<br>\nTSO: - I had a chuckle at Sthar's approach and subsequent \"read\" of TSO, but that is where it stopped to be honest.  take away the TSO and Sthar interchange and what do we have? well we still have a defensive approach IMO and not much more TBH.  input is low and responses to questions is not what I would have expected.<br>\n<br>\nTitus: - is on some peoples possible scum lists including my own early on, but I don't see it right now, yes again input so far is low, to be expected D1 maybe, but the majority of what is being said does not ring alarm bells with me. <br>\n<br>\nRunnerman:- Up until recently I was feeling possible scum, however recent interaction has started to change that perception.  <br>\n<br>\nKCDA :- I dont get it at all, the style is wacky and simplistic IMO, is that bad, not really but even still king of the lurkers in my book and for that reason aloneI have a bad feeling about him, enough to put him in the scum category at this time, yes pretty much, and I actually echo what NRG is saying about KDCA.<br>\n<br>\nYessiree :- ?? have played in a game with Yessiree before but had to replace out, there seems to be no difference from the little I have seen and experienced previously, I would reserve judgement on him also.<br>\n<br>\nPaperscraps: - leaning town on Papers right now for similar reasons as those I have alluded to with Elyse.  is active and responds to questions and challenges coherently.  <br>\n<br>\nBeasts: - Obviously an experienced player and is very active with, IMO, balanced and objective responses to questions and challenges and an early candidate of  \"here is some pressure how you going to deal with it approach\" from Sthar, and to be fair and honest my initial feelings were at that stage \" I don't know maybe scum\" and now they have moved to \"middle for diddle\", meaning again I will reserve judgement but would lean slight town.  <br>\n<br>\nFeelIt :- have played a few games with FeelIt before, in those IIRC he was town and I see no difference between what I saw there and what I am seeing presently.  Yes his input is low, but he is making good comment and is involved when he does post, I think currently FeelIt is town, based on my experience of him previously.<br>\n<br>\nNRG:- was an original possible scum choice of mine and remains so TBH, content of posts have been fairly non committal and some posts unnecessary IMO. would like to see more input.<br>\n<br>\nDon:- again was on my original stand out list as possible scum and until the \"hey let's form a gang\" post, I was coming around to thinking of his inputs as sensible and town like, but that idea he has presented in my mind seems to say, \"follow me lets kill this list of people first because I don't like them, and you don't either do you, no you don't, go on you can trust me!\"  the bit that seems to be missing is \"then I turn on you... \"  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nso after all that where do I think my vote is best served, well here:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TSO</span><br>\n<br>\nwhy TSO and not the other possible scum in my list, as I said before take away the interchange with Sthar and there is not really a lot there, short answers to questions and the challenging attitude remains an underlying current IMO.", "time": "Sun Aug 18, 2013 9:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

The rest will follow tomorrow. After that I'll try to participate in the here and now. Hope we'll be getting that deadline extension.<br>\n<br>\nI'll just base my posts on the notes I have scribbled down. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Titus</div><br>\nHaven't gotten written down much, apart from me really liking his entrance, as he shared my views on beastcharizard at that point. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211470#p5211470\">97</a>, especially the part about Don Johnson's buddying. Don't really know what he was doing by making two persons out of charizard and beast though. Would like him to expand on that.<br>\n<br>\nI also saw some people refer to Titus as a \"she\". It might be nothing, but could those people explain why they did that and where they found out Titus is a female? <br>\n<br>\nDespite my few notes, he strikes me as very townish. It's just that all of his posts so far rub me the right way. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elyse</div> (replacing brjl)<br>\n<br>\nI didn't like brjl at all. His posts seemed to come off too much as him being Mr. Nice Guy. Lots of smilies and jokes, very little content.<br>\nElyse's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5218577#p5218577\">152</a> changed this completely. That post almost summed up word for word what I had on other people myself at that point. This results in a strong townread on Elyse from my part. The only strange thing I found about that post was the vote on notreallygood, whereas I expected that vote to come on beastcharizard. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Don Johnson</div><br>\n<br>\nStarted with a very peculiar self-vote. I find it very strange because it seemed to be designed as some form of reaction test. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5204860#p5204860\">31</a> he votes for TSO for the following reasons: TSO didn't answer beastcharizard's questions and TSO misspelled Mr. Johnson's name. However, TSO had called Mr. Johnson out for the self-vote. I found it strange and scummy that Don johnson would not make any reference to that, because that means the self-vote apparently was not a reaction test. But what was it then?  Scum trying to portray an image of confidence by doing something out of the ordinary? That's my line of thinking at least. <br>\nAs referred to earlier, I also found his \"buddying\" towards Titus noteworthy, especially in combination for his liking of beastcharizard at the time of said buddying. Titus entered with an attack on beastcharizard, whose questions Don johnson seemed to be holding in high esteem. A small discrepancy in Don Johnson's opinions I thought. After that I have seen him do little else than prod dodging. Scummy guy if you ask me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kcdaspot</div><br>\n<br>\nI liked his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206158#p5206158\">53</a>, it was an odd follow-up of events in my eyes as well. It's a pity his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5208729#p5208729\">63</a> tries to pass off everything before that as one big joke. Looks very clumsy. The bits about his \"suspicious winking\" seem to come out of nowhere, possibly revealing some over-worrying about he and his smilies could be percieved. I have no idea what his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210356#p5210356\">84</a> actually means and refers to, and as far as I can tell he never expanded on it. Nevertheless that post felt townie to me. Also his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219910#p5219910\">168</a> felt very townish to me, particularly the part where he welcomes sthar to the game. It shows some confidence towards the greatest contributor to the game that makes me feel he's town. He's a townread of mine, but it's all gut.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sthar8</div><br>\n<br>\nEvery game needs his obvtown and he's the one who gets the part. In the beginning I found his strong support for the RQS bizarre, as well as the, at that point, unexplained vote on Kcda. By page 4 he claimed to be on to something. I'm currently reading some Agatha Cristie's, and it reminded me a lot of the Hercule Poirot character. Smugly sitting in a chair, appearing to have it all worked out, and delivering at the end of the book while showing he was truly onto something all along. Shtar's breakthroughs are not as legendary as Hercule Poirot's (not yet, at least), but they already come quite close. I loved his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216768#p5216768\">148</a>. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> was equally impressive. I do have two questions noted down here:<br>\n*&#168;Why, in the scheme of things, was it important for sthar to wait for Paperscraps in particular? I never saw and still don't see the significance of Paperscraps in this scheme. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212733#p5212733\">111</a> Paperscraps is brought up as a related note, and shortly after he becomes the one unmet condition in order for sthar to divulge his plans. An oddity I'd like cleared up. Hercule Poirot never leaves any loose ends in his logic, so I expect the same of sthar. <br>\n* This question is a bit less relevant now since sthar himself admitted to that part of the argument against TSO being the weakest, but I found the way he called out TSO for coaching beastcharizard not up to par with the rest of his material. First of all, it is an associative tell that we can only use once either of them flips. Second, I don't think the point he makes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219925#p5219925\">170</a> is very convincing when it comes to town TSO not asking beastcharizard to make a case against don_johnson. I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is Always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. <br>\nI'll get to TSO later, but my notes on him don't really agree with the viewpoints presented by sthar8 on TSO in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a>. Given TSO seems to be the main lynch-candidate for today, I imagine some debate. <br>\nAs evident from my earlier comments on Kcda, I also don't agree with sthar's views on that guy. I find it a bit of an anti-climax to see his elaborate plan result in a vote on someone who looks to me as a harmless lurker. But like I said, that's just my gut talking. <br>\nDespite these disagreements, I feel sthar is town. Obvtown in fact.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Feel it</div><br>\n<br>\nHaven't written much about him. I noted that I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a> and his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214230#p5214230\">129</a>, the last one for sheeping the people I consider town.

It made him come off as a newbie which he is clearly not. It also made him come off as careless, and people coming off as careless usually rub me the wrong way because that means they're actively trying to come across as such. I did like how he mirrored sthar8 at some point (didn't write down which post that was, but it was that vote where he mimicks sthar's vote on Kcda and votes on sthar himself). Somehow it felt like the move of a confident townsperson to treat sthar in such a way. By then sthar wasn't the presence that he is now, but I thought sthar's first few posts already hinted at him being a player not to trifle with too much. Yet Paperscraps did just that. Felt bold.<br>\nI also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216049#p5216049\">139</a>, the \"long awaited response\", in which he correctly wonders why this response was so crucial.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216082#p5216082\">141</a>'s second question I found especially pertinent. <br>\nHis reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219918#p5219918\">169</a> I find less convincing.

I just don't see them here, in either TSO's tone or his other content.  Some points though:<br>\n1.  Coaching isn't associative, it's behavioral.  Scum coach scum to subtly protect each other, and scum coach town as a form of buddying.  The point is that in order to coach like TSO was doing, you have to be certain of the other player's alignment.  Being certain of alignment is a scumtell.<br>\n2. This is one I'm always on the lookout for because it's usually the best way to catch <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">me</div> as scum.  I tend to arrogantly assume that I know better than my scumbuddies, and try to fix their play (Anybody want to argue that TSO isn't arrogant?).  I find it especially indicative when the coach doesn't otherwise interact with the person they are coaching (not that TSO has had any significant interaction with anybody but me).

I shall try to do it justice as soon as I get fully into this game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">notreallygood</div><br>\n<br>\nIn the beginning of the game his play was defined by one thing: sideline comments. He never engaged, he was a spectator not threading on any toes. He commented on things going on, yes, but never substantially. This keeps going on until post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213619#p5213619\">117</a>, where he gives a reads list. Two things struck me as odd in that reads list: 1. there\"s no read on Don. This is a possible associative tell. Everyone else there's a read on, be it scum, town or null. In Don's case he just mentions an agreement on a certain particularity, but no read. 2. He considers sthar scum, but he phrases it this way: \"I hate to say this, but sthar is scum\" (paraphrased). Why add the part \"I hate to say this\"? It feels very off to me. If as town you truly consider sthar scum, there's no reason to hate saying it. Hating to say something means you're not comfortable in saying it, and if you're not comfortable in calling someone scum, Iguess it means you somehow know they're not scum. And how would you know? And why would you still say it then? Only one answer to that question. <br>\nLike Elyse has said, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214012#p5214012\">125</a> and 126 are remarkable as well. It's where he calls on sthar not to be a cunt. For starters, I don't think sthar was being a cunt. Second, I generally don't like people briging up policy lynches, but definitely not in this game. I've only reached page 7 and I see enormous content. Why then bring up policy lynches? It seems fabricated to do so.<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214345#p5214345\">130</a> he blindly takes over the idea that it is important to wait for MPaperscraps reply. Even though sthar8 knew the reasons why it was important to do so, he didn't. There's no way he could know in my eyes. Hence this looks like the blatant sheeping of obvtown sthar8. <br>\nI found the reaction to sthar's expos&#233; in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216969#p5216969\">150</a> unnaturally aloof. sthar's 148 deserved more than that. Looks like scum trying to play down what is happening.<br>\nAnd his reply to Elyse's catch-up post is also quite bad, as he mainly addresses things pertaining to himself in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219866#p5219866\">167</a>, which I find scummy to begin with. I know what argument is going to come up next, but in that post I see a notreallygood who is so caught up with how he is being percieved that he not only selects the pieces that are about him, he for some reason feels it necessary to add some inconsequential defence odf Feel It's post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a>. Why single out that post by someone else to valiantly defend it? Just feels wrong.<br>\nI have nothing good to say about notreallygood at this point. I think he's scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TSO</div><br>\nI'm going to start off by daying I had read the last post before entering this topic, and saw suspicions were raised against him (someone calling him out on his reads being poor). I regretted having read that, as I imagined this would bias me in a stance against TSO, but I have to say my impression of his first posts was very positive. I particularly liked how he defied beastcharizard by not answering his questions. And I also liked his vote on Don Johnson because he self-voted. I think I would have done something similar. I also thought his questions to bryl (Elyse's slot) were very pertinent at the time. (I apologize for not adding post numbers, I didn't write them down, but it's on the first few pages of the topic). MY first question mark was raised when he townread Feel It in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206249#p5206249\">54</a>, which felt very out of the blue at the time, as well as his scumread on Kcda just after it. Like Elyse (again :p) I had a complete opposite reaction: I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't). Though I do not agree with his critisisms on sthar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5215371#p5215371\">134</a> and those coming just after it, they do feel authentic and not forced. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\">142</a>, which I found to be a just criticism toward beastcharizard. Townfeels from TSO.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">beautycharizard</div><br>\nGot the most notes on him. Already rubbed me the wrong me starting from his very first post, where he showed clear intent to become some sort of townleader. I was wondering whether he was over-enthousiastic town or self-overestimating scum, and I'm pretty much settled on the latter. He's obviously very smart and sensible, but that's exactly what's giving him away. His posts all feel so terribly calculated. He knows just what to say, he has rational explanations for everything, but it just doesn't feel real. <br>\nTake his RVS for instance. Already in his first post he tries to vote, and in his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5202831#p5202831\">18</a> he RVS'es, but at the same time feels the need to throughly explain that RVS. The \"R\" in \"RVS\" stands for RANDOM, yet already here he wants to come off as this rational, level-headed townleader who thinks everything through. His idea for an RQS seems like a way for him tog et towncred, plain and simple. The added value of his questions are, however entertaining, quite limited. I wouldn't have had so much problems with it, if it hadnt been for post post]46[/post] where he tries to take credit for getting people to talk. This would have happened without him as well. This still leaves open the possibility of a self-centered townie, but I thinkthere's more at play. <br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209195#p5209195\">65</a> sounds unnaturally perfect. He tries to portray how reasonable he is by showing a willingness to change his vote if sthar changes his ways. Also his call for seriousness sounds incredibly forced. Bah!<br>\nIn post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209388#p5209388\">68</a> he insists on Titus answering his questions, yet only a post later^(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209438#p5209438\">71</a>), he claims those questions are not crucial and just for background. He agrees they are not of importance in the big scumhunting picture, but then why insist on TSO answering his questions? Towncred. That's all it is. Beastcharizard is not scumhunting. He's towncredhunting. <br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211258#p5211258\">94</a> is also bad. He's overthinking we he could be considered scummy. Not a town mindset at all.<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211433#p5211433\">96</a> shows too much defiance, the \"bring it on\"-attitude I don't see coming from town, but again from scum overestimating his manipulative abilities. There's also a soft attack on Don Johnson here. I wonder if there was a follow upo on that but Ih aven't seen it uptil now. So far it looks like a textbook soft-bus.<br>\nIn post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212211#p5212211\">107</a> he answers to one of sthar's questions by saying he thinks sthar's vote on him (which is really an FOS at that point) is an RVS. How could he possible believe that after all this time? That answer is just a way to avoid publicized introspection. There's no way sthar's stance towards beastcharziard was random in any way at that point, yet beastcharizard claimed to believe just that. I think this is a blatant lie. <br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213187#p5213187\">115</a> I also don't like. His answer to \"Who are you 3 top scumreads\" is not adequate, as it just mentions two people. Also his statement \"One thing you cannot say is that I don't share information\" is wrong and again fits in with his towncred-hunt. What information has he given? He just answered questions he felt safe in answering dsue to his estimation that he can fool anyone with rational thought and logic, but he forgets to consider that it all feels so wrong.<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213801#p5213801\">119</a> is terrible. Calling sthar's play horrible and scummy came out of nowhere and is completely uncalled for. It just shows defiance, but no content. Scummy as hell.<br>\nAnd in general I also feel he's asking questions, but only the obvious ones. Town will make sompe logical fallacies. If someone says \"All apples are green\", beastcharizard will be the one pointing out that some apples are red. True as that may be, he seems to focus on logic too much, trying to spot harmless mistakes in others and portray himself as an untouchable knight in shining armor. I think and I feel and I believe and I'm this close to knowing that this guy is scum.<br>\n<br>\nI would vote beastcharizard right now, but I want to finish reading through the rest of the topic first.

He never engaged, he was a spectator not threading on any toes. He commented on things going on, yes, but never substantially. </div></blockquote>\n\nI thought it was better not to engage at that point because sthar and beast were arguing. Joining the argument would only make them even angrier.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 1. there\"s no read on Don. This is a possible associative tell. Everyone else there's a read on, be it scum, town or null. In Don's case he just mentions an agreement on a certain particularity, but no read. </div></blockquote>\n\nIf there's no read, then it's null. Don wasn't paying much attention at that point of the game, so I didn't suspect him too much.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> 2. He considers sthar scum, but he phrases it this way: \"I hate to say this, but sthar is scum\" (paraphrased). Why add the part \"I hate to say this\"? It feels very off to me. If as town you truly consider sthar scum, there's no reason to hate saying it. Hating to say something means you're not comfortable in saying it, and if you're not comfortable in calling someone scum, I guess it means you somehow know they're not scum. And how would you know? And why would you still say it then? </div></blockquote>\n\nExperience. I could foresee that sthar might have a plan. Also, I didn't say he's scum, I said he's the most <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">scummy</div> one. That means judging on the situation at that point, sthar was the only one who got the most suspicion. I added the part \"I hate to say this\" because even though he might seem scummy, I didn't think he was really scum. According to my experience, the one who is the most suspicious at the early points of the game is most likely not the scum.  <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Like Elyse has said, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214012#p5214012\">125</a> and 126 are remarkable as well. It's where he calls on sthar not to be a cunt. For starters, I don't think sthar was being a cunt. Second, I generally don't like people briging up policy lynches, but definitely not in this game. I've only reached page 7 and I see enormous content. Why then bring up policy lynches? It seems fabricated to do so. </div></blockquote>\n\nHe admitted that himself. And when did I say I liked policy lynch? I hate it. What I meant is, some people (<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">excluding</div> me) may encourage policy lynch. <br>\nI personally dislike it because I've had some experiences where I was town and someone made a policy lynch on me.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> he blindly takes over the idea that it is important to wait for MPaperscraps reply. Even though sthar8 knew the reasons why it was important to do so, he didn't. There's no way he could know in my eyes. Hence this looks like the blatant sheeping of obvtown sthar8. <br>\nI found the reaction to sthar's expos&#233; in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216969#p5216969\">150</a> unnaturally aloof. sthar's 148 deserved more than that. Looks like scum trying to play down what is happening. </div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, experience. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> And his reply to Elyse's catch-up post is also quite bad, as he mainly addresses things pertaining to himself in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219866#p5219866\">167</a>, which I find scummy to begin with. I know what argument is going to come up next, but in that post I see a notreallygood who is so caught up with how he is being percieved that he not only selects the pieces that are about him, he for some reason feels it necessary to add some inconsequential defence of Feel It's post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a>. Why single out that post by someone else to valiantly defend it? Just feels wrong. </div></blockquote>\n\nIt was my duty. I could sense that Feel It had done nothing wrong, but Elyse kept commenting how his reads were half-assed and scummy. I couldn't let someone I trusted got insulted. I had to defend him, no matter how 'wrong' people might feel. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't. </div></blockquote>\n\nWhy...why? Why do you both (Elyse and you) think that Kcda is town while Feel It is scummy? I think Feel It at least has got more solid reads than Kcda.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Got the most notes on him.

TSO implies the question is of no value, but imo a question on page two asking a player to explain their actions has the value of creating discussion. so that's two players on the same page that TSO seems to be trying to make look bad.<br>\n<br>\ni'm going to try and not tunnel on TSO here, but i know there are a couple more things coming up which grabbed me momentarily.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>brillo wrote:</cite>As far as I see there were two people who didn't want to take the questions seriously and picked one over the other.

A lot of people voting someone who just voted them, would refer to the notion of \"OMGUS\", just to be ahead of the inevitable comments that will follow. Yet, Titus did not bother doing that. It shows to me Titus isn't bothered about how he's being percieved. He's mainly focused on his case and on the reasons for his vote, which in my view are also justified. I also liked the comment on how TSO and sthar were being town vs town. Firstly because I feel the same way, and secondly because it's not a comment I see scum make easily. Scum would be more inclined to join one of the parties in that fight, hoping one of them gets lynched, or just stand back and watch them both devour each other. Titus stepped in and tried to (albeit modestly) defuse the situation. <br>\nTitus' suspicions (paranoia?) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227294#p5227294\">242</a> also feels very genuine and townish.

That post almost summed up word for word what I had on other people myself at that point. This results in a strong townread on Elyse from my part. The only strange thing I found about that post was the vote on notreallygood, whereas I expected that vote to come on beastcharizard.<br>\n<br>\nReading further, I only have written down the numbers of posts of Elyse and put a symbol of my appreciation next to them. They were all positive. I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5220784#p5220784\">183</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221846#p5221846\">189</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222354#p5222354\">207</a> and post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5231594#p5231594\">289</a>.<br>\nWe do have one major disagreement though, and that is pertaining to her post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236035#p5236035\">339</a>. I see where she's coming from, as there was something that screamed town when first glancing at Don Johnson's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236003#p5236003\">338</a>, but I don't feel it warrants such a strong townread at all. More on Don Johnson later. <br>\nThe main reason why Elyse has been scrutinzed are her townreads on people who didn't post much. As you'll find I agree on most of those townreads. I think the push on her was bad, and yes, scummy. MAybe Elyse did try to overexplain it (partially because of having been forced to) while much of the townreads were probably also gut, but the reasons for her townreading those people were always clear and not as mysterious as her attackers made it out to be. More on that later.<br>\n<br>\nElyse is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kcdaspot</div><br>\n<br>\nI liked his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206158#p5206158\">53</a>, it was an odd follow-up of events in my eyes as well. It's a pity his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5201061#p5201061\">6</a>3 tries to pass off everything before that as one big joke. Looks very clumsy. The bits about his \"suspicious winking\" seem to come out of nowhere, possibly revealing some over-worrying about he and his smilies could be percieved. I have no idea what his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210356#p5210356\">84</a> actually means and refers to, and as far as I can tell he never expanded on it. Nevertheless that post felt townie to me. Also his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219910#p5219910\">168</a> felt very townish to me, particularly the part where he welcomes sthar to the game. It shows some confidence towards the greatest contributor to the game that makes me feel he's town. He's a townread of mine, but it's all gut.<br>\n<br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226576#p5226576\">232</a> struck me as very weird. It could be a coincidence, but the fact that he seemed to be able to be summoned by sthar felt as if he's watching and lurking and only posting when someone calls his name. A Candyman of sorts. But as far as I can see, this only happened once, so what I see in Kcda is someone trying a game of mafia, not really liking it, flaking, and when being here mostly taking the piss. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5229796#p5229796\">274</a> is a prime example of him taking none of this seriously. He's not trying. <br>\nI still have him as a townread though. It's hard to define, but I think as scum he would take the piss in a different way, by defying people on the wrong track and stuff like that. Here he's just \"playing along with town\" by providing ridicculous reads, but it still feels like it comes from a town standpoint.<br>\nI do hope he will change his attitude at some point.<br>\n<br>\nKcda is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sthar8</div><br>\n(questions already addressed have not been bolded)<br>\n<br>\nEvery game needs his obvtown and he's the one who gets the part, is what I said earlier, but this is no longer true, though I still consider him town. In the beginning I found his strong support for the RQS bizarre, as well as the, at that point, unexplained vote on Kcda. By page 4 he claimed to be on to something. I'm currently reading some Agatha Cristie's, and it reminded me a lot of the Hercule Poirot character. Smugly sitting in a chair, appearing to have it all worked out, and delivering at the end of the book while showing he was truly onto something all along. Shtar's breakthroughs are not as legendary as Hercule Poirot's (not yet, at least), but they already come quite close. I loved his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216768#p5216768\">148</a>. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> was equally impressive. I do have two questions noted down here:<br>\n*Why, in the scheme of things, was it important for sthar to wait for Paperscraps in particular? I never saw and still don't see the significance of Paperscraps in this scheme. In post 111 Paperscraps is brought up as a related note, and shortly after he becomes the one unmet condition in order for sthar to divulge his plans. An oddity I'd like cleared up. Hercule Poirot never leaves any loose ends in his logic, so I expect the same of sthar. <br>\n* This question is a bit less relevant now since sthar himself admitted to that part of the argument against TSO being the weakest, but I found the way he called out TSO for coaching beastcharizard not up to par with the rest of his material. First of all, it is an associative tell that we can only use once either of them flips. Second, I don't think the point he makes in 170 is very convincing when it comes to town TSO not asking beastcharizard to make a case against don_johnson. I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. <br>\nI'll get to TSO later, but my notes on him don't really agree with the viewpoints presented by sthar8 on TSO in post 161. Given TSO seems to be the main lynch-candidate for today, I imagine some debate. <br>\nAs evident from my earlier comments on Kcda, I also don't agree with sthar's views on that guy. I find it a bit of an anti-climax to see his elaborate plan result in a vote on someone who looks to me as a harmless lurker. But like I said, that's just my gut talking.<br>\n<br>\nFurther notes on sthar confirm my townread on him. However, again some disagreements:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5224370#p5224370\">213</a> you refer to a case on Kcda that is much stronger than the other cases you have, but when referring back to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> I feel this is untrue. What did you feel was so strong about that case? All I really see in that case, I'm sorry to say, is OMGUS, as it pertains his vote on you, and him trying to convince Don to also vote you. Just add a bit of lurking to that and you have a case, true enough, but I don't feel it's a strong case, and defintely not stronger than what you had on the others.</div><br>\nI liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226451#p5226451\">231</a> and also <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227416#p5227416\">250</a> (although that stuff about \"getting a baseline\" is going way over my head). Also liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5235552#p5235552\">331</a>. <br>\nI did not like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5238741#p5238741\">357</a>. Feels like too strong of a push on someone he's been calling a teenager, and I fear his judgement may be a bit clouded. This push made him lose his obvtown-position in my eyes, as it could be scum getting impatient after all the effort he put into getting a mislynch. But that's just a hypothesis at the very back of my mind, as I still think sthar is town. But the push rubs me the wrong way, because only earlier sthar agreed to his interactions with him only amounting to a read on what kind of person TSO could be, but less on what his alignment is. I also don't like that last sentence, as that comes down to a policy lynch.<br>\nI think sthar should push more on beastcharizard again. I get the feeling sthar8 is feeling a bit guilty/bad for the way he played beastcharizard, and is now giving him too much slack as a result. <br>\n<br>\nsthar8 is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Feel it</div><br>\n<br>\nHaven't written much about him. I noted that I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a> and his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214230#p5214230\">129</a>, the last one for sheeping the people I consider town. Doesn't stand out, but overall a good townfeel on him.<br>\n<br>\nAlso on my further read-through I didn't write down a lot about Feel It. I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5220749#p5220749\">182</a>, which I thought were decent reads. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Could you further explain the strong townread you had on notreallygood you had there though?

It's true that he's very, euhm, post- and word-efficient in his contributions, but they always do feel like contributions, however short they are. Every post of his shows he's been attentively reading the game, and what he says is usually pertinent, and if not pertinent, at least genuine and natural. I don't understand his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222189#p5222189\">201</a> (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you explain that please, I don't think you did?</div>), and I didn't like what he said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222207#p5222207\">202</a>, but I immediately felt that was a playstyle-thing, and not alignment indicative.<br>\nI really liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227354#p5227354\">245</a>.<br>\n<br>\nrunnerman is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Paperscraps</div><br>\n<br>\nDidn't like how he started with that joke about everyone self-voting and him hammering. It made him come off as a newbie which he is clearly not. It also made him come off as careless, and people coming off as careless usually rub me the wrong way because that means they're actively trying to come across as such. I did like how he mirrored sthar8 at some point (didn't write down which post that was, but it was that vote where he mimicks sthar's vote on Kcda and votes on sthar himself). Somehow it felt like the move of a confident townsperson to treat sthar in such a way. By then sthar wasn't the presence that he is now, but I thought sthar's first few posts already hinted at him being a player not to trifle with too much. Yet Paperscraps did just that. Felt bold.<br>\nI also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216049#p5216049\">139</a>, the \"long awaited response\", in which he correctly wonders why this response was so crucial.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216082#p5216082\">141</a>'s second question I found especially pertinent. <br>\nHis reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219918#p5219918\">169</a> I find less convincing.

His vote was on TSO, but he moves his vote away from him and onto Titus, while still saying in that same post that TSO is still in his scumteam. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you explain this move?

Despite the lack of pushing on people, I felt sincere engagement through it all.<br>\n<br>\nSmudger is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TSO</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm going to start off by saying I had read the last post before entering this topic, and saw suspicions were raised against him (someone calling him out on his reads being poor). I regretted having read that, as I imagined this would bias me in a stance against TSO, but I have to say my impression of his first posts was very positive. I particularly liked how he defied beastcharizard by not answering his questions. And I also liked his vote on Don Johnson because he self-voted. I think I would have done something similar. I also thought his questions to brjl (Elyse's slot) were very pertinent at the time. (I apologize for not adding post numbers, I didn't write them down, but it's on the first few pages of the topic). My first question mark was raised when he townread Feel It in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206249#p5206249\">54</a>, which felt very out of the blue at the time, as well as his scumread on Kcda just after it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It's been a while, but could you elaborate on those reads?</div> Like Elyse (again :p) I had a complete opposite reaction: I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't). Though I do not agree with his critisisms on sthar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5215371#p5215371\">134</a> and those coming just after it, they do feel authentic and not forced. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\">142</a>, which I found to be a just criticism toward beastcharizard. <br>\n<br>\nReading further I took very few notes on him, also because I got kind of disinterest in the back-and-forth with sthar8. I thought his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222339#p5222339\">205</a> was a very townish response. <br>\nI put question marks next to two post numbers: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236346#p5236346\">343</a> (which somehow felt as coming off very strong at the time, combined with very little (no), argumentation) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you explain why you said what you said in that post?And why you didn't vote him at the time?</div> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5237070#p5237070\">348</a> (which felt petty). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5238820#p5238820\">360</a> are very weak reads indeed.<br>\n<br>\nWhen starting this list I felt TSO would also still be in my townpile, but I can't say he is. I don't have as much of a case against him like I feel I do on notreallygood, beastcharizard and don johnson though, but he could be scum. But I don't feel sthar's arguments for him really being scum (hence why I didn't really like the push), so I'd like to wait a bit more when it comes to TSO before making a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nComing up: my thoughts on my three suspects. I don't think I'll be able to do them today though, but we'll see.<br>\n<br>\nAfter that I'll respond to the most recent events.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nElyse (replacing brjl)<br>\n<br>\nI didn't like brjl at all.

A lot of people voting someone who just voted them, would refer to the notion of \"OMGUS\", just to be ahead of the inevitable comments that will follow. Yet, Titus did not bother doing that. It shows to me Titus isn't bothered about how he's being percieved. He's mainly focused on his case and on the reasons for his vote, which in my view are also justified. I also liked the comment on how TSO and sthar were being town vs town. Firstly because I feel the same way, and secondly because it's not a comment I see scum make easily. Scum would be more inclined to join one of the parties in that fight, hoping one of them gets lynched, or just stand back and watch them both devour each other. Titus stepped in and tried to (albeit modestly) defuse the situation. <br>\nTitus' suspicions (paranoia?) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227294#p5227294\">242</a> also feels very genuine and townish.

I see where she's coming from, as there was something that screamed town when first glancing at Don Johnson's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236003#p5236003\">338</a>, but I don't feel it warrants such a strong townread at all. More on Don Johnson later. <br>\nThe main reason why Elyse has been scrutinzed are her townreads on people who didn't post much. As you'll find I agree on most of those townreads. I think the push on her was bad, and yes, scummy. MAybe Elyse did try to overexplain it (partially because of having been forced to) while much of the townreads were probably also gut, but the reasons for her townreading those people were always clear and not as mysterious as her attackers made it out to be. More on that later.<br>\n<br>\nElyse is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kcdaspot</div><br>\n<br>\nI liked his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206158#p5206158\">53</a>, it was an odd follow-up of events in my eyes as well. It's a pity his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5201061#p5201061\">6</a>3 tries to pass off everything before that as one big joke. Looks very clumsy. The bits about his \"suspicious winking\" seem to come out of nowhere, possibly revealing some over-worrying about he and his smilies could be percieved. I have no idea what his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210356#p5210356\">84</a> actually means and refers to, and as far as I can tell he never expanded on it. Nevertheless that post felt townie to me. Also his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219910#p5219910\">168</a> felt very townish to me, particularly the part where he welcomes sthar to the game. It shows some confidence towards the greatest contributor to the game that makes me feel he's town. He's a townread of mine, but it's all gut.<br>\n<br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226576#p5226576\">232</a> struck me as very weird. It could be a coincidence, but the fact that he seemed to be able to be summoned by sthar felt as if he's watching and lurking and only posting when someone calls his name. A Candyman of sorts. But as far as I can see, this only happened once, so what I see in Kcda is someone trying a game of mafia, not really liking it, flaking, and when being here mostly taking the piss. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5229796#p5229796\">274</a> is a prime example of him taking none of this seriously. He's not trying. <br>\nI still have him as a townread though. It's hard to define, but I think as scum he would take the piss in a different way, by defying people on the wrong track and stuff like that. Here he's just \"playing along with town\" by providing ridicculous reads, but it still feels like it comes from a town standpoint.<br>\nI do hope he will change his attitude at some point.<br>\n<br>\nKcda is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sthar8</div><br>\n(questions already addressed have not been bolded)<br>\n<br>\nEvery game needs his obvtown and he's the one who gets the part, is what I said earlier, but this is no longer true, though I still consider him town. In the beginning I found his strong support for the RQS bizarre, as well as the, at that point, unexplained vote on Kcda. By page 4 he claimed to be on to something. I'm currently reading some Agatha Cristie's, and it reminded me a lot of the Hercule Poirot character. Smugly sitting in a chair, appearing to have it all worked out, and delivering at the end of the book while showing he was truly onto something all along. Shtar's breakthroughs are not as legendary as Hercule Poirot's (not yet, at least), but they already come quite close. I loved his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216768#p5216768\">148</a>. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> was equally impressive. I do have two questions noted down here:<br>\n*Why, in the scheme of things, was it important for sthar to wait for Paperscraps in particular? I never saw and still don't see the significance of Paperscraps in this scheme. In post 111 Paperscraps is brought up as a related note, and shortly after he becomes the one unmet condition in order for sthar to divulge his plans. An oddity I'd like cleared up. Hercule Poirot never leaves any loose ends in his logic, so I expect the same of sthar. <br>\n* This question is a bit less relevant now since sthar himself admitted to that part of the argument against TSO being the weakest, but I found the way he called out TSO for coaching beastcharizard not up to par with the rest of his material. First of all, it is an associative tell that we can only use once either of them flips. Second, I don't think the point he makes in 170 is very convincing when it comes to town TSO not asking beastcharizard to make a case against don_johnson. I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. <br>\nI'll get to TSO later, but my notes on him don't really agree with the viewpoints presented by sthar8 on TSO in post 161. Given TSO seems to be the main lynch-candidate for today, I imagine some debate. <br>\nAs evident from my earlier comments on Kcda, I also don't agree with sthar's views on that guy. I find it a bit of an anti-climax to see his elaborate plan result in a vote on someone who looks to me as a harmless lurker. But like I said, that's just my gut talking.<br>\n<br>\nFurther notes on sthar confirm my townread on him. However, again some disagreements:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5224370#p5224370\">213</a> you refer to a case on Kcda that is much stronger than the other cases you have, but when referring back to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> I feel this is untrue. What did you feel was so strong about that case? All I really see in that case, I'm sorry to say, is OMGUS, as it pertains his vote on you, and him trying to convince Don to also vote you. Just add a bit of lurking to that and you have a case, true enough, but I don't feel it's a strong case, and defintely not stronger than what you had on the others.</div><br>\nI liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226451#p5226451\">231</a> and also <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227416#p5227416\">250</a> (although that stuff about \"getting a baseline\" is going way over my head). Also liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5235552#p5235552\">331</a>. <br>\nI did not like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5238741#p5238741\">357</a>. Feels like too strong of a push on someone he's been calling a teenager, and I fear his judgement may be a bit clouded. This push made him lose his obvtown-position in my eyes, as it could be scum getting impatient after all the effort he put into getting a mislynch. But that's just a hypothesis at the very back of my mind, as I still think sthar is town. But the push rubs me the wrong way, because only earlier sthar agreed to his interactions with him only amounting to a read on what kind of person TSO could be, but less on what his alignment is. I also don't like that last sentence, as that comes down to a policy lynch.<br>\nI think sthar should push more on beastcharizard again. I get the feeling sthar8 is feeling a bit guilty/bad for the way he played beastcharizard, and is now giving him too much slack as a result. <br>\n<br>\nsthar8 is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Feel it</div><br>\n<br>\nHaven't written much about him. I noted that I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a> and his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214230#p5214230\">129</a>, the last one for sheeping the people I consider town. Doesn't stand out, but overall a good townfeel on him.<br>\n<br>\nAlso on my further read-through I didn't write down a lot about Feel It. I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5220749#p5220749\">182</a>, which I thought were decent reads. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Could you further explain the strong townread you had on notreallygood you had there though?

It's true that he's very, euhm, post- and word-efficient in his contributions, but they always do feel like contributions, however short they are. Every post of his shows he's been attentively reading the game, and what he says is usually pertinent, and if not pertinent, at least genuine and natural. I don't understand his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222189#p5222189\">201</a> (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you explain that please, I don't think you did?</div>), and I didn't like what he said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222207#p5222207\">202</a>, but I immediately felt that was a playstyle-thing, and not alignment indicative.<br>\nI really liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227354#p5227354\">245</a>.<br>\n<br>\nrunnerman is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Paperscraps</div><br>\n<br>\nDidn't like how he started with that joke about everyone self-voting and him hammering. It made him come off as a newbie which he is clearly not. It also made him come off as careless, and people coming off as careless usually rub me the wrong way because that means they're actively trying to come across as such. I did like how he mirrored sthar8 at some point (didn't write down which post that was, but it was that vote where he mimicks sthar's vote on Kcda and votes on sthar himself). Somehow it felt like the move of a confident townsperson to treat sthar in such a way. By then sthar wasn't the presence that he is now, but I thought sthar's first few posts already hinted at him being a player not to trifle with too much. Yet Paperscraps did just that. Felt bold.<br>\nI also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216049#p5216049\">139</a>, the \"long awaited response\", in which he correctly wonders why this response was so crucial.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216082#p5216082\">141</a>'s second question I found especially pertinent. <br>\nHis reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219918#p5219918\">169</a> I find less convincing.

His vote was on TSO, but he moves his vote away from him and onto Titus, while still saying in that same post that TSO is still in his scumteam. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you explain this move? Your argumentation for 1. dropping pressure from TSO and 2. increasing pressure on Titus is not clear here.</div>.<br>\nI like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5232018#p5232018\">293</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5235592#p5235592\">333</a>. I like the style of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5200494#p5200494\">332</a>, but again, as with his previous reads, I disagree with big protions of the content.

My notes on him almost only contain post numbers and the V-symbol next to them, indicating I like them.

Despite the lack of pushing on people, I felt sincere engagement through it all.<br>\n<br>\nSmudger is in my townpile.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TSO</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm going to start off by saying I had read the last post before entering this topic, and saw suspicions were raised against him (someone calling him out on his reads being poor). I regretted having read that, as I imagined this would bias me in a stance against TSO, but I have to say my impression of his first posts was very positive. I particularly liked how he defied beastcharizard by not answering his questions. And I also liked his vote on Don Johnson because he self-voted. I think I would have done something similar. I also thought his questions to brjl (Elyse's slot) were very pertinent at the time. (I apologize for not adding post numbers, I didn't write them down, but it's on the first few pages of the topic). My first question mark was raised when he townread Feel It in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206249#p5206249\">54</a>, which felt very out of the blue at the time, as well as his scumread on Kcda just after it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It's been a while, but could you elaborate on those reads?</div> Like Elyse (again :p) I had a complete opposite reaction: I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't). Though I do not agree with his critisisms on sthar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5215371#p5215371\">134</a> and those coming just after it, they do feel authentic and not forced. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\">142</a>, which I found to be a just criticism toward beastcharizard. <br>\n<br>\nReading further I took very few notes on him, also because I got kind of disinterest in the back-and-forth with sthar8. I thought his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222339#p5222339\">205</a> was a very townish response. <br>\nI put question marks next to two post numbers: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236346#p5236346\">343</a> (which somehow felt as coming off very strong at the time, combined with very little (no), argumentation) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Can you explain why you said what you said in that post?And why you didn't vote him at the time?</div> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5237070#p5237070\">348</a> (which felt petty). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5238820#p5238820\">360</a> are very weak reads indeed.<br>\n<br>\nWhen starting this list I felt TSO would also still be in my townpile, but I can't say he is. I don't have as much of a case against him like I feel I do on notreallygood, beastcharizard and don johnson though, but he could be scum. But I don't feel sthar's arguments for him really being scum (hence why I didn't really like the push), so I'd like to wait a bit more when it comes to TSO before making a conclusion.<br>\n<br>\nComing up: my thoughts on my three suspects.

Already rubbed me the wrong me starting from his very first post, where he showed clear intent to become some sort of townleader. I was wondering whether he was over-enthousiastic town or self-overestimating scum, and I'm pretty much settled on the latter. He's obviously very smart and sensible, but that's exactly what's giving him away. His posts all feel so terribly calculated. He knows just what to say, he has rational explanations for everything, but it just doesn't feel real. <br>\nTake his RVS for instance. Already in his first post he tries to vote, and in his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5202831#p5202831\">18</a> he RVS'es, but at the same time feels the need to throughly explain that RVS. The \"R\" in \"RVS\" stands for RANDOM, yet already here he wants to come off as this rational, level-headed townleader who thinks everything through. His idea for an RQS seems like a way for him to get towncred, plain and simple. The added value of his questions are, however entertaining, quite limited. I wouldn't have had so much problems with it, if it hadnt been for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5205995#p5205995\">46</a> where he tries to take credit for getting people to talk. This would have happened without him as well. This still leaves open the possibility of a self-centered townie, but I thinkthere's more at play. <br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209195#p5209195\">65</a> sounds unnaturally perfect. He tries to portray how reasonable he is by showing a willingness to change his vote if sthar changes his ways. Also his call for seriousness sounds incredibly forced. It's all part of building up a fa&#231;ade of level-headedness. <br>\nIn post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209388#p5209388\">68</a> he insists on Titus answering his questions, yet only a post later^(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209438#p5209438\">71</a>), he claims those questions are not crucial and just for background. He agrees they are not of importance in the big scumhunting picture, but then why insist on TSO answering his questions? Towncred. That's all it is. Beastcharizard is not scumhunting. He's towncredhunting. <br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211258#p5211258\">94</a> is also bad.

There's also a soft attack on Don Johnson here. I wonder if there was a follow upo on that but Ih aven't seen it uptil now. So far it looks like a textbook soft-bus. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">After reading through the rest of the topic I see there's been no follow-up whatsoever on this soft attack, strengthening my view that beastchrizard and don johnson are both scum.</div><br>\nIn post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212211#p5212211\">107</a> he answers to one of sthar's questions by saying he thinks sthar's vote on him (which is really an FOS at that point) is an RVS. How could he possible believe that after all this time? That answer is just a way to avoid publicized introspection. There's no way sthar's stance towards beastcharziard was random in any way at that point, yet beastcharizard claimed to believe just that. I think this is a blatant lie. <br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213187#p5213187\">115</a> I also don't like. His answer to \"Who are you 3 top scumreads\" is not adequate, as it just mentions two people. Also his statement \"One thing you cannot say is that I don't share information\" is wrong and again fits in with his towncred-hunt. What information has he given? He just answered questions he felt safe in answering dsue to his estimation that he can fool anyone with rational thought and logic, but he forgets to consider that it all feels so wrong.<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213801#p5213801\">119</a> is terrible. Calling sthar's play horrible and scummy came out of nowhere and is completely uncalled for. It just shows defiance, but no content. Scummy as hell. <br>\n<br>\nAnd in general I also feel he's asking questions, but only the obvious ones. Town will make sompe logical fallacies. If someone says \"All apples are green\", beastcharizard will be the one pointing out that some apples are red. True as that may be, he seems to focus on logic too much, trying to spot harmless mistakes in others and portray himself as an untouchable knight in shining armor. I think and I feel and I believe and I'm this close to knowing that this guy is scum. <br>\n<br>\nFurther noting about the above is that you can see in which instances his logic fails him: when attacking people. His strong attack on sthar has no logical basis. He tries to explain it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5225106#p5225106\">218</a>:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@ Sthar8: Everything since the start of the game has been scummy to me. Your tactic makes little sense as well. I understand want to gauge my reaction but don't understand how you picked me out of everyone else. I am assuming it is because I was the most active or the one who asked the question. Secondly you waited till forever to tell us your \"plan\", which i am not totally convinced that is what you were doing. I didn't think I would ever unvote you but now you are just a null read because i truely believe Elyse is scum and is buddying her partners by giving them town reads.<br>\nI know it isn't my place but TSO is kind of mean when he plays from my experience so what he is doing is null to me. I use mean because I can't think of a better term.<br>\nFinally, why am I scummy to you?</div></blockquote>\n\nDoes any of that stuff warrant the strong wording \"horrible and scummy\"? His first point is little more than \"Why pick on me?\", and thus an OMGUS-reason. His second point, not being convinced that sthar had this plan all along, is a huge stretch. Just like how it was a stretch to think sthar's vote (FoS) on him was RVS at the time. It is simply not logical. There is no way sthar came up with that plan only after the fact. The third is also illogical, he says he's now a nullread (despite all of beastcharizard's (non-)arguments still standing, and calls sthar a nullread BECAUSE Elyse looks scum to him. He's calling someone a nullread based off a read on someone else and completely unrelated.<br>\nAnd his final point is the same as his first point. \"Why me?\" <br>\n<br>\nAlso on my further read-through he keeps trying to use his logic skills as some kind of towntell, in order to get credit. Using logic is a towntell if used consistently, but that's not what he's doing. His attacks give him away.<br>\nFurther notes I have, going to include some quotes:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5221530#p5221530\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5221530#p5221530\" data-post-id=\"5221530\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 186</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21387\">beastcharizard</a> wrote:</cite>@Elyse's super wall: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I am just a weird person.</div>  I asked Titus to answer the questions so they had a good transition into the game and they would be following suit on what most everyone else had done.  I would like to say not all of those questions were useless to me.  Sthar8 used the who did you play with one to do a Meta check.  You know, I get the: \"he is trying to act pro-town\" thing every single game I play.  I am not sure if people think I am always scum or if it is scum trying to get my lynched.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It never crosses people's mind that I might actually be town doing pro-town things.</div>  My comments on Sthar's play didn't come out of nowhere.  He asked in a previous post for people to give their opinion on it so I did.  Now what had changed was they were not posting any better so i decided that they were the greatest threat to the town and that probably was not going to change no matter what they did.  Finally, I think all my posts are going to be \"awkward\", just so you know.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Titus: Your vote on Don looks like pure OMGUS because of the line: \"This vote is utter bullshit.\"</div><br>\n<br>\n@Elyse: Titus has a grand total of 7 posts but yet he is a town read.  Please explain this to me since I fail to see how you can get a read off 7 posts(was like 5 or 6 when you got your read) but not 11 posts from Don.</div></blockquote>\n\nSeveral things I found interesting in the quote above: <br>\n- \"I'm weird.\" \"My posts are going to be awkward.\": A defense trying to explain the bad gut-feeling people may have when reading his posts. But what exactly is so weird about beastcharizard, according to beastcharziard himself? He does not explain. It's just a way of trying to make us believe that any bad gutfeelings we may have is due to his weirdness, and not his scumminess. Beastcharizard is not weird. Or maybe he is, maybe he likes to hang dirty underwear on his left ear, but at least his weirdness is not percievable through his posts. Someone calling himself both a protector of logic and weird also doesn't add up. He's using self-meta, but tries different narratives in order to make a good impression. It shows clear intent, like so many other things, to get towncred. Scumhunting is not apparent in any of his posts.<br>\n- Remember how I admired Titus for not mentioning the possible OMGUS-aspect of his vote on Don_Johnson, but instead focusing on real reasons? Beastcharziard does the opposite here, and tries to make Titus look bad by ignoring the arguments raised against Don_johnson. A don_johnson, who by the way looked scummy to beastcharizard only moments before. If beastcharizard truly thought don_johnson was scummy, he would have given much more attention to the reasoning Titus clearly had when voting for him. <br>\n- The way he formulates his question to Elyse. \"Explain this to me\". It's something he does quite often. It allows a position where he doesn't have to do much scumhunting himself, but just critisize other people's doing so, but at the same time he does give off an air of being reasonable. Someone you can reason with. I think the people who have tried to do so over disagreements with him, will have found this not to be the case. <br>\n<br>\nGoing to contnue this wall later, lunchbreak coming up. Most of my contnued notes are more examples of where beastcharizard behaves in the way he does as described above though, so you get the gist of my case. It will just provide more examples.<br>\n<br>\nNot forgetting about don_johnson and notreallygood, will also post my reads on them,b ut I'm most confident in my scumread on beastcharizard.", "time": "Wed Aug 21, 2013 10:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

That explanation boiled down to don_johnson being lurky, was it not? That's a suspicion that can easily be lifted as soon as that slot gets active, which all slots do at some point because otherwise they die.<br>\nI'm glad you admit your 'scumhunting' so far has been rather deplorable. Yes, you are right, it is a 'strange' thing to base your reads on other people on the read of one person, in this case Elyse. Yet, that's the only serious scumhunting you've done in my book. Your sthar-thing was plainly OMGUS, the Elyse thing was simply you not agreeing with her townreads, and now your vote on runnerman? I don't feel you've properly added arguments to that, maybe I missed them, but as he was also scummy to you through some artificial association you see between him and Elyse, I'm not expecting much.<br>\nAnd the weird-thing, no, I still don't think you're weird.

(\"I fabricated a case against him, misrepped, misled, or did anything scummy\". The problem was what he did do: vote Titus without reasons and just after saying that he actually liked Titus. When looking for reasons he refers to my predecessor's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219305#p5219305\">158</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219323#p5219323\">159</a>, which frankly put, are not adequate in my eyes.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221958#p5221958\">192</a> is lazy, as evidenced by the last paragraph.

Again, it's a sort of \"bring it on\"-attitude, but too passive for me to be town. It's easy to tackle questions one by one, hoping to blur the total picture of you being scum. I'm not saying questions are completely useless, but impressions are more important. More difficult to defend against, I grant you that, as it forces you to either change the impression you're giving off (not easy to do so in a way that doesn't look opportunistic) or to defend your actions instead of simply answering questions.<br>\ndon_johnson's alliance talk is ludicrous. Like Smudger said, these forms of alliances occur naturally, through mutual townreads. They do not center around a person who rallies people around him. It looks like a deflection from don_johnson, one way in order to make him look active, in the other to not people have a talk about him, but about his plan. The plan itself is a null, but the way he awkwardly tried to introduce the idea inhere feels like there's been some strategic thinking before it.

Their posts are very good and are full of reasons for what they do.  They ask good questions and follow up on them as well.<br>\nGrimgroove - Town<br>\nThere is no way scum would come in and attract this much attention to themselves.  Their predessecor didn't like Titus and Grim seems to think otherwise so conflict of the two also makes me think they are town. Scum would probably keep on about Titus.<br>\nKcdaspot1 - Scum<br>\nYes I said they weren't a threat but that doesn't make them less scummy. Since they do nothing they can't hurt the village at all, also you can't see if they are buddying anyone if they don't post so waiting for this lynch is best.  They explain no votes what so ever and have done little to nothing.  They promised a post about the game which I have still yet to see. <br>\ndon_johnson - Null<br>\nThey call people for not voting when they themselves haven't voted.  After some \"catching-up\", i call it that because I don't think they read the whole game, they are posting content.  I can't decide wether they are town trying to catch up or scum making excuses.<br>\nTitus - Null/leaning town<br>\nI like the substance of their posts.  They seem to be reasonable.  I don't think they have done anything to be definitively town though.<br>\nElyse - Null<br>\nMy meta-check on them makes it seem like they are playing between town and scum.  I didn't like thier buddying of people when they did little in the game.<br>\nrunnerman2 - Scum<br>\nTheir vote on me at the beginning was clear WIFOM, saying my vote for scum buddying is dumb because scum wouldn't do that.  The rest of their posts I see no merit in. I already gave my opinion on their earlier post but they still aren't doing much.  They also are just sheeping on my wagon with horrible logic.<br>\nPaperscraps - Town<br>\nThey are not just throwing around votes.  Their joke vote mimicking sthar's bugged me but not enough to ruin their town read.  They use logic in their posts.<br>\nsthar8 - Null<br>\nI still don't like what they did at the beginning but they have done a few town things.  They bulk of their posts is dumb stuff between him and TSO.  Might be another plan to work someone up.<br>\nFeel It - Null<br>\nSome logic but also some filler posts.  I can't get a good read on them.  They stick to their Don vote for the most part though.  Constant reads are good in my opinion.<br>\nnotreallygood - Town<br>\nTheir posts are awesome.  They use logic and reason when they do things.  The follow what people say to see if they answer their questions.<br>\nT S O - Town<br>\nI know how he plays and this isn't his scum playing.  Before the whole sthar thing I felt they were actually doing good for the village.<br>\n<br>\nI tried to make it easy to read for you guys.

Already in his first post he tries to vote, and in his post 18 he RVS'es, but at the same time feels the need to throughly explain that RVS. The \"R\" in \"RVS\" stands for RANDOM, yet already here he wants to come off as this rational, level-headed townleader who thinks everything through\"<br>\nWtf is this sentence?  My reason was refer to first post which said they hammered the game. How is that not RVS?<br>\nMy questions did at least start conversation. I don't care if it was good conversation or not.

Also by using little snarks like \"you nay not be able to understand that\", he shows intent to play it dirty with Elyse, and I found that uncalled for. <br>\nThe first part, where he shows the pinch of disdain I was talking about, seems like a lesson to Elyse of how to scumhunt.

As I said before, notreallygood made no such statement in his reads list, but only mentioned a disagreement he had with don_johnson, without adding any read. This reply, he's again avoiding to give a read on don_johnson. Instead of giving or clarifying his read on don_johnson, he answers to this confusion by giving his read on sthar.

That runnerman can use it to his advantage goes without saying, but implying Elyse's townread of runnerman is part of a scheme runnerman was running is just too farfetched. notreallygood looks levelheaded enough, so I wonder what his motivations were to actively try to come up with such a farfetched idea.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5235498#p5235498\">330</a> I had marked down as a negative in my notes, but reading it again it's double.

Do you realize my reads are NOT exactly the same as Elyse's? Reads Feel It and Don Johnson most notably, for instance. What do you make of these differences?<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Feel It was a weak scum read for Elyse and Don was just null for her.  I am not saying you copied word for word or even the entire thing.  There are just similarities that I find to much to be a coincidence.  Also, yes I understand people can think the same and have the same feelings but not normally this much on Day 1.</div><br>\n3. If you read my walls, you can clearly see the way my opinions have been formed. In a case of me simply mirroring someone else's reads, how likely do you think it is that I would be able to do that?<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You could easily decide what you want your reads to be before reading and then go through people's posts and pick out only the things that make them look good or make them look bad.  You then simply use these things as your \"logic\" for having them as said read.</div><br>\n<br>\nI think that despite your fa&#231;ade of rationality, which you hold up really well when it comes to general observations and your defense, your cases almost always contain some form of a \"stretch\". It's your flimsy cases against people that really give you away, because they're such a breakaway from the rest of your behavior. And I know why that is. As scum you need to get mislynches. The way you try to do that is by gaining credibility through objective logic, and hope that will automatically spill over on your cases. But it does not. Your cases feel constructed and don't seem like you really believe in them.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">How don't they seem like I believe in them?  I am not flip-flopping my votes or my reads really for that matter.  I haven't taken anyone from scum to town or town to scum during this day either. I might stretch stuff somewhat but to me they are logical stretches and not hard to follow.  I will try to explain them better.</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm already going to vote you simply because of this, but there will be an incoming wall on you during the course of the day.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: beastcharizard</span></div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5245642#p5245642\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5245642#p5245642\" data-post-id=\"5245642\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 484</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21197\">Grimgroove</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5245599#p5245599\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5245599#p5245599\" data-post-id=\"5245599\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 482</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21387\">beastcharizard</a> wrote:</cite>I use they and them because I don't look at the Gender part of people's name when writing posts.

That explanation boiled down to don_johnson being lurky, was it not? That's a suspicion that can easily be lifted as soon as that slot gets active, which all slots do at some point because otherwise they die.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Had he done so at the time? No. They have barely even stepped up the activity now.  But now they are at least posting content. Also, their posts contributed nothing back then as well.</div><br>\nI'm glad you admit your 'scumhunting' so far has been rather deplorable. Yes, you are right, it is a 'strange' thing to base your reads on other people on the read of one person, in this case Elyse. Yet, that's the only serious scumhunting you've done in my book. Your sthar-thing was plainly OMGUS, the Elyse thing was simply you not agreeing with her townreads, and now your vote on runnerman? I don't feel you've properly added arguments to that, maybe I missed them, but as he was also scummy to you through some artificial association you see between him and Elyse, I'm not expecting much.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You are already trying to discredit any reads I have on people.  I also said they would have been null/scum if not for Elyse in earlier posts.  I am not going to take someone from town to scum because someone I find suspicious is calling them town.  Refer to my reads for the rest and if i need to elaborate further let me know.</div><br>\nAnd the weird-thing, no, I still don't think you're weird. And I can see the difficulty where you would be acting twon as both scum and town-aligned. BUT YOU'RE NOT! You are not acting like town at all in this game! That's the whole point. You obviously think you are, but you are not. <br>\n<br>\nYou do not scumhunt. You dodge questions (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5233337#p5233337\">314</a> I wrote down as a particularly good example of you dodging a question by only half-answering stuff, and as Smudger pointed out on the previous page, you never answered his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5233448#p5233448\">318</a> either and still refuse to do so.)<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Refer to top of post. That should have answered their question.</div><br>\n<br>\nUnobvious questions, well, it's questions that show you're wondering about the alignment of a person. I don't feel that in your questions. Half of them are pertaining to reads other people have on you (and thus self-involved), the other half looks easy.<br>\n<br>\nWhy, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221530#p5221530\">186</a> did you call Titus out for that vote without getting into his argumentation of that vote? What did you think of Titus' reasons to vote don_johnson at the time?<br>\nI think I already explained this in a different post.</div></blockquote>\n\nDon_Johnson:<br>\nTheir first few posts were nothing of content.  We were in RVS for the first part of it but post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210575#p5210575\">86</a> just seems weird to me.  At this point they are starting to look sketchy.

Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5242964#p5242964\">430</a> is a good example of them contributing again.

But only scum gain advantage from it, and nullifying that advantage is protown.<br>\nYou said that my case on kcda was \"just OMGUS and lurking,\" I've pointed out that there was more to it than that and further discussion on the matter will not be protown.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Obviously. Claiming I believe it is is insulting.</div></blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Feels like too strong of a push on someone he's been calling a teenager,</div></blockquote>\nThis implies that the reason the push is too strong is because of TSO's age.  What was the intent?\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>But you said yourself in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5229441#p5229441\">267</a> that his defensiveness is due to him being in his teens.</div></blockquote>\nI also say that that makes it a null tell, and I'm confused as to why we're still discussing it, since that was the last time I mentioned it.  Yet somehow you (collective, not singular) are ignoring all of the other things I've said in order to bring it up, and I cannot fathom why.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You then later on proceed to say which arguments still hold up against him despite this finding: \"mudslinging thing, or refusing to have any reads, or even the coaching\". I never believed in the coaching-argument in the first place to be honest, but like you said, that was the weak point of your argument. Yet, if you realize it's weak, why insist on it?</div></blockquote>\n-It's good to see that you actually see my other points.  This is the first time that someone other than myself has acknowledged anything but the nulls and the coaching thing.<br>\n- You realize that I've only discussed his coaching in direct response to someone asking questions about it, right?  I don't see how I'm \"insisting.\"<br>\n- If you're asking why I don't drop the coaching thing altogether:  Because I still find it indicative, and I'm not tailoring my arguments to your personal opinion.  You're allowed to disagree with me, but that doesn't mean I have to change my side.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I grant you the other points. Don't take this as me defending TSO, as I've said myself in my overview, I too, see reasons to find him scummy.</div></blockquote>Then let's lynch him!  How do you feel about TSO doing all the things others are getting scumread for, but somehow managing to not draw any fire for it? \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nI think  the decision for today should be this: TSO or beastcharizard.At least that's my personal conviction, both people have decent cases against them I think.\n</div></blockquote> I can get behind this, obviously.  I'd prefer TSO because I think he's more able to avoid attention on later days than charizard is.  I also think there is a chance (though slim) that charizard's play is the result of him just legitimately enjoying being seen as a town leader, regardless of alignment.<br>\n<br>\nAlso TSO's last was a massive misrepresentation.", "time": "Sat Aug 24, 2013 8:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

Reading through his ISO, I don't see much of him trying to find and lynch scum. He has been under the lens for awhile now and defending himself. I don't see much offense though. His play is reactionary and he has regurgitated ideas and points from other players. A lot of his posts are filler where he seems to chime in and respond to stay active, but without doing anything to help town. Lecturing us on grammar and the intricacies of the English language doesn't make you pro-town. I am wary of people who get focused on silly things that have no bearing on finding mafia. His scum reads are pretty elementary and this struck me as inexperience at first, but under the pressure of others it could have been him trying to just get something out there to get the attention away from him.<br>\n<br>\nSo we have deflection(maybe), reactionary play(which implies no scum hunting), fixation on silly things(i.e. grammar, foul language, how2English) and general filler(to stay active and seem productive).<br>\nSingularly the above tells don't make <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NRG</div> mafia, but as a whole they give me a decent scum vibe.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: notreallygood</span>", "time": "Sun Aug 25, 2013 10:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

I tended not to get in arguments because my role could be important for the town.<br>\n<br>\nIt was until brjl got replaced that I was forced into arguing with Elyse. I had to make a decision: Do I explain my posts to her, or do I stay away from her first? Neither was good, but I decided the latter was better because I doubted she would listen even if I explained. <br>\n<br>\nThen Grim stepped in. He agreed with Elyse that I looked scummy, which forced me to make explanations regarding my posts. However, as you all can see, his analysis was so rational. How could I explain it clearly? So I could only tried to stay away again.<br>\n<br>\nSometime later, beast claimed that he was a tracker. I thought I could cooperate with him, since my role can greatly aid him, but this was also the time when people started to vote me.

I had previously been voting with Kc and ice(I think its ice). I haven't at any time \"pretended\" or \"lied\" or anything like that with regards to my activity level. so imo, its pretty obvious that I am supporting the Titus wagon based on the case that was presented by others. <br>\n<br>\nto wit: if you have specific questions elyse, feel free to ask.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>elyse wrote:</cite>Titus is a townread because:<br>\nI liked his opening post<br>\nHe urged sthar to stop gambitting and scumhunt<br>\nHe pointed out notreallygood's fencesit reads list<br>\nHis vote on don johnson is good.</div></blockquote>\n\nhis opening post is null. in your face, but null. <br>\na better way to urge sthar8 to stop gambitting would have been to vote him.  why does he think that sthar8 is town?<br>\nagain, he took no action against the \"fencesitter\". just called him out.<br>\nhis vote on me is omgus. nothing more. he accuses me of trying to justify my vote on his wagon.

I honestly don't think there is scum in that group.</div></blockquote>\n\n^^ which clearly explains part of how the alliance was chosen and clearly states that despite my own opinions, I am not taking some sort of ridiculously static stance on who may or may not be scum. at that time, beast was not a scum read. this was not based on an in depth read, but based on interactions and my skimming.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>sure. its an alliance, not the third reich. thing is, we stop focusing on our alliance mates as much as possible and really delve into who is scum in the other group. if you think someone in the alliance is scum, try and use that to your advantage while hunting their partner(s).</div></blockquote>\n\n^^ more explanation of how the strategy works and a clear indication that scum may be part of the alliance.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>no ones going for the alliance. so whatevz. I did a quick look at the player list, everyone elses suspicions, and thought those two might work. I still haven't read up. <br>\n<br>\nI really don't think beast or elyse are scum. can someone paraphrase those cases?</div></blockquote>\n\nat this point in the game I state that I don't think elyse or beast are scum. this is still not based on an in depth read of the game. if this is the post you are referring to, or if you think it is simply scummy for someones opinion to change then I guess there will be no argument here. I am guilty of thinking at some point that beast might be town. i'm not sure how that is scummy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>but whatevz.

I don't agree with their analysis, so if elyse or feelit flip scum, association duly noted. currently I don't think elyse is scum, but I get the feeling they might be if beast is actually town.<br>\n<br>\nreally? I didn't get that vibe at all. there seems to be a good bit of support for the beast scum read.<br>\n<br>\nthere can be a case made against beast or elyse based on what I have been reading. and I am taking note of associative tells as well, but bottom line is that they could both be town. I doubt they are both scum, but its possible.<br>\n<br>\nalso, i'd compromise on a beast or paperscraps lynch at this time. maybe runnerman. elyse would be a long shot.<br>\n<br>\nif beast is scum, i'm guessing notreallygood is town and beast is just trying to drag him down here. my gut townread on notreally can be dealt with later, but if beast is town, I just don't understand pointing to something like this as \"logic\".</div></blockquote>\n\n^^ this is some of what you missed.", "time": "Wed Aug 28, 2013 5:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

Why are NRG or Beast even being considered?<br>\n<br>\nYou gave us one scum read on beast awhile back and were leaning town on Titus.

A day one lynch with very little opposition should be sending some warning signals to the brain. The majority of players are on board with lynching runnerman, or willing to compromise on him. Yes, he is scummy. So is mafia bussing him today? Or he is just a weaker town player that is succumbing to all the pressure on him? I am thinking the latter now. You can believe whatever you want for me defending him here, but with everyone \"willing\" to lynch him I am thinking he is town. I have much more confidence in Feel It flipping scum than over runnerman at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nLet us visit the last few posts from Feel It:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5274502#p5274502\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5274502#p5274502\" data-post-id=\"5274502\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 777</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21837\">Feel It</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5274304#p5274304\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5274304#p5274304\" data-post-id=\"5274304\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 773</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22265\">Paperscraps</a> wrote:</cite>runnerman was just put at L-1.

This town has discussed and dragged itself through so many circles I'm honestly quite bored and confused and we really need a lynch to move this game forward. I think runnerman has a pretty good chance of flipping scum. Also your vote and scumread is mostly just butthurt I nearly got you lynched.</div></blockquote>\n\nI agree that you can talk yourself out of good lynches the more time goes one, but using this as the sole reason to vote some one is bad as town or scum. I agree that lynches provide information to help the town move forward, but again using this as the sole reason to lynch some one is bad. Feel It provides no reasons as to why he thinks runnerman will flip scum here. The last line isn't true. This reaction speaks more of Feel It being \"butthurt\".<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5274059#p5274059\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5274059#p5274059\" data-post-id=\"5274059\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 770</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21837\">Feel It</a> wrote:</cite>I'm okay with runnerman lynch, this day has dragged on way to long already<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: runnerman</span></div></blockquote>\n\nThis post is mafia trying to rush a lynch through or he is actually bored town.

In this game it would appear that the defence against an attack is to accuse the attack of being weak, this goes for highlighting others play.

And though I normally don't jump to the defence of others in this way, with runnerman being MIA, someone has to do it.<br>\n<br>\n\"playing the I am new card\" - ISO runnerman and look at his first 8 posts. Not once did he play the newbie card. He never even mentioned being a new player, he even talked about currently being and having been in other games. Is anyone actually still reading this shit? Beastcharizard is maknig things up. First I was going to respond to this argument by it being hypocritical (what with beastcharizard constantly playing the \"I'm weird\"-card), but it's even worse than that, it's a blatant misrep. Once, in his ninth or tenth post (in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227354#p5227354\">245</a>, runnerman mentions \"not being used to this kind of play\", which is not the same as \"playing the I'm new here card in his first 8 posts\". <br>\nTell me beastcharizard, what was the scummy thing he did at that point? You're saying he played this card to dismiss the scummy stuff he did, but why play that card if there is no scummy stuff to be dismissed? You did not mention this.<br>\n\"OMGUS\" - calling it OMGUS. The reasoning behind his vote on you was perfectly sound. \"sounds more like an argument that aims to convince others not so much something you actually believe\" were his words, and in fact it's the same thing I'm thinking when reading your case on him. Even if it was OMGUS, it's a null tell in most cases.<br>\nThe Titus-thing: Reads can change, again an OMGUS element, and while his comment on Titus having it in for him wasn't intellectually sound, it's not scummy. It's an emotional response that can come from any alignment. Calling it \"an accusation in order to discredit\" is tying rational tactics to something that was blatantly emotional.<br>\nT S O-thing: Didn't get that. Are you saying T S O didn't act scummy? Or did runnerman? T S O in all fairness has been a difficult read up to a late stage of the game, given his strong and sole involvement with sthar. <br>\nWanting a policy lynch: This is what half of the people on the wagon you're currently pulling are doing. A compromise lynch is a form of policy lynch. Both come with this feeling of \"meh, let's do it then\" and are usually coupled with flimsy reasons nobody really believes in. Too much doubt. Where did you get that runnerman wanted a policy lynch though? I cannot find it.<br>\nno content: I disagree. And you disagree yourself, otherwise you wouldn't be able to make a case of this extent against him.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion: The case on runnerman is a load of bull.<br>\n<br>\nI want to lynch beastcharizard so much <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">", "time": "Tue Sep 03, 2013 6:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

I am more than happy to take my chances with one of them and let the pr situation play out at night, then take a second look at this game once we have some decent perspective. second guessing everything now just seems like a waste of time. imo, I prefer shorter games(easier to keep up, easier to sift through, etc.) so I think there is plenty of info in thread already. extending the day at this point seems unneccesary. TSO is not shouting scum in my book. certainly not enough to warrant further investigation at this time. you know, I could easily say \"grim, your persistence in avoiding the wagons of runner and feel it seem like scum trying to help their buddie(s) avoid getting lynched.\" you see, the argument can be made, but it can't possibly be substantiated without the concrete evidence of a flip or two.", "time": "Wed Sep 04, 2013 5:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

I don't agree with their analysis, so if elyse or feelit flip scum, association duly noted. currently I don't think elyse is scum, but I get the feeling they might be if beast is actually town.<br>\n<br>\nreally? I didn't get that vibe at all. there seems to be a good bit of support for the beast scum read.<br>\n<br>\nthere can be a case made against beast or elyse based on what I have been reading. and I am taking note of associative tells as well, but bottom line is that they could both be town.

He consistently uses terms with little or no understanding of their definition, he gets distracted by tangential issues and semantics.  He's more concerned with winning the argument than making his point.<br>\nC.  He's smart.  When it suits him, he makes a few very good points.  Additional reading of him reveals that he is perfectly capable of scumhunting and that he recognizes fallacy when he sees it, even if he doesn't know the proper name.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI will not be arguing these with anyone, especially TSO.  If you don't agree, I don't care.  If you assert that any of these is the reason I want TSO lynched, then you're stupid.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nReasons that TSO is likely scum:<br>\n<br>\n1. He's not scumhunting.  He's following along with others' cases.<br>\n      -His vote for runner came after FeelIt, Paper, Titus, Elyse and Beast had expressed suspicion of runner.<br>\n      -His vote for NRG came after Grim, FeelIt, Paper, and Elyse had already voted for NRG<br>\n      -He voted Paper, then unvoted without a case.  Of course, only after Elyse and Don expressed suspicion of paper.<br>\n      -His attack on don came after FeelIt, Paper, Smudger, and NRG had criticized the same post.<br>\nNot once has TSO led the push against anyone. Not once has TSO presented a case against these people as scum.  He promised cases on paper and NRG, but they never materialized. TSO doesn't need to expend any effort finding scum because he is scum and he knows who his partners are.  He's just floating along while the town picks their lynch.  Despite having never presented a case, he's FOS'd almost every player in the game to keep his options open.  He's twice admitted to not actively reading the thread.<br>\n<br>\n2. He's looking for an easy lynch<br>\n     -See above.<br>\n     -Despite his failure to hunt scum, he insists that others present real cases.<br>\nNotice that all of the attacks TSO has committed himself to share something.  He won't vote someone unless multiple other players are already voting or FOSing that person.  He's not looking to lynch scum, he's looking to lynch quickly.  And since he's not presenting any cases, he can't be blamed if one of these lynches hits a townie.<br>\n<br>\n3. Active Lurking<br>\n     -<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5288419#p5288419\" class=\"postlink\">He'll comment on people's activity.</a><br>\n     -<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5273910#p5273910\" class=\"postlink\">He'll argue subjective interpretation</a><br>\n     -In his ISO you'll find him defining terms, discussing semantics, and avoiding prods among other effectively empty posts.<br>\nTSO may not be contributing anything of worth, but he's also not getting prodded.  Whenever he isn't aggressively defending himself or following along with someone else's wagon, he has an empty post or two to throw down.  He has the time to generate some content, but as scum he lacks the inclination.<br>\n<br>\n4. Manipulative language<br>\n     -In 972 he horse laughs my argument by misrepresenting my discussion with Smudger.  This ignores the actual assertion that he's using ad mis as an AtE to keep people from seriously considering my case against him.<br>\n     -In 860/861 he implies that everyone should know that he doesn't support a FeelIt lynch, despite his previous two mentions of FeelIt's alignment being that he \"didn't like the jump on the charizard wagon\"  and that he was \"possible scum\"<br>\n     -In 846 he misrepresents Grim's attack on him, asserting that since he \"proved\"  that FeelIt's vote was scummier (subjective anyway), Grim was wrong about TSO being scum.  What Grim actually said was that TSO's vote on runner was scummy, and that it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">might</div> be the scummiest.<br>\n     -In 795 he frames my refusal to argue with him as bait for another argument.<br>\n     - In 793 he asserts that he's called runner scummy the whole game.  But his only mentions of runner before his vote are a criticism of a post and TSO's classification of runner's alignment as \"eh,\"  which as far as I can tell isn't a word for \"scum.\"  Runner hasn't ever been in TSO's suspect list.<br>\n     -In 452 he claims that I'm trying to start an argument with him, three pages after I ignored his question designed to provoke an argument about something irrelevant.<br>\n     -I'm sure you can find more, this is a pervasive pattern.<br>\nTSO is using word choice to characterize himself as a victim on defense, and to change the facts to fit his ideal circumstances.  He keeps asserting things that have no basis in reality and just assuming that nobody is fact checking him.  The single most frustrating thing about this game so far is that most everyone appears to be taking what he says at face value. Town has no need to warp facts, TSO is simply concerned with how he's being perceived.  This is a major scumtell.<br>\n<br>\nI'm very tired after a long day and I'm putting this post up without proofreading as thoroughly as I normally do.  If anything is incomprehensible, please point it out and I'll correct it.<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone (other than TSO) has questions, I'd be happy to answer them.<br>\n<br>\nWhat do you say guys?  How about we lynch TSO instead?", "time": "Thu Sep 05, 2013 9:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

TSO is THE weakest player among us. when I called bowser on this case, they threw their hands up in the air with a giant AtE. then complained that everyone was sheeping me. ME? no one has sheeped me all day. no one has been even listening to anything I've been saying. what this tells me is that bowser did not read as closely as they made it appear to. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the original wagons was on bowser's scumbuddy, but I am more confident in the bowser vote atm and really have no time to investigate which wagon it may have been with deadline just a few hours away. Kc was a gut town read of mine early on but it was seriously flimsy, and they never turned on. bowser comes in, drops a vote on the weakest player when the wagon is gaining steam, does this in a paltry catch up post which gives the appearance that they read closely, then complains about people sheeping dj. come on man. stop dicking around. sthar's case on TSO is a policy lynch when you really read it. TSO never makes his own case? so what? he never had to. not all townies contribute the way we want them to. that doesn't make them scum. I admit I could be wrong, but bowser is setting off all the scum bells. TSO is way more inconclusive imo.", "time": "Mon Sep 09, 2013 3:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

Obviously they'd pick on the guys trying to find them out. With two members missing, the ten convened members split into two groups to find out what was up.<br>\n<br>\nThe job did not take long.

First off that reply was off the cuff and rather flippant, for which I apologise.  The reason you appeared in the listing was actually a typo from me, and I was in a foul mood when I replied to Feel It.  You have a claim on the table that is only proved by the fact that Don is dead, so? that proves you had a kill action, or do you still have one?  for now I will go with the flow.. <br>\n<br>\n(am I allowed to do that? go with the flow? or is that too cautious and flexible?

If you want me to base a vote on that, then my question to you would be why? <br>\n<br>\n  If it is to gather information to actually narrow down the lynch pool, effectively the possibility of a mis-lynch then no, not at this time. In particular when I am beginning to think that both Bowser or Huntress are possibly more qualified to give us a better result if one of them is lynched.  Why those two? well both are replacements into slots that I was suspicious of and neither has done anything to change that POV, although Huntress is actually more active.", "time": "Wed Sep 18, 2013 10:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

I don't care what questions you have for me. You are grasping on my lynch.. Beast is most likely mafia and suggesting he isn't means you aren't reading the game or you are mafia, in my eyes. Titus' claim lines up with there being two deaths and no counter-claims to vigi. There probably being a gunsmith is too much to not think Titus is town at this point. Beast's track makes zero sense. It is almost as if his \"tracking\" IS KILLING PEOPLE.<br>\n<br>\nMafia are always one meta-level deeper than town, but Grim goes hard on Beast. Grim dies. Draw whatever conclusion you want.<br>\n<br>\nElyse hasn't really done anything at this game. Her votes have no convinction or backing behind them. I will lynch any of you(Beast-Elyse-Huntress), but Bowser is basically saying he isn't going to be playing at all anymore. That isn't cool at all. His slot before he came in was scummy. He is a great lynch. It is both policy and a read.

I think the confirmed towns are smart enough to see the plan through to it's conclusion.  Plus when I flip, my unwavering confidence in my plan coupled with a final warning that the scum will attempt to convince them to deviate will become a gospel truth instead of the sound advice that it is right now.<br>\n<br>\nHonestly, I think we've all been phoning it in a little for the last two day phases.  The game is effectively won, and there's no point to putting in the extra work for analysis that can only confirm what we already know.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I've been thinking, and I need to revise that list.  Titus and Feelit need to swap spots.  The kill on NRG was more instructive than I originally credited.  Accounting for that, if there's scum outside the lynch pool (which I do not believe)  there is a 95% chance it's sk-Titus.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, that's likely moot because your post basically confirms that you are the last scum.  As bad as paper's post was (seriously?  adding Titus back into the lynch pool?) you just committed to the two best scum tactics remaining, in the same post.  You probably should have picked one over the other and waited until tomorrow to try to open up the lynch pool, but I don't think even that would have saved you.  I can't fault you for trying, and you're certainly a good player.  You just got trapped in a borderline unwinnable situation with a team that wasn't on your level.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5353284#p5353284\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5353284#p5353284\" data-post-id=\"5353284\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1360</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21512\">Titus</a> wrote:</cite>By the way, it's probably time to say I'm not a joat at all.

Given the silly amount of success you have had, I would have claimed that I'd used the heal on the wrong investigator and that I'd be using my own one-shot investigation tonight to guarantee caught scum tomorrow.  I mean, we win anyway, but why not play for all the beans?<br>\n<br>\nMy last question to you was intended to suggest that course of action.<br>\n<br>\n@beast-  We're at a point now where it's ok to discuss your day 1 play.  I think your main problem came in two areas:<br>\n1.  You were attempting to be a town leader.  This is not something you should be doing with an investigative role.  It will either put you into the spotlight and force your claim, or you will look like an attractive nightkill, neither of which you want.  You spent a lot of time trying to make others see you as town, which again attracts attention.  The ideal investigative role will scumhunt just hard enough to stay off the radar, then present a shitload of confirmed info all at once.  If you do that, then it doesn't matter how everyone else thinks of you because what you tell them is testable.<br>\n2.  You mistook \"weird\" for \"scummy\" day 1, which is excusable from anybody EXCEPT an investigative role.  As a cop-like, your scum reads should be on legitimately scummy players and your town reads on the towniest.  Remember that your role has a mechanism for testing weird, unexplained, and null players.  If they're hard to read, they make good investigations which makes them a waste of your time during the day phase.  <br>\n<br>\nBasically, your normal playstyle didn't work well with the goals of your role.  Rather than alter your play to fit your goals, you tried to do both at once which came off as forced and artificial to those of us who were legitimately scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nThe random question thing was a nice touch.  Its a really obvious coptell, but only in hindsight which is the best kind of coptell.<br>\n<br>\n@ everybody- I'm ready to end the day when y'all are.  I've said my bit and I'm pretty sure we've got this one.", "time": "Tue Oct 01, 2013 8:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30562&start=1350", "forum": "53", "thread": "30562"}

The sourpuss had clearly been keen to join the Mafia, and the Mafia had noticed and obliged - but not fast enough to matter.<br>\n<br>\nAs a few days passed without any unusual deaths of any kind, the troop decided the matter was behind them and announced to the community that the Mafia had been squashed.
