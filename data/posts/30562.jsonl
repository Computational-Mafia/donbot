Originally an upscale district, over the past fifty years it has seen a drop in land value and now houses approximately 300 people of all wealth classes. Yet it still retains its xenophobic attitude with Whiffleburg at large, making it difficult for even prospective howeowners and emergency vehicles to gain access.<br><br>Flitter Hills is now about to face one of its toughest challenges in years. The morning of August 5th 2013, Bruce Costello, landscape architect and the Chairman of the Flitter Hills Community Club, was found dead in Twill Park. Aside from the three bullet holes in his chest and two in his belly, a printed note was stapled to his forehead:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">So, one of you finally discovered our plot. That's fine with us. We'll just start killing people until you leave the doors of the Security Center open at night so we can take over your little world. Go ahead and try to stop us.</span><br><br>The Deputy Chairman, Buck Poston, immediately put out a call to all residents' homes. Beginning the next day, thirteen volunteers would convene at the Community Hall to form an investigation comittee. This comittee would comb the community and its members daily and attempt to ferret out the evildoers as fast as possible. If necessary, they would also have the right to execute one person per day, should they be convinced that they have found one of the baddies. To avoid interference from the outside world, the news of the deaths would be kept secret until the hunt was successful.<br><br>Of course, Buck was known more for his cowboy diplomacy than his critical thinking. The next morning, as the thirteen volunteers came up to the Community Hall, his corpse was found duct-taped to the front yard's statue with another note stapled to his face:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Since this idiot didn't make his little witch-hunt a private affair, we've decided to infiltrate it and take it down. Good luck finding us before you're all dead.</span><br><br>The shaken citizens set up in the main conference room and took a headcount:<br><br><table style=\"border:1px solid black; \"><tr><td style=\"border:1px solid black;

They would commit to executing one person per day via hanging and refrain from attempting to use outside sources (such as searching one's house) until each day's suspect was dead. They expected there to be two or three infiltrators, so after having killed three of them, they would stop any more executions unless there continued to be murders. And while everyone recognized everyone else, nobody really knew anyone else, so there was no favouritism involved - as far as anyone knew.</div></div></div><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Playerlist</legend>1. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Smudger</span><br>2. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Grimgroove</span> \u2190 <span style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">yessiree</span><sup>1</sup></span><br>3. <span class=\"noboldsig\">beastcharizard</span><br>4. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Bowser</span> \u2190 <span style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">RationalMadman</span> \u2190 </span><span style=\"font-size: 64%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kcdaspot</span><sup>2</sup></span><br>5. <span class=\"noboldsig\">don_johnson</span><br>6. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Titus</span> \u2190 <span style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;\">ryhx</span><br>7. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span><sup>1</sup> \u2190 <span style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">brjl</span><sup>1</sup></span><br>8. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Huntress</span> \u2190 <span style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">runnerman</span><sup>3</sup></span><br>9. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Paperscraps</span><sup>1</sup><br>10. <span class=\"noboldsig\">sthar8</span><sup>1</sup><br>11. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Feel It</span><br>12. <span class=\"noboldsig\">notreallygood</span><br>13. <span class=\"noboldsig\">T S O</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 70%; line-height: 116%;\">Bold: confirmed; Superscript: prods</span></fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Current deadline</legend>Game over.</fieldset><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Those who still live</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">3. beastcharizard, <span style=\"color: #00bf00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Tracker</span></span><br>6.

Ignorance of rules is generally not a valid excuse.</li><li>All sitewide rules apply. Duh.</li><li>This is a Normal game.</li><li>Pretending to break a rule will be treated as if you actually broke it.</li><li>If you're not sure whether a specific post you want to make would break a rule, ask the mod before posting.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Moderation</span></span><br><ul><li>These are the moderators:<ul><li><span class=\"noboldsig\">Toomai</span>: Main mod. Potential operating hours: 10:00 am - 12:00 mn ET weekdays and weekends.</li></ul></li><li>This setup was reviewed for normalcy and balance by <span class=\"noboldsig\">AngryPidgeon</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">mykonian</span>, and <span class=\"noboldsig\">LlamaFluff</span>.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Posting</span></span><br><ul><li>Do not impersonate the mod. Impersonation posts may be edited by the mod to dispel the impersonation.</li><li>Do not overuse bold text. If the mod sees a post with too much unnecessary bold in it, they may decide to remove it.</li><li>Posts may be edited by the mod to fix broken tags, and double posts of identical content may be deleted. You may request such actions or the mod may do it of their own accord. Edited posts will be noted to have been edited by the mod; do not make posts with a claimed edit notice. The post of a double that is not deleted will also have such a notice, if not in the post that requests it.</li><li>If you are part of an anti-town faction, do not out your partners or bargain/threaten to do so. If the mod sees a post that goes \"I'm scum with X\", \"my buddies are Y and Z\", \"do Q and I'll tell you my peeps\", or something similar, you will be modkilled regardless of your actual alignment.</li><li>Posts must be fully readable. No hidden text, no text too small to read, no cryptography. Breadcrumbs are okay; codewords and the like set up in thread-external communications are often okay.</li><li>Do not quote your Role PM or any thread-external communications with the mod or another player (e.g. mod PMs, scum/Mason QuickTopics, etc). You may paraphrase.</li><li>You get one \"bah\" post after you die.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting</span></span><br><ul><li>You can vote with the vote tags or the bold tags.<ul><li>Examples of votes: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Doofus</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Doofus</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No lynch</span></li><li>Examples of unvotes: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Doofus</span>, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span></li></ul></li><li>Unvotes before vote switches are not necessary.</li><li>If something looks like a vote, the mod will clarify whether that vote counts in the next votecount, and probably also edit the offending post for clarity. If someone is accidentally hammered or something because of this, too bad.</li><li>Votes do not have to be at the start of a line or in their own paragraph, but most of the players will hate you if you don't do so.</li><li>Once a majority (50% + 1) is voting for one player or for no lynch, the decision is fixed and no further votes or unvotes will take effect.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Phases/Deadlines</span></span><br><ul><li>Each Day phase will last [number of living players + 4] days.</li><li>If there is no majority by deadline, no lynch will occur, regardless of whether the mod is currently online at the deadline to make said result official.</li><li>A maximum of [number of players / 2] days is available for player-requested extensions during the course of the game. Players may post in-thread something like <span class=\"noboldsig\">Request Extension: X days</span> (not accepted by mod PM). Once 50% of players have requested an extension, one will be granted with a length equal to the most common choice. Players may \"Request Extension\" with no given number of days or choose to \"Unrequest Extension\". If you don't get enough players agreeing for an extension before the deadline, or you want an extension and all available days have been previously used up, too bad.</li><li>Reaching a lynch before a deadline will add [number of days remaining / 2] to the amount of days available for extension. For example, making a lynch 6 days before a deadline will add 3 days to the extension pool.</li><li>Each Night phase will last 72 hours (3 days), regardless of whether the mod is currently online at the deadline to make the results official.</li><li>Living players may send the mod a PM during the night requesting that the Night end early. If all living players do this, the Night will end as soon as possible.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity</span></span><br><ul><li>You should try to post once every 24 hours.</li><li>If you don't post for 72 hours, you will receive a prod. You then have 24 hours to respond to said prod in-thread (not by PM). Prods sent will be noted in-thread.</li><li>You will be force-replaced for inactivity under one of the following conditions:<ul><li>You are about to receive a third prod.</li><li>You do not respond to a prod in 24 hours.</li></ul></li><li>If the mod decides, at their discretion, that your activity has substantially improved, they may choose to expire one of your prods or allow you more than three prods before replacement.</li><li>You may declare V/LA by posting in-thread your expected day of return. Once your stated V/LA time expires and you have not yet posted you will receive a reminder that you are now on the prod clock.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Replacements</span></span><br><ul><li>Players who choose to replace out may PM the mod a message they wish to send to their replacement, which will be relayed at about the same time they receive their role PM (as a result, must be sent in before the replacement is found). This message should be treated as a role PM and therefore may not be quoted, only paraphrased. Force-replaced players may not necessarily be allowed to do this, depending on the nature of the force-replace.</li><li>If a replacement occurs during Day with three days or less left in the deadline, the deadline will be suspended while the replacement is happening and reset to three days once it is completed.</li><li>Replacements may ask for an extension of up to three days, but only in their first few posts. You can't replace in early in a Day, wait until close to deadline, then ask for a replacement extension. The mod has the right to disallow this extension request.</li><li>If a replacement occurs during Night, the Night will continue for 24 hours after the replacement is complete (unless this would make it shorter than usual).</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Endgame</span></span><br><ul><li>Note that these win conditions are generic and should not be used to assume any particular role or faction is in the game.</li><li>The Town wins once all anti-town players are dead and at least one pro-town player remains alive.</li><li>An anti-town faction wins once it comprises 50% or more of all living players, whether there exist Town roles capable of stopping them via role actions or not.</li><li>A Serial Killer wins when all other players are dead, whether they themselves are alive or not.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod Requests</span></span><br><ul><li>If you notice a mistake with a votecount or similar, post so in the thread and the mod will fix it.</li><li>If you need a rule clarified, you may post in-thread or PM the mod.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Roles</span></span><br><ul><li>Note that the given role-related information is generic and should not be used to assume any particular role is in the game.</li><li>Roles are composed of a list of abilities. They can be of the following basic types:<ul><li><img src=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/images/thumb/0/0a/AbilityIcon%28Active%29.png/16px-AbilityIcon%28Active%29.png\" alt=\"Image\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">(Active)</span> abilities are only used when you PM the mod stating what you are using and who to use it on (if applicable). If the mod does not receive a relevant PM, it is assumed you chose to not use the ability. Active abilities can be blocked.</li><li><img src=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/images/thumb/5/56/AbilityIcon%28Passive%29.png/16px-AbilityIcon%28Passive%29.png\" alt=\"Image\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">[Passive]</span> abilities are \"always on\". They have a continuous effect and cannot be blocked by normal roles.</li><li><img src=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/images/thumb/b/b8/AbilityIcon%28Reflexive%29.png/16px-AbilityIcon%28Reflexive%29.png\" alt=\"Image\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">&lt;Reflexive&gt;</span> abilities automatically use themselves under a given condition. They may or may not be blockable and may or may not inform the user that they have been used.</li></ul></li><li>Abilities can have the following basic modifiers attached:<ul><li><img src=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/images/thumb/0/0d/AbilityIcon%28Factional%29%28bfbfbf%29.png/16px-AbilityIcon%28Factional%29%28bfbfbf%29.png\" alt=\"Image\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">{Factional}</span> abilities belong to a group and are executed by a chosen member. In general, a player may use a factional ability and a personal ability in the same night, but not two factional ones or two personal ones.</li><li><img src=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/images/thumb/5/52/AbilityIcon%28x1%29.png/16px-AbilityIcon%28x1%29.png\" alt=\"Image\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">(X-Shot)</span> abilities can only be used a given number of times. If an attempt to use such an ability is blocked, no shot is used up.</li><li><img src=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/images/thumb/7/70/AbilityIcon%28Compulsive%29.png/16px-AbilityIcon%28Compulsive%29.png\" alt=\"Image\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">&lt;Compulsive&gt;</span> abilities must be used; one cannot choose to not use them. If the mod does not receive a choice for using this ability, it will be used on a random target. Actions randomized in this way will not target members of the player's faction (randomized Town actions may target any player).</li></ul></li><li>At least one player's role PM looks like this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Vanilla Townie Role PM wrote:</cite>Hello, [Player].

It's just controversial. Some people like it, some don't. Unfortunately, in the last game I played, some of the players encouraged it, and thus I ended up getting lynched.

As promised, this is an explanation of everything I've done in game so far, along with the conclusions I've drawn.<br><br>Especially because of the PBPA part, this is going to be a really long post.

I really like multiple metas because it saves a bunch of work and gives relevant interactions between the playstyles of the two players involved, so I looked it up.  In the game that they shared, a discussion of charizard's meta came up.  I followed the links to the other game, and found that charizard plays very similarly as town and scum.  He appears to like doing the \"super protown\"  thing as scum, which might make him very hard to read.  I did notice a potential tell (that I can't out right now, sorry) that required me to get a baseline on char's emotional state this game before it would be useful.  To that end, I determined that I needed to annoy charizard fairly early this game.  Specifically, from his meta he appears to dislike things he doesn't understand or can't reason out explicitly, so I picked that tone for my early posts.<br><br>FeelIt has seen me employ that particular tactic in a different way before, but I noticed an opportunity for extra value.<br><br>The second thing I was worried about involved the rules in this particular game.  Specifically, I wanted to test the rules for voting.  Toomai's ruleset is a little vague on what counts as a vote, which of course is information that I needed ASAP.  I could have pm'd Toomai or posted in the thread asking for clarification, but the subtleties of the rule could be used in a trap later in the game and I didn't want to risk the ability to use the rule against scum.  Plus, it was easy to test while working on the other pieces of the gambit.<br><br>Third, as of post 58 the game was very quiet.  We hadn't gained much information from RVS and I was ready for a wagon to analyze.  While I will maintain that I didn't do anything scummy during the course of this gambit, several others have pointed out that town are often willing to lynch players they don't understand even without any overt anti-town behavior.  Frankly, it's also easier for me to analyze a wagon on myself, since the sure knowledge that I am pro-town in motivation eliminates a significant portion of the variables.<br><br>So, I decided to a) place an abbreviated vote to test whether it would count b) give no explanation for my vote to annoy beast and c) ride the no explanation wagon until I had enough votes for proper analysis.  I chose kcda for reasons I'll get into in my reads list, and the result was <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5208066#p5208066\" class=\"postlink\">post 58.</a><br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5208164#p5208164\" class=\"postlink\">Post 60</a> was also pursuant to the above.  And a little bit of celebration that I'd gotten beast's interest in my vote and therefore wouldn't have to find something else to bug him with.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209525#p5209525\" class=\"postlink\">Post 72</a> was mostly taunting charizard, along with a joking call for more votes on my wagon (because I wanted more votes on my wagon)  and a hint that I had a plan, for anybody who was paying attention.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209698#p5209698\" class=\"postlink\">Post 76</a> was more of the same.  Breadcrumbing a strategy while pushing charizard.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210301#p5210301\" class=\"postlink\">Post 82</a> was refusal to cooperate, with some hints to town and a joke.  Paper, the brevity necessary for the tactic may have made my questions unclear.  I was actually asking, \"Why is what I am doing not very town?\" and \"Why is keeping things hidden suspicious?\"  Ideally, Paper would have answered these questions before I gave up the gambit.  I don't think town would have tolerated that though.  I'd still like the answers if possible.  I intended the questions to make town players strongly consider my motivations.<br><br>My third bit in that post was a semantic joke coupled with a horse laugh.  The beginning is the equivalent of the English teacher in highschool who wouldn't let you go to the restroom until you said \"May I\" instead of \"Can I\" and the second part notes that his word choice invalidates his argument unless we change the definition of another term.<br><br>In 83, I realized that we'd had a votecount.  I unvoted so that if my new vote didn't count I wouldn't lose track of it, and I revoted both to poke charizard and to test Toomai's tolerance for broken tags and misspellings.  If that vote hadn't counted I would have tried just a misspelling.  <br><br>85, 87, and 89 are all encouragement for players on my wagon.

I responded that my reads were not solid yet but that I felt the information was important, and gave an assurance that I would start playing normally at some point.  Then end of that post is a reference to the poem by Robert Frost that shares titles with the game kcda and don were discussing.</div></div></div><br><br>And that's all I've got time for right now.

Seems concerned with scumhunting.  I believe he wants to \"save me\" from being a VI, which is productive.<br><br>Elyse- Welcome to the game.  Good post.  I disagree with much of it, but it's solid reasoning. Keep doing that.<br>A couple points- <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>(I'm calling you star from now on)</div></blockquote><br>That's fine.  My username was assigned to me by the Airforce almost 20 years ago, and I've been using it since.  It's the first two letters of my first name, the first three of my last name, and a numerical indicator that happens to have some significance to me.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why do you FoS him here if you meant to vote him before?</div></blockquote><br>Two reasons:  As I noted before, I was provoking emotional reactions and beast appears to dislike things he cannot explain.  Also, I had come up with that misspelling of his name in case I needed to test the voting system any further and I didn't want to waste it  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> <br><br>sthar8- Fuck this guy.  He's giving me a headache.<br><br>And what's most importantly, my current scumlist, from weakest to strongest read:<br><br>beastcharizard- Just on the scummy side of neutral.  I'm not going to push him much today unless he gives me some really good tells because he's active and I think I'll be able to read him later.<br>Here's what bugs me about his play, from weakest to strongest:<br>1.  Directing town.  Pushing everyone to answer his questions and ask more of him, promising that he'd unvote me if I presented logic, announcing the end of rvs and stating that further jokes are now scummy, coaching other players to contribute.  Basically, charizard wants to be leading the town and so is attempting to manipulate others' behavior with his posts.  This is a very, very weak scumtell, particularly because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I do that shit all the time</span> regardless of my alignment.  The difference is, of course, that I know why <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I'd</span> be doing that.<br>2. He seems overly concerned at his image.  Noting that he's serious, noting that he's \"giving out information,\"  offering to present meta on himself, insisting that he's been doing most of the scumhunting.  Charizard looks concerned with being perceived as town, as opposed to actually playing a town game.  He might just be self-conscious and I get the impression that he likes to see himself on \"townie\" lists regardless of alignment, but it's still worrying.<br>3. His hypocrisy regarding don.  Attacking me for not providing reasoning, then having no reasoning on don later suggests that he was looking for a plausible reason to attack me instead of attacking me for something he found scummy.<br>4. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213860#p5213860\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> sets off all of my scumbells.  I appreciate the joke, but he ignored a direct question (that he still hasn't answered) to make it.  Given beast's play so far, especially how concerned he's been with questions and answers, I see no protown reason from his perspective to ignoring my request for a case on me.  It looks like he thought I'd be an easy lynch, and if he could avoid giving any reasoning for voting me he could pass it off as policy or blame someone else for pushing it on day 2.<br><br>T S O- I have no idea what TSO is doing this game.  A lot of little one liners are not conducive to either scumhunting or conveying your motivations.<br>Weakest to strongest again:<br>1. Coaching Charizard <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212680#p5212680\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.  Especially the first post, because he's helping someone make a case on a person <span style=\"font-style: italic\">he's expressed no suspicion of</span>.  Related, his attacks on me could be indicative if charizard were to flip scum.  He attacks me for \"noise posting\" (to be fair, that's totally true, but he doesn't say how it's scummy) on the only posts with relevant questions that might pertain to charizard's alignment.<br>2. Mudslinging.  He's expressed suspicion of {notreally, sthar8, kcda, possibly yessiree} without voting for any of them.  His RVS vote is still active, despite having 14 more posts of discussion (?).  He refuses to give his own list of suspicions, but criticizes notreally on the quantity of his reads.  It appears that TSO is looking for an easy wagon but doesn't want to actually be seen on one.<br>3. I don't know what kind of manipulation TSO is afraid of, but having 15 posts with <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no actual reads</span> is scummy as shit.  Town should generally be more concerned with their information being available in thread and actually catching scum.  You do need more than just your vote, which means you'll have to convince others to share your opinion.  Additionally, shouldn't you be able to mitigate any manipulation based on your reads simply by being aware that you're susceptible to it?  It looks like TSO has priorities other than scumhunting right now, which is anti-town.<br><br>Kcdaspot- I don't know if my suspicions on kcda are actually the strongest, but I do think he's the best lynch right now.<br>Here's why I voted him originally (these are super weak but I felt they were enough for my purposes on page 3):<br>1. He jumped in during a semi-serious discussion but made sure to get his random vote in.<br>2. He then found a bad excuse to make his random vote serious, without having to post that.<br>3. He next post was joking and without content, giving him an out should his vote be questioned.<br><br>Here's why I'll be voting him in a moment:<br>1. He was the third vote on my wagon and I don't think he's aware of the jeep tells.<br>2. He talked don into voting me using a game that (as far as I can tell) is irrelevant (though a fun read).  This looks like buddying to me.<br>3. After voting for me with no reasoning and convincing don to do the same he just... vanished.  Lurking is a particularly insidious scumtactic because it prevents the other players from getting a read on you.  It looks to me like kcda tried to set up a day1 mislynch and then disappeared hoping that the town would finish it off for him.  That way he can come back in and claim to have been joking/pressure voting/not ready to lynch when I flip town the next day.<br><br>I think a scumlurker is a great lynch day 1, especially since my other suspects seem content to keep dropping tells.  I certainly don't want to let him lurk his way to a later day when he can be much more damaging.  Barring prods or replacement, I'm very happy with my vote on KCDA today.</div></div></div><br><br>As I said above, I'm going to<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: kcda</span><br><br>Questions?

I know it's early in the game and your reads aren't concrete, but I already explained why it was bad.

You have to have a clear mind when playing Mafia. <br><br>First of all, It is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">ME</span> who don't understand Kcdaspot.

You haven't explained that either. <br><br>Also, Even though sthar was only L-3 at that time, I had to remind him of his behaviour. That's because I'd had similar experience, and I had a feeling that if he kept going on like that, he would get policy lynched. You may not understand, because that's something related to personal experiences and cannot be expressed by words.<br><br>Moreover, I said \"Smudger is V/LA\" instead of simply \"Everyone else: can't read\" because I have a certain habit of explaining everything.

For example, When Paper said I wasn't fencesitting, you immediately disagreed with that and asked him \"How is that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> fencesitting?\", which is a little rude in my opinion. Besides, he had already given his reason in his post. <br><br>Another example is when you described Feel It as \"half-assed and scummy\" just because he had only given reads on four people. If you had read the posts coming after that, you would've known that he did that because those were the only people whom he could give opinions on. <br><br>Lady, don't push it too hard. It'll do you no good."}

He asked in a previous post for people to give their opinion on it so I did.  Now what had changed was they were not posting any better so i decided that they were the greatest threat to the town and that probably was not going to change no matter what they did.

Earlier I had stated that I had a feel for what he was trying to achieve, and for those skimming, I qualified that by saying, as I was trying to catch up, that I was yet to read the promised explanation from Sthar at that time and point of my read. While I was sort of right with my feel which was that he was winding people up to gauge responses to his behaviour it was as he has explained a lot more involved, and it is the first time I have ever seen this  does that make him more town in my mind, maybe, but then it could all be a screen to distract. If it is then it is very well constructed, I think not though.</div></blockquote><br><br>This post is WIFOM if I understand what it is.  You said sthar8's plan could just be scum being clever.<br><br>@ Elyse: The problem is that they people have barely done anything in the game let alone anything to give them enough to be town.  Doing one town thing does a towny not make.  The best post Runnerman has is defending how they play which isn't even helping anything but themselves.  I just don't see how Runnerman is a town read and it is very suspicious.  Your arguement for Titus has already been made but I don't see how that makes them town.<br><br>@ Sthar8: Everything since the start of the game has been scummy to me.  Your tactic makes little sense as well.  I understand want to gauge my reaction but don't understand how you picked me out of everyone else.  I am assuming it is because I was the most active or the one who asked the question.  Secondly you waited till forever to tell us your \"plan\", which i am not totally convinced that is what you were doing.  I didn't think I would ever unvote you but now you are just a null read because i truely believe Elyse is scum and is buddying her partners by giving them town reads.<br>I know it isn't my place but TSO is kind of mean when he plays from my experience so what he is doing is null to me.

I don't know what to think of him.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yes I know why you would think that.  Well day one to me is, generally about getting a feel for people, yes that is a \"No Shit Sherlock\" statement.  But hear me out, I do this by sitting back, obviously not too much or I get called out for lurking, and see who is active and what they are saying and who is calling out who.  I then of course take the answers to questions I may ask on board and this is generally the way I like play D1<br><br> So what am I seeing? Well in no particular order<br><br>Elyse: - actually comes across to me as town, very active responding to questions and any challenges that are throwing their way (it is a Hydra yes?).  reasoning is coherent and nothing is now coming across as outwardly questionable or raises my eyebrows.<br><br>Sthar: - he obviously likes to take the lead and is very convincing in how he presents his reads and interpretation of the play so far.  His techniques are new to me in this game and the way he evaluates playing styles and personalities, At first read I it slightly threatening, but as I reread what was being said I realised what was going on.  I know I say threatening, and that some may now say \"hang on why would you feel threatened?\"  as i said, first glance made me stop and think hang on... as for Sthars alignment, I would like to think he is town I would like to think his approach is one I could trust,  but I reserve judgement.<br><br>TSO: - I had a chuckle at Sthar's approach and subsequent \"read\" of TSO, but that is where it stopped to be honest.  take away the TSO and Sthar interchange and what do we have? well we still have a defensive approach IMO and not much more TBH.  input is low and responses to questions is not what I would have expected.<br><br>Titus: - is on some peoples possible scum lists including my own early on, but I don't see it right now, yes again input so far is low, to be expected D1 maybe, but the majority of what is being said does not ring alarm bells with me. <br><br>Runnerman:- Up until recently I was feeling possible scum, however recent interaction has started to change that perception.  <br><br>KCDA :- I dont get it at all, the style is wacky and simplistic IMO, is that bad, not really but even still king of the lurkers in my book and for that reason aloneI have a bad feeling about him, enough to put him in the scum category at this time, yes pretty much, and I actually echo what NRG is saying about KDCA.<br><br>Yessiree :- ?? have played in a game with Yessiree before but had to replace out, there seems to be no difference from the little I have seen and experienced previously, I would reserve judgement on him also.<br><br>Paperscraps: - leaning town on Papers right now for similar reasons as those I have alluded to with Elyse.  is active and responds to questions and challenges coherently.  <br><br>Beasts: - Obviously an experienced player and is very active with, IMO, balanced and objective responses to questions and challenges and an early candidate of  \"here is some pressure how you going to deal with it approach\" from Sthar, and to be fair and honest my initial feelings were at that stage \" I don't know maybe scum\" and now they have moved to \"middle for diddle\", meaning again I will reserve judgement but would lean slight town.  <br><br>FeelIt :- have played a few games with FeelIt before, in those IIRC he was town and I see no difference between what I saw there and what I am seeing presently.

Don't really know what he was doing by making two persons out of charizard and beast though. Would like him to expand on that.<br><br>I also saw some people refer to Titus as a \"she\". It might be nothing, but could those people explain why they did that and where they found out Titus is a female? <br><br>Despite my few notes, he strikes me as very townish. It's just that all of his posts so far rub me the right way. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span> (replacing brjl)<br><br>I didn't like brjl at all. His posts seemed to come off too much as him being Mr. Nice Guy. Lots of smilies and jokes, very little content.<br>Elyse's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5218577#p5218577\">152</a> changed this completely. That post almost summed up word for word what I had on other people myself at that point. This results in a strong townread on Elyse from my part. The only strange thing I found about that post was the vote on notreallygood, whereas I expected that vote to come on beastcharizard. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Don Johnson</span><br><br>Started with a very peculiar self-vote. I find it very strange because it seemed to be designed as some form of reaction test. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5204860#p5204860\">31</a> he votes for TSO for the following reasons: TSO didn't answer beastcharizard's questions and TSO misspelled Mr. Johnson's name. However, TSO had called Mr. Johnson out for the self-vote. I found it strange and scummy that Don johnson would not make any reference to that, because that means the self-vote apparently was not a reaction test. But what was it then?  Scum trying to portray an image of confidence by doing something out of the ordinary? That's my line of thinking at least. <br>As referred to earlier, I also found his \"buddying\" towards Titus noteworthy, especially in combination for his liking of beastcharizard at the time of said buddying. Titus entered with an attack on beastcharizard, whose questions Don johnson seemed to be holding in high esteem. A small discrepancy in Don Johnson's opinions I thought. After that I have seen him do little else than prod dodging. Scummy guy if you ask me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kcdaspot</span><br><br>I liked his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206158#p5206158\">53</a>, it was an odd follow-up of events in my eyes as well. It's a pity his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5208729#p5208729\">63</a> tries to pass off everything before that as one big joke. Looks very clumsy. The bits about his \"suspicious winking\" seem to come out of nowhere, possibly revealing some over-worrying about he and his smilies could be percieved. I have no idea what his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210356#p5210356\">84</a> actually means and refers to, and as far as I can tell he never expanded on it. Nevertheless that post felt townie to me. Also his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219910#p5219910\">168</a> felt very townish to me, particularly the part where he welcomes sthar to the game. It shows some confidence towards the greatest contributor to the game that makes me feel he's town. He's a townread of mine, but it's all gut.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">sthar8</span><br><br>Every game needs his obvtown and he's the one who gets the part. In the beginning I found his strong support for the RQS bizarre, as well as the, at that point, unexplained vote on Kcda. By page 4 he claimed to be on to something. I'm currently reading some Agatha Cristie's, and it reminded me a lot of the Hercule Poirot character. Smugly sitting in a chair, appearing to have it all worked out, and delivering at the end of the book while showing he was truly onto something all along. Shtar's breakthroughs are not as legendary as Hercule Poirot's (not yet, at least), but they already come quite close. I loved his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216768#p5216768\">148</a>. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> was equally impressive. I do have two questions noted down here:<br>*\u00a8Why, in the scheme of things, was it important for sthar to wait for Paperscraps in particular? I never saw and still don't see the significance of Paperscraps in this scheme. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212733#p5212733\">111</a> Paperscraps is brought up as a related note, and shortly after he becomes the one unmet condition in order for sthar to divulge his plans. An oddity I'd like cleared up. Hercule Poirot never leaves any loose ends in his logic, so I expect the same of sthar. <br>* This question is a bit less relevant now since sthar himself admitted to that part of the argument against TSO being the weakest, but I found the way he called out TSO for coaching beastcharizard not up to par with the rest of his material. First of all, it is an associative tell that we can only use once either of them flips. Second, I don't think the point he makes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219925#p5219925\">170</a> is very convincing when it comes to town TSO not asking beastcharizard to make a case against don_johnson. I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is Always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. <br>I'll get to TSO later, but my notes on him don't really agree with the viewpoints presented by sthar8 on TSO in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a>. Given TSO seems to be the main lynch-candidate for today, I imagine some debate. <br>As evident from my earlier comments on Kcda, I also don't agree with sthar's views on that guy. I find it a bit of an anti-climax to see his elaborate plan result in a vote on someone who looks to me as a harmless lurker. But like I said, that's just my gut talking. <br>Despite these disagreements, I feel sthar is town. Obvtown in fact.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Feel it</span><br><br>Haven't written much about him. I noted that I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a> and his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214230#p5214230\">129</a>, the last one for sheeping the people I consider town.

Townish.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Paperscraps</span><br><br>Didn't like how he started with that joke about everyone self-voting and him hammering. It made him come off as a newbie which he is clearly not. It also made him come off as careless, and people coming off as careless usually rub me the wrong way because that means they're actively trying to come across as such. I did like how he mirrored sthar8 at some point (didn't write down which post that was, but it was that vote where he mimicks sthar's vote on Kcda and votes on sthar himself). Somehow it felt like the move of a confident townsperson to treat sthar in such a way. By then sthar wasn't the presence that he is now, but I thought sthar's first few posts already hinted at him being a player not to trifle with too much. Yet Paperscraps did just that.

If he (or indeed anyone else reading) were the first, thinking about the questions should have challenged that application and made them look at my motives.  Scum, of course, have no incentive to read that deeply and would bullshit something to justify their presence on an easy wagon.  I hoped to use paper's responses to ascertain his alignment, but explaining myself first would have revealed that as a trap if he were scum.

I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is Always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. </div></blockquote><br>This is certainly the weakest point against TSO, because there are protown reasons for fishing out a case.  I just don't see them here, in either TSO's tone or his other content.  Some points though:<br>1.  Coaching isn't associative, it's behavioral.  Scum coach scum to subtly protect each other, and scum coach town as a form of buddying.  The point is that in order to coach like TSO was doing, you have to be certain of the other player's alignment.  Being certain of alignment is a scumtell.<br>2. This is one I'm always on the lookout for because it's usually the best way to catch <span style=\"font-style: italic\">me</span> as scum.  I tend to arrogantly assume that I know better than my scumbuddies, and try to fix their play (Anybody want to argue that TSO isn't arrogant?).  I find it especially indicative when the coach doesn't otherwise interact with the person they are coaching (not that TSO has had any significant interaction with anybody but me).

I shall try to do it justice as soon as I get fully into this game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">notreallygood</span><br><br>In the beginning of the game his play was defined by one thing: sideline comments. He never engaged, he was a spectator not threading on any toes. He commented on things going on, yes, but never substantially. This keeps going on until post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213619#p5213619\">117</a>, where he gives a reads list. Two things struck me as odd in that reads list: 1. there\"s no read on Don. This is a possible associative tell. Everyone else there's a read on, be it scum, town or null. In Don's case he just mentions an agreement on a certain particularity, but no read. 2. He considers sthar scum, but he phrases it this way: \"I hate to say this, but sthar is scum\" (paraphrased). Why add the part \"I hate to say this\"? It feels very off to me. If as town you truly consider sthar scum, there's no reason to hate saying it. Hating to say something means you're not comfortable in saying it, and if you're not comfortable in calling someone scum, Iguess it means you somehow know they're not scum. And how would you know? And why would you still say it then? Only one answer to that question. <br>Like Elyse has said, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214012#p5214012\">125</a> and 126 are remarkable as well. It's where he calls on sthar not to be a cunt. For starters, I don't think sthar was being a cunt. Second, I generally don't like people briging up policy lynches, but definitely not in this game. I've only reached page 7 and I see enormous content. Why then bring up policy lynches? It seems fabricated to do so.<br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214345#p5214345\">130</a> he blindly takes over the idea that it is important to wait for MPaperscraps reply. Even though sthar8 knew the reasons why it was important to do so, he didn't. There's no way he could know in my eyes. Hence this looks like the blatant sheeping of obvtown sthar8. <br>I found the reaction to sthar's expos\u00e9 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216969#p5216969\">150</a> unnaturally aloof. sthar's 148 deserved more than that. Looks like scum trying to play down what is happening.<br>And his reply to Elyse's catch-up post is also quite bad, as he mainly addresses things pertaining to himself in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219866#p5219866\">167</a>, which I find scummy to begin with. I know what argument is going to come up next, but in that post I see a notreallygood who is so caught up with how he is being percieved that he not only selects the pieces that are about him, he for some reason feels it necessary to add some inconsequential defence odf Feel It's post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a>. Why single out that post by someone else to valiantly defend it? Just feels wrong.<br>I have nothing good to say about notreallygood at this point. I think he's scum.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TSO</span><br>I'm going to start off by daying I had read the last post before entering this topic, and saw suspicions were raised against him (someone calling him out on his reads being poor). I regretted having read that, as I imagined this would bias me in a stance against TSO, but I have to say my impression of his first posts was very positive. I particularly liked how he defied beastcharizard by not answering his questions. And I also liked his vote on Don Johnson because he self-voted. I think I would have done something similar. I also thought his questions to bryl (Elyse's slot) were very pertinent at the time. (I apologize for not adding post numbers, I didn't write them down, but it's on the first few pages of the topic). MY first question mark was raised when he townread Feel It in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206249#p5206249\">54</a>, which felt very out of the blue at the time, as well as his scumread on Kcda just after it. Like Elyse (again :p) I had a complete opposite reaction: I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't). Though I do not agree with his critisisms on sthar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5215371#p5215371\">134</a> and those coming just after it, they do feel authentic and not forced. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\">142</a>, which I found to be a just criticism toward beastcharizard. Townfeels from TSO.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">beautycharizard</span><br>Got the most notes on him. Already rubbed me the wrong me starting from his very first post, where he showed clear intent to become some sort of townleader. I was wondering whether he was over-enthousiastic town or self-overestimating scum, and I'm pretty much settled on the latter. He's obviously very smart and sensible, but that's exactly what's giving him away. His posts all feel so terribly calculated. He knows just what to say, he has rational explanations for everything, but it just doesn't feel real. <br>Take his RVS for instance. Already in his first post he tries to vote, and in his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5202831#p5202831\">18</a> he RVS'es, but at the same time feels the need to throughly explain that RVS. The \"R\" in \"RVS\" stands for RANDOM, yet already here he wants to come off as this rational, level-headed townleader who thinks everything through. His idea for an RQS seems like a way for him tog et towncred, plain and simple. The added value of his questions are, however entertaining, quite limited. I wouldn't have had so much problems with it, if it hadnt been for post post]46[/post] where he tries to take credit for getting people to talk. This would have happened without him as well. This still leaves open the possibility of a self-centered townie, but I thinkthere's more at play. <br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209195#p5209195\">65</a> sounds unnaturally perfect. He tries to portray how reasonable he is by showing a willingness to change his vote if sthar changes his ways. Also his call for seriousness sounds incredibly forced. Bah!<br>In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209388#p5209388\">68</a> he insists on Titus answering his questions, yet only a post later^(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209438#p5209438\">71</a>), he claims those questions are not crucial and just for background. He agrees they are not of importance in the big scumhunting picture, but then why insist on TSO answering his questions? Towncred. That's all it is. Beastcharizard is not scumhunting. He's towncredhunting. <br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211258#p5211258\">94</a> is also bad. He's overthinking we he could be considered scummy. Not a town mindset at all.<br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211433#p5211433\">96</a> shows too much defiance, the \"bring it on\"-attitude I don't see coming from town, but again from scum overestimating his manipulative abilities. There's also a soft attack on Don Johnson here. I wonder if there was a follow upo on that but Ih aven't seen it uptil now. So far it looks like a textbook soft-bus.<br>In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212211#p5212211\">107</a> he answers to one of sthar's questions by saying he thinks sthar's vote on him (which is really an FOS at that point) is an RVS. How could he possible believe that after all this time? That answer is just a way to avoid publicized introspection. There's no way sthar's stance towards beastcharziard was random in any way at that point, yet beastcharizard claimed to believe just that. I think this is a blatant lie. <br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213187#p5213187\">115</a> I also don't like. His answer to \"Who are you 3 top scumreads\" is not adequate, as it just mentions two people. Also his statement \"One thing you cannot say is that I don't share information\" is wrong and again fits in with his towncred-hunt. What information has he given? He just answered questions he felt safe in answering dsue to his estimation that he can fool anyone with rational thought and logic, but he forgets to consider that it all feels so wrong.<br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213801#p5213801\">119</a> is terrible. Calling sthar's play horrible and scummy came out of nowhere and is completely uncalled for. It just shows defiance, but no content. Scummy as hell.<br>And in general I also feel he's asking questions, but only the obvious ones. Town will make sompe logical fallacies. If someone says \"All apples are green\", beastcharizard will be the one pointing out that some apples are red. True as that may be, he seems to focus on logic too much, trying to spot harmless mistakes in others and portray himself as an untouchable knight in shining armor. I think and I feel and I believe and I'm this close to knowing that this guy is scum.<br><br>I would vote beastcharizard right now, but I want to finish reading through the rest of the topic first. See you tomorrow."}

And when did I say I liked policy lynch? I hate it. What I meant is, some people (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">excluding</span> me) may encourage policy lynch. <br>I personally dislike it because I've had some experiences where I was town and someone made a policy lynch on me.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> he blindly takes over the idea that it is important to wait for MPaperscraps reply. Even though sthar8 knew the reasons why it was important to do so, he didn't. There's no way he could know in my eyes. Hence this looks like the blatant sheeping of obvtown sthar8. <br>I found the reaction to sthar's expos\u00e9 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216969#p5216969\">150</a> unnaturally aloof. sthar's 148 deserved more than that. Looks like scum trying to play down what is happening. </div></blockquote><br><br>Again, experience. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> And his reply to Elyse's catch-up post is also quite bad, as he mainly addresses things pertaining to himself in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219866#p5219866\">167</a>, which I find scummy to begin with. I know what argument is going to come up next, but in that post I see a notreallygood who is so caught up with how he is being percieved that he not only selects the pieces that are about him, he for some reason feels it necessary to add some inconsequential defence of Feel It's post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209649#p5209649\">74</a>. Why single out that post by someone else to valiantly defend it? Just feels wrong. </div></blockquote><br><br>It was my duty. I could sense that Feel It had done nothing wrong, but Elyse kept commenting how his reads were half-assed and scummy. I couldn't let someone I trusted got insulted. I had to defend him, no matter how 'wrong' people might feel. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't. </div></blockquote><br><br>Why...why? Why do you both (Elyse and you) think that Kcda is town while Feel It is scummy? I think Feel It at least has got more solid reads than Kcda.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Got the most notes on him. Already rubbed me the wrong me starting from his very first post, where he showed clear intent to become some sort of townleader. I was wondering whether he was over-enthousiastic town or self-overestimating scum, and I'm pretty much settled on the latter. He's obviously very smart and sensible, but that's exactly what's giving him away. His posts all feel so terribly calculated. He knows just what to say, he has rational explanations for everything, but it just doesn't feel real. <br><br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209195#p5209195\">65</a> sounds unnaturally perfect. He tries to portray how reasonable he is by showing a willingness to change his vote if sthar changes his ways. Also his call for seriousness sounds incredibly forced. Bah! </div></blockquote><br><br>Where is it \"unnaturally perfect\"? I've said similar things in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5214188#p5214188\">127</a>, only in a calmer tone. So my post is \"unnaturally perfect\" too?<br> <br>@Elyse<br>Well, hurry up and lynch me now. Isn't that what you want?"}

TSO does point out the \"omgus\" reasoning offered, but in reality, misspelling a name is a joke reason. not answering questions seemed like the more serious accusation. ftr, at the time, i was just fucking around. but for bril to pick up on that is not odd.<br><br>second red flag:<br><br>bril posts 44 and 45. they show up as one minute apart. its almost like bril  answers TSO's question with a kind of \"well... maybe\" type answer and then quickly realizes he should be paying more attention so he addresses another post. i don't know. its a stretch, but those time stamps seem awfully close...<br><br>post 47 is a positive from TSO, cause it shows he is following up his line of questioning.<br><br>Kc 53 is interesting point. kind of like the beetlejuice syndrome. reinforces the Kc town read i develop later on.<br><br>i still like titus' entry post. its just kind of a middle finger. i don't think beast is scummy, but titus post 1 is ok.<br><br>beast's brush off of the vote is another red flag. i think town beast would have been a little more defensive.<br><br>fell it's read on beast in 74 is fencesit. that's ok, but if either flips scum it could be an associative tell.<br><br>post 75, i'm moving notreallygood into my town pile for good and i'm not going to discuss why. gut says town based on his play.<br><br>post 80 is poor reasoning imo. its kind of like, \"well if this guy keeps playing in this style i will lynch them, but as soon as they do something that other people think is townie, i will not lynch them.\" it really has no merit and by being so obvious about why the vote exists, the vote really has no pressure, which is what gives votes therir value.<br><br>scum pile at this time: beast bril paper.<br><br>will continue with next post.<br><br>p-edit: TSO- the alliance works against the scum win condition. scum proposing an alliance with their buddies in the drivers seat would be an epic gambit. odds are that someone proposing an alliance is town. but this is from my 90+ games of experience in forum mafia. so what do i know. either way, i'm reading now. so we're doing this the hard way."}

A lot of people voting someone who just voted them, would refer to the notion of \"OMGUS\", just to be ahead of the inevitable comments that will follow. Yet, Titus did not bother doing that. It shows to me Titus isn't bothered about how he's being percieved. He's mainly focused on his case and on the reasons for his vote, which in my view are also justified. I also liked the comment on how TSO and sthar were being town vs town. Firstly because I feel the same way, and secondly because it's not a comment I see scum make easily. Scum would be more inclined to join one of the parties in that fight, hoping one of them gets lynched, or just stand back and watch them both devour each other. Titus stepped in and tried to (albeit modestly) defuse the situation. <br>Titus' suspicions (paranoia?) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227294#p5227294\">242</a> also feels very genuine and townish.

I see where she's coming from, as there was something that screamed town when first glancing at Don Johnson's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236003#p5236003\">338</a>, but I don't feel it warrants such a strong townread at all. More on Don Johnson later. <br>The main reason why Elyse has been scrutinzed are her townreads on people who didn't post much. As you'll find I agree on most of those townreads. I think the push on her was bad, and yes, scummy. MAybe Elyse did try to overexplain it (partially because of having been forced to) while much of the townreads were probably also gut, but the reasons for her townreading those people were always clear and not as mysterious as her attackers made it out to be. More on that later.<br><br>Elyse is in my townpile.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kcdaspot</span><br><br>I liked his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206158#p5206158\">53</a>, it was an odd follow-up of events in my eyes as well. It's a pity his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5201061#p5201061\">6</a>3 tries to pass off everything before that as one big joke. Looks very clumsy. The bits about his \"suspicious winking\" seem to come out of nowhere, possibly revealing some over-worrying about he and his smilies could be percieved. I have no idea what his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210356#p5210356\">84</a> actually means and refers to, and as far as I can tell he never expanded on it. Nevertheless that post felt townie to me. Also his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219910#p5219910\">168</a> felt very townish to me, particularly the part where he welcomes sthar to the game. It shows some confidence towards the greatest contributor to the game that makes me feel he's town. He's a townread of mine, but it's all gut.<br><br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226576#p5226576\">232</a> struck me as very weird. It could be a coincidence, but the fact that he seemed to be able to be summoned by sthar felt as if he's watching and lurking and only posting when someone calls his name. A Candyman of sorts. But as far as I can see, this only happened once, so what I see in Kcda is someone trying a game of mafia, not really liking it, flaking, and when being here mostly taking the piss. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5229796#p5229796\">274</a> is a prime example of him taking none of this seriously. He's not trying. <br>I still have him as a townread though. It's hard to define, but I think as scum he would take the piss in a different way, by defying people on the wrong track and stuff like that. Here he's just \"playing along with town\" by providing ridicculous reads, but it still feels like it comes from a town standpoint.<br>I do hope he will change his attitude at some point.<br><br>Kcda is in my townpile.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">sthar8</span><br>(questions already addressed have not been bolded)<br><br>Every game needs his obvtown and he's the one who gets the part, is what I said earlier, but this is no longer true, though I still consider him town. In the beginning I found his strong support for the RQS bizarre, as well as the, at that point, unexplained vote on Kcda. By page 4 he claimed to be on to something. I'm currently reading some Agatha Cristie's, and it reminded me a lot of the Hercule Poirot character. Smugly sitting in a chair, appearing to have it all worked out, and delivering at the end of the book while showing he was truly onto something all along. Shtar's breakthroughs are not as legendary as Hercule Poirot's (not yet, at least), but they already come quite close. I loved his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216768#p5216768\">148</a>. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> was equally impressive. I do have two questions noted down here:<br>*Why, in the scheme of things, was it important for sthar to wait for Paperscraps in particular? I never saw and still don't see the significance of Paperscraps in this scheme. In post 111 Paperscraps is brought up as a related note, and shortly after he becomes the one unmet condition in order for sthar to divulge his plans. An oddity I'd like cleared up. Hercule Poirot never leaves any loose ends in his logic, so I expect the same of sthar. <br>* This question is a bit less relevant now since sthar himself admitted to that part of the argument against TSO being the weakest, but I found the way he called out TSO for coaching beastcharizard not up to par with the rest of his material. First of all, it is an associative tell that we can only use once either of them flips. Second, I don't think the point he makes in 170 is very convincing when it comes to town TSO not asking beastcharizard to make a case against don_johnson. I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. <br>I'll get to TSO later, but my notes on him don't really agree with the viewpoints presented by sthar8 on TSO in post 161. Given TSO seems to be the main lynch-candidate for today, I imagine some debate. <br>As evident from my earlier comments on Kcda, I also don't agree with sthar's views on that guy. I find it a bit of an anti-climax to see his elaborate plan result in a vote on someone who looks to me as a harmless lurker. But like I said, that's just my gut talking.<br><br>Further notes on sthar confirm my townread on him. However, again some disagreements:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5224370#p5224370\">213</a> you refer to a case on Kcda that is much stronger than the other cases you have, but when referring back to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> I feel this is untrue. What did you feel was so strong about that case? All I really see in that case, I'm sorry to say, is OMGUS, as it pertains his vote on you, and him trying to convince Don to also vote you. Just add a bit of lurking to that and you have a case, true enough, but I don't feel it's a strong case, and defintely not stronger than what you had on the others.</span><br>I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226451#p5226451\">231</a> and also <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227416#p5227416\">250</a> (although that stuff about \"getting a baseline\" is going way over my head).

Feels like too strong of a push on someone he's been calling a teenager, and I fear his judgement may be a bit clouded. This push made him lose his obvtown-position in my eyes, as it could be scum getting impatient after all the effort he put into getting a mislynch. But that's just a hypothesis at the very back of my mind, as I still think sthar is town. But the push rubs me the wrong way, because only earlier sthar agreed to his interactions with him only amounting to a read on what kind of person TSO could be, but less on what his alignment is. I also don't like that last sentence, as that comes down to a policy lynch.<br>I think sthar should push more on beastcharizard again.

It made him come off as a newbie which he is clearly not. It also made him come off as careless, and people coming off as careless usually rub me the wrong way because that means they're actively trying to come across as such. I did like how he mirrored sthar8 at some point (didn't write down which post that was, but it was that vote where he mimicks sthar's vote on Kcda and votes on sthar himself). Somehow it felt like the move of a confident townsperson to treat sthar in such a way. By then sthar wasn't the presence that he is now, but I thought sthar's first few posts already hinted at him being a player not to trifle with too much. Yet Paperscraps did just that. Felt bold.<br>I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216049#p5216049\">139</a>, the \"long awaited response\", in which he correctly wonders why this response was so crucial.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216082#p5216082\">141</a>'s second question I found especially pertinent. <br>His reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219918#p5219918\">169</a> I find less convincing.

Despite the lack of pushing on people, I felt sincere engagement through it all.<br><br>Smudger is in my townpile.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TSO</span><br><br>I'm going to start off by saying I had read the last post before entering this topic, and saw suspicions were raised against him (someone calling him out on his reads being poor). I regretted having read that, as I imagined this would bias me in a stance against TSO, but I have to say my impression of his first posts was very positive. I particularly liked how he defied beastcharizard by not answering his questions. And I also liked his vote on Don Johnson because he self-voted. I think I would have done something similar. I also thought his questions to brjl (Elyse's slot) were very pertinent at the time. (I apologize for not adding post numbers, I didn't write them down, but it's on the first few pages of the topic). My first question mark was raised when he townread Feel It in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206249#p5206249\">54</a>, which felt very out of the blue at the time, as well as his scumread on Kcda just after it. <span class=\"noboldsig\">It's been a while, but could you elaborate on those reads?</span> Like Elyse (again :p) I had a complete opposite reaction: I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't). Though I do not agree with his critisisms on sthar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5215371#p5215371\">134</a> and those coming just after it, they do feel authentic and not forced. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\">142</a>, which I found to be a just criticism toward beastcharizard. <br><br>Reading further I took very few notes on him, also because I got kind of disinterest in the back-and-forth with sthar8. I thought his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222339#p5222339\">205</a> was a very townish response. <br>I put question marks next to two post numbers: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236346#p5236346\">343</a> (which somehow felt as coming off very strong at the time, combined with very little (no), argumentation) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Can you explain why you said what you said in that post?And why you didn't vote him at the time?</span> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5237070#p5237070\">348</a> (which felt petty). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5238820#p5238820\">360</a> are very weak reads indeed.<br><br>When starting this list I felt TSO would also still be in my townpile, but I can't say he is. I don't have as much of a case against him like I feel I do on notreallygood, beastcharizard and don johnson though, but he could be scum. But I don't feel sthar's arguments for him really being scum (hence why I didn't really like the push), so I'd like to wait a bit more when it comes to TSO before making a conclusion.<br><br>Coming up: my thoughts on my three suspects.

A lot of people voting someone who just voted them, would refer to the notion of \"OMGUS\", just to be ahead of the inevitable comments that will follow. Yet, Titus did not bother doing that. It shows to me Titus isn't bothered about how he's being percieved. He's mainly focused on his case and on the reasons for his vote, which in my view are also justified. I also liked the comment on how TSO and sthar were being town vs town. Firstly because I feel the same way, and secondly because it's not a comment I see scum make easily. Scum would be more inclined to join one of the parties in that fight, hoping one of them gets lynched, or just stand back and watch them both devour each other. Titus stepped in and tried to (albeit modestly) defuse the situation. <br>Titus' suspicions (paranoia?) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227294#p5227294\">242</a> also feels very genuine and townish.

I see where she's coming from, as there was something that screamed town when first glancing at Don Johnson's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236003#p5236003\">338</a>, but I don't feel it warrants such a strong townread at all. More on Don Johnson later. <br>The main reason why Elyse has been scrutinzed are her townreads on people who didn't post much. As you'll find I agree on most of those townreads. I think the push on her was bad, and yes, scummy. MAybe Elyse did try to overexplain it (partially because of having been forced to) while much of the townreads were probably also gut, but the reasons for her townreading those people were always clear and not as mysterious as her attackers made it out to be. More on that later.<br><br>Elyse is in my townpile.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kcdaspot</span><br><br>I liked his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206158#p5206158\">53</a>, it was an odd follow-up of events in my eyes as well. It's a pity his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5201061#p5201061\">6</a>3 tries to pass off everything before that as one big joke. Looks very clumsy. The bits about his \"suspicious winking\" seem to come out of nowhere, possibly revealing some over-worrying about he and his smilies could be percieved. I have no idea what his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5210356#p5210356\">84</a> actually means and refers to, and as far as I can tell he never expanded on it. Nevertheless that post felt townie to me. Also his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219910#p5219910\">168</a> felt very townish to me, particularly the part where he welcomes sthar to the game. It shows some confidence towards the greatest contributor to the game that makes me feel he's town. He's a townread of mine, but it's all gut.<br><br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226576#p5226576\">232</a> struck me as very weird. It could be a coincidence, but the fact that he seemed to be able to be summoned by sthar felt as if he's watching and lurking and only posting when someone calls his name. A Candyman of sorts. But as far as I can see, this only happened once, so what I see in Kcda is someone trying a game of mafia, not really liking it, flaking, and when being here mostly taking the piss. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5229796#p5229796\">274</a> is a prime example of him taking none of this seriously. He's not trying. <br>I still have him as a townread though. It's hard to define, but I think as scum he would take the piss in a different way, by defying people on the wrong track and stuff like that. Here he's just \"playing along with town\" by providing ridicculous reads, but it still feels like it comes from a town standpoint.<br>I do hope he will change his attitude at some point.<br><br>Kcda is in my townpile.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">sthar8</span><br>(questions already addressed have not been bolded)<br><br>Every game needs his obvtown and he's the one who gets the part, is what I said earlier, but this is no longer true, though I still consider him town. In the beginning I found his strong support for the RQS bizarre, as well as the, at that point, unexplained vote on Kcda. By page 4 he claimed to be on to something. I'm currently reading some Agatha Cristie's, and it reminded me a lot of the Hercule Poirot character. Smugly sitting in a chair, appearing to have it all worked out, and delivering at the end of the book while showing he was truly onto something all along. Shtar's breakthroughs are not as legendary as Hercule Poirot's (not yet, at least), but they already come quite close. I loved his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216768#p5216768\">148</a>. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> was equally impressive. I do have two questions noted down here:<br>*Why, in the scheme of things, was it important for sthar to wait for Paperscraps in particular? I never saw and still don't see the significance of Paperscraps in this scheme. In post 111 Paperscraps is brought up as a related note, and shortly after he becomes the one unmet condition in order for sthar to divulge his plans. An oddity I'd like cleared up. Hercule Poirot never leaves any loose ends in his logic, so I expect the same of sthar. <br>* This question is a bit less relevant now since sthar himself admitted to that part of the argument against TSO being the weakest, but I found the way he called out TSO for coaching beastcharizard not up to par with the rest of his material. First of all, it is an associative tell that we can only use once either of them flips. Second, I don't think the point he makes in 170 is very convincing when it comes to town TSO not asking beastcharizard to make a case against don_johnson. I could see that happenv ery easily. I myself often ask people to provide cases against the people they consider scummy,b ecause it allows me to catch two flies in one go: assess the accuser and the accused. Of course, it is always better to present your own case, but I don't see the big deal of this \"coaching\"-business. <br>I'll get to TSO later, but my notes on him don't really agree with the viewpoints presented by sthar8 on TSO in post 161. Given TSO seems to be the main lynch-candidate for today, I imagine some debate. <br>As evident from my earlier comments on Kcda, I also don't agree with sthar's views on that guy. I find it a bit of an anti-climax to see his elaborate plan result in a vote on someone who looks to me as a harmless lurker. But like I said, that's just my gut talking.<br><br>Further notes on sthar confirm my townread on him. However, again some disagreements:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5224370#p5224370\">213</a> you refer to a case on Kcda that is much stronger than the other cases you have, but when referring back to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219485#p5219485\">161</a> I feel this is untrue. What did you feel was so strong about that case? All I really see in that case, I'm sorry to say, is OMGUS, as it pertains his vote on you, and him trying to convince Don to also vote you. Just add a bit of lurking to that and you have a case, true enough, but I don't feel it's a strong case, and defintely not stronger than what you had on the others.</span><br>I liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5226451#p5226451\">231</a> and also <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227416#p5227416\">250</a> (although that stuff about \"getting a baseline\" is going way over my head).

Feels like too strong of a push on someone he's been calling a teenager, and I fear his judgement may be a bit clouded. This push made him lose his obvtown-position in my eyes, as it could be scum getting impatient after all the effort he put into getting a mislynch. But that's just a hypothesis at the very back of my mind, as I still think sthar is town. But the push rubs me the wrong way, because only earlier sthar agreed to his interactions with him only amounting to a read on what kind of person TSO could be, but less on what his alignment is. I also don't like that last sentence, as that comes down to a policy lynch.<br>I think sthar should push more on beastcharizard again.

It's true that he's very, euhm, post- and word-efficient in his contributions, but they always do feel like contributions, however short they are. Every post of his shows he's been attentively reading the game, and what he says is usually pertinent, and if not pertinent, at least genuine and natural.

It made him come off as a newbie which he is clearly not. It also made him come off as careless, and people coming off as careless usually rub me the wrong way because that means they're actively trying to come across as such. I did like how he mirrored sthar8 at some point (didn't write down which post that was, but it was that vote where he mimicks sthar's vote on Kcda and votes on sthar himself). Somehow it felt like the move of a confident townsperson to treat sthar in such a way. By then sthar wasn't the presence that he is now, but I thought sthar's first few posts already hinted at him being a player not to trifle with too much. Yet Paperscraps did just that. Felt bold.<br>I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216049#p5216049\">139</a>, the \"long awaited response\", in which he correctly wonders why this response was so crucial.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216082#p5216082\">141</a>'s second question I found especially pertinent. <br>His reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219918#p5219918\">169</a> I find less convincing.

His vote was on TSO, but he moves his vote away from him and onto Titus, while still saying in that same post that TSO is still in his scumteam. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Can you explain this move? Your argumentation for 1. dropping pressure from TSO and 2. increasing pressure on Titus is not clear here.</span>.<br>I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5232018#p5232018\">293</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5235592#p5235592\">333</a>. I like the style of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5200494#p5200494\">332</a>, but again, as with his previous reads, I disagree with big protions of the content.

Despite the lack of pushing on people, I felt sincere engagement through it all.<br><br>Smudger is in my townpile.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TSO</span><br><br>I'm going to start off by saying I had read the last post before entering this topic, and saw suspicions were raised against him (someone calling him out on his reads being poor). I regretted having read that, as I imagined this would bias me in a stance against TSO, but I have to say my impression of his first posts was very positive. I particularly liked how he defied beastcharizard by not answering his questions. And I also liked his vote on Don Johnson because he self-voted. I think I would have done something similar. I also thought his questions to brjl (Elyse's slot) were very pertinent at the time. (I apologize for not adding post numbers, I didn't write them down, but it's on the first few pages of the topic). My first question mark was raised when he townread Feel It in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5206249#p5206249\">54</a>, which felt very out of the blue at the time, as well as his scumread on Kcda just after it. <span class=\"noboldsig\">It's been a while, but could you elaborate on those reads?</span> Like Elyse (again :p) I had a complete opposite reaction: I thought Kcda looked townish after that, and Feel It didn't). Though I do not agree with his critisisms on sthar in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5215371#p5215371\">134</a> and those coming just after it, they do feel authentic and not forced. I also liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5216097#p5216097\">142</a>, which I found to be a just criticism toward beastcharizard. <br><br>Reading further I took very few notes on him, also because I got kind of disinterest in the back-and-forth with sthar8. I thought his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5222339#p5222339\">205</a> was a very townish response. <br>I put question marks next to two post numbers: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5236346#p5236346\">343</a> (which somehow felt as coming off very strong at the time, combined with very little (no), argumentation) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Can you explain why you said what you said in that post?And why you didn't vote him at the time?</span> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5237070#p5237070\">348</a> (which felt petty). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5238820#p5238820\">360</a> are very weak reads indeed.<br><br>When starting this list I felt TSO would also still be in my townpile, but I can't say he is. I don't have as much of a case against him like I feel I do on notreallygood, beastcharizard and don johnson though, but he could be scum. But I don't feel sthar's arguments for him really being scum (hence why I didn't really like the push), so I'd like to wait a bit more when it comes to TSO before making a conclusion.<br><br>Coming up: my thoughts on my three suspects. I don't think I'll be able to do them today though, but we'll see.<br><br>After that I'll respond to the most recent events."}

Entering a topic like I did gives you a certain advantage: you get to see how people's opinions were formed, and if those opinions are congruent with my own, I can't help but feel they have the same mindset.

I think there's always a sense of \"team\" and togetherness when you're scum, on the one hand because they ARE a team with their scumpartners, on the other because they try to smootch up with townplayers and instill this feeling of togetherness.

Already rubbed me the wrong me starting from his very first post, where he showed clear intent to become some sort of townleader. I was wondering whether he was over-enthousiastic town or self-overestimating scum, and I'm pretty much settled on the latter. He's obviously very smart and sensible, but that's exactly what's giving him away. His posts all feel so terribly calculated. He knows just what to say, he has rational explanations for everything, but it just doesn't feel real. <br>Take his RVS for instance. Already in his first post he tries to vote, and in his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5202831#p5202831\">18</a> he RVS'es, but at the same time feels the need to throughly explain that RVS. The \"R\" in \"RVS\" stands for RANDOM, yet already here he wants to come off as this rational, level-headed townleader who thinks everything through. His idea for an RQS seems like a way for him to get towncred, plain and simple. The added value of his questions are, however entertaining, quite limited. I wouldn't have had so much problems with it, if it hadnt been for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5205995#p5205995\">46</a> where he tries to take credit for getting people to talk. This would have happened without him as well. This still leaves open the possibility of a self-centered townie, but I thinkthere's more at play. <br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209195#p5209195\">65</a> sounds unnaturally perfect. He tries to portray how reasonable he is by showing a willingness to change his vote if sthar changes his ways. Also his call for seriousness sounds incredibly forced. It's all part of building up a fa\u00e7ade of level-headedness. <br>In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209388#p5209388\">68</a> he insists on Titus answering his questions, yet only a post later^(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5209438#p5209438\">71</a>), he claims those questions are not crucial and just for background. He agrees they are not of importance in the big scumhunting picture, but then why insist on TSO answering his questions? Towncred. That's all it is. Beastcharizard is not scumhunting. He's towncredhunting. <br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211258#p5211258\">94</a> is also bad. He's overthinking we he could be considered scummy. Not a town mindset at all.<br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5211433#p5211433\">96</a> shows too much defiance, the \"bring it on\"-attitude I don't see coming from town, but again from scum overestimating his manipulative abilities. There's also a soft attack on Don Johnson here. I wonder if there was a follow upo on that but Ih aven't seen it uptil now. So far it looks like a textbook soft-bus. <span class=\"noboldsig\">After reading through the rest of the topic I see there's been no follow-up whatsoever on this soft attack, strengthening my view that beastchrizard and don johnson are both scum.</span><br>In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5212211#p5212211\">107</a> he answers to one of sthar's questions by saying he thinks sthar's vote on him (which is really an FOS at that point) is an RVS. How could he possible believe that after all this time? That answer is just a way to avoid publicized introspection. There's no way sthar's stance towards beastcharziard was random in any way at that point, yet beastcharizard claimed to believe just that. I think this is a blatant lie. <br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213187#p5213187\">115</a> I also don't like. His answer to \"Who are you 3 top scumreads\" is not adequate, as it just mentions two people. Also his statement \"One thing you cannot say is that I don't share information\" is wrong and again fits in with his towncred-hunt. What information has he given? He just answered questions he felt safe in answering dsue to his estimation that he can fool anyone with rational thought and logic, but he forgets to consider that it all feels so wrong.<br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213801#p5213801\">119</a> is terrible. Calling sthar's play horrible and scummy came out of nowhere and is completely uncalled for. It just shows defiance, but no content. Scummy as hell. <br><br>And in general I also feel he's asking questions, but only the obvious ones. Town will make sompe logical fallacies. If someone says \"All apples are green\", beastcharizard will be the one pointing out that some apples are red. True as that may be, he seems to focus on logic too much, trying to spot harmless mistakes in others and portray himself as an untouchable knight in shining armor. I think and I feel and I believe and I'm this close to knowing that this guy is scum. <br><br>Further noting about the above is that you can see in which instances his logic fails him: when attacking people. His strong attack on sthar has no logical basis. He tries to explain it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5225106#p5225106\">218</a>:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@ Sthar8: Everything since the start of the game has been scummy to me. Your tactic makes little sense as well. I understand want to gauge my reaction but don't understand how you picked me out of everyone else. I am assuming it is because I was the most active or the one who asked the question. Secondly you waited till forever to tell us your \"plan\", which i am not totally convinced that is what you were doing. I didn't think I would ever unvote you but now you are just a null read because i truely believe Elyse is scum and is buddying her partners by giving them town reads.<br>I know it isn't my place but TSO is kind of mean when he plays from my experience so what he is doing is null to me. I use mean because I can't think of a better term.<br>Finally, why am I scummy to you?</div></blockquote><br><br>Does any of that stuff warrant the strong wording \"horrible and scummy\"? His first point is little more than \"Why pick on me?\", and thus an OMGUS-reason. His second point, not being convinced that sthar had this plan all along, is a huge stretch. Just like how it was a stretch to think sthar's vote (FoS) on him was RVS at the time. It is simply not logical. There is no way sthar came up with that plan only after the fact. The third is also illogical, he says he's now a nullread (despite all of beastcharizard's (non-)arguments still standing, and calls sthar a nullread BECAUSE Elyse looks scum to him. He's calling someone a nullread based off a read on someone else and completely unrelated.<br>And his final point is the same as his first point. \"Why me?\" <br><br>Also on my further read-through he keeps trying to use his logic skills as some kind of towntell, in order to get credit. Using logic is a towntell if used consistently, but that's not what he's doing. His attacks give him away.<br>Further notes I have, going to include some quotes:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5221530#p5221530\" class=\"postlink\">post 186</a>, beastcharizard wrote:</cite>@Elyse's super wall: <span class=\"noboldsig\">I am just a weird person.</span>  I asked Titus to answer the questions so they had a good transition into the game and they would be following suit on what most everyone else had done.  I would like to say not all of those questions were useless to me.  Sthar8 used the who did you play with one to do a Meta check.  You know, I get the: \"he is trying to act pro-town\" thing every single game I play.  I am not sure if people think I am always scum or if it is scum trying to get my lynched.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">It never crosses people's mind that I might actually be town doing pro-town things.</span>  My comments on Sthar's play didn't come out of nowhere.  He asked in a previous post for people to give their opinion on it so I did.  Now what had changed was they were not posting any better so i decided that they were the greatest threat to the town and that probably was not going to change no matter what they did.  Finally, I think all my posts are going to be \"awkward\", just so you know.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Titus: Your vote on Don looks like pure OMGUS because of the line: \"This vote is utter bullshit.\"</span><br><br>@Elyse: Titus has a grand total of 7 posts but yet he is a town read.  Please explain this to me since I fail to see how you can get a read off 7 posts(was like 5 or 6 when you got your read) but not 11 posts from Don.</div></blockquote><br><br>Several things I found interesting in the quote above: <br>- \"I'm weird.\" \"My posts are going to be awkward.\": A defense trying to explain the bad gut-feeling people may have when reading his posts. But what exactly is so weird about beastcharizard, according to beastcharziard himself? He does not explain. It's just a way of trying to make us believe that any bad gutfeelings we may have is due to his weirdness, and not his scumminess. Beastcharizard is not weird. Or maybe he is, maybe he likes to hang dirty underwear on his left ear, but at least his weirdness is not percievable through his posts. Someone calling himself both a protector of logic and weird also doesn't add up. He's using self-meta, but tries different narratives in order to make a good impression. It shows clear intent, like so many other things, to get towncred. Scumhunting is not apparent in any of his posts.<br>- Remember how I admired Titus for not mentioning the possible OMGUS-aspect of his vote on Don_Johnson, but instead focusing on real reasons? Beastcharziard does the opposite here, and tries to make Titus look bad by ignoring the arguments raised against Don_johnson. A don_johnson, who by the way looked scummy to beastcharizard only moments before. If beastcharizard truly thought don_johnson was scummy, he would have given much more attention to the reasoning Titus clearly had when voting for him. <br>- The way he formulates his question to Elyse. \"Explain this to me\". It's something he does quite often. It allows a position where he doesn't have to do much scumhunting himself, but just critisize other people's doing so, but at the same time he does give off an air of being reasonable. Someone you can reason with. I think the people who have tried to do so over disagreements with him, will have found this not to be the case. <br><br>Going to contnue this wall later, lunchbreak coming up. Most of my contnued notes are more examples of where beastcharizard behaves in the way he does as described above though, so you get the gist of my case. It will just provide more examples.<br><br>Not forgetting about don_johnson and notreallygood, will also post my reads on them,b ut I'm most confident in my scumread on beastcharizard."}

That explanation boiled down to don_johnson being lurky, was it not? That's a suspicion that can easily be lifted as soon as that slot gets active, which all slots do at some point because otherwise they die.<br>I'm glad you admit your 'scumhunting' so far has been rather deplorable. Yes, you are right, it is a 'strange' thing to base your reads on other people on the read of one person, in this case Elyse. Yet, that's the only serious scumhunting you've done in my book. Your sthar-thing was plainly OMGUS, the Elyse thing was simply you not agreeing with her townreads, and now your vote on runnerman? I don't feel you've properly added arguments to that, maybe I missed them, but as he was also scummy to you through some artificial association you see between him and Elyse, I'm not expecting much.<br>And the weird-thing, no, I still don't think you're weird.

At that point his lurking didn't improve much, yet you changed your stance on him completely, as is evident from his complete disappearance from the scumlist you have in this very same post. The only thing don_johnson posted was his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221913#p5221913\">190</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221958#p5221958\">192</a>.<br>This actually brings me on the topic of <span class=\"noboldsig\">don johnson</span> as well.<br>I hated those posts. 190 is a justification for a vote without a reason (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5220324#p5220324\">175</a>) by simply saying what he didn't do. (\"I fabricated a case against him, misrepped, misled, or did anything scummy\". The problem was what he did do: vote Titus without reasons and just after saying that he actually liked Titus. When looking for reasons he refers to my predecessor's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219305#p5219305\">158</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5219323#p5219323\">159</a>, which frankly put, are not adequate in my eyes.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221958#p5221958\">192</a> is lazy, as evidenced by the last paragraph. The rest is a soft defense of beastcharizard and an attack on Titus based on arguments that could just as easily (if not more) have been used against the guy he's just been soft-defending. <br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5213899#p5213899\">124</a> he does a  thing, and will do it several times aftwerwards as well, similar to what beastcharizard often does: he asks people to ask him questions. Again, it's a sort of \"bring it on\"-attitude, but too passive for me to be town. It's easy to tackle questions one by one, hoping to blur the total picture of you being scum. I'm not saying questions are completely useless, but impressions are more important. More difficult to defend against, I grant you that, as it forces you to either change the impression you're giving off (not easy to do so in a way that doesn't look opportunistic) or to defend your actions instead of simply answering questions.<br>don_johnson's alliance talk is ludicrous. Like Smudger said, these forms of alliances occur naturally, through mutual townreads. They do not center around a person who rallies people around him. It looks like a deflection from don_johnson, one way in order to make him look active, in the other to not people have a talk about him, but about his plan. The plan itself is a null, but the way he awkwardly tried to introduce the idea inhere feels like there's been some strategic thinking before it. Didn't like his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5231617#p5231617\">290</a> either. and there's a lot of prod doging in don_johnson's play.

Why so late? <br><br>Back to <span class=\"noboldsig\">beastcharizard</span> (the beautycharizard was a one-time mistake I made when making my first list, which I copied for my case against you, making it a two-time mistake): <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5222186#p5222186\" class=\"postlink\">post 200</a>, beastcharizard wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5213801#p5213801\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a>, beastcharizard wrote:</cite>3a) I have read more than one game from you.

Their predessecor didn't like Titus and Grim seems to think otherwise so conflict of the two also makes me think they are town. Scum would probably keep on about Titus.<br>Kcdaspot1 - Scum<br>Yes I said they weren't a threat but that doesn't make them less scummy. Since they do nothing they can't hurt the village at all, also you can't see if they are buddying anyone if they don't post so waiting for this lynch is best.  They explain no votes what so ever and have done little to nothing.  They promised a post about the game which I have still yet to see. <br>don_johnson - Null<br>They call people for not voting when they themselves haven't voted.  After some \"catching-up\", i call it that because I don't think they read the whole game, they are posting content.  I can't decide wether they are town trying to catch up or scum making excuses.<br>Titus - Null/leaning town<br>I like the substance of their posts.  They seem to be reasonable.  I don't think they have done anything to be definitively town though.<br>Elyse - Null<br>My meta-check on them makes it seem like they are playing between town and scum.  I didn't like thier buddying of people when they did little in the game.<br>runnerman2 - Scum<br>Their vote on me at the beginning was clear WIFOM, saying my vote for scum buddying is dumb because scum wouldn't do that.  The rest of their posts I see no merit in. I already gave my opinion on their earlier post but they still aren't doing much.  They also are just sheeping on my wagon with horrible logic.<br>Paperscraps - Town<br>They are not just throwing around votes.  Their joke vote mimicking sthar's bugged me but not enough to ruin their town read.  They use logic in their posts.<br>sthar8 - Null<br>I still don't like what they did at the beginning but they have done a few town things.  They bulk of their posts is dumb stuff between him and TSO.  Might be another plan to work someone up.<br>Feel It - Null<br>Some logic but also some filler posts.  I can't get a good read on them.  They stick to their Don vote for the most part though.  Constant reads are good in my opinion.<br>notreallygood - Town<br>Their posts are awesome.  They use logic and reason when they do things.  The follow what people say to see if they answer their questions.<br>T S O - Town<br>I know how he plays and this isn't his scum playing.  Before the whole sthar thing I felt they were actually doing good for the village.<br><br>I tried to make it easy to read for you guys.

I found the tone he was using against Elyse unnatural. Showing confidence, a pinch of disdain even, but at the same time oversensitivity over so-called \"subjective and discouteous\" remarks, bringing the argument to a plane where it does not belong: the emotional one. Also by using little snarks like \"you nay not be able to understand that\", he shows intent to play it dirty with Elyse, and I found that uncalled for. <br>The first part, where he shows the pinch of disdain I was talking about, seems like a lesson to Elyse of how to scumhunt. She was doing fine. There was nothing \"unclear\" about her mind when playing Mafia. Asking Elyse to explain Kcda's posts when he didn't even bother to question them in detail shows poor form and intent to use as much as possible against his attacker.<br>He's also dragging in Feel It in his defense in the second to last paragraph, as to somehow discredit Elyse's case on himself by showing where Elyse's case on Feel It fails. <br><br>I also did not like his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5224458#p5224458\">214</a>, and there I saw a link with don_johnson. Here's why: Smudger mistakingly linked notreallygood with the statement: \"Don is scummy.\" (in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5221827#p5221827\">188</a>) I had noticed that mistake and was wondering how people involved would react. As I said before, notreallygood made no such statement in his reads list, but only mentioned a disagreement he had with don_johnson, without adding any read. This reply, he's again avoiding to give a read on don_johnson. Instead of giving or clarifying his read on don_johnson, he answers to this confusion by giving his read on sthar. I found that very odd, and took it as an associative tell between notreallygood and don johnson. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227257#p5227257\">240</a>: Elyse's townread of runnerman put under harsh scrutinization that I found came close to misrepping Elyse's arguments in point 2 he made.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227463#p5227463\">255</a> felt like an enormous stretch. How on earth could runnerman be using Elyse? Elyse came up with her read on runnerman without any direct manipulation by the latter. The townread on runnerman by Elyse came first. That runnerman can use it to his advantage goes without saying, but implying Elyse's townread of runnerman is part of a scheme runnerman was running is just too farfetched. notreallygood looks levelheaded enough, so I wonder what his motivations were to actively try to come up with such a farfetched idea.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5235498#p5235498\">330</a> I had marked down as a negative in my notes, but reading it again it's double. I like the fact he's giving a clear read on don_johnson here, in essence nullifying what I just said before about their connection. I also had posts 351 and 364 marked as negatives, but I can't see why anymore. This hints that I was dealing with a confirmation bias at the time of reading. <br><br>Still would like notreallygood to address issues raised in this post though, I still feel they are relevant."}

Why would I choose to buddy up to Elyse and not someone else, with a stronger position within the topic? Elyse wasn't really in a position where her reads were being taken very seriously. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Only a few people were not fully content with her reads.  She was one of the only people at that time to have posted reads so why not piggy back off of them.  You were just coming into the game with your predecessor doing almost nothing.</span><br>2. Do you realize my reads are NOT exactly the same as Elyse's? Reads Feel It and Don Johnson most notably, for instance. What do you make of these differences?<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Feel It was a weak scum read for Elyse and Don was just null for her.  I am not saying you copied word for word or even the entire thing.  There are just similarities that I find to much to be a coincidence.

If you read my walls, you can clearly see the way my opinions have been formed. In a case of me simply mirroring someone else's reads, how likely do you think it is that I would be able to do that?<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">You could easily decide what you want your reads to be before reading and then go through people's posts and pick out only the things that make them look good or make them look bad.  You then simply use these things as your \"logic\" for having them as said read.</span><br><br>I think that despite your fa\u00e7ade of rationality, which you hold up really well when it comes to general observations and your defense, your cases almost always contain some form of a \"stretch\". It's your flimsy cases against people that really give you away, because they're such a breakaway from the rest of your behavior. And I know why that is. As scum you need to get mislynches. The way you try to do that is by gaining credibility through objective logic, and hope that will automatically spill over on your cases. But it does not. Your cases feel constructed and don't seem like you really believe in them.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">How don't they seem like I believe in them?  I am not flip-flopping my votes or my reads really for that matter.  I haven't taken anyone from scum to town or town to scum during this day either.

No. They have barely even stepped up the activity now.  But now they are at least posting content.

Yes, you are right, it is a 'strange' thing to base your reads on other people on the read of one person, in this case Elyse. Yet, that's the only serious scumhunting you've done in my book. Your sthar-thing was plainly OMGUS, the Elyse thing was simply you not agreeing with her townreads, and now your vote on runnerman? I don't feel you've properly added arguments to that, maybe I missed them, but as he was also scummy to you through some artificial association you see between him and Elyse, I'm not expecting much.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">You are already trying to discredit any reads I have on people.

I'm not so sure now.  <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I just looked them up and assume you're referring to those: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=JEEP%27s_Tells_for_Finding_Mafia\">http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?tit ... ding_Mafia</a><!-- m -->. I don't see which ones Kcda is guilty of. Possible the wagon-tell? But that's it right? The \"jeep tells\" sounds very convincing, but only if several of them apply.</div></blockquote>Yes, those.  If you didn't know what they were, it would have been more productive to ask than to simply ignore their impact on the case.  In my experience, Jeep tells are generally indicative so long as the player is unaware of them. I saw more than one of those in kcda's behavior when I voted him.  <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Fair point, that's why I'm hoping Kcda will change his stance towards this game. But I don't need to tell you town lurks as well, depsite what jeep or anyone else is saying. Kcda's lynch feels too random to me, I'm sorry. There's something, I'll grant you that, but not enough, and not more than on other players.</div></blockquote> It <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> more than on the other players when it was proposed.  Given developments since, I'd agree that there are better cases.  Though I will point out that I've heard \"town lurks too\" in defense of scum more times than I can count.  Obviously town lurks too.  But only scum gain advantage from it, and nullifying that advantage is protown.<br>You said that my case on kcda was \"just OMGUS and lurking,\" I've pointed out that there was more to it than that and further discussion on the matter will not be protown.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Obviously. Claiming I believe it is is insulting.</div></blockquote> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Feels like too strong of a push on someone he's been calling a teenager,</div></blockquote><br>This implies that the reason the push is too strong is because of TSO's age.  What was the intent?<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>But you said yourself in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5229441#p5229441\">267</a> that his defensiveness is due to him being in his teens.</div></blockquote><br>I also say that that makes it a null tell, and I'm confused as to why we're still discussing it, since that was the last time I mentioned it.  Yet somehow you (collective, not singular) are ignoring all of the other things I've said in order to bring it up, and I cannot fathom why.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You then later on proceed to say which arguments still hold up against him despite this finding: \"mudslinging thing, or refusing to have any reads, or even the coaching\". I never believed in the coaching-argument in the first place to be honest, but like you said, that was the weak point of your argument. Yet, if you realize it's weak, why insist on it?</div></blockquote><br>-It's good to see that you actually see my other points.  This is the first time that someone other than myself has acknowledged anything but the nulls and the coaching thing.<br>- You realize that I've only discussed his coaching in direct response to someone asking questions about it, right?  I don't see how I'm \"insisting.\"<br>- If you're asking why I don't drop the coaching thing altogether:  Because I still find it indicative, and I'm not tailoring my arguments to your personal opinion.  You're allowed to disagree with me, but that doesn't mean I have to change my side.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I grant you the other points. Don't take this as me defending TSO, as I've said myself in my overview, I too, see reasons to find him scummy.</div></blockquote>Then let's lynch him!  How do you feel about TSO doing all the things others are getting scumread for, but somehow managing to not draw any fire for it? <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think  the decision for today should be this: TSO or beastcharizard.At least that's my personal conviction, both people have decent cases against them I think.<br></div></blockquote> I can get behind this, obviously.  I'd prefer TSO because I think he's more able to avoid attention on later days than charizard is.  I also think there is a chance (though slim) that charizard's play is the result of him just legitimately enjoying being seen as a town leader, regardless of alignment.<br><br>Also TSO's last was a massive misrepresentation."}

His vote on me is reactionary and not prompted by actual scum hunting. T S O seems to be a bit on tilt since his exchange with sthar.) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Would I be ok with lynching T S O today?</span> He still seems like angry town to me. This decision is also tentative on his future posts and if he actually makes a case against me (this would be a townie thing for him to do).<br><br>- <span class=\"noboldsig\">Don</span> (Reading through his ISO, he doesn't have a singular case against me, but has posted some little things here and there against me. Nothing to warrant an actual response towards. We don't see eye to eye on some things and I have called him out on some questionable plays he is trying to make. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5245749#p5245749\">488</a> this post is good and probably the best reason by him to be voting me today. The point about today being mostly a guessing game with who to lynch is very true. I am curious as to why he would be voting me when he scum reads Elyse and T S O's vote is suspicious.) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Would I be ok with lynching Don today?</span> No. (BUT PAPERSCRAPS YOU JUST SAID YOU WOULD BE OK WITH LYNCHING DON IN YOUR PREVIOUS POST, OMG CONTRADICTION!!! YOU ARE SCUM!!11!!) At that point in time I hadn't read through his ISO in-depth in awhile. We don't agree on a lot of things, but Don flipping scum would surprise me at this point.<br><br>- <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span> (Voting me on a gut read, which I don't have a problem with. Playing mafia with only logic will not win you games, you have to throw some gut into the mix to do well. I do say into the mix though and not relying completely on gut. Elyse's gut read is wrong. Two options I can see here: 1. Elyse is town and really does have a gut read on me as scum. 2. Elyse is scum and using this \"gut read\" to vote me without seeming too scummy and not having to actually make a case. I could see Elyse being scum. I can also see Elyse being town. I could make a case for both alignments. Without any meta I am stuck on my Elyse read until the game develops further. Her motivations won't be apparent until we see some flips.) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Would I be ok with lynching Elyse today?</span> No. I like her agressive style and if she is town, I believe she will be an asset in the later game. I wouldn't be ok with lynching Elyse at this time.<br><br>My town circle right now: <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #408000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">sthar</span></span>,<span style=\"color: #408000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> Smudger</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #408000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Feel it</span></span></span>.<br>Who I would be against lynching but not in my town circle circle: <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #40BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Grimgroove</span></span></span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">beastcharizard</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">don_johnson</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span>.<br>Who is null to me circle: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Titus</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">T S O</span>.<br>Who I would be ok with lynching circle: <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Kcda</span></span>,<span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> runnerman</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">NRG</span></span></span>.<br><br>runnerman, Kcda and NRG don't really strike me as a scum team and there is possibly/probably a 4th scum. I am a bit stuck on who to vote, so many starting days end in a mis-lynch. There is plenty of material against NRG and I could hop on that, but Elyse's point about some many people being ok with it is good. Lynching runnerman or Kcda at this point is meh. Kcda is active lurking and runnerman is being replaced so that lynch would just be bad form, until his replacement gets a chance at redemption. GUYS LOOK AT ME BEING ALL INDECISIVE AND ON THE FENCE.<br><br>I am getting a bit antsy here at the end of this day as I believe a lot of everyone else is. We all want to see some blood, so we can move on and have some solid information to go from. I am not going to let it be my blood if I have my way. By the end of tonight I will vote some one and have some sort of a case made. This is where I stand right now. To be continued..."}

I don't think they have done anything scummy at this point in the game and their reference to a game from two years ago doesn't seem to me to be something scum would dig that deep for.

I had previously been voting with Kc and ice(I think its ice). I haven't at any time \"pretended\" or \"lied\" or anything like that with regards to my activity level. so imo, its pretty obvious that I am supporting the Titus wagon based on the case that was presented by others. <br><br>to wit: if you have specific questions elyse, feel free to ask.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>elyse wrote:</cite>Titus is a townread because:<br>I liked his opening post<br>He urged sthar to stop gambitting and scumhunt<br>He pointed out notreallygood's fencesit reads list<br>His vote on don johnson is good.</div></blockquote><br><br>his opening post is null. in your face, but null. <br>a better way to urge sthar8 to stop gambitting would have been to vote him.  why does he think that sthar8 is town?<br>again, he took no action against the \"fencesitter\". just called him out.<br>his vote on me is omgus. nothing more. he accuses me of trying to justify my vote on his wagon.

I find it very town.</div></blockquote><br><br>because its easy. it wasn't like beast claimed that the questions were for scumhunting purposes. it was a conversation starter. the response could just as easily have come from scum as from town in my opinion. its an easy first vote.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>elyse wrote:</cite>I guess you could be right here. Hmmm. Maybe it was obvious to Titus? Or if Titus is scum, he would know sthar's alignment and if he was town, would know he was gambitting?

I honestly don't think there is scum in that group.</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ which clearly explains part of how the alliance was chosen and clearly states that despite my own opinions, I am not taking some sort of ridiculously static stance on who may or may not be scum. at that time, beast was not a scum read. this was not based on an in depth read, but based on interactions and my skimming.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>sure. its an alliance, not the third reich. thing is, we stop focusing on our alliance mates as much as possible and really delve into who is scum in the other group. if you think someone in the alliance is scum, try and use that to your advantage while hunting their partner(s).</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ more explanation of how the strategy works and a clear indication that scum may be part of the alliance.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>no ones going for the alliance. so whatevz.

I still haven't read up. <br><br>I really don't think beast or elyse are scum. can someone paraphrase those cases?</div></blockquote><br><br>at this point in the game I state that I don't think elyse or beast are scum. this is still not based on an in depth read of the game. if this is the post you are referring to, or if you think it is simply scummy for someones opinion to change then I guess there will be no argument here. I am guilty of thinking at some point that beast might be town. i'm not sure how that is scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>but whatevz.

You have done not much since you claimed and I am not happy with your interaction or lack of it with TSO. You say you trust him and yet how could you possibly know where he is aligned. You have very little direct interaction with him and from what I have found, besides what could possibly be regarded as a distancing move by the early vote, all you have seemed to do is defend him. So you claim tracker, ok there could well be one in the game, but obviously, as there has been no counter, it would seem you maybe legit. At least I thought so until this TSO issue.

A day one lynch with very little opposition should be sending some warning signals to the brain. The majority of players are on board with lynching runnerman, or willing to compromise on him. Yes, he is scummy. So is mafia bussing him today? Or he is just a weaker town player that is succumbing to all the pressure on him? I am thinking the latter now. You can believe whatever you want for me defending him here, but with everyone \"willing\" to lynch him I am thinking he is town. I have much more confidence in Feel It flipping scum than over runnerman at the moment.<br><br>Let us visit the last few posts from Feel It:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5274502#p5274502\" class=\"postlink\">post 777</a>, Feel It wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5274304#p5274304\" class=\"postlink\">post 773</a>, Paperscraps wrote:</cite>runnerman was just put at L-1.

This town has discussed and dragged itself through so many circles I'm honestly quite bored and confused and we really need a lynch to move this game forward.

Also your vote and scumread is mostly just butthurt I nearly got you lynched.</div></blockquote><br><br>I agree that you can talk yourself out of good lynches the more time goes one, but using this as the sole reason to vote some one is bad as town or scum. I agree that lynches provide information to help the town move forward, but again using this as the sole reason to lynch some one is bad. Feel It provides no reasons as to why he thinks runnerman will flip scum here. The last line isn't true.

This that certain phrases and ways of expressing things become 'flavour of the month\".  In this game it would appear that the defence against an attack is to accuse the attack of being weak, this goes for highlighting others play.  But this, \u00e4ttitude\" invariably exists more strongly through D1 and some of D2, then it gets down to true work by those still in the game. <br><br>So in that vane I see you are trying to push attention away from yourself and runnerman by pulling in a \"weak\"argument for Feel It.

And though I normally don't jump to the defence of others in this way, with runnerman being MIA, someone has to do it.<br><br>\"playing the I am new card\" - ISO runnerman and look at his first 8 posts. Not once did he play the newbie card. He never even mentioned being a new player, he even talked about currently being and having been in other games. Is anyone actually still reading this shit? Beastcharizard is maknig things up. First I was going to respond to this argument by it being hypocritical (what with beastcharizard constantly playing the \"I'm weird\"-card), but it's even worse than that, it's a blatant misrep. Once, in his ninth or tenth post (in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5227354#p5227354\">245</a>, runnerman mentions \"not being used to this kind of play\", which is not the same as \"playing the I'm new here card in his first 8 posts\". <br>Tell me beastcharizard, what was the scummy thing he did at that point? You're saying he played this card to dismiss the scummy stuff he did, but why play that card if there is no scummy stuff to be dismissed? You did not mention this.<br>\"OMGUS\" - calling it OMGUS. The reasoning behind his vote on you was perfectly sound. \"sounds more like an argument that aims to convince others not so much something you actually believe\" were his words, and in fact it's the same thing I'm thinking when reading your case on him. Even if it was OMGUS, it's a null tell in most cases.<br>The Titus-thing: Reads can change, again an OMGUS element, and while his comment on Titus having it in for him wasn't intellectually sound, it's not scummy. It's an emotional response that can come from any alignment. Calling it \"an accusation in order to discredit\" is tying rational tactics to something that was blatantly emotional.<br>T S O-thing: Didn't get that. Are you saying T S O didn't act scummy? Or did runnerman? T S O in all fairness has been a difficult read up to a late stage of the game, given his strong and sole involvement with sthar. <br>Wanting a policy lynch: This is what half of the people on the wagon you're currently pulling are doing. A compromise lynch is a form of policy lynch. Both come with this feeling of \"meh, let's do it then\" and are usually coupled with flimsy reasons nobody really believes in. Too much doubt. Where did you get that runnerman wanted a policy lynch though? I cannot find it.<br>no content: I disagree. And you disagree yourself, otherwise you wouldn't be able to make a case of this extent against him.<br><br>Conclusion: The case on runnerman is a load of bull.<br><br>I want to lynch beastcharizard so much <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">"}

I am just using common sense. i'm not going to waste my time investigating others on day 1 when we have two viable lynch candidates who have done nothing, imo, to show that they are townies. if you want to look into the pr claims, then let's do that. I doubt all three are real. imo, titus' is the most likely fake for a number of reasons.<br><br>what possible power role do you think titus could have which would confirm townbeast to the rest of us if beast does as titus suggests? there is only one I can think of, and it would be a waste of an otherwise possibly fruitful investigation, so its not very protown. and, the role I was thinking of does not fit with what I have read so far. (I will explain more once you think this through yourself).<br><br>also, if titus is town, then it would appear that nrg or beast are fakeclaiming, meaning scum would imo, most likely nk titus because his role is unknown, whereas with the other two, there are other ways to deal with. tracker and gunsmith do not reveal alignments, so their results are not definitive. granted they are still powerful, but imo, scum would fear what they don't know over what they do, and chances are that if titus is town, one of beast or nrg are scum. which means scum probably only has one pr to deal with other than titus. so I don't know. it just seems to me that not only was titus' suggestion hugely anti-town, the factr that he hasn't full claimed has left him plenty of wiggle room to set up a good cover story later in the game. <br><br>on that note, what is there to doubt about a vanilla claim? when a lynch candidate claims vanilla, the chances of them being a town pr are effectively zero unless they are extremely stupid. so I see no reason to doubt said claim. certainly plenty of reason to doubt alignment, but the claim? no. so I don't really understand what you are saying there. <br><br>1) of the three pr claims, which do you doubt most and why?<br>2) what possible power role do you think titus could have which would confirm townbeast to the rest of us if beast does as titus suggests?<br>3) \"You constricitng the lynchpool to two possibilities based on two VT claims feels like scum securing a mislynch.\" - there is no evidence imo that either feel it or runner would be a mislynch. in fact, I pointed a pretty glaring contradiction in runnermans posting that no one seems to have addressed. if you think they are both mislynches then the onus is really on you to show me why. if we lynch one of them and they flip town, then you might have some leverage with this angle tomorrow, but until then I really don't see it. I am more than happy to take my chances with one of them and let the pr situation play out at night, then take a second look at this game once we have some decent perspective. second guessing everything now just seems like a waste of time. imo, I prefer shorter games(easier to keep up, easier to sift through, etc.) so I think there is plenty of info in thread already. extending the day at this point seems unneccesary. TSO is not shouting scum in my book. certainly not enough to warrant further investigation at this time. you know, I could easily say \"grim, your persistence in avoiding the wagons of runner and feel it seem like scum trying to help their buddie(s) avoid getting lynched.\" you see, the argument can be made, but it can't possibly be substantiated without the concrete evidence of a flip or two."}

I had previously been voting with Kc and ice(I think its ice).

I honestly don't think there is scum in that group.</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ which clearly explains part of how the alliance was chosen and clearly states that despite my own opinions, I am not taking some sort of ridiculously static stance on who may or may not be scum. at that time, beast was not a scum read. this was not based on an in depth read, but based on interactions and my skimming.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>sure. its an alliance, not the third reich. thing is, we stop focusing on our alliance mates as much as possible and really delve into who is scum in the other group. if you think someone in the alliance is scum, try and use that to your advantage while hunting their partner(s).</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ more explanation of how the strategy works and a clear indication that scum may be part of the alliance.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>no ones going for the alliance. so whatevz.

I still haven't read up. <br><br>I really don't think beast or elyse are scum. can someone paraphrase those cases?</div></blockquote><br><br>at this point in the game I state that I don't think elyse or beast are scum. this is still not based on an in depth read of the game. if this is the post you are referring to, or if you think it is simply scummy for someones opinion to change then I guess there will be no argument here. I am guilty of thinking at some point that beast might be town. i'm not sure how that is scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>dj wrote:</cite>but whatevz.

I didn't get that vibe at all. there seems to be a good bit of support for the beast scum read.<br><br>there can be a case made against beast or elyse based on what I have been reading. and I am taking note of associative tells as well, but bottom line is that they could both be town. I doubt they are both scum, but its possible.<br><br>also, i'd compromise on a beast or paperscraps lynch at this time. maybe runnerman. elyse would be a long shot.<br><br>if beast is scum, i'm guessing notreallygood is town and beast is just trying to drag him down here. my gut townread on notreally can be dealt with later, but if beast is town, I just don't understand pointing to something like this as \"logic\".</div></blockquote><br><br>^^ this is some of what you missed.</div></blockquote>"}

You were getting heat, and you decided to turn your play around.</div></blockquote><br><br>or, I was getting flak for not participating, so I decided it would be in town's best interests for me to participate. <br> <br><blockquote><div><cite>grim wrote:</cite>I also don't like the way you're trying to fish more out of Titus at this stage.

Additional reading of him reveals that he is perfectly capable of scumhunting and that he recognizes fallacy when he sees it, even if he doesn't know the proper name.</div></div></div><br><br>I will not be arguing these with anyone, especially TSO.  If you don't agree, I don't care.  If you assert that any of these is the reason I want TSO lynched, then you're stupid.<br><br><br>Reasons that TSO is likely scum:<br><br>1. He's not scumhunting.  He's following along with others' cases.<br>      -His vote for runner came after FeelIt, Paper, Titus, Elyse and Beast had expressed suspicion of runner.<br>      -His vote for NRG came after Grim, FeelIt, Paper, and Elyse had already voted for NRG<br>      -He voted Paper, then unvoted without a case.  Of course, only after Elyse and Don expressed suspicion of paper.<br>      -His attack on don came after FeelIt, Paper, Smudger, and NRG had criticized the same post.<br>Not once has TSO led the push against anyone. Not once has TSO presented a case against these people as scum.  He promised cases on paper and NRG, but they never materialized. TSO doesn't need to expend any effort finding scum because he is scum and he knows who his partners are.  He's just floating along while the town picks their lynch.  Despite having never presented a case, he's FOS'd almost every player in the game to keep his options open.  He's twice admitted to not actively reading the thread.<br><br>2. He's looking for an easy lynch<br>     -See above.<br>     -Despite his failure to hunt scum, he insists that others present real cases.<br>Notice that all of the attacks TSO has committed himself to share something.  He won't vote someone unless multiple other players are already voting or FOSing that person.  He's not looking to lynch scum, he's looking to lynch quickly.  And since he's not presenting any cases, he can't be blamed if one of these lynches hits a townie.<br><br>3. Active Lurking<br>     -<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5288419#p5288419\" class=\"postlink\">He'll comment on people's activity.</a><br>     -<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5273910#p5273910\" class=\"postlink\">He'll argue subjective interpretation</a><br>     -In his ISO you'll find him defining terms, discussing semantics, and avoiding prods among other effectively empty posts.<br>TSO may not be contributing anything of worth, but he's also not getting prodded.  Whenever he isn't aggressively defending himself or following along with someone else's wagon, he has an empty post or two to throw down.  He has the time to generate some content, but as scum he lacks the inclination.<br><br>4. Manipulative language<br>     -In 972 he horse laughs my argument by misrepresenting my discussion with Smudger.  This ignores the actual assertion that he's using ad mis as an AtE to keep people from seriously considering my case against him.<br>     -In 860/861 he implies that everyone should know that he doesn't support a FeelIt lynch, despite his previous two mentions of FeelIt's alignment being that he \"didn't like the jump on the charizard wagon\"  and that he was \"possible scum\"<br>     -In 846 he misrepresents Grim's attack on him, asserting that since he \"proved\"  that FeelIt's vote was scummier (subjective anyway), Grim was wrong about TSO being scum.  What Grim actually said was that TSO's vote on runner was scummy, and that it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">might</span> be the scummiest.<br>     -In 795 he frames my refusal to argue with him as bait for another argument.<br>     - In 793 he asserts that he's called runner scummy the whole game.  But his only mentions of runner before his vote are a criticism of a post and TSO's classification of runner's alignment as \"eh,\"  which as far as I can tell isn't a word for \"scum.\"  Runner hasn't ever been in TSO's suspect list.<br>     -In 452 he claims that I'm trying to start an argument with him, three pages after I ignored his question designed to provoke an argument about something irrelevant.<br>     -I'm sure you can find more, this is a pervasive pattern.<br>TSO is using word choice to characterize himself as a victim on defense, and to change the facts to fit his ideal circumstances.  He keeps asserting things that have no basis in reality and just assuming that nobody is fact checking him.  The single most frustrating thing about this game so far is that most everyone appears to be taking what he says at face value. Town has no need to warp facts, TSO is simply concerned with how he's being perceived.  This is a major scumtell.<br><br>I'm very tired after a long day and I'm putting this post up without proofreading as thoroughly as I normally do.  If anything is incomprehensible, please point it out and I'll correct it.<br><br>If anyone (other than TSO) has questions, I'd be happy to answer them.<br><br>What do you say guys?  How about we lynch TSO instead?"}

I think a player like TSO is better off caught with associative tells, because the playstyle is really null(unless you produce meta to counter it). when you look at bowser's entry into this game, they post their reads as though they read the thread pretty closely. their only comment on TSO is \"scummy scum scum\"(and this is when the TSO wagon had just picked up momentum.) bowser had a couple wagons to choose from(all pretty decent ones), but chose to jump onto TSO. TSO is THE weakest player among us. when I called bowser on this case, they threw their hands up in the air with a giant AtE. then complained that everyone was sheeping me. ME? no one has sheeped me all day. no one has been even listening to anything I've been saying. what this tells me is that bowser did not read as closely as they made it appear to. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the original wagons was on bowser's scumbuddy, but I am more confident in the bowser vote atm and really have no time to investigate which wagon it may have been with deadline just a few hours away. Kc was a gut town read of mine early on but it was seriously flimsy, and they never turned on. bowser comes in, drops a vote on the weakest player when the wagon is gaining steam, does this in a paltry catch up post which gives the appearance that they read closely, then complains about people sheeping dj. come on man. stop dicking around. sthar's case on TSO is a policy lynch when you really read it. TSO never makes his own case? so what? he never had to. not all townies contribute the way we want them to. that doesn't make them scum. I admit I could be wrong, but bowser is setting off all the scum bells. TSO is way more inconclusive imo."}

Thus we are accepting that NGR has given us a read on Feel It, we should believe that read, in fact we should believe NGR is who he claims to be. NGR was on many early scum lists or under suspicion for some time until he claimed.  Now he effectively clears himself and Feel It by stating Feel It does not have a gun?  I understand fully that there is a probability that this is correct, but it is strange so many have accepted it without question,  Feel It may not have a gun, does not mean he is town, NGR maybe not be who he purports to be, there are possibilities still in play here that leave an area of doubt with regard to both.<br><br>I am also somewhat startled that Beast would follow Grim?  there was no indication IMO that Grim was suspected by Beast of being scum, I would have thought that anyone from Huntress.

They're not 100% off the hook, but I'd rather look at a pool with a certainty that there is scum inside it than not.  When we catch some scum, then we can reevaluate our \"nearly confirmeds\"  to see if they fit as partners.<br><br>Aside:  I did not \"allude\" to there being a chance that Feelit is scum; I explicitly stated it.  He is almost certainly not a serial killer, and from what we know of the setup a mafia doc would essentially be a gf with a different name anyway.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5317037#p5317037\" class=\"postlink\">post 1201</a>, Smudger wrote:</cite>I would also like to comment on the discussion surrounding Sthar and his tunnelling of TSO.

How is that scummy?<br>2. I did so because I thought that TSO might self-hammer to keep Huntress's reads out of the thread.  She could then be nightkilled without ever getting a chance to contribute.  This happened to me in a game very recently, so it's been on my mind.  I wish I had put my vote back, and I intended to but you all got distracted by don and feelit's silliness and I missed my window.  Honestly, I'm glad grim was active to keep you all on track.<br>3.  How does that make me look town? At all?<br>4. I did achieve TSO's lynch, and I'm glad I did.  His play was intensely anti-town, and all available information indicated that he was playing for a different win condition.  Did he turn out to be scum?  No, he was just playing significantly below his potential.  I was wrong about his motivations, which happens sometimes.  Would I lynch him again if I had it to do over?  You bet your ass.  He was the play, given the information that we had.<br>5. So if I'm scum, then who do you think my partners are?<br><br>@ Everyone- How do you guys feel about Smudger?

First off that reply was off the cuff and rather flippant, for which I apologise.  The reason you appeared in the listing was actually a typo from me, and I was in a foul mood when I replied to Feel It.  You have a claim on the table that is only proved by the fact that Don is dead, so? that proves you had a kill action, or do you still have one?  for now I will go with the flow.. <br><br>(am I allowed to do that? go with the flow? or is that too cautious and flexible? [/sarcasm])<br><br>Sthar, you ask me would I lynch Elyse, <br><br>Well is that because primarily she began this game strong, and was fairly active posting content and asking relevant questions that showed active scum hunting to now, where her posts have thinned out in content and are primarily not full on hunting? If you want me to base a vote on that, then my question to you would be why? <br><br>  If it is to gather information to actually narrow down the lynch pool, effectively the possibility of a mis-lynch then no, not at this time. In particular when I am beginning to think that both Bowser or Huntress are possibly more qualified to give us a better result if one of them is lynched.  Why those two? well both are replacements into slots that I was suspicious of and neither has done anything to change that POV, although Huntress is actually more active."}

I don't care what questions you have for me. You are grasping on my lynch.. Beast is most likely mafia and suggesting he isn't means you aren't reading the game or you are mafia, in my eyes. Titus' claim lines up with there being two deaths and no counter-claims to vigi. There probably being a gunsmith is too much to not think Titus is town at this point. Beast's track makes zero sense. It is almost as if his \"tracking\" IS KILLING PEOPLE.<br><br>Mafia are always one meta-level deeper than town, but Grim goes hard on Beast. Grim dies. Draw whatever conclusion you want.<br><br>Elyse hasn't really done anything at this game. Her votes have no convinction or backing behind them. I will lynch any of you(Beast-Elyse-Huntress), but Bowser is basically saying he isn't going to be playing at all anymore. That isn't cool at all. His slot before he came in was scummy. He is a great lynch. It is both policy and a read. I don't think there are enough people right now to get behind the Elyse lynch.<br><br>Huntress you are trying to hard, but that isn't enough right now to put you over Bowser."}

I also note that this seems to be a trait of yours to react to people who may raise concerns against you by throwing a vote at them.  You are actually quite subtle about it as you do not immediately react, leaving it a few posts before doing so.  Is that a bad thing, not really, but seems somewhat unwarranted in my mind.  <br><br>with regard to your SCREAMING you had a kill action and was going to waste Don, I have to admit I can't see it and I have reread you a few times now.  You mention your soft claim, again I can't see it.

All I can see is off the wall whacky and rather inane post content from KDCA and Bowser, A handful of votes without much reason behind them.

I think the confirmed towns are smart enough to see the plan through to it's conclusion.

Given the silly amount of success you have had, I would have claimed that I'd used the heal on the wrong investigator and that I'd be using my own one-shot investigation tonight to guarantee caught scum tomorrow.  I mean, we win anyway, but why not play for all the beans?<br><br>My last question to you was intended to suggest that course of action.<br><br>@beast-  We're at a point now where it's ok to discuss your day 1 play.  I think your main problem came in two areas:<br>1.  You were attempting to be a town leader.  This is not something you should be doing with an investigative role.  It will either put you into the spotlight and force your claim, or you will look like an attractive nightkill, neither of which you want.  You spent a lot of time trying to make others see you as town, which again attracts attention.  The ideal investigative role will scumhunt just hard enough to stay off the radar, then present a shitload of confirmed info all at once.  If you do that, then it doesn't matter how everyone else thinks of you because what you tell them is testable.<br>2.  You mistook \"weird\" for \"scummy\" day 1, which is excusable from anybody EXCEPT an investigative role.  As a cop-like, your scum reads should be on legitimately scummy players and your town reads on the towniest.  Remember that your role has a mechanism for testing weird, unexplained, and null players.  If they're hard to read, they make good investigations which makes them a waste of your time during the day phase.  <br><br>Basically, your normal playstyle didn't work well with the goals of your role.  Rather than alter your play to fit your goals, you tried to do both at once which came off as forced and artificial to those of us who were legitimately scumhunting.<br><br>The random question thing was a nice touch.  Its a really obvious coptell, but only in hindsight which is the best kind of coptell.<br><br>@ everybody- I'm ready to end the day when y'all are.  I've said my bit and I'm pretty sure we've got this one."}

As for the joat claim, I thought that if you really had that role you would have kept quiet about it at least for a day or two so it didn't seem very likely.

I thought he might be playing a shit game to disguise scum-laziness, turns out it was just regular laziness.  If I had it to do again, I'd still lynch him but I'd argue with <span style=\"font-style: italic\">him</span> about it less and with everyone else about it more.<br><br>Grim- I think you did better than you think you did.  I look forward to playing with you again.<br><br>Bowser and Huntress- Tough luck that you guys got screwed by the people you replaced.  I think you had to basically out yourselves just to stay alive.  You did save the game from being dreadfully boring, though, and I appreciate it greatly.  Huntress, it was just as much a pleasure as I remember <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> <br><br>Smudger-  If you hadn't tried to manipulate me, I might never have cottoned on to you.  Also, you should have recognized that there was no way I'd <span style=\"font-style: italic\">ever</span> get lynched over the TSO thing, and the post where you tried to make that an option was almost a confession.  Your day 1 was phenomenal, and you might have made it to endgame if you had just kept your head down a little longer.<br><br>Don- Your approach is unorthodox, but I think it could be a lot of fun.  I will note, however, that you had all three scum in your \"town bloc\"<br><br>Titus-  I've said before how crazy risky that was, but congratulations!  That was skillfully done.  You were super lucky that I wasn't scum and that there wasn't a mafia roleblocker, though.  Fun fact:  the day you claimed JOAT I was considering a fake doc claim on the faith that you could solve the setup a day faster if I got shot.  The only thing that stopped me was the possibility that there might be a real doc who would misunderstand my purpose and counter.  Hope to team up with you again!<br><br>Elyse- I don't think I've ever disagreed with someone so much and still read that person as intelligent town.  I'll be happy anytime we get to play on a team, because I think you see all the stuff I don't.<br><br>Paper-  That was a great first game on MS.  In my experience, games on this site are a little more subtle and strategic than games elsewhere.  You'll get the hang of it; you're certainly smart enough.  <br>As promised-  Huntress couldn't claim a PR on the last day.  If she were counterclaimed, we had enough lynches left to test both claims.  And even if she weren't, her claim would be the weakest just because the others had been given time to prove their townieness with night actions.  Her only hope was to put me back on the list of suspicions and then open the lynch pool to include FeelIt or Titus.  If she had claimed a PR, I would have seriously considered counterclaiming just to get her killed.<br><br>FeelIt-  Keep on doing what you're doing, but please always be town in games with me.  You as scum would make for a headache.<br><br>NRG- Excellent picks.  You and Titus won this game.  Thanks <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br><br>Beast-  Good job with your later play.  Remember also that is is a Really Bad Thing for the scum to know who the PRs are targeting at night.  I'd be happy to play with you again."}
