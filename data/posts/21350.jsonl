Some witnesses claimed he shouted before entering the alley; others said that he sprinted into the darkness waving his arms erratically perhaps he did <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">both</div>. Regardless of the beginning, the scenarios end with the same conclusion - brief intense flashes of light followed by echoing bangs erupting from the alley pulling the unreliable witnesses out of their drunken stupor and into clarity. Every witness claims they saw no one leave the alley  from the direction Jonathan entered. The only noise they heard afterwards were cries of panic and their own frantic footsteps on the pavement. It wasn&#8217;t until they had come across Jonathan&#8217;s lifeless bullet ridden body did they realize the reason for his fateful detour. A woman&#8217;s body lay limp against the wall, her blouse covered in blood. She was shot in the head.

Only paraphrase in your own words. You may quote from the sample role PM.  As a corollary, do not impersonate the Mod.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">5.)</div> This is a closed setup, which means the only roles you will know in advance are your own and that of any other player I mention in your role PM. All other role information is secret, including how many players with a certain role exist and even if the role exists in the first place.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">6.)</div> Nights will last at least 48 hours to 72 hours, or until a replacement is found.  Day One will last at most three weeks.  Each other game Day will last at most two weeks.  Exigent circumstances may result in an extension.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">7.)</div> A lynch (or a No Lynch) takes a majority of votes.   In other words, if 7 players are alive, it takes 4 votes to lynch. A majority is half the amount of living players rounded to the nearest whole number. If deadline is reached with no player having enough votes for a lynch, the day ends in an automatic No Lynch.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#003366\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">8.)</div> To vote, post a bolded <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Oversoul</div>.

This \"Bah\" post must contain no information about the game or its contents. Any post after death containing information will be met with strict punishment.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">13.)</div> After a lynch is reached, there is a brief period of twilight (from the time of lynch to the time I check the thread). You may talk during twilight, but you must adhere to the game's rules. No more votes will be counted after a lynch has been reached.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">14.)</div> Do not use small text, invisible text, spoiler text, etc.  All players should be able to read everything you say.  As a corollary, do not constantly use CAPS LOCK, large text, colored text, etc.  All players should be able to read everything you say without getting a headache.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">15.)</div> I will issue a prod to any player that does not post for 72 hours without notifying me of his or her absence. If you are prodded, you will have 48 hours from the time of submission to post in thread. Failure to do so may result in replacement. I will only prod the same player twice after that, he or she must post every 72 hours to ensure that he or she remains in the game.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#331150\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">16.)</div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Discussing an ongoing game gets you a warning the first time and a <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">MODKILL</div> the second time.

The change caused them to thirst for answers, clues, anything that would help them find the people who killed Jonathan. He did not harm anybody, he only helped the people.

Accusations, shouts, and expletives pierced the noisy air volleyed by everyone with an uneasy disposition distrust of his neighbor. <br>\n<br>\nA reveler, perhaps afflicted by some obscure brain malady, stepped into the town hall one evening, already intoxicated by his daily trips to the local Wine and Spirits store.

His blood soaked the sidewalk and seeped into the sewer, the rest curdled in the air. Dismayed by their homicidal attack the crowd dispersed and returned to their homes. They shut their doors, turned out their lights, and armed themselves. <br>\n<br>\nIt would be a long night.<br>\n<br>\nFew people slept well, instead they restlessly watched their doors with expectant eyes thinking \"Am I next?\". Despite the lack of dreams and fantasies, no one heard the gun shots that echoed throughout the town. <br>\n<br>\nAn old, quiet man woke up to pee, an unfortunate side effect of his growing age. He adjusted himself, put on his slippers and nightgown and shuffled his feet into the bathroom. Once he was done he returned to his bed and closed his eyes waiting for the next time he would have to wake up. He thought about the meeting and the death of the drunk. He thought about what he did, and didn't do. At the meeting he didn't say much. He absorbed the anarchy and stood their stoicly, determined to not be fooled by the villians who instigated this chaos. <br>\n<br>\nHe heard something and his eyes immediately opened. What had he heard? A footstep? A door opening? Whatever the noise it was distinct enough that he quickly rose out of his bed and armed himself with a baseball bat. He slowly walked to his door, twisted the knob, and fueled by the rush of adrenaline pumping through his veins opened the door. <br>\n<br>\nNo one was outside. He walked the stairs ever so slowly to make sure the boards would not creak under his meak weight. His slippers muffled the little remaining noise. He walked into his kitchen and waited for his eyes to adjust. Something stirred behind him.<br>\n<br>\nA flash of light filled his house, the gun shot echo reverberating throughout the house.

He had been a big proponent of finding the people who murdered the woman and Jonathan in the alley and many respected him for his dynamic personality and vigor. He read the newspaper, scouring the article about Jonathan for any sort of clue, but his efforts proved fruitless. Tired and frustrated, he turned out his light and shut his eyes. <br>\n<br>\nHe dreamed of many brutal and savage things. He dreamed of a triumphant victory over the murderers, dead in the parking lot of the town hall. He dreamed of a forlorn and deserted town, its citizens scattered and scared away by the murderous outsiders who now inhabited the place. He dreamed of coming home and finding his home ransacked, his family killed. He dreamed of several men entering the town hall shooting guns, killing everyone in a bloody massacre.<br>\n<br>\nHe suddenly awoke. He got up and turned on his lamp. His door was open, an oddity because he always shut the door to the bedroom every night. He walked out of his room and opened the doors of his children's rooms. They were sound asleep and nothing was amiss. He walked down the hallway, opening every door to make sure everything was secure. He went downstairs and checked all of the doors and the windows. Then he heard it. A crashing sound in his garage. His heart began to pound and he cursed it, fearing the sound might give away his presence. He slowly grabbed a cutting knife from a drawer in his kitchen and cautiously approached his garage door. <br>\n<br>\nHe touched the door knob and the door slowly swung open. He could see that his garage door was open and that his car window was smashed, tiny bits of glass covering the floor, twinkling from the street light. He flicked the switch to the turn on the light in the garage and nothing happened. His stomach sank, freezing every muscle in his body. <br>\n<br>\n\"This is not safe.\" he whispered to himself.<br>\n<br>\nInstead of closing the door and calling 911 he ventured further into the dimly lit garage, careful to avoid bits of glass from cutting his feet, careful to be quiet. He eventually made it around his car only to notice a man rifling through the trunk of his car.<br>\n<br>\n\"Hey!\" he shouted, startling the man.<br>\n<br>\n\"Shit!\" the burglar replied, shooting the gun in desperation. He died before his body hit the floor. In that short moment before the bullet pierced his chest he thought about his life, his family he would be leaving behind, his friends at work, and that voice.<br>\n<br>\nHe knew that voice.<br>\n<br>\nKortul, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#107010\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gunsmith</div></div>, shot Night 1!", "time": "Sat Mar 17, 2012 10:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}

Needless to say, if I live, they'll be needed to stop this moronic town from another misguided mislynch. I've found the scum, so it won't be that hard to describe.<br>\n<br>\nMy list remains largely unchanged, but there is a difference:<br>\n<br>\nTOWN: <br>\nkortul<br>\ncharter<br>\nVijay<br>\nhiplop<br>\nLibrarian<br>\nhavingfitz<br>\npecanpie<br>\nIS<br>\n<br>\nSCUM:<br>\nUberNinja<br>\nkdowns<br>\nBub Bidderskins<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFirst off--<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Reasons for my initial reads</div>:</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm fairly transparent, so it really isn't that hard to guess what my reads in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3914768#p3914768\" class=\"postlink\">post 16</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3914771#p3914771\" class=\"postlink\">its followup</a> were based off of, but I'll have to spell it out nonetheless, because it'll make what I'm about to explain a little bit easier.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why Librarian is town:</div> Librarian opened the game up with a normal random vote. This might not seem like much, but compared to players like MusicNinja and UberNinja, it becomes a fairly serious towntell. It was weak, little more than gut, but it was enough to get him on my town list.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why Bub Bidderskins was initially town:</div> For the exact same reason Librarian was--he placed down a random vote. Not only that, but his vote was on kdowns, someone I came to suspect. This gave me the townread on him, putting him fairly high on my list, but you'll note that this quickly faded as newer evidence began to pour in.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why Vijay is town:</div> Again for the same reason--a normal random vote placed down in the early game, which gave me that initial townread on him. Who he was voting for certainly didn't harm things, either.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why charter was scummy:</div> Charter started a bandwagon on kdowns. Obviously, this made it so that he couldn't be scum WITH kdowns, but it drew my attention to him and made me rather suspicious of his vote.<br>\nHow come he went from \"scum?\" to \"null\", then?<br>\n<br>\nSince I concluded it was probably kdowns that was scum, I had a complete scumteam in the form of {Music, Uber, kdowns}. (More on that later, of course.) I was suspicious of charter, but there can only be so many scum in the game. This is why he was in null--because he wasn't scum, but didn't look town at all.<br>\n<br>\nIn hindsight, there actually wasn't much wrong with charter at all; if memory serves, he did the same tactic in the last game I saw him in (Fire and Ice), was town, and (the real \"What An Idiot\" part comes in right here) I suspected him for it when I initially read the game. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nAll of this combined is why he's moved back to my town category.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why I was initially suspicious of Music:</div> For much the same reason the wagon on Music was formed, believe it or not: The <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">lack</div> of random vote from him in his initial post set off a ton of red flags to me. And then treating the vote from hiplop as a serious threat and addressing it. That set off a ton more. All in all, it looked like exactly what you'd expect to see from a scum player.<br>\n<br>\nHis vote on kdowns, an OMGUS, only worsened things.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then he did his move. But more on that, later.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why hiplop is town:</div> For much the same reasons as everyone else--a normal random vote, on a player I thought was scum for bonus points. You'll note, however, that this is pretty much all hiplop got to do in the day. It was his only post, so I didn't have anything else to work off of--hence why my read on him was weakened, but it still holds.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why UberNinja is scum:</div> Oooh, boy. Where to begin? Ah, yes. How 'bout with his first post? Overwhelmingly scummy, I can quote any number of reasons why it was a scum post. But let's start with what gave me the scumread on him in the first place--<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What a contrived reason. Music is life! Don't hate!</div></blockquote> A defense of Music...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Vote: MusicNinja</div></blockquote> ...Followed by an immediate vote on Music. Yeah...<br>\n<br>\nBut that's just the start.<br>\n<br>\nIt reeked of 'defending buddy, then deciding they weren't worth it and distancing from them'. (Bad enough, but now it looks even worse--UberNinja was trying to get the best of both worlds, by both defending MusicNinja while also attacking him.)<br>\n<br>\nYet there's more. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hear, here! It's good to play again. That Epic Mafia site just didn't cut it for me.<br>\n<br>\nAlso I just recently made a wiki page, and the first thing I talked about was just how bad Mini 1296 was.</div></blockquote> This fluff may not look like much, but it worsened my feeling. It might be the Tone in it, or maybe the way he addressed Bub, but something in here felt...<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">off</div>. (You can call it gut if you'd like, though a more accurate description would be \"there's something in here which I know I was suspicious of, but I can't quite remember what it was exactly\".)<br>\n<br>\nBut let's discard that piece of evidence, since while it's something that made *me* suspicious, it's not something very presentable in a case. This, however, is: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>That's just how I roll, baby. Even if I was BabyNinja, I would be OP.</div></blockquote> ...See this kind of defense of oneself? Yeah, this is the EXACT same thing which made me suspicious of MusicNinja. (See above.) The need to defend oneself during the RVS has been, is, and shall continue to be a rather strong scumtell; the reasoning should be obvious enough.<br>\n<br>\nI remember there being more, but unfortunately, I don't remember the rest of it. This'll have to do for now, but you can see why I voted UberNinja; he was, is, and shall continue to be my strongest scumread.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why kdowns is scum:</div> The suspicion on him formed by him immediately strengthening the Music wagon. He messed his vote up, but the intention was there. (If I were more cynical, I'd say that he might've messed it up intentionally to try and avoid being on the wagon 1: next to UberNinja, and 2: so he wouldn't be third, AKA, the 'third on the wagon scumtell'. But I'm willing to accept it's far more likely that Occam's Razor applies and that a messed up vote was just a messed up vote.)<br>\n<br>\nAnd that's how my initial reads were formed. You'll note something: the people who hadn't posted yet were \"town\", with a lowercase t. The people who had were \"Town\", with an uppercase T. That was to differentiate between \"process of elimination, town\", and \"Actually Town\". The reason why was rather obvious--I had found three scum, in the form of Uber, Music, and kdowns. See the section about charter above for more details on that.<br>\n<br>\nBut they were just that--initial reads. They were based around some rather logical principles, mind you, but they boiled down to little more than educated guesses. Not quite gut (stronger than that), but with such weak reasoning that it might as well have been.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo now let's get into how things morphed from there into my current reads.<br>\n<br>\nFirst off, kortul.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>kortul wrote:</cite>I'd like to check whether you are sincere <br>\nVOTE: kdowns</div></blockquote> This might have seemed fairly random, but it wasn't; it was semi-random, semi-scumhunting. He was testing kdowns, and (quite frankly) kdowns failed. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>As for the ninjas - i doubt that ninjas would use guns. One the other hand, scummy ninjas might do this to mislead us.</div></blockquote> This comment was of the exact same nature: while it was made to look random, he quite clearly was stating his opinion, here, that neither ninja was suspicious to him at the time. In other words, immediate scumhunting, right off the bat. This is what shot him to the top of my town list, where he remained until Music usurped it. (Which means he's at the top again. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">)<br>\n<br>\nYou can see the post about Bub below for further evidence, in conjunction with this: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>UberNinja, why ask only Internet Stranger? We are still missing pieceofpecanpie, Internet Stranger and havingfitz - they didn't make a single post each.</div></blockquote> ...One of the best questions asked in the game, which I'm not sure we ever got an answer to, that was quite valid and had kortul not already been at the top, this would have propelled him there.<br>\n<br>\nIn general, kortul has shown to be a quite logical player, showing reason and in general asking the right questions to the right people.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vijay wrote:</cite>Yes. Bus your buddy evil scums. *evil laugh*</div></blockquote> And this is what made Vijay town, since he expressed the exact same \"Uber is scum bussing Music\" theory that I had. His suspicions were (as I quite neatly showed above) rather well-founded, and he pushed them fairly decently, and all that combined made him one of my strongest townreads.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Librarian wrote:</cite>#22 is a scum post.</div></blockquote> This scumhunting was an extreme towntell. He pushed it hard and immediately, exactly as I would expect to see from town. Made more noticeable in that Librarian's relatively new; as a newbie, there's pretty much no way to fake that as scum.<br>\n<br>\nBetter yet, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@mastin: how in the world is charter null when others that haven't posted yet are town?</div></blockquote> He inquired elsewhere, not limiting his suspect to just who he was voting. This was one of the main reasons why Librarian was near the top.<br>\n<br>\nThe ONLY reason he was moving down is because I hadn't checked why he was so high, and he was on the scum-driven Music wagon, but this post is a nice reminder of why he earned that spot.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>OK, if you want to get off of Music why don't you attack charter? He's the one that put him at L-1.<br>\n<br>\nWhy not attack me? I pointed out he was L-1 and didn't unvote.</div></blockquote> As is this. It's aimed at either kortul or (better yet, what the context seems to imply) UberNinja, doing some quite nice scumhunting and asking good questions.<br>\n<br>\nIn general, Librarian is proving to either be an excellent relatively-new scumhunter, or a godly good scum-faking-scumhunter.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>kdowns wrote:</cite>Oh someone jumped on my wagon that I was help starting a Counter Wagon against... YAY</div></blockquote> The grammar here made it hard to comprehend this, but basically, it displayed... (this is what I get for writing things in the middle of the night. I had what I was going to say IN. MY. MIND. less than ten seconds ago, yet I'm drawing a complete blank. ARG!<br>\n*sigh* Label it bad-tone gut-feel for now, 'til I can remember what I was going to say.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I agree with you on #22 and I think mastin was just taking guesses so far.</div></blockquote> This was sucking up (buddying) to Librarian; he made his thoughts about 22 clear above, so there was no need to say that. As for me, he put words in my mouth, trying to make my stance look weaker than it actually was.<br>\n<br>\nAs I quite nicely explained above, I had some rather firm reasoning in my post, and saying it was 'just guesses' weakens its effect.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite>I'm not going to be the idiot to put him at L-1 on page 2.</div></blockquote> This post instantly made me second-guess my townread on Bub. This level of caution seemed excessive: made worse by the fact that he followed through and voted, and--despite having the chance to unvote when Music WAS at L-1--he continued to leave his vote on him. Of course there's more...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>kortul wrote:</cite>I am a bit confused by your second \"I really don't like\" - you really don't like the post (again?), or is this somehow related to your selfrestriction on the vote on MusicNinja?</div></blockquote> I can't really say it much better--the emphasis from Bub was both unnecessary and unnatural.<br>\n<br>\nAnd for the main display...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>UberNinja wrote:</cite>No that was clearly my influence, what with my non-random vote on MusicNinja.</div></blockquote> We have this to start off with. He tries to claim his vote on MusicNinja wasn't random. And while this line looks like a poorly-done attempt to add in something to make it look serious: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I also notice you haven't voted anyone yet even though you've posted twice.</div></blockquote> The REST of the post, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Admitting contradictions already? *narrows eyes*<br>\n<br>\nMethinks thou seemeth too disarming.</div></blockquote> ESPECIALLY when you add in this: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What a contrived reason. Music is life! Don't hate!</div></blockquote> Makes it look quite random. All in all, Uber's post gave off the vibe of trying to get the \"best of both worlds\", in more ways than one: \"try to do scumhunting...while still trying to be random...while trying not to be overly offensive...while trying not to be overly defensive\". Look at the post in question and tell me my asessment isn't accurate. It was all-around artificial, constructed in such a way as to leave open Uber's options, rather than taking a firm stance on matters.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What don't you like about it? It seems clear that he hadn't realized RVS was already over yet and was just counter-bandwagoning.</div></blockquote> Again, note that this post tries to get the best of both worlds. In this case, he throes a weak FoS at Bub...while still voting Music...and in fact, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Triplevote: MusicNinja<br>\n<br>\nchoo choo</div></blockquote> ...Reinforcing his vote later in that very same post. Again, trying to get the best of both worlds and defend Music while blatantly attacking him as well.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, because it was only an FoS, it comes across exactly as what one would expect from a buddy distancing from their scumbuddy--something to get distance between them without drawing a noticeable amount of attention to their interaction.<br>\n<br>\nPlus there's the blatant parrotting in the form of this: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And why did you feel the need to say \"I really don't like it\" twice?</div></blockquote> ...A question <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kortul asked less than four posts earlier</div> and which Bub had answered <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">three post above</div>.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wouldn't simply saying it once have sufficed?</div></blockquote> This question itself is ironic, in that due to asking the above takes care of this question, pretty much already asking this--making it fluff. And guess what he tries to call kortul out for in the same post?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My, what delicious fluff you have, my dear.</div></blockquote> ...Showing blatant hypocrisy as well.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt gets worse.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Unvote</div></blockquote> After Bub gets on the wagon and it's pointed out, Uber gets off. Note that Bub Bidderskins, kdowns, and UberNinja were all (briefly) on the wagon at the same time, and it was only after Bub joined that Uber got off. This is classic scumbuddy behavior: \"Oh, *BEEP*, I don't want to make the connection between my scumbuddies by being on this wagon with them!\"<br>\n<br>\nHe doesn't even justify it. No vote on someone else; he just leaves it hanging in the Not Voting category. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Internet Stranger, you've been awfully quiet.</div></blockquote> If this were real, why not vote for IS? If this were real, then why'd he ignore the other two or three players who hadn't posted by that time? This was out of the blue, serving no real purpose and having nothing of a followup. Its sole purpose was to try and act as a justification for him to be off the wagon, and he failed even in that regard, due to the lack of transition. It's artificial, unnaturally flat fluff.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Librarian wrote:</cite>why'd you unvote?</div></blockquote> Uber brushed this off, not seeing it as a serious question, but Librarian had every right to ask why Uber unvoted. There was--as mentioned--nothing, at all, leading to his unvote.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>UberNinja wrote:</cite>Is that a serious question?</div></blockquote> As said above, this was brushing off a legitimate question. Librarian's question was quite valid, and deserved a valid answer. (Of course, kortul came in and did Uber's work for him, providing an easy out, but the fact remains, UberNinja should have been forced to give his OWN reasoning for unvoting.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>First, we don't want a lynch right now. Too early in the game, and we still know relatively nothing about anything so far.</div></blockquote> Without prompting, he suddenly decides to answer the question he had brushed off before--this makes no sense as town; why answer something you saw as unimportant? As scum, however, it makes perfect sense as he realized, \"Oh, crud, I might actually catch some flak for that.\" And as a last saving-throw, put together this BS. Why not say any of this while unvoting? Why not strongly advocate other players to unvote? Why not push someone harder?<br>\n<br>\nHe did none of those, not in the original post, and not here, either.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Second, even if he does happen to actually flip scum, there's precious little discussion from which to glean info about his partners.</div></blockquote> This is fluff, because it's saying literally the exact same thing as the first. Point one, \"we haven't talked enough; there's not enough information\". This point? \"There's not enough information.\" Exact. Same. Thing. Making this...yeah, fluff to make it look like he had more logic than he really did.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, it sounds like he was seriously doubting Music'd flip scum, as if he knew he wasn't going to: \"even if he does happen to actually flip scum\" heavily, HEAVILY implies \"he's not scum\", but UberNinja goes on below (as I'll quote in a second) to show that he *did* \"think\" Music was scum. Showing extreme cognitive dissonance and quite frankly a scumslip. Compare and contrast his \"even if he does happen to actually flip scum\" with his following point:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Third, if he's town, we just effectively wasted Day 1, we get one possibly 2 kills tonight, and we have to start Day 1 all over again.</div></blockquote> \"if he's town\". Not \"even if he does happen to actually flip town\". Note the bundle of extra words in the latter, which are lacking in the former. One of them is blunt and to the point--this is the one which is true. The other is dodgy and extremely excusive in its nature--the one about Music being scum.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, once more, this point is basically a repeat of the other two. I'll give him the \"if he's town, we get one or two kills\" part as being new, but \"we just wasted day one\" and \"start day 1 all over again\" are the exact same message as the previous two points: \"we don't have enough info\". Making it...yeah, fluff.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm not attacking anyone else because I focus on one sorry sucker at a time.</div></blockquote> And this was an excuse to be tunnel visioned on...yeah, you guessed it: Music Ninja. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>IN CASE YOU HADN'T BEEN READING YOUR NINJA MANUAL, GEEZ</div></blockquote> This sarcasm was bad in tone as well.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Seriously though. Why attack other people when this guy is so juicy? I just don't want him lynched yet.</div></blockquote> These two contradict. Either you want him dead by attacking him, or you don't want him dead...in order to attack others. There is no overlap. You can't want him not dead yet while continuing to attack him; the effort of attacking the guy who is so \"juicy\" is itself furthering the chance he'd get lynched sooner, which contradicts with his goal of getting more information. The main way to get information would be to...yeah, attack others, and not lynch him.<br>\n<br>\nThis shows extreme cognitive dissonance.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Next topic:<br>\nMusicNinja is right that he's not breaking any rules.</div></blockquote> Why the defense of MusicNinja, again? Especially when Uber wanted him dead in the end? Especially when if Music were scum, a modkill on him would be beneficial to Uber if Uber were town? There's no reason to defend a scumread from mod action.<br>\n<br>\nHis attack against me reeked of baiting me into a wall war, and I'm ashamed to admit, for a while, it worked. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>One would hope you'd at least have a few minutes to skim and find out that someone's already strung up and awaiting the noose. However, with that said, the way you wrote this post doesn't seem overly suspicious to me.</div></blockquote> Again, best of both worlds: why point this out if he didn't find it suspicious? Yet he goes out of his way to make sure he says he doesn't find it suspicious. So why ask it in the first place?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>ARE YOU KIDDING ME<br>\n<br>\nOOPS GUYS LOL HAMMER I DIDNT KNOW HE WAS AT L-1 LOLOLOL IDK ANYWAY HE WAS SCUMMY TEE HEE<br>\n<br>\nBULLSHIT</div></blockquote> And the fakerage and fakesurprise settle in; it was quite clear when Uber was writing this post he already knew that the lynch had gone through, as evident by his comments on Music.<br>\n<br>\nBut there's of course more. Reading my post below, I said there was parroting, poor logic, contradictions, OMGUS'ing, wishy-washyness, fake-surprise, and fake-rage. I've explained most of those: wishy-washiness (best of both worlds), fake-surprise, fake-rage, contradictions, the OMGUS is obvious, and I believe the poor logic, but there's of course the parroting. Where does that settle in? Well, take a look at these:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>First, we don't want a lynch right now. Too early in the game, and we still know relatively nothing about anything so far.<br>\nSecond, even if he does happen to actually flip scum, there's precious little discussion from which to glean info about his partners.<br>\nThird, if he's town, we just effectively wasted Day 1, we get one possibly 2 kills tonight, and we have to start Day 1 all over again.<br>\n</div></blockquote> Compare that, to this: <blockquote><div><cite>kortul wrote:</cite>The question is - do we just quickhammer confessed scum and lose the rest of the day available for scumhunting (this may haunt us later), or start looking for another suspects, and just hammer MusicNinja by the end of the day 1? With such a low activity, i would opt for a second option (or at least wait for everyone to arrive).</div></blockquote> Not to mention, when defending MusicNinja, there was the fact that<br>\n-I had pointed out the rule in question on page one.<br>\n-Music had already declared himself to not be violating any rule, AND<br>\n-The mod had said as much at the top of the page.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>and you are further saying that I am one of your five suspects in a thirteen person game</div></blockquote> This is also a misrep. Never did I go above three (and a half, I guess) suspects in my lists. In total over the whole game, yes, five people caught my eye. But the neat thing about reads when you're town? They <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">change</div></div>, and mine did, evolving. In this case, from {UberNinja, MusicNinja} and one of (but obviously not both of) {charter/kdowns}, into {Uber, kdowns, Bub Bidderskins}.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm the only one with common sense enough not to jump on the very aforementioned quick lynch</div></blockquote> Not only is this uplaying his contribution MASSIVELY (as mentioned, his posts read nothing of the sort to me--there was barely any hint AT ALL that this even COULD have been his motive; it is quite obvious this was faked), but it also downplays the contributions of other players--mainly, kortul and myself.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Fact: I left the flash wagon on MusicNinja the second it got to L-1. Flash wagons are bad, and bad things come of them.</div></blockquote> Once more, there's no evidence that this is anything other than BS he made up later. At the time, his unvote was given no reason, and an extremely poor transition. How does that translate AT ALL into, \"This wagon formed to fast; I'm getting off.\"? It doesn't.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>100% agree with both paragraphs. I want to hear explanations.</div></blockquote> And this is extreme buddying to kortul. Especially bad because--while he got off of it--UberNinja is for all intensive purposes a MEMBER OF THE WAGON HE IS SAYING IS FILLED WITH SCUM. You can be a member of the wagon without currently having your vote on him. It'd be one thing if UberNinja simply once had a vote on Music and took it off. In that situation, he wouldn't be a member of the wagon to most people. It's entirely different when you're fully advocating his lynch, but are doing so specifically off the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not even finished yet, but I don't really feel like going on. You get the idea.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can quite easily see how things transitioned from one scumlist into another, forming my final reads at the end of the day.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd let's finish with the VCA.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>kdowns (3): Bub Bidderskins, charter, kortul</div></blockquote> Again, I'd like to point out that this kdowns wagon completely fell apart by the end of the day. The most notable change was of course, Bub Bidderskins who hopped wagons quickly.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>MusicNinja (2): hiplop, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">UberNinja</div><br>\nUberNinja (2): vijay2vasadani, Mastin2</div></blockquote> And by pure probability alone (not to mention my standard VCA technique of combining wagons of identical sizes, making this a four wagon which outsizes the kdowns one), there should be one scum in here. <br>\n<br>\nGuess who it looks like?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not voting (8): pieceofpecanpie, Internet Stranger, havingfitz, <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">MusicNinja</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kdowns</div></div></blockquote> ...Which of course leaves one scum in here, the leftovers. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>kdowns (4): <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bub Bidderskins</div>, charter, kortul, <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">MusicNinja</div> (L-3)<br>\nMusicNinja (3): hiplop, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">UberNinja</div>, The Mini-Librarian<br>\nUberNinja (2): vijay2vasadani, Mastin2<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNot voting (4): pieceofpecanpie, Internet Stranger, havingfitz, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kdowns</div></div></blockquote> And as a reminder, each of the three wagons has one scum on it. If you don't like my rules, follow probability, and you'll realize what I mean.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>MusicNinja (5): hiplop, The Mini-Librarian, kdowns, Bub Bidderskins, charter (L-2)<br>\nkdowns (2): kortul, MusicNinja<br>\nUberNinja (2): vijay2vasadani, Mastin2<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNot voting (4): pieceofpecanpie, Internet Stranger, havingfitz, UberNinja</div></blockquote> And here. Here, the kdowns wagon has dissolved completely. Unnaturally fast, even with a scumclaim from Music; there is no way that scum did not join the wagon by this point. There's easily two on here. And as mentioned, for a brief time, I imagine there was three--until UberNinja unvoted, thinking he'd be getting out of the spotlight due to \"Not Voting\" not being seen as a wagon to most people.<br>\n<br>\nI unfortunately am not most people and hiding there doesn't fool me. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> In particular, it's because he's moved from the largest wagon to the second-largest wagon.<br>\n<br>\nSo, what am I saying?<br>\ntl;dr?", "time": "Sat Mar 17, 2012 2:24 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}

I push pretty damn hard on one person at a time, and figure out whether they're scum or not based on what they've done, how they react, and how they carry themselves after my attention has moved on. It's a complicated mix of criteria that I find works wonderfully well. It's much less effective in games with multiple scum teams, but in a game this size I doubt there are multiple scum teams. In a \"large\" game with 20+ players this style would be almost worthless. It works pretty much invariably in newbie games though, since there are so many known quantities (the size of the scum team, what possible town power there is, etc).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl;dr:</div> I find that throwing shit around and seeing not where it sticks, but where it is uncomfortably shied away from (versus dodged and vehemently cursed at) is pretty effective in finding scum... at least for me.

This makes me feel dirty because I'm beginning to feel he's scum using my mistaken reasoning to get a wagon off his buddy.<br>\n<br>\n2. \"slightly unnecessary claim by kdowns\" - Kdowns would have 100% been lynched without that claim. I still don't trust him. I don't like how he's disappeared from the face of the game either. That was 3 days ago, and Kdowns has only posted one sentence since. If that's not the definition of how to fake-claim a town PR as scum, and then powerlurk until someone else is lynched, then I don't know what is. But pecanpie seems more than happy to write him off as town, and hasn't questioned kdowns once about his claim or subsequent disappearance.<br>\n<br>\n3. \"the best lynch target for the day is Mastin. he's going to turn peoples brains into soup and derail rationale\" - This says nothing about mastin being scum. When I called pecanpie out on this earlier, he said \"I've made it perfectly clear that Mastin is a top scum suspect of mine.\" Well, let's see. Going back through his ISO, here's what I find:<br>\n<br>\n3a) Post #117: When I said \"If mastin is scum, charter is scum with him. That's a guarantee\", pecanpie responded with \"If that stands true then I'm tempted to say that Mastin, Charter and Vijay are all scum.\" Which is great. Really. But notice how he doesn't like the vijay wagon, but DOES like the mastin wagon. This feels like distancing from vijay, and keeping his options open on charter and mastin by linking them to vijay if vijay ever DOES flip scum.<br>\n<br>\n3b) Post #149: \"Put simply, I thought UN is town and Mastin is scum\" -- but no reasoning. The only things he's noticed about mastin so far is that mastin tends to make \"ridiculous and factually deficient\" posts. That doesn't make somebody scum, and he's never said he thinks mastin is scum for that; just that he thinks mastin is scum.<br>\n<br>\n3c) Post #149 again: \"Mastin is still there but I largely ignore whatever he throws out because the contradictions would make my head explode.\" -- This doesn't sound like something somebody says about someone who they think is scum. This sounds like something SCUM says about people they know are TOWN, in order to get other people not to listen to them, and to discount their theories. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">(This is important)</div><br>\n<br>\n3d) Post #179: Pecanpie says: \"Mastin's #174 is unsurprisingly useless, but does strenthen the case for a Mastin-Charter scum team.\" -- For the record, post #174 said: \"It *might* be charter. I need to check stuff.\" and that's pretty much it. How does that strengthen a mastin-charter team? It really doesn't. If anything, it weakens it.<br>\n<br>\n3e) Post #179 again: \"Mastin was also all too happy to join the Vijay wagon (#136)\" -- This is blatantly hypocritical, as pecanpie has been all too happy to jump on wagons as well, NOT TO MENTION he's ignoring everyone else who hopped wagon on Day 1, onto MusicNinja, AND MASTIN WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PLAYERS <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">OFF</div> THAT HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE WAGON. Also, what's not to like about a vijay wagon? After the terrible hammer on Day 1, his terrible play since, and making even less sense than mastin, why shouldn't mastin want to jump on his wagon? I'm thinking more and more that pecanpie is scum with vijay.<br>\n<br>\n3f) There are literally no more posts that show why he is suspicious of mastin. This is BAD.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr: Pecanpie has been seemingly acting pro-town, but after re-reading his posts and examining his possible motives for doing things, I think he's scum. It also makes sense that none of my other suspicions seem to line up when I compare them to each other. I think it's pecanpie, vijay, and Mystery #3 scum (and possibly a serial killer since we had that second kill last night. on the other hand it could be a vig, but who knows at this point).<br>\n<br>\nI've felt a little hollow on most of my other reads (except vijay), but this one feels very solid. pecanpie's play seems very, very coordinated and calculated, and it feels like smart scum playing us all like a hand of blackjack.<br>\n<br>\nAlso don't think I haven't noticed that pecanpie has been sheeping me.

He was carrying a bouquet of roses and a new novel by his wife's favorite author. He strode silently, acknowledging the foreboding clouds to his south. and the eminent storm. Thunder cracked in the background and brief flashes of light reflected off the windows of the stores around City Hall.

Today was his anniversary.<br>\n<br>\nThe man had barely enough time to cross the lawn in front of City Hall when the first droplet fell, splashing quietly on his leather shoe, gliding off as if it never landed at all. Slowly droplets plummeted to earth and peppered the sidewalk, he had very little time before he would be soaked to the bone. He adjusted his posture, placing the flowers and the book inside of his coat and quickened his pace. As he went by City Hall the doors flew open in excited commotion. Two men were punching fell down the stairs entangled in each other's arms. Shouts and cries could be heard from the onlookers inside of the City Hall until a woman screamed shocking everyone in proximity to the shriek into consciousness. They all looked at the man hunched over, now running across the lawn to avoid the rain, and they all perceived him to be hiding something in his coat.

In one big hit they knocked him to the ground, cracking his skull open on an unfortunately placed rock.<br>\n<br>\nThe rain was falling in sheets now, washing away the blood as it streamed out of his head. He lay there, half conscious, and looked at the sky. His vision blurred, obscuring the clouds, the trees, and the two men rifling through his coat.

{"number": 370, "id": "3945832", "user": "Oversoul", "user_id": "16087", "content": "Apparently the solace of the morning without new blood was not enough to save everyone in the town. As each day passed and the body count increased, the atmosphere in City Hall grew more tense. Not a soul could be found in the townsquare outside of the City Hall. Not one person dared to walk to the streets of Sholle after yesterday's incident. A youth typical of the rebellious mindset with piercing's punctuating his face, multicolored hair more vibrant than a rainbow, and a black and white shirt with his favorite band \"Pottymouth\" walked into the City Hall. His presence in the days preceding had been minimal, his contributions fairly nonexistent. He kept quiet counsel, scanning the crowd's faces for anything odd hoping he could be that one that did something different. Hoping that he could be one to find a clue linked to Jonathan's murder. He found nothing. The days passed and his mere presence intensified the animosity in the room. He was too different, too rebellious and it made people nervous. <br>\n<br>\nHis appearance isolated him to a corner with a bench. He sat there in solitude watching men, women, young and old, ugly and beautiful, spit saliva as they shouted at each other until their faces were red. Their emotions were running high, he noticed. At a particularly fervent and emotional juncture, he stood up, mumbled something under his breath and began to walk towards the exit pulling a chain out of his pocket. This action only exacerbated the anger in the crowd. <br>\n<br>\nA man stepped foward grabbing the youth by his collar only to scream in pain clutching his hand. The youth's necklace had cut his palm. By this time the blood had entered the water. Their eyes turned to the youth, their anger focused on a central figure, on the skull toilet insignia of his shirt. He stuttered and stammered to say something, anything to prevent them from encroaching further on his rapidly dwindling personal space he had come to cherish. He watched the crowd encircle his position. Their faces of pure animosity seared into the back of his retinas. Words struggled to come out of his mouth, and when push came to shove he realized he did not want to stand out in a crowd. His heart beat slowed, his stomach dropped, his mouth filled with cotton. Before he could raise his arms in defense, a chair came crashing down on his head snapping into hundreds of jagged pen sized splinters. He looked up at his attacker, blood gushing out of the top of his skull. The blood stained the white skull on his shirt and soaked his pants. His right ear had filled with blood, making it very difficult to hear. His hair was a mixture of black and red, the colors muted by the blood. One woman picked up a splinter. A second man picked up a splinter and shouted<br>\n<br>\n\"Did you kill them!?\"<br>\n<br>\nThe youth turned to the dampened, inaudible noise. Maybe it was the blood, or the chair, or something else entirely whatever the cause he didn't understand the man's shout. Fatigued by the loss of blood he stared at the crowd with a combination of perplexed and agonizing glances incapable of saying a word due to his fear and his injury.<br>\n<br>\nThe woman stepped forward, plunging her splinter into the fountain of blood. Next the man placed his splinter in the boy's neck. The stabbing only stopped until everyone in the crowd filled their appetite.<br>\n<br>\nHours passed until his mother came to identify the body. She rushed through the grand oak doors, past the crowd, and fell onto his body. She clutched his head to her breasts. A constant stream of tears only ebbed by the mother's visceral cries and damnations of God fell on the boy.<br>\n<br>\n\"He was a good kid!\" she moaned with the full capacity of her lungs. \"He was just different!\"<br>\n<br>\nAfter several minutes her tear ducts finally dried and the grief stricken mother faced the crowd with swollen, red eyes. <br>\n<br>\n\"When will this stop?\"<br>\n<br>\npieceofpecanpie, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#107010\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>, lynched Day 3!<br>\n<br>\nNight 3 ends Wednesday April 4, 2012 at 10:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.", "time": "Mon Apr 02, 2012 2:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}
{"number": 371, "id": "3950377", "user": "Oversoul", "user_id": "16087", "content": "A cold front had moved over the town of Sholle, casting grey shadows on the inhabitants and blowing cool breezes of wind, ruffling leaves from the trees. The noise from the trees and the wind shook shutters, rattled doors, and screamed against tightly closed windows. The noise muffled all but the loudest sounds of the night. Rats running through the field did not hear the distinctive flapping of wings from the owls. The cats in the alley behind City Hall could not locate any vermin to gorge themselves. <br>\n<br>\nClouds floated quietly and quickly in the night sky, often obscuring the moonlight leaving only street lamps to reliably brighten the town. A lowly night guard had just finished his night shift and was walking home wearing his thick brown comforted by the warm fleece interior. He was largely untouched by the town's vehement and irrational blood lust because he seldom had the time to go to City Hall on account of his job. He stopped in front of a storefront to examine his appearance in the crisp night air. His eyes looked shrunken compared to the puffy bags popping up from his cheek. His hair waving in the wind looked like a brown extension of his coat. His lips were cracked, dried out by the constant breeze. He looked horrible in every way. His late nights and long hours had sapped any vitality from the his bones. Still he hoped someday soon he would be promoted and finally leave the grasp of his the dreaded night shifts. <br>\n<br>\nHe walked on further, slowly, letting the cool air fill his lungs and leave his body. This type of weather was his favorite weather. He had lived in tropical, arid, and cold places, but never in neutrally warm and neutrally cold area. He was glad he was the only one enjoying the breeze, selfishly trying to draw in as much of the cold air as his lungs would allow. <br>\n<br>\nHe stood their, hands in his coat pockets, deeply breathing in the air slowly exhaling it after his lungs screamed for release. But like the mouse ,and the cat, he could faintly hear a noise. Had it not been windy, had he not stopped to talk in all of the fresh air he could, perhaps he would be alive now. Perhaps if he had participated in the daily City Hall meetings he could have stopped this murderous spree. All of this was now behind him as he fell onto the cold pavement and the shadowy figure walked to the opposite side of the street. He watched his killer cross under the streetlight, faintly making out his appearance. He tried to utter a word, but no sound, if he made a sound, could be heard. His legs wouldn't move and his back ached in severe pain. The wind he was so fond over failed to enter his nose for his nose was bleeding from the fall. He chose to breathe through his mouth hoping that someone heard the gunshot, hoping that someone would come to his rescue. Each time he took a breath his lungs and his back felt like they were on fire. Still he persisted, hoping someone would help him.<br>\n<br>\nkdowns, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#107010\">Jailkeeper</div></div>, shot Night 3!", "time": "Thu Apr 05, 2012 3:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}

{"number": 418, "id": "3962320", "user": "Oversoul", "user_id": "16087", "content": "The sun began to set after a long and ardous day of deliberation. All of pressure the town felt built up under the extreme force of fear. How many days did they have left before their lively hood's would be destroyed? How many more bodies would it take to stop the criminals who started this whole bloody ordeal? Too many days had passed filled with red herrings and erroneous thinking, the town was stuck in a rut with seemingly no way to escape. They were no better off than the day after Jonathan's death. <br>\n<br>\nMany promised vengeance for Jonathan, promising his family to find the culprits, but those promises would not be filled. <br>\n<br>\nOne man boldly stood up and shouted obscenities at the speaker and began to leave City Hall. At the door the entire audience rose in unison, staring at the man. He looked back and shouted \"Fuck off, I'm the Mayor.\" before leaving through the giant wooden doors that had become a symbol of death for the townspeople. He walked down the stone staircase, buttoned his jacket, put on his hat staring at the low hanging sun. He planned to quit the next day, for the town no longer expressed his ethical desires, or the principles he had set since becoming mayor. Wasn't he partly to blame for this mob mentality? As mayor he did nothing. Surely he would have remorse.<br>\n<br>\nThe crowd was now walking out of City Hall into the soft orange and yellow light. The clouds closest to the setting sun adopted a red trim, those farther away appeared as balls of pink. They looked at each other dismayed at their failures, saddened by their murderous acts, and frustrated at their ineptness. They looked at the town, now mostly empty. People seldom walked or left their houses for that matter. Those not involved in the killings waited in their homes patiently, hoping to ride out the storm, little did they know that the eye was now passing over. <br>\n<br>\nA man sat crouched a storefront's door across the street. He had dark hair, tan skin, and was listening to the radio while fiddling with the locked door. He went to his truck, turning the volume up, and returning with something silver. His liscense plate was from a foreign locality. He clearly was not from around these parts. <br>\n<br>\nSlowly, one by one the crowd approached the man, casting a shadow on the door knob. In frustration he looked up and noticed the mass of people. <br>\n<br>\n\"Hello .. uh, foks. What can I .. uh.. do for ya?\" he stated casually.<br>\n<br>\n\"What are you doing?\" one woman responded.<br>\n<br>\n\"Oh this? I'm .. uh ... fixing a lock.\" <br>\n<br>\n\"You're not from around here are you, pal?\" a disgruntled man said, taking of his cap.<br>\n<br>\n\"No, .. uh sir. I'm .. uh locksmith. Someone called me from .. uh this store. Said they .. uh needed help since .. uh the other locksmith was busy.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"The <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">other</div> locksmith?\" the man with the hat replied.<br>\n<br>\n\"Uh... ya.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Do you know what has been going on around here lately?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Uh-\"<br>\n<br>\n\"You haven't heard about the murders?\" the woman added<br>\n<br>\n\"No, I-\"<br>\n<br>\n\"You don't know about the mob?\" the man said as he approached, reaching into his pocket<br>\n<br>\n\"Mob? What mob?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">This</div> mob.\" he said coldy<br>\n<br>\n\"No, I've only been in town for a couple of days I didn't have the right parts to fix this door.\" the locksmith said in a quivering voice.<br>\n<br>\n\"Convenient, since that was the time when these murders started.\" <br>\n<br>\n\"What? You don't seriously think <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I am</div> the one you're after?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"That's exactly what I think!\" the man shouted lunging forward with a screw driver he took from the man's truck. <br>\n<br>\nScreams erupted from the crowd prompting the Mayor to run to the store. \"What in the hell was going on?\" he thought. He pushed his way through the crowd to see the locksmith fighting off the man with the screw driver. The locksmith's ear was bleeding and a piece of his lobe was missing. The blood trickled down the leftside of his neck and onto his blue shirt and denim pants. <br>\n<br>\n\"What is the matter with you people!?\" the mayor inquired, ending the conflict immediately. <br>\n<br>\n\"Hasn't enough blood been shed? Haven't enough people paid with their lives? Haven't enough innocent people been persecuted by your thirst for blood?\"<br>\n<br>\nAn unknown voice rose out from the crowd, distinguished from the rest. \"No\" it replied. The mayor turned in horror at the thought of this proclamation only to stare down the barrel of a hand gun. Releasing the trigger, the voice replied \"This town is ours.\" <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nvijay2vasandi, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#107010\">Vanilla Townie</div></div> has been lynched Day 4!<br>\n<br>\nA wincondition has been achieved!

It allowed the scum to easily skirt by Day 1 without leaving too much in their wake and their lucky kill on Night 1 hurt the town even more. That cycle in its whole is the main reason why the town lost. If it had been one or the other, I think there could have been room for rebound but that cycle just sapped the energy.<br>\n<br>\nThe newbies of this game played really well and I hope you all continue to play on MafiaScum despite this game. You all are good players and I am sure you will only continue to grow in skill.<br>\n<br>\nKdowns played well preventing kills, and if he had gone with his Mastin suspicion he would have left two guppie scum by themselves which could have turned out interesting. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nCharter, why did you decide to kill Pieceofpecanpie instead of Vijay that night? Why did you kill IS over Vijay for his posts about the Music wagon?<br>\n<br>\nAll three Mafia dodged suspicion because the town was so willing to pile onto other wagons which allowed the Mafia to utilize their voting bloc well in my opinion. Mastin's claim of JoAT was in my opinion a high risk claim as there was no real reason why town should have a JoAT since no Mafia had flipped yet. UberNinja's vote hopping was scummy and opportunistic from my point of view, but no one seemed to bat an eye. <br>\n<br>\nThe pieceofpecanpie lynch was in my opinion the worst of the lynches as the town completely disregarded the fact that he could have been a victim of a shot. I was hoping with Kdown's protection that the town would be able to last for one more day and lynch a scum member, but wishful thinking.<br>\n<br>\nI hope you all had fun, but from the activity and motivation I don't think you guys did <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">. While I technically only needed to send out one prod, there were instances that slipped between the cracks and I am thankful to all of you. It is nice not having to be on someone's case about activity.<br>\n<br>\nMusicNinja barely getting by without a modkill put me in a suspenseful situation early on, I am just glad he didn't try to outright break the rule for the sake of the game but in the end it wouldn't have mattered. His actions have shown me that I need to remove that rule, though. <br>\n<br>\nWhat did you guys think? Did you like the flavor? Did you like the setup? Did you like me modding?<br>\n<br>\nI tried to give you guys a votecount everday, but there were some days when I couldn't get to the computer and I am sorry for that.<br>\n<br>\nDid you guys dislike 48H nights? If enough people expressed interest in 72H I would have changed it, but I didn't receive any PMs from people saying they wanted slower nights. Frankly, I was hoping it would keep momentum up. <br>\n<br>\nAll in all I think the set-up was balanced as I had designed it to be less intrusive than other games, but still retaining power. Do you all think it was balanced?", "time": "Tue Apr 10, 2012 9:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}

I liked the setup, but I felt that it was a little bit scumsided, due to how powerful an Encryptor is. I had no issues with your modding, either, as things seemed to run fairly smoothly. So all in all, fairly good game. Honestly, the weakest thing in the game is your post-game Mod Notes. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">", "time": "Tue Apr 10, 2012 9:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}

We also figured out he was the most likely vig pretty early on, too. Once pecan flipped VT (he was actually a vig suspect of mine--our kill failed and there was no sign of a vig N2, so it made sense that he was our vig and I honestly thought the town had lynched their strongest power role <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">), there weren't a lot of options. Vijay was a claimed VT, leaving fitz (whose play didn't seem to fit), Bub, and charter, and I determined through gut that charter was more likely.<br>\n<br>\nMeaning we had a fairly good lock on the town's roles from the start. That definitely had to have contributed to the win. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">", "time": "Tue Apr 10, 2012 9:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21350&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "21350"}
