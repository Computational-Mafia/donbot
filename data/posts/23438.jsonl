I will handle any situations as I see fit.<br>-Message me with any concerns you have regarding game mechanics, even something as simple as a vote count. The more that can be worked out behind the scenes, the better for everyone! <br>-Any time you want my attention in-thread, please use bold.<br>-If rules are broken I have the right to judge if replacement or modkill is needed.<br>-I may change the rules at any point in the game, although you will be notified.<br>-Flavour is for the purpose of entertainment only and will not be any indication of role or alignment.<br><br><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">General:<br></span></span></span><br>1) Have fun! And allow others to have fun too. Excessive insults or personal attacks will result in a warning or force-replacement. <br>2) There must be no talking about the game outside this thread, unless using a method allowed by your Role PM.<br>3) No editing of posts. Ever. <br>4) No quoting of any PMs or QTs relating to the game.<br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">5) Green is my colour. Don\u2019t use it.</span></span><br>6) Do not discuss ongoing games.<br>7) Hydras are allowed, but no more than two heads, and they must be PM\u2019d to me.<br><br><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gameplay:</span></span></span><br><br>8) Votes must be bolded or in vote tag format to count. I will not count any that are not. Example: Vote: MattP Abbreviations can also be used as long as it\u2019s clear who you\u2019re voting for. Example: Vote: MP<br>9) Unvoting when changing a vote is helpful, but not required. Voting at the beginning of a line is also helpful, but not required.<br>10) A no-lynch before deadline requires at least half of votes. A lynch always requires a majority of votes.<br>11) Once a majority is reached, it becomes twilight until I can post the lynch. No voting or unvoting will count.<br>12) No majority at deadline means no lynch occurs.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Activity:<br></span></span></span><br>14) Please inform me if and when you will be V/LA. If I feel the period is too long or there is some other reason for me to do so, I will replace you.<br>15) Prods will be sent after 2 days (48 hours) without a post. If there is no response after another 24 hours, you will be replaced.<br>16) If someone accumulates 2 prods over the course of the game and I feel they are not active enough, they will be replaced.<br>17) Days last 2 weeks unless a lynch occurs before deadline or an extension is granted. Feel free to ask for them, but I will only grant one if it\u2019s deserved.<br>18) Nights will last 48 hours.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #400080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Vanilla Townie Role PM</span></span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome, you are a Vanilla Townie. <br><br>You win when all threats to the town have been defeated.<br><br>During the day you have the ability to post in the game thread and vote.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Please confirm by sending your role to me by PM.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Thank you to DeasVail since I used a large portion of his ruleset."}

He hasn't had any real suspicions so far and his vote on redtail is still heavily couched (\"Vote redtail because he came late and is distorting things\").

In my last post, I asked for your reads on you think is scummy and so far you've only offered weak indications against those against you. I notice Trollie didn't voice some suspicions either.

I agree that we could use a little more info on his trollie vote; the most I got out of him when I asked him was \"Robert is too easy\" (paraphrase).  But you need to sell me on why that's scummy and not just how he's playing.  By contrast, you say quite a bit and post often, yet I see little in the way of reasoning from you.  <br><br>Your Axxle logic is even worse.  At the time you were voting Axxle, he had 2 posts, both solidly in RVS.  Nobody at the time was making posts with content.  I'm actually willing to write your Axxle vote off as RVS too but a) you kept it there for quite some time, even while the game moved on, and b) you dodged any attempt to justify it while not moving it.<br><br>Next post (which I'm writing right now, I promise) on Robert; I want to avoid this being too long."}

Conceivably Robert misconstrued what fitz said about being late and distortion as...no, forget that.  I don't see how he could have misconstrued what fitz said in that section.  Fitz clearly meant those as reasons to vote for me, but somehow Robert takes them to be possible outs if the wagon doesn't materialize.<br><br>His suspicion of Trollie feels a bit too OMGUS for my liking, but I don't read as much into it as Axxle does.

I don't understand why he reads BB as town (null for me), but fine.  And I'm not even touching his townread of me; that's got WIFOM written all over it.  I certainly don't see anything inherently scummy in his townreads (NB: I might be biased, as he townread me).<br>Also: UN's vote on Robert is godawful, and his later latching onto Axxle's reasoning isn't much better.<br><br>In the final analysis, I could probably be convinced to vote for Robert, but am happy with my current vote.

Fitz inquires as to what the abbreviation he used means. UN inquires as to RM's motives. RM says he is trolling, and asks about fitz being scum. (His vote is on UN at the time.)<br>-BBMolla agrees with RM, saying a fitz vote (his vote at the time) is good.<br>-UN attacks Axxle's RVS vote.<br>-RM backs his words up and switches to fitz, quoting BBM.<br>-Axxle votes BBM, citing his RVS claim.<br>-Slandaar stays on UN.<br>-Fancy-pants votes redtail, who hadn't posted.<br>-Fitz calls BBM out on his RVS, Cooldog double-defends BBM from Axxle and fitz. UN disagrees, but thinks Cooldog's town.<br>-Red vote fitz, citing RM and saying fitz feels forced. UN disagrees, saying there's no scum motivation. Red responds, saying nobody (except for a few possibles) would show scum motivation on page two.  UN asks what hints there were, Red responds 20 and 33, then inquires as to UN's Axxle vote.<br>-Cooldog attacks UN.<br>-Red explains why fitz's posting feels forced.<br>-UN calls red town.<br>-Fitz thinks red was lying about agreeing, and about red's forced point. Places a vote on red for perceived BS from red.<br>-Red explains his point, but realizes his point against fitz is (apparently) hypocritical, unvoting and promising a reread. At this point, fitz is the lead wagon at L-4. (Had red not unvoted, it'd have been L-3. The members were Venrob, BBM, and RM.)<br><br>-fitz continues attacking red.<br>-Trollie points out RM's trolling as being 'snakey', voting.<br>-Red explains that he attacked fitz for things he's known for doing as town.<br>-BBM switches to Trollie. Red asks why; BBM says RM's an easy target.<br>-UN votes BBM for BBM's explanation of his initial post people reacted badly to.<br>-RM says BBM and red are town, and that fitz and trollie are good targets. Says fitz is gut, playing on fitz using technicalities while not appearing to have a real suspect or reason. Says trollie's hopping onto RM's RVS posting is bad.<br>He later elaborates, saying it's easier to fake being town than to fake having suspects.<br>-Verity votes BBM, saying he just knows BBM's scum.<br>-Cooldog simultaneously defends BBM while attacking (inquiring) him.<br>-Trollie elaborates on RM, saying it's verbosity and overexplaining combined with forced posts, \"sounds more like scum than newbtown\".<br>-Slandaar defends BBM, \"why would doc!BB not say what he did?\".<br>-Cooldog elaborates.<br>-Venrob goes V/LA for one week, unvoting. Has said nothing in six days since then. (In other words, he has one day left.)<br>-Fancy Pants asks how RM concluded fitz's suspicions weren't real and asked why RM's were, and making sure to point out neutrality in a fitz stance.<br>-Fitz asks much the same, focused on the townreads.<br>-Fancy Pants says not to focus on BB, and to focus on RM. On this same train of thought, red asks UN to explain why BBM is scum. Fitz calls Fancy Pants out, saying there isn't any interest in lynching BBM in the first place. He also further elaborates on his RM inquiries.<br>-Slandaar agrees with RM, thinking he's town. Asks fitz what's wrong with strong early reads, and says UN's posts are suspicious.<br>-Red answers fitz's inquiry, saying there is some interest in a BBM lynch, theorizing post 61 as the cause. (The \"It's a JOKE!\" scumtell.)<br>UN responds to the inquiry about BBM, saying he doesn't need a reason to vote for someone he thinks is scum. (Gut?) Red asks for one, anyway.<br>-At this point, BBM is the lead wagon at L-4. (The members are Axxle [received a prod at that time], UN, and Verity.)<br><br>-BBM directs attention towards Trollie.<br>-UN points out that RM did not immediately vote fitz. Also asks Fancy Pants to explain the \"slow\" comments. Calls RM newbscum talking about theory to look good. Says Axxle is also a good vote, for the RVS post and followthrough on BBM. Furthermore says that BBM is a good vote, saying BBM's iso is quite bad and asks for all with a townread to explain why.<br>-RM explains why he was suspicious of fitz, admitting the reasoning wasn't strong, but saying it was strong enough for pages 2-3. (In other words, his suspicion on fitz was weak, yet was slowly growing.) Accuses fitz of saying that red and RM are both presenting invalid arguments, while not saying there's an alternative reason other than they're scum. (In a word, RM accuses fitz of OMGUS.) Also calls Trollie out on seeming lack of suspicions. Throws an FoS at UN.<br>-UN asks for a reason why Axxle would be town from red. Has some banter with RM that goes nowhere.<br>-At this stage, there's no true lead wagon; both main wagons have two votes, being RM (Trollie and UN) and Trollie (Cooldog and BBM).<br><br>-Axxle explains reasons for the BBM vote, saying BBM usually pulls stunts such as the doc-claim, but that they're usually implausible. Combined with BBM's play, Axxle says he's fine keeping a vote on BBM.  Defends fitz by pointing out that fitz is in line with his town play, when he got caught up in semantics (but wants fitz dead before lylo). Also says RM's last post was scummy, for being willing to switch onto Trollie despite claiming Trollie is a weak read. Jumps wagons to RM, thinking it's a better vote than BBM.<br>-Fancy Pants expresses concern about RM.<br>-Slandaar says that BB, RM, Red, and my slot are all town.<br>-Cooldog votes UN for not explaining his reads, while diverting attention away.<br>-red joins the wagon, explaining a former null read on Axxle, asking for a reason for the BBM scumread.<br>-fitz defends himself, while pressing BBM, Axxle, Slandaar, and everyone voting UN.<br>-UN explains his scumread on BBM, the reason for his Axxle read, and pushes an RM lynch further.<br>-red says that UN is the most prominent poster, and admits the most prominent poster is going to say scummy things, but fails to elaborate on why UN doing so makes him scum rather than scummy. He does explain a little, that he disagrees with UN's BBM stance along with his stance on Axxle.<br>Red's following post shows support for an RM wagon, but an unwillingness to switch over immediately, preferring his current vote (on UN).<br>-Fitz defends UN with meta. Cooldog posts immediately after, that he doesn't like using meta to justify a read. (Also, Cooldog's post exaggerates how much meta UN used in the post.)<br>-BBM declines elaboration on trollie, simply stating, \"read his posts\". He goes into detail about Axxle, however. Also thinks Fancy Pants is scum with (one of/both of; not clear) the two. Also says UN is scum for trying too hard. (<span class=\"noboldsig\">BBM:</span> How is UN trying to hard, exactly? I and fitz both got the opposite impression.) Says Cooldog, red, RM and fitz are town. Gives reasoning for fitz and RM, and semi-Cooldog.<br>-Fitz insists on elaboration from BBM.<br>-At this stage, RM (Trollie, UN, Axxle) and UN (Slandaar, Cooldog, redtail) are tied for the lead wagon, both at L-4.<br><br>-BBM says Fancy Pant's defense was awkward and made no sense from town, and says that fitz believes what he's saying and therefore is town.<br>-RM says there's nothing to respond to, but backs out of the fitz wagon despite thinking it still had some ground because the wagon wasn't going anywhere. Supports the UN wagon, but instead votes for Trollie.<br>-Axxle brings up points against RM. Says that UN looks scummy, but is probably not scum with RM, who Axxle suspects more.<br>-Slandaar elaborates on reasons for thinking UN is scum, saying that BBM's wording nailed the point, \"trying too hard\". (To which I'll ask <span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar:</span> Now that you have two people vouching that this is actually the inverse of their experience, saying that UN-as-scum IS a town leader and that this game ISN'T what they'd expect from him-as-scum, do you still think this point holds?)<br>-RM thinks UN is being hypocritical and brings up two examples, the first which I can't see hypocrisy in.<br>-redtail says, \"what RM said\", but does question RM on Trollie.<br>-Trollie scumhunts my slot, defends UN, and points out a perceived inconsistency from BBM. Says Slanddar is town, as is fitz, with a slight scumlean on BBM and my slot, while thinking RM is scum.<br>-Cooldog asks why Trollie is defending UN, and urges people to discard meta.<br>-BBM clarifies what he meant, and then calls a UN/Trollie scumteam. <br>-At this point, UN is the lead wagon at L-3 (Slandaar, Cooldog, red, BBM), with RM right behind at L-4 (Trollie, UN, Axxle).<br><br>-Trollie clarifies his point with Cooldog, calling him out. Trollie also continues calling BBM out on his previous point, presumably due to a misunderstanding on BBM's wording. Adds to the attack by pointing out BBM's votes.<br>-BBM clarifies his wording.<br>-UN expresses potential Trollie suspicion (unclear if so), asking BBM to give the case against Trollie.<br>-RM continues pressing UN, while also asking those on his wagon who they think are his scumbuddies.<br>-A little RM and UN back-and-forth, before an Axxle post where he (once more) asks to see a Trollie case. Says the inactive players are more likely to be RM's scumbuddy.<br>-Fancy Pants says BBM is \"weird\", and says RM is WIFOM'ing, voting.<br>-Red agrees, saying RM looks bad for it.<br>-Fitz likes red's posting, dropping the red case, but also dislikes the UN wagon.<br>-At this stage, both UN (Slandaar, Cooldog, redtail, BBM) and RM (Trollie, UN, Axxle, Fancy Pants) are at L-3.<br><br>-UN promises isos, and starts by doing a lot of null on fitz. Says town.<br>-Lots of back and forth between fitz and Slandaar, with a little from UN as well.<br>-This is the point where I come in. The main wagons remain identical.<br><br>-Cooldog continues attacking UN. BBM says he likes the people on the UN wagon and that the RM wagon is garbage.<br>-UN responds to my opening suspects, calling Cooldog dumb-town, neutral on red and Venrob, and town on Axxle, while agreeing with RM.<br>-red asks for elaboration from BBM, and throws an attack at RM.<br>-Trollie posts something.<br>-RM answers, by saying UN is scummy, but he's not sure if UN's scum.<br>-BBM calls both UN and RM town, but keeps a vote on UN.<br>-Pine comes in and promises a read later, becoming weary of BBM.<br>-Fancy Pants says UN looks town, but isn't sure on RM, yet RM's scumminess is \"good enough for now\". Calls BBM town.<br>-Fitz pursues Slandaar and BBM, voting BBM.<br>-UN says Cooldog's town. Cooldog says the opposite, that UN's scum.<br>-Axxle says I look town, and calls \"wtf\" to BBM.

The Marathon Square Dance I went to Saturday Night (~7 PM to 7 AM on Sunday, 12 hours of square dancing, round dancing, and line dancing. I did literally everything, and was the only one to do so.

So a lot of the stuff I was planning to do on Sunday didn't get done on Sunday, meaning they have to be done today, on Monday.<br>Real life dominates online life, so that means I'll be less active today than I'd prefer, and likely won't finish my scumhunting as I had planned to.

Red's sheeping is null (combined with a weak-townread, his jump doesn't ring alarm bells), and BBM's switch is only slightly-scummy (wouldn't surprise me if it were bussing, though).

(Lurking, Active and Passive.)<br>-Refusal to take a stance. (Waffling.) As just ONE instance, look at this. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It's somewhat justified with deadline looming, but it's still suspicious.</div></blockquote> \"It's suspicious, but it's not.\"<br>*Related, Weasel wording. Leaving doors open to backtrack if necessary.<br>*Also, heavy use of words such as \"interesting\", \"strange\", \"odd\", \"intriguing\" and the like. (This is a minor scumtell. There's a reason veteran players seeing these words specifically say, \"define 'interesting'\".)<br>-Showing extreme concern over being voted. Asked why Robert voted him, but Robert was the first person to vote FP.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the only person that actually has some sort of reasoning is Robert</div></blockquote> Discredits the rest of the wagoners as having no reason. Not true--RM gave reasons, UN pointed out FP's horribad post, red agreed with RM's case, and I have my own reasons. (BBM's the only one, so 1/5, not the stated 4/5.)

Scum like to wiggle out of these situations so they have time to prepare a fakeclaim.<br><br>And all of this is just a ten-minute case.

(I can't analyze myself, so I'll leave others to the task of that.)<br><br>-Member one, Robert. RM starts the game trolling (similar to BBM), but once the RVS is over, flips a switch and becomes a different person. I recognize this playstyle; it's similar to what I once did. The intention to end the RVS by whatever methods (even if they draw attention to yourself) is incredibly effective and typically a town move. He immediately starts scumhunting by pushing attention onto fitz (while still under the guise of being random) and when he has gotten reactions, explains why his push was <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span></span> RVS. RM has been scumhunting the entire game, and while I had an initial bad gut read on him, RM's doing exactly what he should as a pro-town player--addressing other players' concern on him, while directing their attention to his suspects.<br><br>-Member two, UN. He's not playing to his scum meta, being more casual and relaxed (as I'd expect of him as town). However, I have more than meta--Though he's visibly not taking the game seriously, his posts are almost all original, bringing up good points, asking all the right questions and making good observations. While he has defended himself somewhat, this is easily explained by the casual playstyle; I know that when I'm playing casually, I'm prone to responding to anything addressed at me, and in doing so, defend myself. However, similar to RM, UN's defenses are only brief breaks in the overall pattern: scumhunting. His posts are generally spot-on and nail the point in perfectly. Add in his active posting with no active lurking, and you've got a solid town player.<br><br>-Member three, redtail. Redtail's been sheeping a good deal this game. However, redtail's sheeping seems simply as him seeing a good point from another player and agreeing with it. He hasn't been parroting (in sharp contrast to FP who has been), and frequently when he does say he agrees with a point, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">he gives elaboration of his own</span>, adding his insight into the matter. Furthermore, red hasn't been exclusively sheeping, and has been bringing up strong points of his own against his own suspects. He shows an extremely individual thought process, making sure to express his opinion on anything he sees as important, directing attention in a way I feel is pro-town. He's taking strong stances with his own logic, not blindly following without reason. As just one example of this, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4372454#p4372454\" class=\"postlink\">read his last post</a>. He elaborates on FP (pretty much saying \"FP hasn't done anything townworthy, a sentiment I share\"), and then provides to also give his own concern about the wagons, bringing up a theory which DOES require some thought, as he brings up some good points. (I happen to disagree, for the reasons listed in the above sections, but it is a valid concern to have had.)<br><br>-BBM: Yeah, I'm not defending him. Of the five voters, he's the only one who legitimately has not presented a solid reason to have voted FP. When people say the wagon \"has almost no reasons\", and is \"full of sheep\", with \"questionable people on the wagon\", they're talking about BBM, not the other members. However, I will continue to point out, BBM will not live to lylo. Yes, he'll likely get lynched sooner rather than later, but he is NOT day one lynch material. \"Because he's confusing\" is not the basis of a good lynch.<br><br>So tell me, why is the FP wagon bad, again?"}

When BBM made <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4375449#p4375449\" class=\"postlink\">299</a>, I decided to take a look at him. And while, yes, his iso does contain a fair amount of trolling, BBM's overall play this game has been incredibly town, which explains the gut townread I had on him. His vote on fitz might have been RVS, but given fitz's post and followup post, when BBM said his vote was a good one, it was already clear he was scumhunting. <br><br>Then, when further content comes, he changes his vote to Trollie. Initially, it's without reason, but he explains with very little prompting that Trollie was likely scum for attacking the easy-target, RM (an attack specifically linked to later: post 59). He continues to push his read, and when asked for elaboration, he says \"Iso him\", basically saying that Trollie should be scummy enough by sight (and when said person doesn't see it, BBM explains what he sees in Trollie). He also pushes Axxle at the same time for being scummy. At this point, BBM was attacking Fancy Pants, an either-or (rather than \"both of\") between fitz/Trollie, and UN (plus Axxle in said post). Saying that fitz was likely town made it clear the way he was leaning, also giving townreads on Cooldog, red, and RM (saying Slandaar can't be read for a few days as well). <br><br>He then elaborates on FP, so I have to take back my statement about BBM not having given a reason. As he said in 299, he did, just said it earlier and didn't vote on it. Meaning, all 5 people on the wagon have given reason, and like the others, BBM has been playing a solid town game. He basically calls a UN/Trollie/FP scumteam, and continues to push it, and when asked, he gives his reasoning for his suspects. BBM's point about the RM wagon being garbage is just one example of why he's been playing a solidly pro-town game.<br>Beyond that, he showed a willingness to change his read, saying UN might be town, but he wasn't sure, so he continued to apply pressure to figure it out. After this, he votes for Axxle (who was an earlier suspect of his) and then Fancy pants (also a consistent suspect of his, even if he didn't bring it up very often).<br><br>Yes, BBM's been trolling. Yes, that's something he does as scum. But his overall content this game points to a solidly pro-town mindset. Not to the same degree as the others, but now that I've gone back and checked BBM's contributions, he's back inside my town-list, rather than my null list. Not as high as the others on it, of course, but CERTAINLY not a day one lynch. His posts haven't been \"confusing\". Quite the opposite, BBM's posts are some of the more clear ones in the game, because he's kept his overall focus where it needs to be.</div></div></div> tl;dr, BBM's town and NOT getting lynched today.<br>FP's almost certainly not, and probably SHOULD be lynched today."}

The wagon in which Axxle's only suspect is the person who started it (and therefore had no way of knowing it'd become a wagon) and the person who had shown interest in it long before any other? (And which has TWO members in his \"will not lynch\" category, with a third at the BOTTOM of the \"willing to lynch\" category--3/5 members HE BASICALLY WAS CALLING TOWN.)<br><br>...Or the counter-wagon, which has two people in his \"willing to lynch\" category? Which from his perspective, has only two town members on it? (Himself and fitz.)<br><br>Yeah. The BBM wagon is a counterwagon to FP, made in an attempt to avert a Fancy Pants lynch. The members on it are questionable. Their reasons are questionable. Pine kept his slot's vote without explanation, and never gave his reasoning for having kept it. Axxle voted BBM for being \"harder to read\", basically, for being distracting. FP's reason is the same, for being a \"disruption\" and being \"confusing\".<br>In other words, of the four members, only one has given solid reasoning for suspecting BBM. (Fitz.)<br><br>The FP wagon was made almost entirely by people who are near-universally townreads, with the possible exception of RM and the probable exception of BBM. Every single member has given clearly-defined reasons for having joined the wagon. RM has a post. UN had a post. Red had multiple posts. I have multiple posts. Even BBM has multiple posts. Everyone has given their reasons on the wagon, and nobody has given counter-reasons, other than,<br>\"This is a wagon which is there just for the sake of 'let us see where this goes'\", which I've shown to be false.<br>And \"This is a counter-wagon to BBM\", which is the inverse of the truth, because the BBM wagon primarily formed AFTER the FP wagon.<br>And \"the members of this wagon are questionable\", which I've also shown to be a lie.<br><br>So the difference is quite clear.<br><br>-The FP wagon is made up of pro-town players with clearly-defined reasons with no counters provided as to why it's not a good wagon.<br>-The BBM wagon is made up of questionable players (except fitz) with ambiguous, unclearly-defined reasons if reasons are given at all (except fitz), who have not responded to the points against the BBM wagon."}

He isn't convince of RM's conclusions, but doesn't disagree with the argument.  He finds RM's town reads \"strange,\" but chalks it up to being emphatic.  I come away having no idea what FP's opinions are.  He's not saying anything substantial.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4354076#p4354076\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 3</a>: FP says (correctly) that BB's first post is no reason to lynch him.  He also says we should be worried about RM.  I still have no idea what Fancy Pants thinks about anybody.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4356149#p4356149\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 4</a>: There are 4 elements to this post.  The first is merely answering a question from Fitz.  The second gives a mediocre (but fine for very early game) reason for FP's RVS votes.  The third cites RM being \"emphatic\" as \"worrisome.\"  I don't really understand the fourth part, but at least he says that he finds something Robert did \"a bit suspicious.\"<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4361194#p4361194\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 5</a>: Defends his questioning of RM's reads and says he's not buddying fitz or trollie.  He then talks about BB's \"trying to link a lot of people together very early in the game,\" which he finds not scummy, but rather odd.  Noted, but I think the way you phrased this makes it quite easy for you to later jump on a BB wagon (or not).  Finally, he votes Robert based on RM's WIFOMy question (which, to be fair, was not great).  Looking back, one could say he's been kinda building to this, but the biggest hint we've gotten till not is that he found some action of Robert's a bit suspicious.  For the record, this was the fourth (and functionally final) vote on the Robert wagon, bringing Robert vs. UN to 4 vs. 4.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4363321#p4363321\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 6</a>: Small nothing about a previous assumption, but it's good to note how quickly FP can and does label a previous statement of his as \"not a strong assumption.\"<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4365279#p4365279\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 7</a>: \"He seemed scummy, and that's good enough for now.\"  There is nothing good about that sentence.  Really.  Also presents his first solid townread of D1 (and his second actual read altogether), although the first line of this post \"UN looks town to me\" could be taken as a read.  Actually, I'll count that.  Note: it's on the major opposing wagon of the day so far, and it's a sentiment shared by many in town.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4370018#p4370018\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 8</a>: First vote on the FP wagon and he immediately asks for reasons.  Unclear whether he knew a wagon would form on him so quickly, but he's very quick to immediately become defensive.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4374490#p4374490\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 9</a>: The first half of this has already been deconstructed by mastin.  In the second half, FP votes for BB, after previously expressing one of his few actual townreads on precisely that person.  Now, obviously stuff happened in between (68 posts to be exact), but he spends very little time talking about this.  Instead, he merely notes that he finds BB difficult to read, and concludes that BB is scummy.  Actually, he might be concluding that BB is not necessarily scummy, but is anti-town. <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4374529#p4374529\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 10</a>: But that defense goes down in flames here, where FP solidly says he thinks BB is scummy.  He provides no reasoning why difficult to read = scummy.<br><br>tldr: FP has consistently avoided giving real information about what he thinks, instead relying on fence-sitting and rhetoric to avoid saying much of anything.  When he has made substantive statements or given actual reads they have been easy and sheepish, without much justification.  He has, from my perspective, performed no active scumhunting."}

As the lead wagon, not claiming under pressure gives you-as-scum two forms of leverage:<br>-If you claim at literally the last second to be a PR, the wagon on you collapses. We either speed-wagon someone else, or we no-lynch. Not pro-town.<br>-If you don't claim at all today and are scum, you have a whole night to discuss your claim with scumbuddies, to see what makes the most sense and what has the least amount of holes. Not pro-town.<br><br>As town? The only advantage--theoretically hides your role from scum. BUT, it has HEAVY consequences. The town is less likely to believe you when you DO claim, and smarter scum have likely figured out whatever role you have, meaning the ONLY people you're hiding it from is the town, who (as I'm a clear example of) are quite skeptical of you.<br>No pro-town motive. Serious pro-scum motive. FP needs to claim, or die. <br><br>If FP doesn't claim, we lynch FP. If FP does, it depends on what the claim is; Axxle IS a good alternative to FP, but I'd prefer FP under most circumstances."}

Why did scum allow a town vs. town wagon fight to disintegrate like that?<br>Case 3: Ah, here we're on promising ground.

Most of his words are generic, general and highly-unoriginal accusations. He lets others do his work for him, rather than contributing his voice.

I guess your argument might be that doing so would have been a dumb strategy. idk, i still dont think your analysis holds much weight because this early in the game town really out-powers scum.  Your analysis rely's on scum having the power to shift the wagons and i just dont think they have that power this early.  also i think they want to actively avoid using that power in unison to avoid getting caught.  anyway, im not saying you are wrong, just that i dont think your argument is enough in-and-of-itself to prove that the wagons were scum v. scum.  <br><br>On another note, i read through axxle, need to re-read the case against him.  hes a null for me right now.  <br><br>Robert is back on my very-very scummy list.

My \"eternal newbie\" philosophy regarding constantly reinventing myself means that I don't play similarly in any two games, and that--because I constantly seek to change my play--I know my meta better than anyone else, so can theoretically manipulate it, nullifying the point of defending myself with it), but ultimately, the wagon on me isn't entirely scum-driven. One member, sure, two at the most. But there's at least one vote on there which comes from town. And that town vote(s) would best be placed elsewhere.<br>And a significant part of all three members' cases relies on meta. But I can show 'em wrong.<br><br>The difference between my town-self and scum-self is quite simple: conviction. When I'm scum, I have absolute conviction in my reads. When proven wrong, I (as UN describes) shrug it off and continue to attack someone else, with my suspect list undergoing very little modification at all. During my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=21408&amp;f=3&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=12314&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">last scum game</a>, I mostly subverted it, because I was trying to out-grow it. However, if you start reading <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4056427#p4056427\" class=\"postlink\">from here-on</a>, you can see that ultimately, I played it straight. It was possible Tammy was scum. It was possible TD was scum, 'til the town lynched TD. Didn't matter. I showed absolute conviction towards Nacho being the last scum. I locked myself into that, and stuck it through.<br><br>Compare and contrast, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4096553#p4096553\" class=\"postlink\">my last town game</a>, where I went into the day absolutely certain I was going to vote (Pine)...<br>...But I (correctly, as it turned out <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) second-guessed myself, and thought, \"...waaaaaaaiit a sec...\", and thought things through.<br><br>Those are both lylos, but the principles apply throughout the game--town-me walls to FIND conviction, but LACKS said conviction to START with. With me alive, something's gone horribly wrong, but I don't know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what</span>. Ultimately, my list could end up virtually identical or completely changed, but I re-think things through.<br>Scum-me walls to SHOW conviction, explaining WHY I believe what I do. My list undergoes minimal changes if it changes at all.<br><br>And that's where UN goes wrong. He thinks that I've been showing no hesitation. My hesitation was my walling. The difference is subtle, but it's there.<br><br>That's UN taken care of. adorkable's case was that I'm \"setting up lynches\" and \"more aggressive than normal\". The first has been disproven by my stances, and the second I've already explained as being a consequence of being a universal townread. Think of it in terms of an innocent child. You're confirmed town--are you going to fade into the background and lurk through the game, or step up, use your towncred, and take control of the town?<br><br>Axxle's bit against me is that I post some good points, but the majority is filler-junk. I can tell you right here and now that you can look at any game of mine as any alignment and see the exact same tactics in place. The difference is in the motive, subtle as it may be. As town, I'm either trying to solidify my reads or convince the town of my reads. As scum, I'm either testing the waters or trying to push something through. There's not much of a difference, sure, but it's there to be found.<br><br>Yes, this whole defense is meta, but as the title of the spoiler says, so is most of the case against me.

I just finished my first read-through.  I got up to the last few pages, preparing a grand attack on RM, only to find that you all had already come to that conclusion.  Good job.  I shall add my vote to it.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Robertmontana</span>.<br><br>Reasoning, to summarize, is basically his numerous weak attacks and blatant sheeping in the early game. After he got attacked with an early wagon, he disappeared and only posted content-light posts, trying to stay under the radar.  He finally posts content when attacked again.  This sort of lightswitch behavior is one of my favorite scumtells.<br><br>For posterity's sake upon replacing in, here are a few of my other scumreads:<br><br>Mastin: I hate putting Mastin here, because I really do respect him as a player, but I feel like I have to.  He attacked the RM wagon without giving sufficient justification, and got the Fancy-Pants wagon moving, which I never really quite got.  Looked reachy to me.  Finally, look at his attack on Axxle based on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">seeing him online</span>.  That just feels like scum trying to bait an overly-emotional player, which leads me to....<br><br>Axxle: Playing the emotional card isn't great, nor is incessant sheeping.  He then responds to the criticism by laying heavy praise on Mastin.  Seems very scummy to me.<br><br>Questions:<br>I didn't see anything really damning regarding UN in my first readthrough - I have him on my neutral list.  It was a bit quick, though.  Can somebody point me to a decent case against him?<br><br>Are posts that explicitly state that they are prod-dodging accepted practice these days?  I've seen it a few places, and we didn't do it all that much back when I played before.<br><br>It seems as if most of the players here know about BB's tendency to make a D1 fake claim.  Can somebody explain this to me briefly, as a player who's never played with him?  It seems...bizarre.<br><br>Also, shoutout to Havingfitz!  As I recall, when we last met, you were a newbie with a Gene Frenkel avatar - I'm glad to see that you're still playing!"}

About how, deep down, in my gut, I thought of each of them.<br><br>And I'm typing this without access to the site, so I can't double-check my facts. But I like it this way, because...well, in a sense, I feel as if it makes my reads more pure. I know, that's counter-intuitive; it should corrupt my reads rather than make them less diluted, but I just have this <span style=\"font-style: italic\">feeling</span> that this strategy, of thinking when away from the game, makes the thoughts more valuable.<br><br>redtail--Town. If this guy's scum, he quite frankly deserves to win, no matter who his scumbuddies are. When I came in, I thought the possibility of him being scum was there, but...I asked myself \"in what scenario is redtail scum?\", and I can't come up with anything. 'Guy's the towniest of town players. If he's not town, then he's played so solidly that it'd be scummy-worthy. I just can't see him as scum.<br><br>UberNinja--Town. My mind told me that there was a period where I had a brief doubt about him via my gut, thinking \"maybe his play here <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> different from himself-as-town, and maybe it IS similar to his scum-self, and maybe people like redtail doubting him are right\", but I asked myself, again and again, \"but do I really believe that?\" The answer's no. No, I do not. I picture him in my mind. Over and over again, he comes off being town.<br>The bit of doubt is there (for instance, the thought of him-as-scum knowing that attacking me is a cheap and easy way to gain towncred), but it overwhelmingly still portrays a pro-town picture.<br><br>Pine--Town. Yes, I know, this is not something you'd expect from me, but I thought things through. I thought about my case. And I asked myself, in my gut...did I actually believe it? Did I actually believe my case against Pine, that he was once-again scum, playing to his scum meta? And my gut told me the truth: no, I didn't. The case against him wasn't trying to convince the town; the case against him was me trying to convince MYSELF that he was scum, because deep-down, I didn't believe it, and now that I've thought about it, I still don't.<br><br>BBMolla--I have a hard time concentrating on BBM in my mind (think of it as having a sort-of static interference), but whenever I do, the conclusion is nearly instantaneous: town. Yes, he's been trollish. Yes, his play's scummy-as-hell. Yes, his play here reminds me a little bit of his scum meta. Yes, I know that if he ends up being scum having trolled the town, I'll have felt ridiculous.<br>...But despite all of that, I've got this deep-down feeling that he's town. His mannerisms, his way of talking, the words he uses, his contributions to the game, everything he says, everything he does...scummy, yes. But scum? The doubt's there, sure, but I just can't keep a realistic picture of scuMolla in my mind; it keeps on drifting, over and over again, to BBM being town.<br><br>Cooldog--Town. I know, I initially called him scummy, due to resemblance to GvE, CvL, but the more I think about it, the more he feels...different. His contributions to the game feel as if they're more significant and have a town motive in them. He brings up a lot more logical points, rather than mostly sheeping. He's less interested in debating with others and seems more focused on scumhunting. All-in-all, he feels like an entirely different guy. If he's scum, then he's completely reinvented his scum-play since the last game we played, in an extremely good way. (If the most-improved scummy is still around, I'd nom him if he's scum; his play is just. that. dang. better.) But I find it far more probable that what I see is what I get: that he's as he appears, town.<br><br>Trollie--Surprisingly, I thought of him being town in less than a second. I was like, \"Trollie...town!\" BAM, that quick. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> I know, this guy's been overall null for me most of the game, but...I got that gut feeling, a strong gut feeling, that he's town. He's done some questionable things throughout the game, he's made me doubt him at multiple times, but the more I'm thinking about it, the less doubt I have. He gives me reason to pause, but...I can't shake the feeling he's town. And honestly, I'm willing to trust that gut-read.<br><br>Now here's where things get tricky. {Axxle, fitz, adorkable, RM}.<br><br>adorkable--ambivalent. One moment, I think scum, the next, town. My thoughts stray more and more towards scum, but I can't help but ask myself if that's my biases taking control, or if the feeling's legitimate. When thinking about Venrob, my thoughts definitely lean heavily towards scum, but when thinking about adorkable...their exit from the game and their vote on me both felt...town. adorkable's main post for reads, along with their (lack of) contribution to the game (both before and after) make me question this, but I can't tell. I just can't make a judgment one way or the other.<br><br>fitz--scum. I know, difficult call to make. And I'll admit, I'm having a little back-and-forth in my head, but he's more on scum than on town. A few of the things he's said have seemed town, but a lot of what he says seems as if it has a scum motive behind it. I realize I'm not good at reading fitz (I think town when scum, scum when town), but I think one of the key factors in reading him is to look between the lines. I'll admit, a lot of what he does looks as if he has that town motive, but I see at least an equal amount which seems as if it's scum-motivated. There's also who he's been pushing. Making the assumption that everyone in my town-list is town...who outside that list has he pushed? RM? No, he threw some questions at RM, but ultimately avoided that wagon. Axxle? No, same story. adorkable? No, he's twice said in-thread that the slot needed attention (Venrob needed a prod/replacement, adorkable needed a prod/replacement), and while he's urged that slot to give content, he's given no scumread on them.<br><br>Axxle--scum. The counterpart to Trollie, in that I thought of him for a split-second, and the result came up as scum instantaneously. Does that mean I have confirmation bias against him? Yes, it most certainly does. Do I think that he's scum, anyway? Also yes. I think about his posts. At every point in the game. I try to think of them as town. I have his ISO virtually memorized because of how many times I've looked at it. And yet, no matter which point in the game I go to, no matter where I stick...Axxle always, ALWAYS looks like scum. I don't see town in him. His posts just feel as if they have a scum motive. I can't think of anything he's done which I thought was town.<br>The picture paints him as doubtfully being scum with RM, so he does have that in his favor, but I just had the extremely irrational thought of, \"what if it were bussing?\", and now that I thought of it, I can't shake it off, because he dropped his RM suspicion further on.<br><br>Robert Montana--Scum. I made the call almost instantly, and am surprised at the speed I did so. I keep on thinking about his play, and how it initially pinged my scumdar. I keep on thinking about how he sheeped me. I keep on thinking about all the cases against him, and how they strike a chord with me. I keep on thinking about how much I want to believe them. Balanced against what? What, to make him town? Two things. His initial posts remind me of my style when I was a younger player. Combine that, with Slandaar's \"bad lynch\" part about him.<br>Yet I got the feeling that Slandaar in his grave is going, \"ffs, Mastin, IT WAS A DAY ONE READ!\" <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> A point that others have made as well. <br>And this may or may not be me trying to justify a scum-read on him, but the thought of my posting style having been a null-tell rather than a town-tell comes to mind, since when I did it as a younger player, I had to enforce it as both alignments, lest it become a towntell/scumtell for me to do it/not do it.<br>I also have a gut feeling that somehow, he's been inconsistent on a player. (BBM?) I don't really remember much else.<br><br>Basically, when it comes to RM, a significant part of me is trying to scream out, \"HE'S TOWN!\", but it's being overwhelmed by an overall feeling of, \"shut up, no he isn't\", and when I think things through, I can't help but agree. <br><br><br><br>A tl;dr version is that I can't really see the scum being outside adorkable/fitz/Axxle/RM. My townreads on the other players are just too strong for me to shake. Yes, they're gut reads. Yes, they're not entirely logical. Yes, I can't really explain them, but my feelings are what they are. I just can't shake my view on any of them. Call it confirmation bias, call it stubbornness, call it sheer Mastin idiocy if you'd like, but I simply can't see any of them as scum.<br><br>So by POE alone, it has to be one of the four. And on almost all of them, I have conflicting feelings. I know that I'm having tunnel vision on all of them, I know that my suspicions on them aren't rational, and I know one of them is town, but I can't tell who; I just have this overwhelming feeling, that the scumteam's entirely contained within that list.</div></div></div> tl;dr, the scum're still inside {dorkable, fitz, RM, Axxle}."}

There are, I think, three points of interest.<br><br>A. Your point #2.  I have no gripe with this, although you understate his point; his point is that you promised to read yesterday and didn't.  Regardless, I actually think this is a completely stupid point on Mastin's part, and it has no real relevance to the conversation.<br><br>B. Your point #1.  That is not what Mastin is saying.  Actually, if I understand correctly, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that is the precise opposite of Mastin's point</span>.  Mastin is claiming that you are playing poorly as a feint, trying to get us to think that you are too incompetent to be scum.  He says this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4408146#p4408146\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4407866#p4407866\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.  You are misrepping him.<br><br>C. You address Mastin's case, but no others.  Except for that last line, where you derisively dismiss the idea that you're trying to save a scumbuddy.  But you don't give any reason for said dismissal, and it's not a crazy idea.  Either you have read the whole thread and are acting as if you haven't (mastin's theory), or you haven't read the whole thread and are putting it off to engage with us over Robert.  Neither looks particularly good for you, and I struggle to see town motivation.  Unless you seriously think we're about to mislynch Robert and you have a strong town read on him, you're trying to address a situation without full knowledge of the facts.  That seems like desperation.<br><br>You've also been kind of ignoring BB's meta case, although you have repeatedly stated some variation on \"meta is bull****,\" so I'm not sure I expect you to address that further."}

He's pretty much flat-out admitting it here.<br><br>What he fails to realize, however, is that he's misjudged me. People (except UN <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) aren't morons, so while they see that I've done plenty scummy, they know that I'm not scum. <br>Furthermore, let me tell you two things:<br><br>-One of AP's main points against me is that I've been wallposting, and being confusing, and spamming the thread. This is false, for I have been mostly avoiding walls this game. I have the occasional long post, but most of them are short.<br>...But this also shows extreme hypocrisy on AP's part, since what has AP been doing?<br><br>Spamming the thread and spreading confusion.<br><br>-Furthermore, this kind of flailing when having not caught up is very reminiscent of how I'd expect someone to play when replacing in under heavy pressure. Example: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=21258&amp;f=3&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=12314&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">my flailing here</a>. Desperation, walling, cracking under pressure. Signatures of scum caught.<br>(This also serves as an excellent point showing why I'm not scum now, being that--despite being under heavy pressure--I'm not cracking. You can see this same flailing <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3068277#p3068277\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, after I was confirmed scum via my cop counterclaim the previous day. Basically, when I'm scum, I panic and wall instinctively, trying to get anything to escape my lynch. Pretty much exactly what AP is doing.)"}

I can see no reason other than to avoid suspicion (or that UN is a buddy I guess which is red\u2019s thing from earlier today)<br>(2)\tIn #175 vote is this:<br>Robert (4): TheTrollie, UN, Axxle, FP<br>UN (4): Slandaar, CooLDoG, redtail, BB<br><br>Trollie(1): RM<br>BB(1):Verity<br>Axxle(1): Maestro<br><br>It stays there for a while and then FP talk starts and very very rapidly in #272 its this<br><br>FP(5): RM, UN, Redtail, BB, Mastin2<br>RM(2): Trollie, FP<br>UN (2): Slandaar, CooLDoG<br><br>BB(3): Pine, fitz, axle<br><br>#341 UN jumps off FP and FP moves to BB<br>BB(4): pine, fitz , axxle, fp<br>FP(4): RM, redtail, BB, mastin<br><br>Axxle (1): slandaar<br>Cool(1): trollie<br>Fitz(1): adork<br>UN(1): cooldog<br><br>#430 bb jumps off FP and on axle, cooldog jumps on fp BB becomes L-2 as I jump on it<br><br>#453 is the lynch<br>FP(7): RM, redtail, cooldog, mastin, bb, axle, adork<br><br>Ok this is big and important.<br>a. RM was being so so so so so shady.  To the point where like the only argument I can remember against voting for him was that he was an \u201ceasy target.\u201d  If he is town, scum could have easily pushed that lynch when it was RM(4)v.UN(4):<br>Robert (4): TheTrollie, UN, Axxle, FP<br>UN (4): Slandaar, CooLDoG, redtail, BB<br>Robert lynch could have easily been pushed, but it wasn\u2019t, Robert avoids pushing the counterwagon.  IMPORTANTLY, AS SOON AS Fantsy-Pants gets people suspicious, Robert, UN, redtail and BB (ppl who are critical to the Robert v. un wagons) jump on FP. FP and Slandaar (who are both conftown) stay put.<br>Conclusion: Robert is scum otherwise that wagon would have grown to more than 4 votes.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">very important:</span> if Robert is town, UN &amp; Axxle are scum.  At the very least one of them would have to be otherwise that wagon would have grown faster (because the scum would join it).  This also explains why they both ditch the Robert wagon once fantsy pants comes around.  Also note that Robert is fine switching to fantsy but not to UN.<br><br>b. fuck there was more but im like super multitasking and this is making my head hurt.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tl;dr</span><br>At least 2 of {RM, UN, Axxle} are scum. RM is the starting point.  if he flips town UN and Axxle look very very bad.<br>Im worried about lynching RM but I think he is the best chance we have.  After reviewing this the alternative story where RM is town and UN/Axxle are scum seems pretty persuasive but seeing one of them flip will not resolve this story whereas seeing a RM flip will.<br><br>I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Robert is a good lynch because he is pretty damn scummy, and likely scum.  The reason he is a better lynch than any other scummy candidate is that his flip is going to be the most informative.  There are so many interactions with him, and, critically, this analysis I provide shows how useful RM\u2019s flip is.<br><br>Waiting to hear from him before I put my vote back on. <br><br>Last note, I have a gut feeling that one of {cooldog, redtail and mastin} is scum if RM is town. But my brain says that\u2019s dumb, so I cant really say why I feel this way.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>I'd just like to thank you for this.  I'm glad somebody has finally caught on to what I've been saying for quite some time.  Why did RM vs. UN stall at 4v4?  Why didn't Robert vote UN (who he clearly suspected)?  Listen to this vote count analysis."}

You promised a read on him, but there's more to my request than this, because you're incapable of giving a good read with how you are right now.<br><br>So, my request is rather simple: remove me from your equation. Think of it, without me attacking AP and without AP attacking me. Think of his massive spam as attacking some other generic player using the same logic he is right now.<br><br>What's your read then? Removing your bias towards me from the picture. Removing the mutual attacks between our slots. Getting rid of my piece of the equation, getting rid of your extreme bias on me beyond reason. Looking at AP, without me. Read his posts then. You've had so many more than the required ten, but your read on him as it is right now is entirely dependent on me: me, scum, attacking him, town. Him, town, attacking me, scum. Remove me. Him, ??, attacking some player, ??. Tell me, is he still town?<br><br>Or is he only town for attacking <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">me</span></span>?

That it's <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">my</span> attack on him which gives you a townread?<br><br>And as you might have gathered from the above, I ask you to do the same for RM. Remove my attacks from the equation. Forget my vote for just a second, just for the sake of an unbiased read, and think of all other aspects of RM. Is he still town? As you have been calling him ever since I voted him?<br>Or is your bias towards me (and don't deny it's bias; you're refusing to even <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">consider</span></span> a townflip from me) that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">makes</span> him town?<br><br>And as the last part of this exercise, look at RM and AP's interactions with<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">out</span> me-as-scum.

I don't care if you think it's impossible I'm town. I don't care that you think  this suggestion comes from scum. <br><br>I want to hear from you, what you think of RM and AP. Without confirmation bias towards me. Because, bluntly--like it or not--I'm town, will flip town, and I want to hear it from you now, rather than later, what that'd mean for your reads.<br><br>...And for that matter, while we're on the subject of a flip on me...what if you're right about me and I AM scum? Who are my buddies, and why? Clearly, you're convinced with absolute conviction that I'm scum, so I've pretty much given up on convincing you otherwise. But who am I scum with? Tell me that, UN.

If anything, he'll be roleblocked. Plus, if he really is a vig as he claims, he's limited-shot, so him getting off a shot while being killed isn't too tragic. Furthermore, even if he's neither blocked nor a vig, his death would be pro-town, for the simple fact that, even though *I* think he's town, there may be some lingering doubts on him, doubts a scum NK would remove.<br>UN's had his towncred blown for him, via Trollie hammering in solid point after solid point after solid point, further hammered in by his RM push and RM flipping town, and is one of my primary suspects, along with Kimor.

Furthermore, Trollie's strong play and insistence on his reads means that he's more of a threat to the scum than redtail, and I want him alive for another day. Trollie's more active than redtail, his theories are jiving with me more than redtail's, he's pushing his reads harder than redtail is, and he's less likely to be scum than redtail is. (Not that I'm willing to entertain redtail as scum; he's town, just not AS town.)<br><br>Add in his absence from the RM wagon, PLUS his absence from the FP wagon, and there's no better nightkill in the game than Trollie.<br>Hence, why I elected to stop it.</div></div></div><br><br>And if you doubt my claim, I prepared the proof:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Was typed some time ago</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I have no desire to do so (I want to either have to have used my ability and be able to claim who it's on, OR to be able to counterclaim scum going for an easy fakeclaim, hence my push so hard to get both BBM and RM to claim), but thanks to UN's confirmation bias, it's possible that I may need to claim, so I should begin working on the proof of why I am what I will say I am.<br><br>Of course, the largest hint to people should be my obsession with the nightkill. Yes, that's part of who I am regardless of my role, but the emphasis I had on my failure to see a Slandaar kill coming should have been hints strong enough.<br><br><br>Anyway, first hint: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4348626#p4348626\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro's questioning of BBM's doc claim</a>.<br>Second hint: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4350345#p4350345\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro says he's the doctor</a>.<br><br>If memory serves, I don't have any D1 hints.

If FP claimed doctor, I'd CC, easy 1V1 with me holding more credibility. FP gets lynched, I get NK'd, game continues on with my analysis being used. (In theory, anyway.)<br><br>I remember this, because I specifically pushed for BBM's claim d2. Had his initial claim been anything other than doctor, I wouldn't have done so. But I needed to make sure he wasn't scum, setting up a doc-claim, so I needed a hardclaim of what he was.<br><br>\"Why didn't you suspect BBM if he claimed your role?!?\"<br>The same reason Maestro didn't: because I'm not an idiot. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>BBM's claim was RVS. This was the reason for the hardclaim, as mentioned above. If he was scum planning on using a refuge-in-audacity doctor claim, then he'd be caught by me, but otherwise, I'd have no reason to think him scum.<br><br>This is one of the main reasons when BBM claimed VTown, that I dropped my case against him; if he were scum, I'd have expected a doctor claim or something of similar nature.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>my first real hint wrote:</cite>Also, need to double-check Slandaar townreads and Slandaar suspects. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Was not expecting his kill.</span></div></blockquote> Here's where the real hint begins. My obsession with the Slandaar kill goes beyond what is reasonable for a VT doing NK analysis, for the simple reason that I'm not a VT--<br><br>I'm a doctor, albeit limited. And I felt as if I had failed, for not having stopped the Slandaar kill. As town, yes, I always do NK analysis, but why was it so important to me that I hadn't seen his kill coming?<br><br>Because, simply put, it was my job to have stopped the scum's kill, and I didn't see their kill.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4393802#p4393802\" class=\"postlink\">515</a> was a huge one. Why did I feel as if I needed to be hyper-aggressive?<br><br>Because if I didn't, then the scum would think they could get away with a kill on me, for being town enough to be a threat, but not town enough for protection.<br><br>I was fine with being killed (though I'll admit--I had a little bit of a fear of it), but I wanted to make sure if I was, that people thought it was for my reads, not for my status as town-but-not-town-enough, if that makes sense.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>extremely relative from that post wrote:</cite>At the time, I was a universal townread. Everyone thought I was town. Everyone.

Protected, not doc'd.

If I claimed one-shot doctor first, then RM'd know not to claim a protective role.<br><br>Also, look at post 700 (iso 97), for where I bluntly say I'm not getting lynched; I'm getting NK'd.

Of the five (1) voters, we've got two conftown, one likely-town, and one prob-town. Leaving one name standing out. (Kimor's slot.)

The RM wagon has one conftown, one close-to-conftown, and two questionsables. The UN wagon has one conftown, one obv-town, and two likely-towns. Where are the scum? Why no more scum on RM? Why no more scum on UN? We now know RM's town, so it's not because the scum were avoiding wagoning him. Far more likely is that scum were already on his wagon, and scum were avoiding wagoning their scumbuddy. Both of these point, quite strongly, to UN being scum.<br>The three (1) wagons contain two conftown, so if there's scum, it can only be on the remainder, Kimor. <br><br>Axxle ( 2 ) (L - 5 ) mastin2, UberNinja<br> BBmolla ( 2 ) (L - 5 ) Verity(Kimor), havingfitz<br> RobertMontana ( 3 ) (L - 4 ) TheTrollie, Axxle, Fancy-Pants<br> TheTrollie ( 1 ) (L - 6 ) RobertMontana<br> UberNinja ( 4 ) (L - 3 ) Slandaar, CooLDoG, redtail896, BBmolla<br> Not Voting ( 1 ) Venrob(AP)<br><br>Now we know for a fact that the scum aren't trying to save RM, here, but the fact remains, the RM wagon begins to fade.

It succeeded. The BBM wagon has grown, and a sudden FP wagon as appeared, with both the UN and RM wagons disintegrated. We know the scum weren't protecting RM, so the only name they could have been protecting was UN. Note, the FP wagon has two conftown, one obvtown, and one likely-town. The BBMolla wagon is, bluntly, a piece of junk; none of the names on it are good. Note that there's two conftown and one close-to-conftown on the remnants of the wagons, with the fourth being likely-town.

The BBMolla wagon gains steam, with one conftown on it.

While I don't think that Trollie OR AP were good uses of vigs, when we have players like Axxle running around, it's obvious that at least one of these kills was (at least partially) town-driven, and one was scum-driven.

Because: mastin can beat people to death with walls and make convincing arguments, whereas Trollie just goes \"HE'S SCUM! LYNCH HIM!

Which means a doc got lucky on Night 1 and blocked one of the kills, (I think if it was a roleblocker or jailer that they'd have spoken up, so more likely doc here).<br><br>Thoughts?</div></blockquote><br>In regards to the counter-claim that I discussed earlier, this is the post where I got it from.  I was reading rather quickly due to incoming walls of text, though, so I may have misparsed it.  <br><br>Good point about the hider, I hadn't thought about that...I don't think I've ever played with a hider before, to be honest.<br><br>Me, UN and Fitz posting cannot be a scumtell because we would have had to coordinate times to be posting, which would be stupid.  I didn't know when the mod would open the thread, and I can't imagine anybody else would either.  I think it's only logical that the only 4 really active players in the game have been the 4 posting.<br><br>Otherwise, I need to read the encyclopedia you all posted more fully."}

Yes, that's part of who I am regardless of my role, but the emphasis I had on my failure to see a Slandaar kill coming should have been hints strong enough.<br><br><br>Anyway, first hint: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4348626#p4348626\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro's questioning of BBM's doc claim</a>.<br>Second hint: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4350345#p4350345\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro says he's the doctor</a>.<br><br>If memory serves, I don't have any D1 hints.

If FP claimed doctor, I'd CC, easy 1V1 with me holding more credibility. FP gets lynched, I get NK'd, game continues on with my analysis being used. (In theory, anyway.)<br><br>I remember this, because I specifically pushed for BBM's claim d2. Had his initial claim been anything other than doctor, I wouldn't have done so. But I needed to make sure he wasn't scum, setting up a doc-claim, so I needed a hardclaim of what he was.<br><br>\"Why didn't you suspect BBM if he claimed your role?!?\"<br>The same reason Maestro didn't: because I'm not an idiot. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>BBM's claim was RVS. This was the reason for the hardclaim, as mentioned above. If he was scum planning on using a refuge-in-audacity doctor claim, then he'd be caught by me, but otherwise, I'd have no reason to think him scum.<br><br>This is one of the main reasons when BBM claimed VTown, that I dropped my case against him; if he were scum, I'd have expected a doctor claim or something of similar nature.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>my first real hint wrote:</cite>Also, need to double-check Slandaar townreads and Slandaar suspects. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Was not expecting his kill.</span></div></blockquote> Here's where the real hint begins. My obsession with the Slandaar kill goes beyond what is reasonable for a VT doing NK analysis, for the simple reason that I'm not a VT--<br><br>I'm a doctor, albeit limited. And I felt as if I had failed, for not having stopped the Slandaar kill. As town, yes, I always do NK analysis, but why was it so important to me that I hadn't seen his kill coming?<br><br>Because, simply put, it was my job to have stopped the scum's kill, and I didn't see their kill.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4393802#p4393802\" class=\"postlink\">515</a> was a huge one. Why did I feel as if I needed to be hyper-aggressive?<br><br>Because if I didn't, then the scum would think they could get away with a kill on me, for being town enough to be a threat, but not town enough for protection.<br><br>I was fine with being killed (though I'll admit--I had a little bit of a fear of it), but I wanted to make sure if I was, that people thought it was for my reads, not for my status as town-but-not-town-enough, if that makes sense.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>extremely relative from that post wrote:</cite>At the time, I was a universal townread. Everyone thought I was town. Everyone. (Including a primary suspect, Axxle.)<br><br>So, I said (quite bluntly) to myself, \"Mastin...you're <span style=\"font-style: italic\">screwed</span>.\" <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">  And I decided two things:<br>-My main chance of living was to make sure the scum thought I'd be docced, and<br>-If the scum killed me and I wasn't protected, that people would listen to my reads and know why I died.<br>Hence the playstyle shift.</div></blockquote> Note, I said that my main chance of living was to make sure the scum thought I'd be doc'd.<br>Why didn't I say that my main chance of living would be to BE doc'd?<br>Because I AM the doc, that's why. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>And that's also the wording in the latter--note how I say \"I wasn't protected\". Protected, not doc'd. Because I'm only a one-shot doc, there has to be another protective role present, so while I could be protected (by, say, a bodyguard or a jailkeeper), I couldn't be doctored (because I AM the doctor).<br><br>You can see the NK-spec continue <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4393913#p4393913\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, for good reason. <br><br><br>I pushed for an RM claim for much the same reasons as outlined for BBM and FP: if RM claimed doctor, I'd be there to CC. If I claimed one-shot doctor first, then RM'd know not to claim a protective role.<br><br>Also, look at post 700 (iso 97), for where I bluntly say I'm not getting lynched; I'm getting NK'd. The reason for that? Because the scum can't let me live.<br><br>And there are a few others where I put some similar sentiments of \"I'm confirmed town, so screw your suspicion, UN\" <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">.<br><br>However, none of these are 'crumbs.

Look at my play with the mindset of me as a one-shot doctor, and you'll see it clearly:<br>Why I knew I'd have to be nightkilled, why I was so obsessed with the nightkills, why I wanted to force the hardclaims that I did (in particular, BBM's) so that if any of them were scum fakeclaiming a protective role, I'd be there to counterclaim and set up an easy trade.<br><br>If that's faked, then I had been setting it up for an awfully long time. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}

So expect a post sometime today from me (hopefully). In the meantime...something that has me confused...why would AP essentially fakeclaim being a vig (and thereby most likely drawing a kill) when he could have just come out and said \"Hey..I'm a hider and I'm going to hide behind UN (or whomever).\" If he had announced that what would the negative outcome? I may be wrong on my interpretation of the hider role but I believe if AP had been targetted by vig-fearing scum AND had had the foresight to hide behind someone who wasn't targetted....that he would have survived. Is this correct? So what harm could have come from just announcing to everyone what his intentions were so that we would not be trying to guess what they were? He could have either lived/died and confirmed someone vs the hypothetical mess we are in now.<br><br>Other things that have me concerned...I do not like the way CoolDog handled AP's vig ~claiming. I think scum are more likely to not be paying close attention in a game. I can not see how AP's vig claim and actions could have been overlooked. So a bit leery on all of that.<br><br>Not sure we should be discounting anyone as possible scum...ex. redtail (who seems to be a universal townread despite being one of only two people on both mislynches...Axxle being the other).<br><br>If CoolDog and mastin are both telling the truth then I think UN is probably scum. If one or the other of CoolDog and mastin are fakeclaiming I'd be more inclined to think it was mastin. Not sure I think they are both scum (or town) but considering scum only needs ONE more mislynch to end the game there's no reason to not try a potential game winning gambit. So any claims today would be questionable IMO.<br><br>Also, @ mastin....you seem to put a lot of creedence into the opinions of the dead. FYI...Trollie spend the majority of the first 2 days suspecting Robert and BBmolla. Slandaar was all over Axxle as his D1 came to an end. So why are you discounting BB and Axxle? IMO Trollie and Slandaar are no different than any of the other town players in the game and are subject to be wrong more often than right. Especially Trollie who you are leaning on today. He never even addressed my defense of his unsubstantiated suspicions towards me. His whole case on me was lies and misreps which I called him on and he ignored. Why should I have faith in his suspicions towards anyone else?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl:dr;</span> There is no clear cut lynch today and there are no conftown IMO. Everyone is on the table. And if someone says you aren't you should be worried about getting too much smoke up your ass."}

My thought towards it protecting from a single kill was that there was a serial killer at first. However, with Slandaar's flip n1, along with AP's softclaim d2, I realized that--rather than there being a SK--it was far more probable that there was a limited-shot vig, as I 'crumbed in 1027.

I protected Trollie--Trollie died, anyway. My first thought, without reading anything other than that Trollie died, was exactly that: that I was roleblocked.<br>Then, I began reading what others had posted, and saw Cooldog's claim to have vigged Trollie. And, knowing that my PM specifies I only protect against a single kill, I made the logical conclusion that--rather than me being roleblocked--Trollie was double-killed.<br><br>And, really, unless the roleblocker was limited-shot, I don't see one in the setup, for the simple reasoning that all our PRs claimed so far are one-shot.

My play pretty much says it, though. I've been consistently pushing from the mindset of my role, that my time in this game was limited, and that the scum couldn't afford to keep me around, so that I'd have to make sure I did the best I could. I've been consistently trying to lure scum into a claim where they'd be caught, because if they claimed doctor, and, heck, even if they guessed they should claim one-shot doctor, that I'd be there, ready to hammer home how they're scum, because they neglected to mention the phrase in my PM about stopping only a single kill. I've been consistently scumhunting, rather than coasting by. For instance, look at UN's posts at the end of D1--he released responsibility from his vote, compared to me, who actively drove in the FP lynch, and knew the consequences when FP flipped town.)<br><br>Of course, since nobody will read it all, I'll have to boil it down to a tl;dr version, and maybe a summary of the  tl;dr version, but it won't be hard to do."}

If AP\u2019s kill goes through on UN and UN happens to be town\u2026that puts us in the situation we are currently in (MYLO)\u2026.i.e. scum only a mislynch away from the win. </span></span></span> Furthermore, even if he's neither blocked nor a vig, his death would be pro-town, for the simple fact that, even though *I* think he's town, there may be some lingering doubts on him, doubts a scum NK would remove. UN's had his towncred blown for him, via Trollie hammering in solid point after solid point after solid point, further hammered in by his RM push and RM flipping town, and is one of my primary suspects, along with Kimor. If he's not scum and the scum killed him, they'd be doing us a major favor. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I\u2019m getting the feeling UN never has the strongest of towncred unless maybe he\u2019s getting all his wagons right. Which plenty of us haven\u2019t. How is killing town doing anyone a big favor besides scum?</span></span></span><br><br>I can't protect myself, and if I die, it does nothing but strengthen my stance on the four names: UN, fitz, Kimor, and Axxle.<br><br>Speaking of fitz, if he died, again, it'd do nothing but favors for the town. Same for Axxle.<br><br>BBMolla's a liability to the town as RM was, so if he died, I wouldn't want to stop it. And Cooldog's status as a lurker means he's not someone who'd be missed, either, so I'm not stopping that.<br><br>The ONLY names, therefore, which are town enough to be targeted are redtail and Trollie. My townread on Trollie actually outranks my townread on redtail. Furthermore, Trollie's strong play and insistence on his reads means that he's more of a threat to the scum than redtail, and I want him alive for another day. Trollie's more active than redtail, his theories are jiving with me more than redtail's, he's pushing his reads harder than redtail is, and he's less likely to be scum than redtail is. (Not that I'm willing to entertain redtail as scum; he's town, just not AS town.) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">So being more active means one is more town? Except for UN. But most definitely in your case. Yes? Was that a strawman? My bad.</span></span></span><br><br>Add in his absence from the RM wagon, PLUS his absence from the FP wagon, and there's no better nightkill in the game than Trollie. Hence, why I elected to stop it. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">And as mentioned above\u2026.you use position on the mislynches to clear one player but ignore it\u2019s implications towards others. You can\u2019t have it both ways but that\u2019s what you are trying to do.

Yes, that's part of who I am regardless of my role, but the emphasis I had on my failure to see a Slandaar kill coming should have been hints strong enough.<br><br>Anyway, first hint: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?%20p=4348626#p4348626\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro's questioning of BBM's doc claim</a>. Second hint: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4350345#p4350345\" class=\"postlink\">Maestro says he's the doctor</a>. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Speculation. BB could say he was dropping hints as well.</span></span></span><br><br>If memory serves, I don't have any D1 hints. I was, after all, trying to get nightkilled, so I figured if I did my job, I wouldn't need any. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Why would town try to get NK\u2019d? Especially town that claims to have a protective PR? Which they opt not to use on N1. </span></span></span><br><br>Actually, I did have one--I wanted FP to claim. If FP claimed doctor, I'd CC, easy 1V1 with me holding more credibility. FP gets lynched, I get NK'd, game continues on with my analysis being used. (In theory, anyway.) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">makes no sense.</span></span></span><br><br>I remember this, because I specifically pushed for BBM's claim d2. Had his initial claim been anything other than doctor, I wouldn't have done so. But I needed to make sure he wasn't scum, setting up a doc-claim, so I needed a hardclaim of what he was. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">You mean to say it\u2019s possible that scum could set-up a doc claim? Interesting that you would think that.</span></span></span><br><br>\"Why didn't you suspect BBM if he claimed your role?!?\" The same reason Maestro didn't: because I'm not an idiot. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> BBM's claim was RVS. This was the reason for the hardclaim, as mentioned above. If he was scum planning on using a refuge-in-audacity doctor claim, then he'd be caught by me, but otherwise, I'd have no reason to think him scum. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Your scenario asks why you didn\u2019t suspect BB\u2026not why didn\u2019t you out yourself. If you were really a doc and BB was hinting at being a doc\u2026you could still \u201csuspect\u201d him. But you don\u2019t iirc.</span></span></span><br><br>This is one of the main reasons when BBM claimed VTown, that I dropped my case against him; <span class=\"noboldsig\">if he were scum, I'd have expected a doctor claim</span> or something of similar nature. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I find your words above in bold (by me) ironic and potentially prophectic.</span></span></span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>my first real hint wrote:</cite>Also, need to double-check Slandaar townreads and Slandaar suspects. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Was not expecting his kill.</span></div></blockquote> Here's where the real hint begins. My obsession with the Slandaar kill goes beyond what is reasonable for a VT doing NK analysis, for the simple reason that I'm not a VT--<br><br>I'm a doctor, albeit limited. And I felt as if I had failed, for not having stopped the Slandaar kill. As town, yes, I always do NK analysis, but why was it so important to me that I hadn't seen his kill coming?<br><br>Because, simply put, it was my job to have stopped the scum's kill, and I didn't see their kill. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">But you didn\u2019t even try? In fact\u2026you were trying to get NK\u2019d according to you? Why did you not try to save anyone N1? You were surprised Slandaar was killed.

Protected, not doc'd. Because I'm only a one-shot doc, there has to be another protective role present, so while I could be protected (by, say, a bodyguard or a jailkeeper), I couldn't be doctored (because I AM the doctor). <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">This sounds like you making shit up with what you have to work with.</span></span></span><br><br>You can see the NK-spec continue <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?%20p=4393913#p4393913\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, for good reason.<br><br>I pushed for an RM claim for much the same reasons as outlined for BBM and FP: if RM claimed doctor, I'd be there to CC. If I claimed one-shot doctor first, then RM'd know not to claim a protective role.<br><br>Also, look at post 700 (iso 97), for where I bluntly say I'm not getting lynched; I'm getting NK'd. The reason for that? Because the scum can't let me live. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">And yet miraculously they did????</span></span></span><br><br>And there are a few others where I put some similar sentiments of \"I'm confirmed town, so screw your suspicion, UN\" <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">.<br><br>However, none of these are 'crumbs.

Dr. Mastin. Doctor Mastin. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">This is the closest thing to an actual crumb that I would acknowledge. But just as easily done by scum setting up a fakeclaim as you allude to above.</span></span></span><br><br>It's not much, but like I said, I wasn't really planning on claiming one-shot doctor. Not unless I made a successful protection or a scum player claimed doc.</div></div></div> One crumb not mentioned there is the fact that I knew there was a killing role in this game besides the scum, which I said in one of my posts towards AP. <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?%20p=4412861#p4412861\" class=\"postlink\">post 1027</a>, mastin2 wrote:</cite>Also, I fully believe there's another killing power in play other than the scum's, but it's almost certainly limited shot.</div></blockquote> <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I still see no reason for you knowing there was a killing role in the game besides scum. How would you assume that? In fact\u2026with AP being a hider there is still no proof that there were two kills last night. I lean towards believing CoolDogs claim but the fact remains there is no definitive proof. And MYLO is not the time to take that assertion as gospel. Nor any claims. Especially yours.</span></span></span><br><br>So yeah. AP hid behind Trollie or scum. Cooldog shot Trollie. Scum shot Trollie. I protected Trollie, but my protection only stops one kill. (Originally, I thought the fact that I could only stop one kill pointed to SK, but it was after AP began claiming vig that I realized that the killing role was probably a one-shot vig, as I hinted at above.) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Speculation: AP hid behind Trollie or scum.

The first spoiler there explained, crystal clearly, why I protected Trollie. Compare the section on AP to Trollie:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>those on the RM wagon are going to catch heavy heat, those off are going to be targets--much the same way as those on the FP wagon caught heat and those off were targets. Trollie was on neither.<br><br>AP's a townread, but his BBMolla strategy this game will likely prevent him from being NK'd. If anything, he'll be roleblocked. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Plus, if he really is a vig as he claims, he's limited-shot, so him getting off a shot while being killed isn't too tragic.</span> Furthermore, even if he's neither blocked nor a vig, his death would be pro-town, for the simple fact that, even though *I* think he's town, there may be some lingering doubts on him, doubts a scum NK would remove.<br>[reasons why everyone else is off the list]<br>The ONLY names, therefore, which are town enough to be targeted are redtail and Trollie. My townread on Trollie actually outranks my townread on redtail. Furthermore, Trollie's strong play and insistence on his reads means that he's more of a threat to the scum than redtail, and I want him alive for another day. Trollie's more active than redtail, his theories are jiving with me more than redtail's, he's pushing his reads harder than redtail is, and he's less likely to be scum than redtail is.<br><br>Add in his absence from the RM wagon, PLUS his absence from the FP wagon, and there's no better nightkill in the game than Trollie. Hence, why I elected to stop it.</div></blockquote> You couldn't get much clearer than that. Also, this was typed the minute I submitted a protection on Trollie--once again, in this post, I show knowledge of a limited-shot vig, BEFORE it was claimed.<br>And if you think that I typed all of that post up in the few minutes between my post asking for an RB claim and seeing Cooldog's claim...well, then, you're full of it. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> I'm a fast typist, but I'm not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> fast. As I said, the spoilered sections were typed up before the day began.

People on both mislynches are bad NK targets. (Bad NK targets =/= scummy.) People OFF both mislynches are good NK targets. (Good NK targets doesn't necessarily mean town.) <blockquote><div><cite>fitz wrote:</cite>So being more active means one is more town? Except for UN. But most definitely in your case. Yes? Was that a strawman? My bad.</div></blockquote> This is a blatant misrep. I said Trollie was more active than redtail, so between the two, Trollie's a more appealing target thanks to being more active. Never did I say him being active made him more town. It merely made him a more probable NK. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fitz wrote:</cite>Was typed some time ago? </div></blockquote> Yes. It was typed when UN began pushing for my lynch yesterday, and I thought he was derptown, as indicated in the first paragraph.

Especially town that claims to have a protective PR? Which they opt not to use on N1.</div></blockquote> Because said protective PR is limited-shot. If I were a full doctor, sure, living would be good. But being limited shot, I could afford to die. As for why I didn't use it on N1, that's because I didn't have any idea who the scum would kill, and wasn't sure of my townreads. Had I protected anyone n1, it woulda been redtail, and my shot would have been wasted. Also, you're fighting a losing battle. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=23738\" class=\"postlink\">Check here to see how people would use a 1-shot doc</a>. They'd wait 'til mid-game, not N1.<br>Also, I remember another reason I didn't use it N1--because if there were multiple killing roles and my doc was successful, it could have potentially masked their presence. I wanted to make sure that there was only one kill n1, as that'd help alleviate my SK fears.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you were really a doc and BB was hinting at being a doc\u2026you could still \u201csuspect\u201d him.

Hence, \"because I'm not an idiot.\"<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>We\u2019re there other\u2019s that you would have expected to be killed? And if so\u2026why not protect them?</div></blockquote> See above. 1: I wanted to make sure when I used my shot, that it counted. I didn't have anyone n1 who I was confident enough to use it on.<br>2: I wanted to make sure I wasn't masking a kill. Had I used my shot n1 and had it been successful, yet there was still another kill, I'd have no way of knowing my shot was successful.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I do not recall you ever being a universal town read. </div></blockquote> Except, I was. The playerlist, at the time, was<br>Slandaar--townread.<br>Trollie--townread.<br>FP--had not yet expressed suspicion.<br>RM--townread.<br>UN--townread.<br>adorkable--had not yet expressed suspicion.<br>Axxle--townread.<br>BBMolla--townread.<br>Cooldog--townread. (Or if not town, at the very least not scum.)<br>fitz--townread. (See above; if not town, at least not scum.)<br>Pine--townread. (See above; if not town, at least not scum.)<br>redtail--townread.<br><br>Yes. I was a universal townread. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And yet miraculously they did????</div></blockquote> Because Trollie and Slandaar were better kills than me, yes. As mentioned, my reads change, and I had suspicion on me. Slandaar's and Trollie's wouldn't, and they (for the most part) didn't.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fitz wrote:</cite>Also\u2026UN\u2019s wagon has 3 conftown on it.</div></blockquote> You're just proving my point, fitz--that this was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">all typed out during the night</span>. If I had typed that during the morning, then I'd have said three conftown.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think it is interesting to note that you are putting weight into the previous two votecounts that UN and I appear to have a lot of town on our wagons. AND AT THE SAME TIME\u2026 you are pushing the theory that it was ALL TOWN ON THE D1 MISLYNCH!</div></blockquote> Timing's everything. FP was deadline-lynched. The all-town wagon theory is more probable for that specific reason--because the town doesn't want a no-lynch d1.<br>UN and yourself weren't.

Of course I'm going to consider myself conftown. When I type things out in quick reply, I don't. You're yet again just proving my point, that I made these posts in my QT before Cooldog claimed.

And again, which explanation is simpler?<br>I'm scum, who was pushing hard to get a mislynch that I knew was likely going to happen without my help, only to back out at the last minute hoping to get towncred...<br>...Or that I'm town, who pushed my read until I realized it was wrong?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>-\"Mastin's reads have been all over the place; he's been throwing stuff at the wall, just to see what will stick.\"<br>This is actually a pretty strong towntell when it comes to my play. As scum, I NEVER lack direction. I ALWAYS know where I'm heading with regards to my reads. I have conviction from the moment I enter the game, every day. Consistently, across all of my scum games, you'll not see me show doubt. (With the possible exception of multiscum, where the doubt isn't faked.)<br><br>As town, however, it's there. The uncertainty of the game means that I'm always second-guessing myself. Especially after night. This uncertainty is something I lack the ability to express as scum, since as scum, I already know the setup. (With the exception of multiscum, in which I don't.) Every time I've tried, the results felt extremely exaggerated, because they were. It's not something I can fake.<br><br>But beyond this meta defense, think about how my reads have changed. Yes, they've been all over the place, but so were other players', such as AP's. The reason being, much as in the above (only without meta), that a town player in this game is always looking for the truth, reviewing the evidence and making reads based off of it, rather than making evidence based off of reads. My reads were all over the place, because when I came in, I lacked direction. AP's reads were all over the place, because when he came in, he lacked direction. Ultimately, as the course of the day unfolded, our reads began to solidify, as we got a better hold of the game.<br><br>-\"Mastin nightkilled two players supporting him to frame people!\"<br>Yeahno. This is pretty much the final nail in the coffin for why I'm not scum, because I know not to do this.<br>The last time I-as-scum nightkilled two players supporting me in a game was also the first time I was scum. Yes, THAT long ago. (Either OhGodMyHamlet or OhGodMyVillage. Both are in the Newbie 700s, so check out whichever one of those I'm not the doctor-who-died-n1 in.)<br><br>It didn't work out so well for me. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Because, guess what? By killing the players who had supported me, come mylo, I had no allies left. Imagine that! The WIFOM I had hoped to generate was not strong enough to carry my game through, and I lost the game.<br><br>That's exactly what two nightkills on Slandaar/Trollie would be: killing players who are supporting of me, leaving my only ally as the WIFOM generated from their deaths. That didn't go so well for me three years ago; nothing in the site meta has changed to make it go so well for me now.<br><br>No, as scum, I'd kill a mixture of the people in the middle of the game (redtail, Cooldog, and BBMolla would all be viable nightkills), who're unlikely to be doc'd and doubtful to be lynched. Maybe, if I were feeling bold enough, I'd kill people who had thrown suspicion my way, if I thought I could get away with it and people would write it off as NK WIFOM.<br><br>This defense does go into meta, though, so let me give you an argument which doesn't rely on it: occam's razor. Which is simpler?<br>That I'm scum, who killed two players that would have helped me mislynch UberNinja, in order to help hopefully frame him off of NK WIFOM...<br>...Or that I'm town, and they were killed for their reads?<br><br>-Mod WIFOM. \"No way in hell did he include a phrase about only protecting against one kill\". Only, he did, and the speculation about him not doing so is stupid. See <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4428399#p4428399\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for this in slightly more detail. But to give most of the points:<br><br>I can't really counter the the \"point\", because as I just said, it's not really a point at all. However, if we wanna play games with setup spec, feel free to tell me:<br>-Where's the town power? We've got four claimed one-shot roles. No counterclaims. If my claim were false, that'd be down to <span class=\"noboldsig\">three</span> PRs, all of which are incredibly weak.<br>-Why did I claim something easily countered? With the setup as it is, it'd be pretty much GUARANTEED that there's a protective role, and yet, none other than my own has been claimed.<br>-If I'm scum, where is the protective role? My role is the only one which gives the town any protection from the scum at all.<br>-How did I manage to predict that there was a killing role in the game other than the scum? I pretty much flat-out stated I knew there was one thanks to 1027.<br>-Why do my posts over the days not come across as having a doctor mindset? Can you give an answer?<br>-If I were scum planning on claiming one-shot doctor who got roleblocked on Trollie, why did I back out and instead of saying it was a roleblock, that Cooldog's kill was responsible?<br>*For that matter, if I were scum, why the heck would I claim one-shot doctor? It's not a claim which would save me, unless I sacrificed my nightkill to \"prove\" my claim.</div></div></div><br>SO LET'S GIVE THE TL;DR:<br>-Where's the town power if I'm fakeclaiming? Where's the protective roles if I'm fakeclaiming? Why'd I fakeclaim something easily counter-claimed? Where's the scum motive in my actions? How's my claim at all consistent with my scumplay? How's my play at all consistent with my scumplay? All of these have been asked. None of them answered."}

He makes a mod error, in not calculating whatever nullified my protection. (Unless there's a blocking role that blocked me, it's that Trollie was double-killed, when I can only protect against one kill. This is also proof of my claim, by the way, since if there wasn't a protection role stopping a Trollie kill, what caused the moderator error in thinking Trollie had lived?) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">No comment for fear of modkill.</span></span></span><br><br>Fitz sees Trollie alive. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Speculation:</span> The scumteam is convinced there's a serial killer running around. Fitz votes Trollie. Going off of the above, it'd make sense from a scum's perspective, to immediately jump towards bulletproof SK, rather than doc-protection as happened. Notice how fitz gave no reasons for voting Trollie. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Once again\u2026why would anyone think there was an SK? When I put my vote on Trollie there was only one kill showing up (AP\u2019s). I would have had no reason to suspect a 3rd party killer. See the bullshit you are pumping out? As for Trollie vote reasons\u20261st) not everyone always provides vote rationale\u2026and 2nd) I\u2019m pretty sure my exchange/vote with Trollie on D1 made my continued suspicions obvious. So my reasons were out there. Misrep.</span></span></span><br><br>Then, UN goes about on two crazy theories. The first is that the hider was mistakenly treated as a bodyguard. Yeah. But his third theory instantly jumps to the conclusion of serial killer, with a protection role in the game--why? Why not, simply, that there's a one-shot vig? It's an incredibly common role, which easily augments the 1-shot cop. He ignores occam's razor, and goes for a more complicated \"SK-blocked-by-doc\". <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Speaking of ignoring Occam\u2019s Razor\u2026 what do you think of the people on both mislynches? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"></span></span></span><br><br>Really, the thought of a serial killer comes more frequently from the scum than it does the town. Furthermore, as a final nail in his coffin, he says that I should be lynched today, while <span class=\"noboldsig\">simultaneously pushing an Axxle/fitz/Kimor scumteam</span>. Why would he want me dead when he's pushing three other names? At this stage, I'd point out, it's likely that the scum have no choice but to bus each other. And this fits into UN's scum meta perfectly; in the last game UN, fitz, and I were all present, the scumteam had to bus each other in lylo, while pushing a suspect who was town. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Why do you keep bringing up a SK? How does this have anything to do with anything? It cooooooooould have been a brief consideration between the time the mod changed Trollie to dead and the time CoolDog said he vigged him but otherwise I do not recall any time were an SK was a topic worth consideration. Stop muddying the waters.</span></span></span><br><br>And guess what?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">It worked.</span> We won, because we lynched a townie, rather than one of our buddies. This is EXACTLY what UN was hoping to accomplish, by putting me and Axxle (if my scumteam theory is correct) in his list, along with (out of the blue) fitz and Kimor. He wanted two things from this: 1: Push a mislynch. 2: If a mislynch proved impossible, get towncred for lynching his scumbuddy. Repeat for tomorrow as well. Push a mislynch. If it proved impossible, get towncred for lynching his scumbuddy. And then in 3p lylo (well, 4p mylo), push the mislynch.<br><br>-\"Why is Axxle not scum?\" Well, I can go over his play for previous days, just like I can go over the play of the previous days from fitz, UN, and Kimor/Pine to show you why they're scum. However, you can see the evidence in today just as well. Axxle opens up lylo (well, mylo) by voting for UberNinja, concluding (with a 50/50 chance of being correct) that AP hid behind scum, UN. He proposed that theory. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Axxle voting UN does not make Axxle town nor UN scum.</span></span></span><br><br>Then, fitz asks why it'd explain the two deaths nicely, and Axxle gives clear town reasoning as to why, and he invokes (semi-correctly) occam's razor with regards to the kills.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>Mastin. I want to hear your wall on this because you're much more likely to be town given Trollie's flip.</div></blockquote> This is the exact opposite of what UN was saying before, that he wanted me lynched. <blockquote><div><cite>UN, earlier in D3 wrote:</cite>No, actually. Mastin should be lynched</div></blockquote> I repeat: Mastin should be lynched. Trollie'd already flipped. And now, he immediately reverses around, when Axxle starts pushing him, and says that I'm town, because he's desperate--he needs allies.<br><br>And after Cooldog claims his shot, Kimor comes in and says, simply, \"That's interesting.\" (Which is the \"interesting\" scumtell--those who use the phrase interesting in a game are scum more often than not.) He asks why Cooldog shot Trollie, but to me, this read as being inside knowledge, of Kimor being scum, having shot Trollie, and wondering if Cooldog's an SK. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">The interesting scumtell? Seriously? I prefer the \u201cI\u2019m a doc who didn\u2019t protect the guy I thought was town and ~claimed vig on N2 on the heels of not protecting the guy I was surprised to see killed despite not thinking anyone was worth saving N1 which is also when I hoped to be NK\u2019d myself\u201d tell.</span></span></span><br><br>This day three play (which, as a reminder, is mylo) would be evidence enough to lynch all three of them. Add in the Trollie kill with his suspects, and the Slandaar kill with <span class=\"noboldsig\">his</span> suspects, and the VCA which (other than the D1 lynch and the D2 lynch) strongly points to these three as the scumteam...and, well...it's a pretty dang strong case, even without all the interactive scumtells that all three have been showing. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum don\u2019t ever use WIFOM to their advantage do they?{/sarcasm}</span></span></span><br><br>They've been playing the scum game. I've looked at their isos. With a town and scum mindset in mind. The scum one makes more sense, as they've been playing the long game--playing low enough to stay off of people's radars, while high enough to stay out of trouble. They've been pushing mislynch after mislynch, and are showing zero pause as to why RM (and Trollie) flipped town. (THE VERY SCUMTELL UN ACCUSED ME OF DOING!) I'm not going to say everything they do is scum; it's not. They all have done some townie stuff. However, the overall picture is quite clear: <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Are you accusing UN of playing low to stay off radars. Granted I didn\u2019t post a lot over periods of D1 and D2 but that is how I am. Due to early game lack of interest or suspicions.

Axxle's interactions today with mastin seem less like scumbuddies than I would imagine. There is some genuine confusion going on there.<br>Axxle actually seems genuinely confused as to why mastin keeps pushing him as scum. Either that's because he's a buddy and he's wondering why mastin is stirring shit up about him being possibly scum with a town-result on town-mastin (which really makes absolutely no sense), or he's actually town and confused as to why mastin is throwing dirt on the guy who just \"cleared\" him.<br><br>And then of course, mastin ... We all know that mastin is undeniably thorough... RIGHT?<br><br>...<br><br>WRONG! He's only thorough when it suits his purposes.<br>There have been numerous examples of this.<br><br>So here's what I was thinking.<br><br>Maybe Axxle isn't scum after all. Maybe he IS town, and mastin is a Godfather.<br><br>It struck me as odd that I automatically assumed town/town or scum/scum on them, but mastin KEPT pushing the Axxlescum/mastintown theory. It struck me as VERY odd.<br><br>Mastin being a Godfather would explain why he wants to a) claim credit over and over that \"if you believe Axxle is town, you MUST believe I'm town!\" and b) continues to insist that \"Axxle's not necessarily town! Vote for HIM, instead!\"<br><br>Mastin being a Godfather would also explain why he's been soooo incredibly verbose, but never quite worried about looking town as he pushed the Day 1 mislynch. Most scum players (and indeed, most town players too) are wary of Day 1 mislynches because if they push them toooo hard, they might end up lynched themselves on Day 2. <br><br>OR AT LEAST THEY'LL DRAW AN INVESTIGATION<br><br>I think this was mastin's plan all along.<br><br>1. Get an obv mislynch on Day 1 (on a new, new player), and<br>2. Be as omnipresent and in-your-face as possible while pushing the mislynch, thereby<br>3. Drawing the investigation on Night 1, which would show him as town.<br>4.

Because what fascinated me about this back and forth is how mastin responded to the claim.  Let's explore each possibility in turn:<br><br>Both are scum: Then mastin's response makes perfect sense.  This was quite possibly not planned during the previous night, in which case mastin's confusion is likely genuine and he is working out what to do behind the scenes.  Even if it was planned, mastin's posts could easily be him stalling to see what the town thought of the claim.  Then he staked a position (although not as strong of one as I would expect).<br><br>Both are town: Here we're on shakier ground.  First, the reason given by Axxle for waiting to reveal doesn't hold water.  He knew there was suspicion of mastin yesterday, and he knew that it would only increase.  He had no more PR uses, so he should've come right out and said it.  Yes, it lines up mastin for a nightkill, but better he die by nightkill than be mislynched, costing us the game.  And he had to know that doing it now would be suspicious.  From mastin's side, while he investigates what Axxle said early, he doesn't focus on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">motivations</span>.  I would expect town-mastin to ask himself why scum-axxle would do what he did.  But he doesn't; he instead focuses on voting arguments and what Axxle said yesterday.  So I can't believe this scenario.<br><br>Axxle is scum and mastin is town: Here nothing makes sense.  Did Axxle think this maneuver would give him towncred?  Why isn't mastin asking himself about Axxle's motivations?  Given we're already in mylo, why did Axxle feel the need to upset a very nice applecart?  I have nothing here.<br><br>UN's Godfather theory: This is actually a bit more stable, but it doesn't fully explain Axxle's actions.  We're still stuck with asking why Axxle didn't reveal earlier.  The biggest flaw that I find with this theory is how mastin responded to it; he was far too tentative, and I would expect him to have planned for this and come out much more forcefully.  <br><br>To make a long story short, I'm leaning towards both being scum, although it doesn't answer all questions (notably: why did Axxle feel the need to do this in the first place, and with such monumentally bad timing?).<br><br>More later.<br><br>Finally, I reiterate my calls for a massclaim, especially at this stage."}

When I've come back from a three-month vacation, has specified I'm turning a new leaf, have an eternal newbie philosophy of always reinventing myself, incorporating successful elements of town/scum play into scum/town play, and have been in so many games that someone can make any accusation on me and back it up with a game, and/or make an accusation about me <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> doing something and come up with a game. (By now, it has to be 90+ games on mafiascum in my career, not including marathons.)<br><br>So, bluntly...<span class=\"noboldsig\">fuck. meta.</span> <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I didn\u2019t realize people were using meta against you. I know I haven\u2019t been.</span></span></span><br><br>If people really want to use meta against me, I know my own meta better than anyone else, and can point to any game of any alignment and show any tell to be false. The whole exercise of meta on me is pointless, specifically because using any single game won't work. If you can give the <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">general</span></span> picture saying I'm scum and support it with multiple scum games of mine, then THAT would be worth countering, but you can't, because I'm town.<br><br>On the other hand, I'm perfectly capable of linking to my doctor games in the past and showing how this is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly</span> how I've <span class=\"noboldsig\">always</span> played doctor: aggressively, along with an obsession with the nightkill. I won't, 'cause I dislike the prospect of defending myself with meta, but if someone wants me to, I can. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing some of your Dr games. I do not typically use meta but since you offered.</span></span></span><br><br>-\"Mastin Championed the FP Lynch!\" Yes. Yes, I did. I was wrong about FP and FP happened to flip town, but nobody's explained how my strong push to lynch FP is scummy, other than... -\"Mastin showed no remorse for the FP lynch!\" <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">It\u2019s scummy because it was on a mislynch?</span></span></span><br><br>Except, I did. It's just that it was subtle. My emotions almost always are. I was surprised at FP flipping town, my confidence was wrecked, and I entirely lacked direction, hence the spam-posting during the beginning of the day, to FIND direction.<br><br>If I had deliberately played up my emotions, if I exaggerated my feelings, then THAT would have been a scumtell. But since I'm town, I didn't do that.<br><br>-\"Mastin backed out of the RM lynch for fear of the consequences!\" This and me championing the FP lynch are pretty much mutually exclusive. If I were scum, I'd have no fear of mislynching RM, and in fact would have pushed it through. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">IMO mastinscum would have wanted to avoid being on both mislynches. They are not mutually exclusive. The first mislynch is getting the first day out of the way at any cost and not lose any scum. The second day is stay off a mislynch if possible\u2026especially if there is a really scummy townie whose wagon I help support for most of the day. Yeah\u2026.that\u2019s not scummy\u2026..</span></span></span><br><br>Among other reasons, it'd be consistent with my stance on FP, and far more pragmatically, I could get away with it easily, because of how the RM wagon was flowing. However, because I'm town, the reason I did a 180 on RM is because--as a good town player does when presented with new evidence--<span style=\"font-style: italic\">my read changed to match the facts</span>, rather than (as with confirmation bias) the facts warping to match my read. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">What was the new evidence that cleared RM in your opinion?</span></span></span><br><br>-\"Mastin knew RM would flip town, and wanted towncred for being off the lynch wagon!\" Again, the FP wagon shows why I wouldn't do this as scum. And again, which explanation is simpler? I'm scum, who was pushing hard to get a mislynch that I knew was likely going to happen without my help, only to back out at the last minute hoping to get towncred... ...Or that I'm town, who pushed my read until I realized it was wrong? Yeah. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Didn\u2019t you already make this point above?</span></span></span><br><br>-\"Mastin's reads have been all over the place; he's been throwing stuff at the wall, just to see what will stick.\" This is actually a pretty strong towntell when it comes to my play. As scum, I NEVER lack direction. I ALWAYS know where I'm heading with regards to my reads. I have conviction from the moment I enter the game, every day. Consistently, across all of my scum games, you'll not see me show doubt. (With the possible exception of multiscum, where the doubt isn't faked.) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I do not find wagon hopping to necessarily be an alignment tell. I DO find whose wagon is being hopped on and off and when to be a tell though.</span></span></span><br><br>As town, however, it's there. The uncertainty of the game means that I'm always second-guessing myself. Especially after night. This uncertainty is something I lack the ability to express as scum, since as scum, I already know the setup. (With the exception of multiscum, in which I don't.) Every time I've tried, the results felt extremely exaggerated, because they were. It's not something I can fake. But beyond this meta defense, think about how my reads have changed. Yes, they've been all over the place, but so were other players', such as AP's. The reason being, much as in the above (only without meta), that a town player in this game is always looking for the truth, reviewing the evidence and making reads based off of it, rather than making evidence based off of reads. My reads were all over the place, because when I came in, I lacked direction. AP's reads were all over the place, because when he came in, he lacked direction. Ultimately, as the course of the day unfolded, our reads began to solidify, as we got a better hold of the game.<br><br>-\"Mastin nightkilled two players supporting him to frame people!\" Yeahno. This is pretty much the final nail in the coffin for why I'm not scum, because I know not to do this. The last time I-as-scum nightkilled two players supporting me in a game was also the first time I was scum. Yes, THAT long ago. (Either OhGodMyHamlet or OhGodMyVillage. Both are in the Newbie 700s, so check out whichever one of those I'm not the doctor-who-died-n1 in.) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">WIFOM. Why would scum eliminate their strongest detractors if it was going to attract or increase suspicions from those still alive?</span></span></span><br><br>It didn't work out so well for me. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Because, guess what? By killing the players who had supported me, come mylo, I had no allies left. Imagine that! The WIFOM I had hoped to generate was not strong enough to carry my game through, and I lost the game.<br><br>That's exactly what two nightkills on Slandaar/Trollie would be: killing players who are supporting of me, leaving my only ally as the WIFOM generated from their deaths. That didn't go so well for me three years ago; nothing in the site meta has changed to make it go so well for me now. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I thought you were against using meta. Isn\u2019t that what you are now doing to base your suspicions on you three top suspects?</span></span></span><br><br>No, as scum, I'd kill a mixture of the people in the middle of the game (redtail, Cooldog, and BBMolla would all be viable nightkills), who're unlikely to be doc'd and doubtful to be lynched. Maybe, if I were feeling bold enough, I'd kill people who had thrown suspicion my way, if I thought I could get away with it and people would write it off as NK WIFOM. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">So you learned your lesson and are now trying to reverse?</span></span></span><br><br>This defense does go into meta, though, so let me give you an argument which doesn't rely on it: occam's razor. Which is simpler? <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Occam\u2019s razor should be pointing at Axxle and redtail\u2026something I do not believe you have done, with any conviction at least, prior to this post.</span></span></span><br><br>That I'm scum, who killed two players that would have helped me mislynch UberNinja, in order to help hopefully frame him off of NK WIFOM... <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar WIFOM points to Axxle. Trollie points squarely at UN. Which scum UN would have realized. Which a scum group not including UN would have realized as well. WIFOM WIFOM WIFOM WIFOM</span></span></span><br><br>...Or that I'm town, and they were killed for their reads?<br><br>-Mod WIFOM. \"No way in hell did he include a phrase about only protecting against one kill\". Only, he did, and the speculation about him not doing so is stupid. See <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4428399#p4428399\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for this in slightly more detail. But to give most of the points: <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I do not know what any role PMs that may or may not exist may or may not say. Other than mine. Which says I\u2019m town. </span></span></span><br><br>I can't really counter the the \"point\", because as I just said, it's not really a point at all. However, if we wanna play games with setup spec, feel free to tell me: -Where's the town power? We've got four claimed one-shot roles. No counterclaims. If my claim were false, that'd be down to <span class=\"noboldsig\">three</span> PRs, all of which are incredibly weak. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">How do we know this game isn\u2019t weak all around? Would it still be weak if all the mafia had no PRs? Or is they only had one or two 1-shot PRs as well? Who knows? Maybe it isn\u2019t weak? We know we had a cop (investigative). We know we had a hider (investigative/protection hybrid) and we probably have a vig (town aligned killer). If mafia has limited or nonexistent PRs\u2026that\u2019s not too weak for town. And without knowing what if any of scums PR\u2019s could be\u2026we\u2019re to believe there are 2 MORE town aligned PRs? With Kimor as yet to claim iirc? </span></span></span><br><br>-Why did I claim something easily countered? With the setup as it is, it'd be pretty much GUARANTEED that there's a protective role, and yet, none other than my own has been claimed. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">After BB\u2019s early ~gambit claim and your comments wrt Maestro and your\u2019s feeling out of his claim\u2026you very easily could have assumed there was no doc and it was safe to claim. Worst case you would out a real doc.</span></span></span><br><br>-If I'm scum, where is the protective role? My role is the only one which gives the town any protection from the scum at all. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Does there have to be one? Is that the recipe for this game? Did the hider not provide AP a certain degree of protection (if used properly)?</span></span></span><br><br>-How did I manage to predict that there was a killing role in the game other than the scum? I pretty much flat-out stated I knew there was one thanks to 1027. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">AP had softclaimed vig. It wasn\u2019t a reach.</span></span></span><br><br>-Why do my posts over the days not come across as having a doctor mindset? Can you give an answer? <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Thinking ahead which you\u2019ve provided examples of doing in this game\u2026or being of a mind of.</span></span></span><br><br>-If I were scum planning on claiming one-shot doctor who got roleblocked on Trollie, why did I back out and instead of saying it was a roleblock, that Cooldog's kill was responsible? <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cause CoolDog fcuking claimed it??!</span></span></span><br><br>*For that matter, if I were scum, why the heck would I claim one-shot doctor? It's not a claim which would save me, unless I sacrificed my nightkill to \"prove\" my claim.</div></div></div> <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Uh\u2026because the previous flipped PRs were both 1-shot???? Are you pretending obtuse?</span></span></span><br><br>SO LET'S GIVE THE TL;DR: -Where's the town power if I'm fakeclaiming? <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cop, Hider, ~Vig against TBD scum might be all required.</span></span></span><br><br>Where's the protective roles if I'm fakeclaiming?<br><br>does there have to be one and 2) Did the hider not offer AP protection if used properly?[/b][/color]<br><br>Why'd I fakeclaim something easily counter-claimed? <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">You waited until D3 and the potential of a doc had been somewhat vetted by you and Maestro once BB brought it up.</span></span></span><br><br>Where's the scum motive in my actions? <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">WTF?

Additionally, <blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>Ahem.<br><br>Vote: BBmolla</div></blockquote> He hops onto the easy target of BBM, yet ignores the similarly-posting RM. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>Do I have to think someone is scum to vote for them?</div></blockquote> Blatantly dodges redtail's question (as redtail points out), and also pretty much admits to voting without reasoning.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>This is the kind of early game post I like to look at where newbscum talk about theory and try to look helpful to look town.<br><br>Vote: RobertMontana</div></blockquote> In addition to this being a chainsaw of fitz, this is also incredibly scummy, for the simple matter of timing--he's quoting something RM said on PAGE ONE, as evidence against him. UN saw this post before. HE EVEN QUOTED IT ON PAGE ONE. And yet, only NOW, after RM attacks fitz, does it become suspicious to him? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cooldog wrote:</cite>Doesn't explain his reads, and then changes his vote to take attention away.

At the time you were voting Axxle, he had 2 posts, both solidly in RVS. Nobody at the time was making posts with content.

UN's wagon has (to me) two conftown with a third obvtown. RM's has one conftown, UN, and suspect #4 of Axxle. Yeah.

There's no scum here, because UN himself is scum.<br><br>UN's defense in post 154 is also pretty horribad in hindsight, where he basically brushes off BBM and Cooldog's votes as being based off of previous game biases, rather than (the rather more likely) legitimate reads based off of the CURRENT game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>If I was scum I'd probably push for his lynch at this point because it is annoying as fuck.</div></blockquote> Except...<span style=\"font-style: italic\">this is exactly what UN was doing</span>. His vote was on RM still, yet he was actively pushing BBM as well. 127, 113, and 98 as just a few.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RM wrote:</cite>In response to UN, I suspect you as scum indepedently of BBMolla's accusation. So do a few others. Can you respond to that rather than simply stating you are obvstown because you are being tunnelled by someone even though you are their third vote?<br>---<br>My point is, all of those posts before stated that you weren't scum because BB is wrong. What do you say to those people who voted you before BB? To answer your question of what you should say to those accusations, make your case on me. If you truly believe I am scum, you should try and convince people that I am a better option. If you are scum, I can see how you would not like this option as the more of a case you make on someone you know to be town, the more likely you are to be caught out. Nevertheless, point is; people have other reasons for suspecting you apart from BB's accusation, so don't focus on that.</div></blockquote> <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>BBM wrote:</cite>So let me get this straight<br><br>Everything you've said points to me being town<br><br>But you want to vote me<br><br>?</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>We are operating under the assumption that you're confirmed scum.<br>Meaning that WIFOM such as that last question is entirely irrelevant.</div></blockquote> He completely dodges RM's question of \"who else\", which was always legitimate.

Fitz got to four votes. Of them, two are confirmed town, and both the remaining aren't in the lynch pool. (BBM and redtail.) Why did this wagon fall apart by the next page? Why weren't there scum interested in hopping onto fitz? He had left himself wide open to attack. There was clearly interest. Why did his wagon just vanish so quickly?<br><br>As with UN, the evidence strongly implies only one answer: that fitz himself is scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RM wrote:</cite>Fitz is more of a gut read which will develop with more content, but his reponse to redtail looked like he wanted to focus on the structural problems of the argument rather than disputing its truth. He hasn't had any real suspicions so far and his vote on redtail is still heavily couched (\"Vote redtail because he came late and is distorting things\"). Feels like an accusation in order to have an accusation. IMO, bad/poorly reasoned/semi-RVS reads are generally decent scumtells, so I am happy with my vote at this stage.</div></blockquote> Additionally, the vote on redtail was also OMGUS, now that I think about it. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Slandaar wrote:</cite>I agree with Robert.<br>Why is it scummy to believe someone is town so early fitz?<br>Note: UN's posts, why are you not after him?</div></blockquote> This is also a point against UN, but it's mainly against fitz.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mod wrote:</cite>BBmolla ( 3 ) (L - 4 ) Axxle, UberNinja, Verity<br> havingfitz ( 1 ) (L - 6 ) RobertMontana<br> redtail896 ( 2 ) (L - 5 ) Fancy-Pants, havingfitz<br> RobertMontana ( 1 ) (L - 6 ) TheTrollie<br> TheTrollie ( 2 ) (L - 5 ) CooLDoG, BBmolla</div></blockquote> Basically, this shows exactly how effective the scum were at dismantling the wagons on them. There's a flash-wagon on BBM made up of Axxle, UN, and Verity(Kimor). Furthermore, the two lead other wagons are redtail (obvtown) and Trollie (conftown)! The UN and fitz wagons have completely vanished in one page, in favor for a strong BBM push which lasted on-and-off throughout the day. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>UN wrote:</cite>Why did you wait until BBmolla said something, before you actually voted fitz?</div></blockquote> Pretty blatant chainsaw from UN, here. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RM wrote:</cite>@Fitz, this is what I meant by couched. After arguing against redtail for all that time, you vote him but then immediately add these caveats about it being about lateness and \"IMO\" distorting of facts. It's like insurance for the town flip, which isn't how town thinks. While we're at it, you are doing the same thing to me as redtail - you are saying our arguments are no good but not offering an alternative than we must be scum for doing so. In my last post, I asked for your reads on you think is scummy and so far you've only offered weak indications against those against you.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fitz wrote:</cite>What is the case on UN? I think Cooldog and redtail are off the mark with their reasoning and the other two appear to be holdovers from RVS.

Which continues, here:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>redtail....please provide an example of UN dodging attempts to justify his ~RVS Axxle vote between posts 26 and 61.</div></blockquote> The defense continues in 119, where he says he's not willing to put much suspicion on UN, citing his activity as well as his past game with UN.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>fitz wrote:</cite>I'm not sure on the UN wagon.

Why did he want to not be voting?<br>And for that matter...who was fitz suspecting at the time? He had nothing, and was giving nothing. Why did he say he was going to specifically wait for replacements? Why not actively generate content and get reads <span style=\"font-style: italic\">before</span> the replacements came in? <br><br>I'd highly recommend reading Slandaar's banter with havingfitz on page eight, as it brings up many good points about fitz, some of which I outline above.<br>Boiled down, fitz wasn't bothering to scumhunt at this stage in the game. He was just active lurking, posting for the sake of posting, without contributing anything constructive.</div></div></div></div></blockquote> The Kimor case is blank, 'cause I stopped on page ten, and that slot doesn't start having anything 'til pretty much that page. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>But as I said. The play here is making me reconsider my reads. For instance, I'm beginning to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">heavily</span> suspect that I'd be dead by now (via lynch) if Axxle wasn't scum. (Again, Cooldog's pretty much conftown, so that means that unless both UN and fitz are scum, my wagon should have been hammered, yet Kimor's not on it, nor are redtail or BBMolla.) He can't jump onto my wagon without scumclaiming, after all. Also, that's one of the key differences between my reads and Trollie's--I called UN/fitz/Kimor (with Axxle as the fourth). He called UN/fitz/Axxle (with Kimor as the fourth)."}

And my plan as scum is always that I'm the most expendable member of my team (except when I'm the scum PR), the first to go down if any of us go down at all, because I've never had a solo win as scum. <br><br>As town, my plan is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">always</span> to end up dead within a couple of night phases. Living 'til lylo is an utter failure to me, because historically, lylo is when I'm most under stress, consistently doubting myself. (For instance, look up Reck's Sexy Sedilla. I got into lylo, expecting to be mislynched. And even if I wasn't mislynched, I expected the scum to vote me. Nope! To my absolute shock and horror, the other two crossvoted, leaving me to painstakingly comb the thread, put many hours into the game, and on the night before deadline, pull an all-nighter and when I could take no more, when I had to go to sleep, it was still something like 55/45 when I cast the hammer vote. I swore that I'd never be under that kind of stress again, for good reason. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">)<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Cause CoolDog fcuking claimed it??!</div></blockquote> You're not getting the point. If I were scum, planning to claim that I was a one-shot doctor who protected Trollie, but ended up roleblocked...then why did I switch from the roleblock plan to the Trollie-double-killed-with-doctor-only-protecting-against-one-kill plan? If I stuck with the roleblock claim, that'd have been simpler. \"I protected Trollie. Trollie died. I must have been roleblocked.\" Is a LOT simpler than, \"I'm a one-shot doctor. I protected Trollie, but my shot only protects against one attack, so Trollie must have been double-killed.\"<br>Occam's razor applies to scum plans as well, you know. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Which is the simpler scum plan? The former (which didn't happen), or the latter?<br><br>That's the point.

(Well, it worked good for the first day, at least. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) I give the reason I think I have my gut townread on UN, and say that Pine's entrance along with fitz's Trollie's and UN's posting seemed town. The IioA post I made was typed in the QT, and I outline my five-step scumhunting method plan.<br>6-10: I do some initial analysis and give my first true readlist, which had Pine, fitz, UN, and Slandaar as town with RM as suspected town, BBM as possible town, and both redtail and Cooldog as maybe-town, with a mild scumread on FP and three other nulls. And I say in my QT my role. (I had forgotten about that.) <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Oh, and I might as well put this here:<br><br>I strongly, STRONGLY suspect there's a town jailkeeper this game.<br>Why?<br><br>Think about it--2of4, the newbie setup.<br>Doc-JK.<br><br>Broken.<br>Incredibly overpowered.<br><br>...So the solution?<br>Weaken a town PR.<br><br>What is a 1-shot doctor other than a weakened doctor?<br><br>Yeah.</div></blockquote>  I point out FP's likely the scum PR, thanks to the resistance to that lynch, and bump Pine down to null, giving a revised scumlist, nearly identical to the last but with Pine in null and redtail up with RM and how I lean towards some of the nulls.<br>11-16: I talk about how I'm a universal townread and what that means, do my research into FP, admitting he could be town and what that'd mean, along with me catching Axxle lurking. <br>17-20: I mention my scumday has passed, and make assumptions on what will happen if I live through the night, outlying my intention to vote BBM to force a hardclaim, and once he does, adork/pine, outlining why. I also do some analysis on the lynch votecount and adorkable's single true content post. <br>21-24: I go into serious doubt mode. Trollie could be scum, trollie could be town. I wasn't certain of my scumteam at all. There's my QT post I quoted in-thread about Trollie's BBM push, along with a comment about how I almost said, \"Hey, slandaar, why aren't you posting?\", but stopped myself when I realized why, angsting about me living. <br>25-30: Decide to trust my gut and to screw logic.  I explain the difference between my town self and scum self, along with trying to make scumteams but miserably failing. Then, my sleep-post which I quoted in-thread. My next post was me showing my 'crumbs. I also ranted about how there were too many obvtown players to protect (at the time), which were redtail (who before then was my #1 protection choice), Kimor, UN, and Trollie.<br>31-36: I focus on RM being scum for a while, but when I change my vote to Kimor, I outline the reason why in my QT. And with that turnaround in the game, I begin speculating on scumteams.<br>37-39: night two posts, all of which I quoted in my claim.<br>40: Case.<br>41: My UN-Axxle scumteam theory.<br>42: What I was going to post, but I want to wait for a redtail claim, just in case."}

And had I done so, I would have re-opened my case (I still have that tab open where I was working on it), and hammered in my offense. (My defense was about as rock-solid as I could get.) I would have hammered in all the interactions, all the things Slandaar and Trollie were saying, all things pointing to AP's hide-behind-UN. I would have pointed out their staying on me rather than switching to Axxle more than I already had. (Though that said, UN not switching was smart, since it was one of the main things making me hesitate on calling Axxle town. Ultimately, I would have; see also, how I was reconvincing myself I wasn't wrong and how Axxle had no scum motive for his claim.) How they were desperate to force the lynch through on me.<br><br>I have nobody to blame but myself that it took me that long, that by the time I had re-gathered myself, it was too late, though ultimately, with BBM refusing to play the game, and Cooldog not even remotely listening to what I was saying, it almost certainly wouldn't have made a difference. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> A strong offense does no good if the offense is altogether ignored. I'd already made the more concise points for why they were scum, and those weren't enough; I had already made the concise points for why I wasn't scum, and that wasn't enough, so the strong offense wouldn't have done much, considering how little the strong defense did.<br><br>This game <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> proof of why my belief in NK-analysis is justified, though. When I was a newb, the scum couldn't get away with killing the people largest suspicious of them. Now, as this game proves, they most certainly can. I was right in almost every single point I was making on d3.<br><br>All-in-all, I don't really think I coulda done much better than I did. The FP mislynch, while my fault, helped steer me in the right direction. AP's play during the second half of d2 along with Kimor's play at the same time got me where I needed to be, getting RM out of my scumlist, getting AP out of my scumlist, and putting in their place the (correct!) Kimor-UN scumteam. With fitz in both. (And Axxle, since Axxle played a lot like I'd expect scum to, and he had plenty of interactions with the other three. It wasn't 'til d3 that I had any reason to think him town.)<br><br>So really, it was AP who I owed the most to. He turned me from thinking him and RM to be scum, into where I needed to go. It's just that it wasn't enough, because I didn't drive it hard enough. Guess that's my largest mistake this game: I never went hard enough. I pushed, and I pushed hard, but I didn't push as much as I needed to push. All the scum were off the d1 lynch; I felt it, and I needed to push that. All the scum were ON the d2 lynch; I knew it, and that lynch was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">horrendously</span> scumdriven, but I didn't push it hard enough. The push on d3 was horribly scumdriven, yet I didn't hammer that home hard enough. I can't really say, though, that if I were to play this game again, I'd do so differently.<br><br>In <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> game, me not having conviction was a weakness for the latter half. However, the <span class=\"noboldsig\">first</span> half of the game is proof of why having conviction isn't always a good idea, since my absolute belief in FP got an all-town mislynch d1, and my absolute belief in AP-RM could have easily cost the town the game. Hence, why I don't think I'd do this game much differently than I did.<br><br>Guess this just means that I need to change my approach. Be willing to change early-on and solidify myself later-on, rather than solidifying myself early-on only to doubt myself later-on. So maybe that's what I'd have done differently. It's a good learning exercise, though, and I've got a few MD posts to make about this game. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:90%\"></div><br><blockquote><div><cite>AP wrote:</cite>My crumbs were very clear.

Your posting over the course of d2 was, after all, quite...shall we say...not solidified. Near the end, it was beginning to get solid, but that's one of the reasons why the RM mislynch was bad: because it cut off discussion, preventing you from having further solidified them. It was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">possible</span> you hid behind Axxle, but I was beginning to rule that out. It was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">possible</span> you hid behind Trollie, but I didn't think you did. It was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">possible</span> you hid behind Kimor, and this was the most likely alternative to the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">probability</span> that you hid behind UN. I was getting more and more convinced of said probability, but like it or not, it was just that--a very strong probability, not a certainty.<br><br>That said, you're right. I shoulda pushed it harder, myself. And because I was becoming more and more certain of it, I should have made that explicit, and it's my fault for having failed to do so."}
