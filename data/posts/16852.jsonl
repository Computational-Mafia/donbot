Mafia is a game. Please try to have fun while playing it. Blatant personal attacks on other players will result in warning optional modkill and auto-loss to the offending player.<br>\n2. You have been given a win condition and it is your job to try and fulfill it. Do not deliberately play against your win condition and/or deliberately hurt your faction with your play.<br>\n3. Do not quote your role PM. Do not quote from any mod-provided private QT. Both these will result in modkill and auto-loss.<br>\n4. Talking about the game outside the thread or any mod-provided QT is forbidden. Unless the offense is incredibly minor (i.e. brief mention of the game without discussing any of its content), this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>\n5. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts, do not do so, this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>\n6. Unreadable text is forbidden. This includes but is not limited to cyphers, incredibly small text and invisible text.<br>\n7. Dead players may not speak in the thread once they are dead. Not even a simple &#8220;Bah&#8221; post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rules Of Voting And Deadlines:</div><br>\n8. Votes must be bolded and in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Havingfitz</div>. I suggest using the vote button when placing your vote to ensure it is formatted properly and easily noticed.<br>\n9. You have the option to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div>.<br>\n10. Unvotes are not required but should be bolded when used.<br>\n11. A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1. For example, Day 1 will have 13 players alive, and ((13+1)/2) = 7 votes to lynch.<br>\n12. After a lynch or no lynch occurs the thread will be locked once I announce the result. Posting can continue until the thread is locked.<br>\n13. Day 1 will last 3 weeks. All future days will last 2 weeks. All nights will last 72 hours.<br>\n14. If no player reaches a majority of votes by the deadline on a given day, No Lynch will occur.  <br>\n15. If a player does not submit a night action by the end of any given night, they will not act that night.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rules Of Activity And Prods:</div><br>\n16. If a player goes 72 hours without posting in-thread, they will be prodded. If they do not post in-thread within 24 hours following a prod, they will be replaced.<br>\n17. Please let your mod know if you will be on V/LA &#8211; post it in-thread and bolded.<br>\n18. Players are allowed two prods. Player replacement takes the place of a third prod.<br>\n19. Players may request a prod on another player if a player has gone without posting for 72 hours and I have missed prodding them.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rules Unrelated To The Previous Categories:</div><br>\n20. Though I am the mod, I'm not exempt from making mistakes. If I screw up something, please PM me and point it out.<br>\n21. My color is <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">blue</div></div>. Do not use it.<br>\n22. Vote counts will be posted at my discretion and by request if necessary.<br>\n23. Anything game related that needs brought to my attention (ie votecount and prod requests, v/LAs, etc) must be bolded and preferably start with &#8220;Mod, &#8220;</div></div></div><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:75%\"></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample Vanilla Town PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Hi.

In regards to C, this is my second open setup, I normally stick to closed setups.<br>\n<br>\nSo lets just get this right:<br>\n<br>\n- I dislike RVS, you say refraining from using RVS is a scumtell.<br>\n- I bring up questions, you attempt to discredit the questions before an explanation was given towards them and before they had a chance to work at all, you state those questions are a scumtell.<br>\n- Someone points out that disliking and refraining from using the RVS is a null-tell, you instantly turn the previous scum-tell on me towards 'anti-town' behavior even though you understand the RVS vs RQS debate.<br>\n- I explain the reasoning behind the questions, you state that you don't think Meta-exists or is relevant thus the questions are still a scum-tell<br>\n<br>\nHave I got that right? Because from what I'm reading you're attempting to change your reasoning behind the vote whenever it suits it, you seem to have your tunnel goggles on.", "time": "Sat Mar 12, 2011 4:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=50", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

Then that person and myself will disagree. See pt.3<br>\n2. I mean that you need to look at refusing to RV as a section of time a person was refusing to play. For example: You are not RVing, but you're still investigating. IE: not lurking. The first guy who said he wasn't going to RV hasn't said anything else since, but it's still early.

Your entire argument for it being a scumtell depends upon a person not having any good reason for refusing to RVS. If they think RVS is useless, then regardless of whether or not you agree with them their action isn't scummy. <br>\n2. What you're saying here is a response to something..but not to my second point. Again, in case you just didn't understand me, my second point has been focussed on your suggestion that refusing to RVS might be relevant \"down the track\". My problem is that either a person's refusal is scummy or not - how it looks later on is irrelevant.<br>\n3.

The idea of 'Just because seomeone used those methods doesn't mean they will do it again' really shows how little attention you paid to my posts because I explicitly said that although it doesn't mean they're going to play that way this game it gives us some basis to work from.

Watching the progression of my own arguments, I have been being terrible, for reasons that you guys have been swift to point out. I am, for the moment, satisfied with the answers given by Regfan. If he had any other questions I failed to answer though, point them out. I might have missed them scanning through the flurry of events that occured while I was away. I didn't think we'd hit page 4 so fast in a 3 week long game.

People who voted for me first, I accept your reasoning, so understand that my dislike of Bgg and Yura's votes is not by any means OMGUS. I was tunneling, as stated earlier, and am going to let me eyes wander a little more, and stop focusing so much on Regfan. As for why Bgg and Yura or my new persons of interest is because bgg decided I hadn't posted \"in the longest time\" when at the time of bgg's post(4:50 pm server time) since 8:30 am. A whole 8 hours and 20 minutes. Why, that's almost as long as a SHIFT AT A FULL TIME JOB(Plus or minus commute). And Yura is on the block for so suddenly and rediculously bandwagoning. And thusly, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote:Yura-chi</div>. Bgg is promising more logical reasons, and I'll decide if I think he's scum-hunting or not when the time comes. Yura, though, has nothing more then \"Oh, yeah, he has been quiet...*L-3*\".

At the same time, the game simply becomes impossible if you even seriously entertain the idea that somebody is trolling rather than playing seriously.  At the very least, Magnetic's play has a clear scum motivation. I don't want to run away from that, and also permanently protect Magnetic, by giving him an out on the basis that he is 'trolling'. And, don't forget, aside from the scum motivation, bear in mind that trolling =/= town. If he is trolling, that has no relationship to his alignment.<br>\n<br>\nSo, whilst I am conflicted on magnetic, I think the balance favours him being lynched immediately. The only reason for keeping him alive is if we think he is trolling - but if we give him an out on that basis, he will never be lynched.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CKD wrote:</cite>\nYuro is a bad vote, vollkan you SHOULD know better than that day 1...interesting..\n</div></blockquote>\n\nDid you even read what I said?

He promised more logical reasons soon, and so I reserved specific judgement on his vote until he did. Now that he didn't, I think it pretty clearly was an attempt at a wagon. His defense of Bgg is also suspect, though mostly because I've never actually heard of 'strong doctor'(I have heard of, and seen, the use of the 'weak' prefix before, which I've seen on cops as well as doctors to mean that if they try and target scum, they die.) It's possible I misunderstand, and when Bgg said \"strong doctor\" and just mean \"normal doc\", but even in that case, there's no benefit to a doctor fake-claiming a role identical to his own, but slightly worse. <br>\n<br>\nAnd, Max, the reason we want to stretch the day as long as possible is because on N1, a townie will almost certainly die. We need to learn as much information as we possibly can today, related to things ASIDE from Magnetic. For the moment, Magnetic, Yura, and Bgg are on my list, in that order.

Knowing this, it's foolish to read too much into why the targets were chosen. We can't know the scum motivation for killing any particular player, so it would be unwise to lynch somebody on the basis of assuming we know those motivations. The killer might have picked tclawren because he considered him a strong town candidate, but unlikely to be watched. He might have picked him purely randomly. He might have picked him with the intention of making the exact argument you're making on D2 to fuel the lynch of an innocent. Also, the \"optimal\" kill isn't necessarily the player that has already expressed suspicion of the actual scum, it could be the player that is considered most likely to eventually pin point the scum and lead a wagon against him.

I simply don't see a mafia making this MANY mistakes, I should say. Slip once or twice, yeah, but even under pressure I consider it more likely a desperate townie fumbling for survival then I do a scum fumbling for his disguise.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, before you guys go pinning us together, remember that if we all just agreed on one person who defended themselves alone, cases would be pretty shitty 90% of the time. I mean, in this case yes, I specifically believe Bgg to be scum, but there are times when a player will disagree just to play Black Hat.<br>\n<br>\nI think Bgg was uncertain of Magnetic, since his plays were so completely off the wall. I honestly didn't know if he was scum or town when I hammered, but I did know that he'd do us an enormous amount of harm to keep him around, even as a townie.<br>\n<br>\nAs for CKD and Regfan, I can't say much of CKD. He gave himself a 59% chance(his own words) that Pappums was scum(wrong 0-1). His stupid BS about pressure is tough to read, but I'm inclined to just think it's childishness. He also hasn't been posting much, though his posts have a tiny bit more content then other people's. Both of them seemed to still think that Magnetic was on the level, but confused/stupid, or at least still credible ENOUGH to have reasoning. I doubt BOTH of them were, though. I'm more inclined to find CKD scummy, of the two, though I wouldn't toss out the idea of a team between them.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nmafia edit: At least we can agree on something, Sub. And you can keep your vote on Bgg. Your case is a solid one, and the only thing I have to argue it is meta(which is thin at best) but it's what's staying my hand. I've seen town act the way he is, but not scum. I'm also curious as to which comment made Max rethink, but only curious.

In either case, you are indicating suspicion. The only difference between the two is, as I indicated in the analogy above, that the latter gives you a form of plausible deniability.<br>\n<br>\n(FTR, the reason it gives plausible deniability is right there in bgg's post - it doesn't rely \"on the people, and whatever else that they might have done\". In other words, he quarantines the reason for suspicion from the subjects of the suspicion.)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>SC wrote:</cite>\nHe hasn't actually done anything pro town, so much as he has played almost exactly the way I used to when I was first starting to play mafia, false scum-tells and all, I haven't seen anything majorly wrong come from him, just a lot of small things, so I am disinclined to comdemn him just yet. I think he, at worst, reads null to me, but I am more inclined to read 'misguided town' in his actions. Things like 'are you vig' aren't something even the worst of scum would outright ask, after all. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nHow do you think his play would differ if he was scum? <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>SC wrote:</cite>\nAs to the second point, what conclusions do you draw from him changing his mind?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWell, I don't think he did \"change his mind\" in the sense of forming a different opinion. The point is that he clearly made an attack on whoever wanted the day to end quickly. Then, when called out on this, he has resorted to this weird semantic defence about how he wasn't attacking anybody in particular but, rather, was attacking their conduct - like it makes a difference.<br>\n<br>\nSo, with that in mind, the scumminess in this is not a contradiction but, rather, the fact that he is refusing to actually commit both to defending his position and identifying his suspects and, instead, is just playing word games.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>bgg1996 wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You think I did something scummy, but that doesn't mean you suspect me.

I don't find him scummy because I have seen less-then-adept town including myself play exactly this way, but I haven't seen scum behave quite so textbook scummy. It's much, much more likely in my mind that's he's just a townie who made a mistake and can't do anything to remedy it without looking worse. \"Woops, made a mistake, sorry\" at this point would look just as bad against him as anything else.\n</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SC wrote:</cite>\nA quick look over things and Yura's current post continues a rather disturbing trend of contributing nothing, and riding nearly every single bandwagon, or potential bandwagon so far this game. She has rarely missed even one. This is terrible practice, and not at all in the town's favor, possibly bordering on a definitive scumtell. The constant wagoning would combine with the lack of original evidence to keep Yura in my top spot in spite of andrew climbing quickly closer.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhilst I give a QFT to the second quote above, I want to juxtapose the two, because I don't think your position is inconsistent.<br>\n<br>\nBoth bgg and Yura are playing badly. I also think they are both scummy.  You', however, only think that Yura is scummy (in fact, you indicate that she is your #1 suspect). This is interesting because your defence of bgg (which boils down to \"too scummy to be scum\") should apply equally, if not more so, in the case of Yura. <br>\n<br>\nI recognise that there is a difference between the two, in that bgg at least has a thread of reasoning to follow, even if I think it's ridiculous.

Slip once or twice, yeah, but even under pressure I consider it more likely a desperate townie fumbling for survival then I do a scum fumbling for his disguise.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nApologies if you already answer this in response to my \"How would his play differ?\" question, but I'd like to know how you think \"fumbling townie\" differs from \"desperate scum\"?

Who whomever has killing roles is hard evidence that can't be falsified.  Almost everything else in the game is subject to opinion and how you read what they wrote where you know the mafia/sk killed for a reason.

Non-town try to ensure their survival while town are fine dying if they can catch scum.  Therefore, scum generally get rid of threats to them if and when they think that they can get away with it.  SKs fall into this even moreso than mafias cause they don't have anyone but themselves to rely on so they're more likely to kill off direct threats.  Therefore, when I saw that TCL was stabbed, I analyzed who he was suspicious of to see if I could get a bead on the SK.<br>\n<br>\nMore later, gotta go to church.", "time": "Sun Mar 20, 2011 1:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

I'm hesitant to start a theory debate on this, because it gets into fairly abstract issues. But, basically, a) since almost everybody can see that almost nothing is scummy divorced of its circumstances (ie. it is terrible play to apply a blanket set of scumtells) and b) nobody has the empirical evidence needed to actually know what scum are \"more likely\" to do, we fall back on a behavioural/motivational approach. In short, we can't ask \"What are scum more likely to do?\" so we ask, instead, \"Can I see this person reasonably doing X action as town?\".  <br>\n<br>\nMaybe you disagree, but I'm not going to assume that Yura plays differently from the vast majority of people in this respect.

Besides what I've already said about not finding hypocrisy to be a scum tell, I don't think she was being hypocritical. If you read Yura's post, she accuses bgg of \"making useless arguments,\" While she admits not to being \"useless and dumb\" but of being thought of as \"useless and dumb\". Making \"useless arguments\" and being thought of as \"useless and dumb\" are two different things, which invalidates the charge of hypocrisy. Both involve being useless, but one is a judgement by others while the other is a deliberate act of creating dumb arguments. Even if she actually admitted to being useless and dumb, that is still not the same thing as making dumb arguments. <br>\n<br>\nI want to be clear here. I am not doing this because I want to defend Yura. I am doing this because I want to show that Vollkan is not an infallibly logical scum hunting robot as he would like to portray himself. I think this was a pretty poor post, and an extremely bad set of reasons for switching a vote from another serious scum suspect. If a different player switched votes off of a wagon just as it was gaining steam using this post as justification, I would not have a problem calling it quite scummy. With Vollkan, I'm not quite as sure, because I realize that he's dogmatically following a scoring system that allows this kind of flip flopping.

If you read Yura's post, she accuses bgg of \"making useless arguments,\" While she admits not to being \"useless and dumb\" but of being thought of as \"useless and dumb\". Making \"useless arguments\" and being thought of as \"useless and dumb\" are two different things, which invalidates the charge of hypocrisy. Both involve being useless, but one is a judgement by others while the other is a deliberate act of creating dumb arguments. Even if she actually admitted to being useless and dumb, that is still not the same thing as making dumb arguments. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nSince Yura's posting has shown on a number of occasions that she is aware of her own deficiencies, your point here is inapplicable.<br>\n<br>\nShe words it as though it is others thinking she is bad, but it's clear that she agrees with that assessment.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Truant wrote:</cite>\n@Vollkan: NK's ARE hard evidence.

That would make sense on N2 here if we mislynch, but not N1.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't done a full re-read of the thread, but I have re-read truant's ISO, and I don't like it. So far, he's been on the magnetic wagon, yura wagon, and bgg wagon (he was also the 3rd person to fos or vote tclawren after he refused to RV). Granted, he was the first voter for Yura today, but I think it's fair to say that she was the second most likely lynch candidate from D1, and there was a good chance some of that momentum would carry into today. Also, he completely flip flopped from a town read on Yura to voting her overnight based on some very shaky NK analysis. Now, he's voting for bgg for similarly shaky reasons (a single quote). Based on his support for the biggest wagons and votes with weak reasoning, I'm getting the impression that Truant is putting his vote on whoever he feels will be easiest to lynch rather than who he most suspects.<br>\n<br>\nFor reference, here are his votes accompanied with the reasons he provides:\n<blockquote><div><cite>truant wrote:</cite>Vote: tclawren Since if you're not going to vote, your vote should at least be on your sleeve and not in your pocket.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div><cite>truant wrote:</cite>Magnetic should be insta-lynched.<br>\nUnvote<br>\nVote: Magnetic<br>\n<br>\nThis time for pretty much exactly the reasons that Vol stated, you don't decide to gambit as town for no reason, then ungambit, then regambit.

Either way, (if there's an SK or a Vig) I doubt that there's only 2 mafia since mods generally don't like it if there's a chance that a scumgroup could theoretically be eliminated d1 (lynch and being NK'd would wipe out a scumgroup of 2).

Anybody can argue with me if they wish.<br>\n<br>\n1. What's completely illogical is what Magnetic did in the first place. Is it that bad to think that it was possible that there was a rational explanation for it all?<br>\n2. I think it was fairly clear that Magnetic was probably going to be lynched that day. Extending the day would have benefitted us. Shortening the day would have benefitted mafia. Since it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the lynch, the mafiaMagnetic should've self-hammered. You're saying that we would have been best off if he had been automatically lynched with no new content the second Magnetic reclaimed weak doctor.<br>\n3. I'll direct you to my analogy. \"If you hold the dagger up to somebody's neck, and say \"I am only doing this to apply pressure to you so that you tell me this secret\", you are not reducing any pressure of this threat.\" That's mental pressure. The only reason it didn't have much pressure behind it is because Magnetic was as good as lynched.<br>\n4. I only said that people were tunneling, at least by my definition, and needed to stop. Do you dispute that?<br>\n5. When I am a member of the town, defending myself is pro-town. That was my point. I wasn't even defending myself, I was attacking a statement that was very clearly false. <br>\n6. I think that this is true. If I am moderately scummy, and most other people are not scummy at all, then I am probably scum. If most everyone else is extremely scummy,then I probably town. It is basic probability. <br>\n7.

The risk of a smart replacee squirming a scum slot out of a lynch  is a low one, but it's definitely a real one (I've done it myself on a few occasions). The key point is just to understand that the replacee doesn't get a clean slate, or even an opportunity to \"redeem\" themselves. Yura's replacee is as scummy as Yura.

I&#8217;m trying a new tactic of reading the game, so bare with me when playing.<br>\n<br>\nI trust everyone knows the difference between lurking and active lurking, and that I&#8217;m not going to have to explain it even once during this game -_-<br>\n<br>\nDay One!<br>\nToken/Regfan: Dislikes the RVS, Token does not suggest a suitable alternative, Regfan suggests RQS. All questions were fine except for the 5th one, in which he asked whether people prefer to lead or follow. Any questions like that can give the scum valuable information as to what makes each player tick &#8211; thus why I discourage questions like that. What did Regfan hope to gain from asking this question? If he was scum, he would know who to target for buddying and who would be very easily influenced, giving a good indicator of who they should leave alive until lylo. Answers this question with &#8216;leader&#8217; which would give him an easy excuse later on in the game for leading the town in stupid directions. The third question can be used by the mafia to attack a player if they lose interest in the game and lurk. If someone who prefers playing town, is town and still lurks, mafia could use that as an attempt at a case against them. <br>\n<br>\n1. I&#8217;m a Brit.<br>\n2. Vullkan or CKD. Maybe both. Was definately one of them. &#8211; he made me check my role pm to check if I really was town, cause he convinced me otherwise. Can&#8217;t remember his role.<br>\n3. Refuse to answer.<br>\n4. Couple of times a day? Sometimes I have a habit of lurking for a few days, then posting several large walls.<br>\n5. Refuse to answer.<br>\n<br>\n@ Vollkan &#8211; Can you keep two point scores for me? One with the person who I replaced, and my own? <br>\n<br>\nI like Surprise_Carcinogen&#8217;s post (number 18), pretty much realizes why RQS is bad and is against it.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vollkun wrote:</cite> My avatar is meant to be expressing anger at the use of \"gut\". FWIW, if I have a schtick on this site, it's for hating gut-based play. </div></blockquote>\nWhy is this? Just for the record, I&#8217;m a very gut based player but have found it holds very little influence over what happens during the game, so I re-read my gutscum players and form logical cases against them.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite>Hm, seems like a pretty powerful tool for giving your completely subjective observations a false air of objectivity. I do not like it.</div></blockquote>\nIt&#8217;s called &#8216;Operationalising&#8217; in Psychology, it&#8217;s a tactic often used in research to give something a value like Vollkun is doing. It&#8217;s not scummy. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s quite pro-town because if we look through his posts and find his pluses and minuses are disproportionate to his opinions, then we have pretty good evidence for him being scum. He&#8217;s basically showing his whole hand and holding nothing back, which is what I would expect from a townie.<br>\n<br>\nMagnetic got banned for being parknourie. /offtopic.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Magnetic wrote:</cite> But for me, Ima genius motherfuck so I can say someone's 100% scum or 100% town.

Don&#8217;t say its wrong for one person to say something and for you to say something else.<br>\n<br>\nFor everyone&#8217;s information: Even if I was cop with a guilty result, I&#8217;d still have 1% doubt in it due to possible unknown sanily. <br>\n<br>\nI wish people would either claim or not claim, not ask questions about whether they should or not first. It seems scummy. (Carcin)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> I've concluded that two players have a playstyle more cautious then most I've played with in my one other game on mafiascum, and in my experiences playing on other forums.</div></blockquote>\nAnd this is important, because?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Truant wrote:</cite> Otherwise, vote for sub or possibly pappum's as a third option.</div></blockquote>\nWhy those two? Why are you trying to &#8216;threaten&#8217; people into voting for whom you want them to? Where were you prior to your first post? <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> His metagaming question is dubious at best. Metagaming can tell you, potentially, if someone is playing differently then usual, but it's always going to be debatable evidence</div></blockquote>\nI disagree. Meta can be useful, obviously people shouldn&#8217;t be lynched based on that alone, but it can be pretty solid evidence. People can change some of their meta, but there&#8217;s always very subtle differences between their posts as town and scum. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maxeous wrote:</cite> It seems like he does'nt actually suspect anybody he's just pretending to do so because they stood out a little by following the crowd with the RVS - by the way from my experience following the crowd is what the mafia tend to do not the town.</div></blockquote>\nAt this stage in the game, do you really expect people to be forming strong cases on other people. You work with what you&#8217;ve got in front of you. <br>\n<br>\nHello Yura-chi, she&#8217;s annoying me cause she&#8217;s posting in text language -.-<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Truant wrote:</cite> pappum is a decent 3rd option because he really hasn't said anything.

Neither had you.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite> 2)Anyone who hasn't posted yet. Granted, it's the weekend and people might have things to do, but lurking isn't cool. At least check in.</div></blockquote>\nARRRRGH NO! NO NO NO! I am going to explain this once. Lurking is not scummy, it&#8217;s anti-game which isn&#8217;t scummy, Active Lurking is scummy. People have haven&#8217;t posted at that time, weren&#8217;t active lurking, they were lurking. If people make jokes all the time, post in other threads but not this one and do a whole load of other things in this criteria, they are active lurking.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> i have to go a tourney now, but i would like to note that yuri speaks like a man...</div></blockquote>\nHow is this relevant in any way? This is an example of a real filler post and active lurking.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Token wrote:</cite> It's obvious she's bad at the game, but it's hard to tell if she's actually scum.</div></blockquote>\nShe read as lost newbie town to me. Me thinks Token needs to join more newbie games so he can read newbies better.<br>\n<br>\nPeople need to stop the HoSing and have the balls to make a vote.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>bgg wrote:</cite> I'll vote: Surprise_Carcinogen because, as of this moment, he has not posted for the longest time.</div></blockquote>\nGood vote. Bad reasoning. Carcin looks scummy at this moment because she left when people stopped putting pressure on her. I half retract this because I didn&#8217;t notice it have only been 8hrs. What I&#8217;m not liking is that Bgg cast a vote and expected people to follow it before he had posted his reasons. It looks like he&#8217;s just flinging a vote down and making something up later.<br>\n<br>\nTunneling isn&#8217;t scummy, by the way, it&#8217;s a perfectly valid scum tactic.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vollkun wrote:</cite> The obvious newbscum reason, however, is that he doesn't like the little attention that he got and is now being contrite and unvoting to avoid it.</div></blockquote>\nStop throwing fuel on a fire, she obviously was saying sorry for her ipod not being able to bold properly.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite> I believe that's the definition of a weak doctor, though never played with one before so I'm not sure. For now: Unvote</div></blockquote>\nWait? You&#8217;re unvoting a player who reacted so badly to being voted that he claimed his role?<br>\n<br>\nMagnetic is making my blood boil. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to read his posts anymore. I HATE cheaters.<br>\n<br>\nWait? Regfan DOESN&#8217;T vote the admitted liar?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maxeous wrote:</cite> Bgg you are saying we should talk. Okay, but talk about what or who? Espically since you're saying we should lynch Magnetic anyway. There is no difference to lynching him now or in 2 weeks.</div></blockquote>\nDidn&#8217;t you get the memo? The only weapon the town has to find out who scum is without outing their power roles is discussion and voting. We need to discuss do we can find out who to vote next day or see if the lynchee is going to accidentally let something slip. Regfan doesn&#8217;t get it either?<br>\n<br>\nIf Bgg doesn&#8217;t give reasons for voting Carcin, then we pressure him to do so ~.~ We don&#8217;t leave it.<br>\n<br>\nPg 7: Where&#8217;s pappums gone?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> 1) Bgg, when asked \"why don't you change your vote\" \"I wont change my vote\" isn't a real answer</div></blockquote>\nBecause he didn&#8217;t read the question, he read what question his brain wanted him to see. Using that knowledge, it allows me to see that he is feeling pressured over the vote for some reason. Definitely something to pressure him for a bit later, or pressure him for something else!. <br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I&#8217;m leaning scum on Bgg and Regfan.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite> If he does flip mafia, then I would consider Yura town.</div></blockquote>\nNon-sequitor. They haven&#8217;t communicated much at all. You can&#8217;t consider Yura town just because she voted for Bgg, and that goes for any votes!.<br>\n<br>\nAndrew&#8217;s lurking.<br>\n<br>\nDay Two<br>\nWell, it looks like Regfan came into the day knowing that he wanted to get CKD lynched. To me, this indicates that it may have been something discussed during the scum quicktopic/PMs and Regfan just dived right on in there without building up to a vote.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite> I was even thinking of keeping him alive as a kind-of scum-pet. Of course, if we had kept the day going, we may have found real scum, maybe even the SK</div></blockquote>\nYou seem to know that there&#8217;s an SK in the game, what an interesting thing to presume. It could equally be a Vig, but you instantly decide they&#8217;re an SK. Why did you do this?<br>\n<br>\nAndrew, I don&#8217;t see anything scummy about Carcin for hammering CHEATING BASTARD. He was pretty scummy and I think anyone would have hammered him by then. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> Side note, everybody look at Andrew's ISO. Five posts, 2 votes, no substance.</div></blockquote>\nI pretty much agree with this.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> And aside from that, I dislike his refusal to read 'walls'</div></blockquote>\nHe&#8217;s going to love this one!<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m finding the interactions between Bgg/Vollkan and Vollkun/CKD quite interesting. Will re-read those at a later date.<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m more inclined to believe post 281, than I am to believe Bgg&#8217;s responses/argument.<br>\n<br>\nOn page 13, I&#8217;m thinking Bgg, Andrew and Regfan might be scum.<br>\n<br>\nAndrew&#8217;s not providing content and is pretty much active lurking. It looks like he&#8217;s providing content, when he isn&#8217;t really.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> hmm? are you saying if everyone calls me town then i cant fos or vote ANYONE since they all think im to win?</div></blockquote>\nNo she&#8217;s saying you&#8217;re reasoning looks like your voting someone for thinking you&#8217;re town. Stop strawmanning.<br>\n<br>\n@ Bgg &#8211; If you&#8217;re going to quote Vi, explain why you&#8217;re doing it and don&#8217;t fuck it up. And don&#8217;t make really really bad arguments out of it.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> also, bgg feudin slipped</div></blockquote>\nIIf you see a slip, YOU VOTE FOR HIM IN THAT POST. Otherwise, it makes you scummy for not following through with your accusations. If you&#8217;re town, you want to lynch scum so if you see someone slip up, you vote to lynch them.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite> I'll make sure to NK you for that statement.</div></blockquote>\nAND HE IS STILL ALIVE. *headdesk*<br>\n<br>\nCarcin: Joking around and having fun is not a scumtell, or a towntell. It&#8217;s a null tell. Because that&#8217;s what these games are about. Having fun.<br>\n<br>\nRegfan: For the love of god, put spaces between @ and playername. It is really really annoying when people don&#8217;t do that. Also, you&#8217;re ignoring everything else Andrew has done and are only voting him because you&#8217;ve read his scum games. Then you don&#8217;t explain what about his play is scummy and similar in this game? <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite> yura-chi, I honeslty don't know whether to read him as dumb mafia or dumb town, it's quite frustrating actually.</div></blockquote>\nHow about, you could have asked her what her views and opinions were on other players in the game, asked her about situations? That&#8217;s lazy, if you don&#8217;t knpw what alignment someone is, then take steps to finding out! Or it shows you&#8217;re not really scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nNot liking Maxeous&#8217;s self meta of indecisiveness.<br>\n<br>\nBgg is taking back his soft claim of a killing role. Backtracking and lying. Scummy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite> I think an SK would be primarily interested in hitting somebody that couldn't be traced back to him.</div></blockquote>\nYou&#8217;re not very active. And the above is wrong. I know quite a bit about SK theory and they don&#8217;t really tend to do that.<br>\n<br>\nBgg&#8217;s opportunistic vote of Andrew in Iso 613, is obviously opportunistic. He seems to be trying to sway people away from voting him onto voting for Andrew instead who is also extremely scummy to everyone else.<br>\n<br>\nAndrew votes CKD without any reasoning? Scummy.<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;ll probably need to re-read the last few pages when I&#8217;m not tired (I read this whole thing and wrote this post all in one session.)<br>\n<br>\nI will be voting for either Andrew of Bgg depending on what my reread of the last few pages does.", "time": "Wed Mar 30, 2011 10:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

All anyone needs to do is look at the game and they'll see she voted for the most experienced player.<br>\n<br>\n#2: She's upset that her ipod didn't work and she failed with her vote. <br>\n<br>\n#4: Oh hey, girl on the internet gets pissed off at being called a he. Pretty sure that's what the shouting was about. I'm basing this on the fact that she seemed extremely young and less mature than some of us.<br>\n<br>\n#5: That was a question, posted in a confused tone.

She obviously thought the person who was voting for her was scum and asked him whether she was a threat to him.<br>\n<br>\n#6: Votes Carcin, to be honest, it really did seem like Carcin hadn't posted in ages because of the amount of time it took me to read the thread and the number of pages, so I can see where she was coming from here.<br>\n<br>\n#7: Gut player is playing by gut but let it get influenced by logic so unvoted that logic vote. But she doesn't know what she's looking for and how to scumhunt. It looks like she played a game too advanced for her and replaced out when she realised this.<br>\n<br>\n#10: It's a fair question.

But she didn't know what she was looking for. The scumhunting she did above stuff people had accused other people in the thread of doing which ties in with newbie town who doesn't know what she's doing.<br>\n<br>\n#14: There we go!

They worry that their skills are so shockingly undeveloped that their reads are totally wrong. They worry that they've somehow said something that could be mistaken as a scumslip. Mostly, what they are worried about is that if they're lynched, the town isn't going to win - they have a massive fear of being lynched when it really doesn't matter.<br>\n<br>\nScum don't have to worry about anybody buddying them, cause they're the one doing the buddying most of the time!

Now go back and read my bgg case and see how it's not \"ridiculous\".</div></blockquote>\n\nAs I said before, your \"case\" was really just you taking every possible negative interpretation and spinning them together. To go through this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> So, you have no scumreads? Do you really think that one vote on me is really going to pressure me into rereading and making a post faster? *whew* I'm in real trouble now! You've gotten this far through the game (28 pages and D2 with 3 flips) and yet you find that no place else could better serve your vote than on me... -_- <br>\n<br>\nOh goodie, there's more! You actually felt the need to explain why your vote was a \"pressure vote\" so town didn't find you scummy for it.<br>\n<br>\n*keeps reading*\n</div></blockquote>\n\nPressure voting is useless, but here you actually construct a conspiracy argument* around it being a tactic to stop his vote being criticised. Aside from the fact that your assertion that he has no scumreads is both wrong in fact and was not a reasonable opinion even from this single post that you based this attack on, your argument here really only proves that the pressure vote was useless - not that it was scummy<br>\n<br>\n(* by \"conspiracy argument\", I mean an argument based on you attributing a motivation to him without proving why that motivation is the most reasonable explanation for his play)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> ...really? You would \"very much\" like to lynch him? And it's not like you just snuck that in there, hell, you fucking underlined it... *checks rules to make sure I can curse. we're clear. goes back to ranting* I mean, it's not like you voted me for \"pressure\" then said \"oh, Andrew is scummy\", you fucking said \"I would like to LYNCH him\" and, just in case no one saw it, felt the need to emphasize it by underlining it. <br>\n<br>\nIn other words: I here what you're saying. Yet your actions say differently.<br>\n<br>\n*keeps reading*\n</div></blockquote>\n\nOr, you know, he might have decided that his vote was doing nothing on you and decided to place it elsewhere. It's useless, sure, but hardly scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite>\nThis is how the game is played. You find someone scummy. You vote them. By voting them, you ARE FULLY AWARE that you are contributing to their lynch BECAUSE YOU FOUND THEM SCUMMY. The point of voting him would be to CONTRIBUTE TO HIS LYNCH. Why else would you fucking vote him?<br>\n<br>\n*sighs, goes and gets something to eat and to drink, comes back hoping it might make a little sense, but doubting it*\n</div></blockquote>\n\nI agree with you on the theory side of this, insofar as I don't believe that votes have any use beyond contributing to lynches (ie. I never pressure vote - in fact, my system makes it impossible).<br>\n<br>\nHowever, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, you still haven't explained why this is scummy. Despite your BIG WORDS IN CAPITAL LETTERS you still haven't explained what is scummy about this, as opposed to it just being a stupid way to play<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite>\nIt's not just going to become fucking possible because everyone just goes \"WELL HELL, I THINK ANDREW SHOULD BE THE LYNCH BECAUSE I FUCKING FEEL LIKE IT\". No, it will become, as you say, \"possible\" when you do something, maybe ISO him and show the town WHY he should be the lynch. It shouldn't just be \"sitting on him\", you have to actually give valid reasons and stuff of why you vote him.<br>\n<br>\n*goes back to reading, hoping it will end soon*\n</div></blockquote>\n\nThe only way this is scummy is if you are implying that he isn't doing enough to push Andrew as a lynch candidate. Since you hadn't read any of his previous posts, however, you can't possibly be drawing that implication on any reasonable grounds. Thus, your argument is, again, you latching onto the worst possible interpretation.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> Do you REALLY think that? REALLY? That I might come to the computer, see your one vote, and shit my pants and make sure the reread and my posting comes faster because of one vote? I hope not, or whatever...<br>\n<br>\n*could it get much worse?*\n</div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, useless =/= scummy<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> Translation: Hopefully town would be dumb enough to all drop their scumreads and all come put stupid \"pressure votes\" down all at the same time on CMAR and he will be quick hammered. I'm speculating as to what my buddies should join me in doing. Now I'm going refer to CMAR as a townie. Whoops! A scumslip! Now I'm going to speculate that town will lose if they lynch a townie for no reason. Now I'm going to confirm that I indeed don't think CMAR is scum by saying that he's not yet \"at that level\", but that I'm going to vote him anyway because I damn well please.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd, as I have already demonstrated, this flat-out contradicts your subsequent explanations - and you still haven't provided any meaningful explanation beyond, in essence, \"I was thinking one thing and typed the exact opposite in staggering detail\"<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite>\nShe said prior to this that she is a sheep. So perhaps she felt she'd done something wrong when she was criticised and should be voting with everyone else.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd yet, she'd been comfortable enough with not being sheepish in voting me in the first place.  In fact, she even said:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite> Ahhhhh since no one is choosing volkan for their vote Ima choose him n n ders miles edgeworth Acting funny \n </div></blockquote>\n\nThe above actually shows that, far from following people, she was actually trying to go against the grain.  If she really is just confused and scared about breaking from the pack, such an attitude makes no sense. If, however, it was just newbscum trying to be contrite and avoid the limelight, it makes perfect sense<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite> Because, from her point of view and my point of view, the only people who could find her threatening is scum. Thus why she asked the whether he truly found her to be a threat. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhich relies on us assuming that, on being voted, Yura would, to begin with, think \"They must be voting me because they are scum and consider me a threat\". The first part is a strange assumption to make, and the second is downright ridiculous.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite>\nNewbie town are infinately more paranoid than newbie scum. Newbie scum only have to worry that they have been caught out. Newbie town worry that anybody in the game could be scum: \"is it the guy who's claimed cop or the person I've been defending all game\", they worry that they have done the wrong thing (for example: hammer) and that they're going to get lynched next day. They worry that their skills are so shockingly undeveloped that their reads are totally wrong. They worry that they've somehow said something that could be mistaken as a scumslip. Mostly, what they are worried about is that if they're lynched, the town isn't going to win - they have a massive fear of being lynched when it really doesn't matter.<br>\n<br>\nScum don't have to worry about anybody buddying them, cause they're the one doing the buddying most of the time! They don't gave to worry that the person they're attacking isn't scum, because they're scum themselves. ect ect.<br>\n<br>\nTown paranoia is completely different to scum paranoia. In this case, she was worried CKD was buddying her. Only a townie would need to be worried about this.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nAll fine as a matter of general theory, but what doesn't make sense is that this gives her an entirely contradictory attitude - she both thinks that anyone who votes her is trying to eliminate her as a \"threat\" but also that anyone who defends her is scum buddying. It's actually unusual for newbie town, given (as you say) the high priority they place on survival, to be worried about somebody defending them; generally, they tend to be thought of as a white knight<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite>\nA fallacy that tends to be wrong. \n</div></blockquote>\n\n\"too townie\" is a fallacy where the argument is \"This person is playing too well/too hard, so they must be scum\"<br>\n<br>\nIt isn't a fallacy where it is directed at a person who makes superficial rhetorical attempts to appear town/genuine", "time": "Thu Mar 31, 2011 5:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

His suspicions are not in proportion with his votes.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>do you even know what lurking is? its not 'posting low amounts', its 'cant post a lot'. then, the only confusion about magnetic was the fact that he said 'weak doctor protect fails if attaack by more than 1 person', to me: that was what THE NORMAL DOC does anyway. and also at the end where he listed everyone as likely town.<br>\nand thus u hammered and you were WRONG. BUT U CONTINUED TO START THE DAY WITH A LEAD (PROB FAIL COS UR SCUM)</div></blockquote>\nPretty much all of this is fail logic.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>bgg1996 is oppourtunistic in attempting to lynch me. where have i said i refuse to post my opinions.</div></blockquote>\nFail logic again. Why would you not post your opinions? Wouldn't he try to lynch someone who refused to give their opinions on people and play the game? And I do see it as Andrew not giving his opinions, by the way.<br>\n<br>\nAs soon as people put pressure on him, he gets desparate and tells them to 'DIAF'. which is deflection in itself. 'If you think im scum, then you can DIAF :&lt;' <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>\ni did give opoinions on almost every player apart from volakn himself(who is a bully)</div></blockquote>\nHypocrit. I can't see a list of opinions either.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>that seems like an epic way to say 'i like it that your contributing now' then 'but ur contribution is bad, this is why etc'.</div></blockquote>\nAnd it's not OK to say that? Well here you go. I like that you're contributing, but you're not contributing in a town way.<br>\n<br>\nAndrew has a false sense of what Active Lurking is.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>because then, he doesnt read what happened, just generally commenting. i notice that when you read the whole thing, you will notice that people have already addressed the points.<br>\n<br>\nthus: wall of fluff</div></blockquote>\nUm no. If everyone in every game started doing what you are suggesting CKD stop doing, then nobody would get anywhere in a game. If he doesn't post at all, then I'm assuming you will call him scum for lurking.

Like this, for example:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>alright, and bgg's case is just fail</div></blockquote>\nBy not saying why it is fail, he's not giving Bgg the chance to defend himself which is scummy and could be distancing.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>it appears that haylen hasnt fully read the game as there was some errors when she was referring to me (such as the lurking for instance)</div></blockquote>\nNo there wasn't, you made 2 posts on day one.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Conclusion: Either scummy, or a really really bad player.

In 800 and a number of his previous defence posts, he clearly showed that he KNEW he was voting based on incomplete information.

Eventually, he soft claimed when it became apparent that nobody was buying his defenses and bgg began to look like a pretty likely lynching candidate.

The same argument can (and is) made against NLing in any MYLO situation. In fact, the stalemate it leads to is called \"Happily Ever After\". But, in practice, that stalemate (to the point of the game ending in a draw) has only ever happened once, according to the wiki. I think I've been in one game in the past where scum twice refused to kill (meaning two cycles of NL and NK went by), but they gave in in the end.<br>\n<br>\nThe second worst argument was the one raised earlier about LYLO being more dangerous than MYLO because of the risk of one errant townie throwing the game.

There will be the scum, who will want to mislynch. They will always be able to switch back to no lynching if the lynch turns to a mafia member. Then, there are the people who won't give in, and only want to no lynch, unless they can lynch a confirmed scum. Finally, there are those who only want to lynch. Type 3:They will pretty much lynch anybody in their top 3 or 4 in favor of not no lynching, just to get the game moving.<br>\nDo you know how that game would work out? <br>\nThink about it.

All of the lynchers would wagon onto the non-scum, and we would lose. <br>\n<br>\nNext, the majority of the eight players is 5. Let's assume that there are 5 town, including myself. Since I'm town, and I'm not going to no lynch, you would need a scum on your boat to no lynch, or just wait 'til the deadline. If no lynching benefits town as you say, which it won't, the scum would  never get on it. It won't even work. <br>\n<br>\nThen, you're assuming that Haylen is the only power role left. That's a pretty big assumption to make, you know. I don't think that anybody here, except maybe you, by assuming that, have claimed a VT position.<br>\n<br>\nNow, as I've already explained, if we get to lylo, townHaylen's ability won't save us. Therefore, she has to use it after mylo. Out of eight players, I doubt that she can get it right. We will have wasted her ability. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou're saying that the only con to somebody dying is the loss of their role and opinion. That's not true. It... ummm... Hmmm.<br>\nI'm sure that there's something...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFinally, and probably most importantly, When you made your little chart, or whatever you want to call it, you didn't include yourself. To me, that is a major scumslip. I know, townVollkan didn't include himself because he A) didn't want to give any information away about his role, and B) was someone else.

Then, there are the people who won't give in, and only want to no lynch, unless they can lynch a confirmed scum. Finally, there are those who only want to lynch.

Imagine a 4:3 LYLO. We mislynch, it goes to 3:3. Yes, as you said earlier, scum can just No Kill, but they don't win with a tie. The reason that games get endgamed when there is a tie is that there is no way for town to win. However, in 3:3, we still can win - by Haylen redirecting at night.

I can't think of any realistic situation under which I would vote BGG - because the objective likelihood of another candidate being scum will be higher. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">However</div>, BGG being scum is still a live, if unlikely option (the pro I've already explained).<br>\n<br>\nAddressing your cons, the short answer is that I don't think any of them are sufficient to override the above. <br>\n<br>\nTo address each individually:<br>\n1) We already have bgg's opinion on everything that has transpired so far. His semi-confirmed status means his opinions are probably genuine, but that's really the end of it. Remember: NL always deprives the town of one townie's perspective, but it's still almost uniformly accepted as the best move in MYLO. I may be speaking only for myself here, but I can't conceive of any situation in which, despite his semi-confirmed status, I would trust bgg's judgment over my own. <br>\n2) I accept that this is a con; but I don't think night discussion is likely to be sufficiently influential on the day game to override the pros<br>\n3) As somebody who has designed a playstyle that pre-commits my vote, I take a particularly dim view of the value of reaction-gauging, let alone so late in a game. <br>\n4) Seriously? Given that a Happily Ever After cycle is exceptionally unlikely, the timeframe you are talking about is most likely only the length of a single night phase. I'd be amazed if anybody would lose touch with the game in that time.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite>\nBut mostly, yes, I just want him to admit I'm right <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote>\n\n@Regfan: Yup.

I'm not sure how to calculate the exact probability, but since I'm assuming that there is at the very least 1 scum PR, and there are 15 different scum PRs on that one list, since the godfather is more common I'll count it as two, and guess that the probability of a mafia godfather is around 1/8. 1/8*1/6 is 1/48. I have a 1/48 chance to be scum, with the following assumptions:<br>\n*The chance that there is a godfather is around 1/8.<br>\n*There are three scum left. <br>\n*There are no millers or framers.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWithout factoring in anything other than the cop clear, the odds of me being scum are exactly 1/48.<br>\nThat equates to 02.083%.<br>\nThat would make your odds... harder to calculate.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, I have it now.

It would depend, at least, on how much of a risk mafia perceived the claimed powers versus how much of a threat they perceive you to be.

Your \"choice\" argument is simply wrong - NL always gives mafia a \"and mafia will always exercise that choice in what they perceive to be their best interests. The point is, though, that town, being in an uninformed position, sees an improvement in their position from the increased certain knowledge<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that you are semi-confirmed makes the case for NL somewhat weaker, but (and this is a point on which people will differ) not sufficiently so to outweigh the certainty that would come if you were NKed.

Keeping the assumption that Haylen and CMAR are town the powers themselves would be a threat and, beyond that, mafia would be taking a gamble that people would see Haylen/CMAR as preferable lynches over anybody else.

I would rather NL in pre-MYLO than lynch and lose in MYLO). In this particular case, though, we have good reason to think that three scum is more probable: first, the increase in mini size from 12 to 13 (2 scum and SK was difficult for mafia even under 12 player); and, second, the power roles we have seen so far as well as the claims suggest that this is a town-PR heavy game.

His semi-confirmed status means his opinions are probably genuine, but that's really the end of it. Remember: NL always deprives the town of one townie's perspective, but it's still almost uniformly accepted as the best move in MYLO. I may be speaking only for myself here, but I can't conceive of any situation in which, despite his semi-confirmed status, I would trust bgg's judgment over my own.<br>\n2) I accept that this is a con; but I don't think night discussion is likely to be sufficiently influential on the day game to override the pros<br>\n3) As somebody who has designed a playstyle that pre-commits my vote, I take a particularly dim view of the value of reaction-gauging, let alone so late in a game.<br>\n4) Seriously? Given that a Happily Ever After cycle is exceptionally unlikely, the timeframe you are talking about is most likely only the length of a single night phase. I'd be amazed if anybody would lose touch with the game in that time.\n</div></blockquote>\n1) Completely understandable.<br>\n2) I think night discussion plays a bigger part then you're giving it credit for but aruguing over this is trival.<br>\n3) I can understand where you're coming from given your play-style but I'm a big fan of reaction testing and pressure voting in certain scenarios so we're going to have to agree to disagree with this con.<br>\n4) I've seen far too many games end in mafia wins purely due to the fact that town nl'ing too often when they shouldn't have.\n</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite>\nAnd I don't think you understand what I'm saying about choice.

Factors that they will have to weigh up in making that decision include:<br>\na) Threat posed by CMAR-town's power<br>\nb) Threat posed by Haylen-town's power<br>\nc) Threat posed by BGG-town<br>\nd) Who will be lynched if bgg-town dies?<br>\ne) Who will be lynched if CMAR-town dies?<br>\nf) Who will be lynched if Haylen-town dies?<br>\n<br>\nIt's overly-simplistic to think: \"BGG is semi-confirmed and not going to be lynched, so no matter what he will be NKed\" because it ignores all the threat judgments that scum would rationally be need to be making. It's already clear that it is by no means certain that Haylen and CMAR would be lynched, which poses a huge problem for scum if either Haylen or CMAR is town. <br>\n<br>\nAnd so, mafia, despite being the informed faction, is left having to make difficult probability and risk judgments. For obvious reasons, I think it's a bad idea to debate what we think the best or even most likely strategy for mafia in that situation would be. Likewise, as SubG has already said, it's a bad idea to debate what would be \"worst\" for town. The point is that, by forcing mafia to make such a difficult judgment and force a flip, we get more information and a more accurate lynch tomorrow. In contrast, lynching today, with a high likelihood of it being MYLO, when nobody has any confident suspicions, is a recipe for disaster.", "time": "Thu Apr 21, 2011 4:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

I was mad at the CMAR claim because it threw a wrench in my suspicions of him. At the time, I wasn't sure how to interpret it, and that was frustrating. The scum team listed in this post is the one that would result from hypothetically taking CMAR and Haylen's claims at face value and seeing if it made sense.

{"number": 1203, "id": "2992822", "user": "vollkan", "user_id": "6898", "content": "Reading over the start of the latest discussion, I basically agree with SB's 1169. The Reviewers are not idiots and would not have allowed multiple non-normal roles into a normal game - not only because, obviously, it makes the game non-normal but also because it would lead to precisely this sort of setup debating. Which means that the only logical conclusion is that Haylen is fakeclaiming. <br>\n<br>\nFrankly, the rationale for NLing all but evaporates in these circumstances, since we have as clear and compelling evidence as is really possible that Haylen is scum (on top of the history of her slot). <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>\nShe explained why her role can be in the game, why should she be outraged and surprised if she moderated a game that had a couple of these 'unusual' or whatever roles?</div></blockquote>\n\nShe cited the inclusion of GF, which is explicitly mentioned as a normal role to validate her claim of redirector, which is explicitly non-normal. Mentioning a mini-normal with a GF does nothing to make her claim more believable. If she can remember what the other roles are and show that they were outside the normal rules of the time, I would be willing to listen.<br>\n<br>\nI think a townie's natural reaction to someone pointing out that their claim is contrary to the rules of the game would be to read the rules, recognize that they've been somewhat screwed over by the mod, and protest that regardless of the clearly stated rules, he or she did in fact receive that role. Instead, Haylen is trying to argue that her role is allowable without giving any compelling evidence. I see her putting more effort into showing that her claimed role is feasible than that she actually received that role. I think this is because she fake claimed and she has a bit of pride on the line if she's lynched on the basis of a foolish role choice.</div></blockquote>\n\nAgreed. If SB had merely told her that the role isn't normal, without quoting the rules, it might have made sense for her to go looking for other games. But faced with the rules which are clear on this point, it's unnatural for her immediate response to be to defend the claim when, if you genuinely held the role, you'd immediately see it as a problem with the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">moderator</div> rather than the claim.<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings me to another point: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MOD: Does this game depart from the normal requirements as outlined on the wiki?

It's the day that I confess to my lies and explain how they came about. Bare in mind, my friends, this was not my fault. I lynched people, I kill people, I intentionally hurt people. But I have no regrets. Nothing is as it seems, I add a clause to my modded games saying 'Expect the Unexpected', this isn't for fun, it's a warning. I am not whom you think I am. They...changed me, something I never believed to be possible. It all happened on one fateful days, one event spiralled and caused an explosive chain of events. Until it happened, suddenly I wasn't in control. <br>\n<br>\nI joined this website as a newbie on April Fools Day 2009, a young 18 year old looking for a bit of fun. I guess I got it in some ways, just it wasn't my idea of fun. As a newbie fresh out of my first newbie game, I decided to give a mini normal a go (to this day, it's the only game number I've remembered. Mini 800). It started out pretty cool. But then as players started to leave and be replaced, the corruption began. An old player by the name of 'Ether' extended an offer to me...to become a Mith Minion. Craving to be accepted as part of a group, I gave a joyful 'Yes' in reply. In reality, I should have listened to Incognito and camn when they tried to convince me everyone's corrupt. But I'm a pretty stubborn young lady, so Ether's words overruled theirs.<br>\n<br>\nIt was fun for a while, but then the weirdness started. On the missions we were granted by the High Overlord himself, things started to go wrong. Firstly it was silly little things like my uniform being different to the other girls, then it esculated. My equipment started going missing. One the mission to destroy Bluehost, my flame gun disappeared. The only people who had access to the changing rooms and lockers were my fellow minions. So I burrowed an ordinary gun. Our plan seemed to be working; every day we were invading another one of their offices or meeting rooms. The building looked very much like the one where Portal is set, the only difference was we didn't have weird guns like on there. Soon, we had covered a vast area and the only thing left to do was attack Bluehost itself. The plan was simple: split into groups and listen to all instructions given. But something clicked in my head at that very moment. We were killing REAL PEOPLE. People with friends and families and aspirations. People just like us. I tried to convince the others of my brainwave but was accused of being a traitor; knocked out and locked in a cupboard for the night. I was unamused and displayed total apathy when they released me the next day. Their intentions were obvious: help destroy Bluehost. Or die. So I carried on. I tried not to kill anybody but in the end this wasn't possible. I shot Bluehost's primary guard 3 times. 1.2.3. In the chest, stomach and head. Blood splattered against the wall behind him and flowed out of his body like a river of evil. That's what I was part of. Evil. <br>\n<br>\nI thought after destroying Bluehost, they would leave me alone. This was sadly not the case. I was harrassed, my parents and neighbours were threatened. I was held there doing their bidding for a further two weeks. During those two weeks I concocted numerous escape plans, but each of them were pre-empted. One evening, however, when I was at dinner; I managed to slip away from everyone else. If I couldn't escape, I might as well explore and see what was really going on here. I hid being pillars and round corners to avoid being seen, this was what I was used to doing, I was an expert. My heart pounded whenever I heard a noise or saw anything out of the corner of my ear. Illusions. I went down and down, going deeper and deeper, the corridors got thinner and darker. Security got tighter. But that I couldn't understand, the basement had been abandoned for years! There was only one door open, and that appeared to be an accident. I slipped through it in case someone was in there ready to ambush me. I was shocked at what I saw.<br>\n<br>\nClones. There were clones of every player in the game. I knew them well enough to know very few of them were twins. But these looked exactly like their biological counterparts. Computers put them through complicated logic and agility tests. I was fascinated to note that they completely ignored me. It was obvious what was going on here. The High Overlord was planning to create super players! Those who could play mafia using a sense of logic that nobody else in the world possessed. Lost in my thoughts, I did not notice guards creeping up behind me. I was soon consumed by darkness. <br>\n<br>\nHere I am now, I'm locked in a cell; facing my last day alive on Earth and in this game. I found a dusty old computer in a box of broken belongings and managed to fix it and write you this warning. Tell everyone you know. Trust no one. Right now, the most important thing you can do is stay alive. Don't believe a word people say. It started with my favourite weapon going missing and is resulting in my death. <br>\n<br>\nThere is now only one thing left for me to do. Death is inevitable. But I'm not going to let it be at the hands of those monsters. Slowly, I am going to pull out a gun I have hidden away. It contains one bullet. That one bullet will be my freedom. I hold it to my head and speak my last words. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote.

It isn't finished yet, but I may as well post it so I can get some answers/put some opinions up to where I'm at in the game before the mod comes back.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1.

I've played with vollkan, Scott, and Haylen. Vollkan is very analytical and tends to post walls. He's kind of a love-him or hate-him type of guy. He's also very hard to incriminate because he can usually make something that is a scum-tell look illogical; that or he makes no mistakes, which is highly unlikely. I don't think I can read him well. Scott was, well, maybe his play was different since, if I recall, he was a PR, but he seemed like a gut type of person, almost the opposite of vollkan. Maybe he isn't, I don't know. He was lying low for most of that game. Haylen was v/L-A for the time I played with her. She temp-replaced in for a friend, posted a couple of times(everyone was mad at her for replacing in and not posting so she got attacked), mainly angry posts, so I'm assuming that isn't her actual playstyle. <br>\n3. Town.<br>\n4. My activity goes up and down but fairly often.<br>\n5. Leading.<br>\n<br>\nvollkan, are there walls in all the games you're in? I'm not even to page 3 and I've seen consistent wall o' text'ing.<br>\n<br>\nSo, let's get this straight for Day 1. The game moves out of RVS and Magnetic claims with 1 vote on him. Yeah, this was trolling and, since he's town, mafia and town alike would've lynched him so there isn't a lot of info there. What is to note is the unvoting being done. Tcl obviously had good reason considering his role. Ckd's unvote and vote on Maxous seems like an attempt to garner townie brownies and, at the same time, buddy with bgg who asked for unvotes in order to extend the day and get more info. The whole thing against bgg seems a little over the top, however he doesn't help at all by avoiding questions that would take typing out two names to answer. SC's hammer on Magnetic in reply to bgg was unneeded, as if he was taking the game and making it personal. My predecessor's play really sucks. Yura's most likely obv VI-scum. That said, the game picks up on D2. CKD felt really frantic on 334. Is he always like this? I've seen him on-site a lot and he joined in '07 so this type of reaction really feels off when I read through it.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ckd wrote:</cite>please someone else see this!!!!!!!!!!!</div></blockquote>\nIt looks like something Shotty would post.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>I voted Magnetic for a reaction at first, unvoted because I was unsure whether to read him as caught mafia or dumb town and didn't vote again because I didn't want to risk shortening the day as much as it ended up.</div></blockquote>\nWhat? I looked back and you unvoted Magnetic when he had 2 votes on him. Your vote and Andrew's RVS vote. How do 2 votes warrant a reason to think you will help prolong the day by unvoting<br>\n<br>\nOk, I haven't gotten to the N2 kill in the game yet but from where I'm at, SC is siding and defending bgg like a boss. In the first post, SC flipped cop. I'm assuming this would mean bgg is possibly confirmed since there's a very likely possibility SC got an innocent on him. SC's 423/430 only re-confirms this in my eyes.<br>\n<br>\nVollkan, in your 460, you had given no points to Andrew94 as of posting. What about his play did you find that didn't warrant points? I remember you specifically asking him to post reads or replace out. He posted a few lines on the game and people in the game but did not list anyone as scum or town in doing so. After you asked him to try again, his next post was his attempt to disprove he was not active lurking. He fos'd bgg in the post but did not do anything else beyond that. Why did you not push on this or follow through with it?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite>well i don't mean to bandwagon but i think sub is making sense bgg is getting into useless arguements (tho i don't really think i have any say in this, since everyone also thinks i'm useless and dumb) and i wanna see how he wud react if he face some heat</div></blockquote>\nThis is just mirroring what Subgenius just said.(Useless arguements and heat were actually part of what subgenius said) This looks like a very opportunistic bandwagon attempt in an attempt to buddy up to subgenius while at the same time have a place to park her vote.(Yura votes in the post after this post) There was nothing added to the discussion nor does Yura take a solid stance on who she thinks is scum but rather just wants to see \"how he wud react if he face some heat\". Why is this slot still alive?<br>\n<br>\nI'm surprised noone has asked SC why he is just sitting around and watching the day pass by. Subg, ckd popping in right after his name is mentioned should not entail a \"strong fos\". There is no evidence he was lurking and by at least posting right after his name is mentioned, he is making a promise to attempt to scumhunt and/or participate later on. There is nothing to suggest he was pressured because his name was mentioned. I've done the same type of thing before on a player but it's null tell at best.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite>I don't really have any other big sus for mafia but I do think he can be mafia and just planning when the night comes or he actually IS a sk planning his own kills.

On another note, vig makes no sense. Anyways, again, why is this slot still alive?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>or a townsperson(vig).</div></blockquote>\nWhy'd you mention this in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2897237#p2897237\" class=\"postlink\">504</a>?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CKD wrote:</cite>EDIT, he then votes 3 people very quickly...1st vote I get...the two after looks bad.</div></blockquote>\nThe two after he mentions here are truant and then Yura. Truant has been someone Max has been display suspicion of whilst Yura is one of CKD's top(tied with bgg) scum leads which tells me one of two things: CKD doesn't like the reaosns Max has presented for voting Yura or CKD needs a suspect so he quotes this one line from Max, misconstrues it to his liking, and uses it as a scum-tell. An important thing to note is that CKD is voting for Regfan and Max, both of who have looked into his case in the past. If anyone has played with him before, meta would be appreciated because I feel it may be helpful to have around for CKD reads.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">the bgg vote wasnt much of a strong scum sus like which i kinda have on ckd</div> it was more of to see how he would react and base on it.... and for now my sus are not that big yet for i have no big evidence yet...:/</div></blockquote>\nITT: Yura outs herself by saying she suspects ckd more but voted bgg but then counteracting it and offering a possible neutral stance on ckd by stating she has no big evidence.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>Just finished briefly reading Andrews scum games, his playstyle in them is almost identical to that of this game.

{"number": 1253, "id": "3008619", "user": "subgenius", "user_id": "8898", "content": "Interesting development. This claim strikes me as fairly credible. First, it meshes with my previous suspicions of CMAR/Hindu. Second, I had noticed that Maxous hadn't posted for two days, and his claim explains that. Third, the fact that he clears Regfan makes his claim extremely useful tomorrow. If Hindu flips scum, we could start tomorrow with 2 confirmed innocents, which kicks ass. <br>\n<br>\nI'm willing to accept his explanation for doubting the case against Haylen, since he has made several references to playing mafia at other sites. In my limited experience, I've found that MS puts a lot of thought into their rules and how to enforce them, so I was quite willing to lynch Haylen for making a claim that contradicted the rules, but I can understand how I would be less eager if the majority of my mafia experience was at a site that wasn't quite as structured and moderated. I'll admit that it's strange to cite experiences from other sites to explain why a claim at this site is within the rules, but I can let it go.<br>\n<br>\nP.S. I had the following post sitting on my clipboard from last night, and didn't get around to posting it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite>I'm now basically left without a clear suspect. CMAR obviously has the highest score, but his claim obviously complicates things. I agree with SubG that there is a decent chance that CMAR was sheeping Haylen's claim. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis statement is unusually equivocal for you, Vollkan. You want to say he's scummy, but then you mention his claim affects your opinion, then you say that there's a good chance that he's lying about it anyway. You don't want to NL, but who are you thinking you want to lynch?<br>\n<br>\n@Regfan<br>\nCondensing the VC's like that makes for some interesting reading. In particular, I think 2.20 and 2.21 are interesting, in which Max, Vollkan, and I are voting for CMAR. I'm not sure what to make of it, but it looks like an interesting focal point to investigate. <br>\n<br>\nAs I'm rereading, I'm becoming more and more convinced of CMAR's/Hindu's guilt. In particular, his breadcrumbing and claim seem extremely, extremely suspicious to me.<br>\n<br>\nAs I mentioned earlier, he started breadcrumbing in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2943367#p2943367\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 27</a>, which was very near the end of day 2, shortly after Haylen's claim, and shortly after he garnered three votes. At the end of this very same post, he writes:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite>I'll be online til around 10 EST if I need claim.</div></blockquote><br>\nTo me, this indicates a certain eagerness to claim. He's almost asking someone to request his claim in the same post that he starts breadcrumbing. This seems odd to me.<br>\n<br>\nThen, the fact that he claimed yesterday with one vote. If he was town, he wouldn't be worried about his replacement missing his breadcrumbs, his replacement would be able to refer to his pm and claim when it made sense. It seems more likely to me that he didn't want his breadcrumb defense going to waste, so he claimed when he decided he had to be replaced.", "time": "Mon May 02, 2011 3:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=1250", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

Your claim worked better because it was new and less tarnished. Plus, you would make an extremely unlikely jail keeping target. He would have had to explain why he used his one shot ability in an offensive bid to MAYBE catch scum rather than n defensive move to protect a confirmed innocent. Hindu jailkeeping you would have been a very tough sell. In addition, even if he successfully bussed you, he would have had lower chances to survive the next day, given his slot's spotty history.

He listed his suspects as Vollkan, CMAR and Subgenius. i.e. the only person in the game to suspect Subgenius. Scott did'nt mention any suspicion towards myself. The confirmed town Bgg was gunning for myself and Regfan (mostly myself) to be lynched.<br>\nTherefore it would be in Sub's best interests to kill Scott and keep Bgg alive, certainly not in mine. Scott dies instead of the confirmed town.<br>\nAt the end of Day 4 Bgg was strongly coming around to the idea that I was town and stated a few times earlier that myself as CMAR/Hinduragi's mafia partner was unlikely. Regfan expressed doubt at how all this was going so smoothly and wondered if something weird was happening since both Vollkan and Sub agreed to the plan immediatly. So in Day 5 Bgg would of been more likely to beleive me than Regfan. Bgg dies.<br>\nThis is against my interests and benefits Subgenius. This was illustrated when first chance he got, Subgenius mentions <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3032892#p3032892\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> Regfan.

Similarly, I could speculate as to why you were pushing the idea of only 2 maf, and all of my speculations could be wrong, but it wouldn't change the fact that, again, you are the lone player who claimed to think there were only 2 mafia in the setup.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>The cons of losing my mafia partner in that situation far outweighs the pro's of slightly having less suspicion on me. </div></blockquote><br>\nThat's possible, but highly debatable.

I thought people were settling on his lynch without much discussion, and I found it concerning considering we were most likely in MYLO. If most of the people on that wagon had given compelling evidence for their voting intentions, I wouldn't have been as concerned. I just thought the lynch was proceeding suspiciously easily. Proclaiming him almost certainly town at the end of D3 really was a bluff in the hopes of getting Mafia to kill him during the night.

We both did essentially the same thing, and you're being pretty hypocritical by trying to say that it's only scummy in my case. If Regfan and Vollkan care to look into both events and decide which seemed more genuine, I'd welcome it.

I noticed when Regfan suggested the roleblocking plan that you didn't seem especially enthusiastic about it. In hindsight, it might have been because you didn't realize that role blocker would be useful for further narrowing down the suspects. I also recall you questioning a few times today whether or not role blocking blocked night kills, further showing that maybe you hadn't taken that plan into account when you picked roleblocker as your final ability.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>suggested there was only 2 mafia as a deliberate misleading town tell</div></blockquote><br>\nAgain, you were the only player that claimed to think this was likely. Everyone else correctly assumed there were three. You're a smart guy, and so are Vollkan and Regfan. They should ask themselves how much in question the setup actually was. To me, it really wasn't, and we already have two examples of other scum players misleading town in this way. I think it's compelling.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>gloated and suggested myself as bussing Hinduragi</div></blockquote><br>\nAgain, you seem to be missing the point about this piece of evidence.

The fact that his explanations for his actions don't fully take into account the opinions he claimed to hold at the time he made his decision shows that he is lying. That is not WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, I don't think Hindu's response to Max's claim has much WIFOM in it. Technically, it is possible that Maxous is town and Hindu went down easy in a conscious effort to look like a bus, but even when I try to look at it completely objectively (after all I'm quite biased when I consider this scenario), it just strikes me as exceedingly unlikely that a scum player would execute that kind of tactic on the fly without having any opportunity to discuss it with a scum partner. He would be handing a great deal of credibility to Max in the hopes that his partner would pick up on it the next day and be able to make a strong case without ever having the chance to confer with him. It's possible, but it seems overly complex and unlikely. The Max/Hindu bus plan is also complex, but they had an entire night period to plan it, so it seems far more plausible. Admittedly, there is some WIFOM, but one option seems so implausible that I really can't imagine anyone actually executing it. It's possible that I only hold this opinion because I'm not looking at it impartially, but I don't think so.", "time": "Sun May 15, 2011 5:16 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16852&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "16852"}

However, I agree it couldn't realistically have been an attempt to dissuade the wagon. First, because (as you note) SubG never showed any intention to push elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n But also because, looking at the substance of SubG's argument again, I seriously doubt he could have even entertained any hope that it would stop CMAR getting lynched. If scum are going to try and derail a wagon, they need to do it effectively. Thus, if that was SubG's intention, you'd expect him to have actually either argued against CMAR's lynch or, alternatively, jumped to another candidate. I accept that SubG-scum would have had good reason to want to stall the wagon on CMAR - but in the circumstances, I don't think he would have judged a temporary stall as outweighing the risk that he would come under suspicion for it. <br>\n<br>\nThe wagon did build up quickly, even though, as I pointed out, if you took a more complex view and looked at its history, it wouldn't look so sudden. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite><br>\nThis is an incredibly tough spot, as much as I hate it, I have a horrible feeling that I'm going to end up voting wrong.

Part of my interpretation of NK resolution was that the RB would only only work on one action.  Not all actions.  Which 99 times out of a hundred neve comes into play to begin with.  I don't think it is vey often that plays have two abilities they can conduct.  Also...to say both RBs should have gone through (and no NK) would have completely negated any impact of Vollkan's RB while in effect allowing Maxous' RN to occur.  Having them offset, or cancel each other out, seemed like the proper thing to do.  As under these circumstances at least one reviewer agreed to during N4.  <br>\n<br>\nEither way..Vollkan really kept the suspicion off him the entire game.
