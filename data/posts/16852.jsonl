Mafia is a game. Please try to have fun while playing it. Blatant personal attacks on other players will result in warning optional modkill and auto-loss to the offending player.<br>2. You have been given a win condition and it is your job to try and fulfill it. Do not deliberately play against your win condition and/or deliberately hurt your faction with your play.<br>3. Do not quote your role PM. Do not quote from any mod-provided private QT. Both these will result in modkill and auto-loss.<br>4. Talking about the game outside the thread or any mod-provided QT is forbidden. Unless the offense is incredibly minor (i.e. brief mention of the game without discussing any of its content), this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>5. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts, do not do so, this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>6. Unreadable text is forbidden. This includes but is not limited to cyphers, incredibly small text and invisible text.<br>7. Dead players may not speak in the thread once they are dead. Not even a simple \u201cBah\u201d post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rules Of Voting And Deadlines:</span><br>8. Votes must be bolded and in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Havingfitz</span>. I suggest using the vote button when placing your vote to ensure it is formatted properly and easily noticed.<br>9. You have the option to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No Lynch</span>.<br>10. Unvotes are not required but should be bolded when used.<br>11. A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1. For example, Day 1 will have 13 players alive, and ((13+1)/2) = 7 votes to lynch.<br>12. After a lynch or no lynch occurs the thread will be locked once I announce the result. Posting can continue until the thread is locked.<br>13. Day 1 will last 3 weeks. All future days will last 2 weeks. All nights will last 72 hours.<br>14. If no player reaches a majority of votes by the deadline on a given day, No Lynch will occur.  <br>15. If a player does not submit a night action by the end of any given night, they will not act that night.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rules Of Activity And Prods:</span><br>16. If a player goes 72 hours without posting in-thread, they will be prodded. If they do not post in-thread within 24 hours following a prod, they will be replaced.<br>17. Please let your mod know if you will be on V/LA \u2013 post it in-thread and bolded.<br>18. Players are allowed two prods. Player replacement takes the place of a third prod.<br>19. Players may request a prod on another player if a player has gone without posting for 72 hours and I have missed prodding them.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rules Unrelated To The Previous Categories:</span><br>20. Though I am the mod, I'm not exempt from making mistakes. If I screw up something, please PM me and point it out.<br>21. My color is <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">blue</span></span></span>. Do not use it.<br>22. Vote counts will be posted at my discretion and by request if necessary.<br>23. Anything game related that needs brought to my attention (ie votecount and prod requests, v/LAs, etc) must be bolded and preferably start with \u201cMod, \u201c</div></div></div><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:75%\"></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample Vanilla Town PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Hi.

Some are practical. What timezone do you live in? That's a reasonable and relavent question, but has very, very little application for scumhunting. Do you like being scum, or town? Irrelavent BECAUSE it cannot be applied in any way towards case-building. His metagaming question is dubious at best. Metagaming can tell you, potentially, if someone is playing differently then usual, but it's always going to be debatable evidence. My experience has been that cases using metagaming as any sort of major component will meander around for a little bit, while RARELY actually going far enough to lynch, and even MORE rarely, actually catching scum. I'm willing to reevaluate my experience if given a few cases where metagaming was used successfully, since I haven't done much reading, and I'm used to a very different playstyle then MS.net uses, but the idea that \"he's playing a different kind of game then he did when he was town, and this is suspicious\" is weird to me."}

But, the questions THEMSELVES needed to have a purpose, and you've as of yet to tell me how you intend to use ANY of the answers in a town-productive way. And no, I can't really show you a game where RVS has, provably and immediately, led to a scum-lynch. I can show you plenty of games, though, where RVS has been used on D2 or D3(or, scum doing stupid things under the GUISE of RVS early game, which can't be done if there is no rvs) to conclude or finish proving a case. On the other hand, your statement has gone from \"RVS is generally unproductive\" to \"RVS HAS NEVER EVER WORKED EVER!\" Also, the rvs debate is slightly moot at this point as I've explained my reasoning. Refusing to partake and then doing nothing at all = antitown. Refusing to partake and doing something else(ie rqs) = productive. Asking questions that are at best irrelavent and at worst WIFOM/leading, and then refusing to offer up any reasoning behind how you intend to use the questions = antitown at best."}

You may continously state that meta-gaming is useless and have never seen it help, but again that's your opinion something that I strongly disagree, the purpose of this question is to gain a broad understanding of the bonds formed inside the room. As well as if anyone has anything notable they remember that a particular player does a few examples would be (Tunnel, Lurk, OMGUS, AtE). Sure, the fact they may have used them in the past as mafia doesn't mean they're mafia this game from it but it helps gain a better understanding if it's their natural play-style if they're attempting to differ from it.<br>3.

This question againw as so I have an idea of how much content people are likely to post and to be frank, it just for curiosities sake.<br>5. I've seen multiple players in the past sheep lynches without much questioning and response, I've ended up tunnelling and pushing against these players due to it to find out they sheep regardless of allignment. It's things like this that I'm interested in finding out.<br><br>C) To state that a lynch on mafia in previous games is purely due to the RVS period is a blatant lie, though I do agree with you saying that the RQS isn't that much better, personally I like neither and to start discussion around optimal ways to play the setup but since this setup is open we cant' do that. Thus my attempt to deviate from the norm of the RVS and instead attempt RQS which occasionally puts people on the spot. Though, from reading peoples responses I don't have a real-leading suspect at the moment though I will need to have a proper re-read later when I'm not as tired."}

Watching the progression of my own arguments, I have been being terrible, for reasons that you guys have been swift to point out. I am, for the moment, satisfied with the answers given by Regfan. If he had any other questions I failed to answer though, point them out. I might have missed them scanning through the flurry of events that occured while I was away. I didn't think we'd hit page 4 so fast in a 3 week long game. I'm kinda used to D1 being over by page 6 or 7(D1 usually being 72 or 96 hours long at most) so I'm still getting used to the pacing here at MS.net<br><br><br>My eyes are now on the two most recent votes on me. People who voted for me first, I accept your reasoning, so understand that my dislike of Bgg and Yura's votes is not by any means OMGUS. I was tunneling, as stated earlier, and am going to let me eyes wander a little more, and stop focusing so much on Regfan. As for why Bgg and Yura or my new persons of interest is because bgg decided I hadn't posted \"in the longest time\" when at the time of bgg's post(4:50 pm server time) since 8:30 am. A whole 8 hours and 20 minutes. Why, that's almost as long as a SHIFT AT A FULL TIME JOB(Plus or minus commute). And Yura is on the block for so suddenly and rediculously bandwagoning. And thusly, <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote:Yura-chi</span>. Bgg is promising more logical reasons, and I'll decide if I think he's scum-hunting or not when the time comes. Yura, though, has nothing more then \"Oh, yeah, he has been quiet...*L-3*\". A frightening sort of bandwagoning, and enough to get my vote on D1"}

Whilst some people questioned what me meant and/or offered suggestions about how to format his vote, nobody attacked him (mainly, I guess, because it was an obvious non-case vote).  His reaction above is completely disproportionate to any criticism that he might have received, and I can't think of any way that, if he was acting genuinely, he would unvote as a response. The obvious newbscum reason, however, is that he doesn't like the little attention that he got and is now being contrite and unvoting to avoid it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>yurachi wrote:</cite>nothing's going on i just unvoted my mistake....<br></div></blockquote><br><br>\"Nothing to see here officer!\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Yura-chi wrote:</cite>I JUST WASNT SURE ABOUT MY VOTE N SOMEONE SAID 2 ME I SHUD NOT TALK ABOUT USELESS STUFF SO I DID N MADE IT SHORT...

At some base level, they will still be operating under town and scum motivations - it's just that their modes of acting will be more irrational and/or extreme than most people's. Yura's play maps perfectly with a newbscum pattern, and doesn't gel at all with a town thinking pattern."}

At the same time, the game simply becomes impossible if you even seriously entertain the idea that somebody is trolling rather than playing seriously.  At the very least, Magnetic's play has a clear scum motivation. I don't want to run away from that, and also permanently protect Magnetic, by giving him an out on the basis that he is 'trolling'. And, don't forget, aside from the scum motivation, bear in mind that trolling =/= town. If he is trolling, that has no relationship to his alignment.<br><br>So, whilst I am conflicted on magnetic, I think the balance favours him being lynched immediately.

On the one hand, he has a very good point about prolonging the day, though he's not the first to make it.<br><br>On the other hand, he made a very poor attempt at bandwagoning, now that I'm confident that's what it was. He promised more logical reasons soon, and so I reserved specific judgement on his vote until he did. Now that he didn't, I think it pretty clearly was an attempt at a wagon. His defense of Bgg is also suspect, though mostly because I've never actually heard of 'strong doctor'(I have heard of, and seen, the use of the 'weak' prefix before, which I've seen on cops as well as doctors to mean that if they try and target scum, they die.) It's possible I misunderstand, and when Bgg said \"strong doctor\" and just mean \"normal doc\", but even in that case, there's no benefit to a doctor fake-claiming a role identical to his own, but slightly worse. <br><br>And, Max, the reason we want to stretch the day as long as possible is because on N1, a townie will almost certainly die. We need to learn as much information as we possibly can today, related to things ASIDE from Magnetic. For the moment, Magnetic, Yura, and Bgg are on my list, in that order. Maxous's misunderstanding that \"The only rason to extend the day would be for the possibility of the town changing their minds\" seems kind of off, but I think it's just someone not quite understanding, and not something much less innocent.<br><br><br>mafia edit: Regfan, a couple quick questions about your points:<br>The more interactions we have, the more we can learn from whoever the mafia select as their NK, so I disagree that this is a disadvantage.<br>[quote=\"Regfan]The possibilty that Magnetic and other players interactions with Magnetic will give us a better clue of their allignment, however people will just yell WIFOM whenever any of this is brought up.[/quote]<br>I don't understand this at all.

Not for today, anyway. I think we can spend a few more days on D1 to figure out who our D2 lynch should be, and then reevaluate on the other side of the first NK to see if our information lines up, but at the same time, I cannot see fit to bring both Magnetic, and Yura along with us. I'm honestly fine with either being the eventual D1 lynch."}

The reason for lynching \"a\" is obvious. The reason for lynching \"b\" is that if I can't trust that someone isn't playing around with gambits and reaction tests, I can't read them as scum or town, and I don't want that kind of player making things more difficult down the road.

Knowing this, it's foolish to read too much into why the targets were chosen. We can't know the scum motivation for killing any particular player, so it would be unwise to lynch somebody on the basis of assuming we know those motivations. The killer might have picked tclawren because he considered him a strong town candidate, but unlikely to be watched. He might have picked him purely randomly. He might have picked him with the intention of making the exact argument you're making on D2 to fuel the lynch of an innocent. Also, the \"optimal\" kill isn't necessarily the player that has already expressed suspicion of the actual scum, it could be the player that is considered most likely to eventually pin point the scum and lead a wagon against him.

No it's not, explain to me why yura is or was a bad lynch.

In either case, you are indicating suspicion. The only difference between the two is, as I indicated in the analogy above, that the latter gives you a form of plausible deniability.<br><br>(FTR, the reason it gives plausible deniability is right there in bgg's post - it doesn't rely \"on the people, and whatever else that they might have done\".

I think he, at worst, reads null to me, but I am more inclined to read 'misguided town' in his actions. Things like 'are you vig' aren't something even the worst of scum would outright ask, after all. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>How do you think his play would differ if he was scum? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SC wrote:</cite>As to the second point, what conclusions do you draw from him changing his mind?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Well, I don't think he did \"change his mind\" in the sense of forming a different opinion. The point is that he clearly made an attack on whoever wanted the day to end quickly. Then, when called out on this, he has resorted to this weird semantic defence about how he wasn't attacking anybody in particular but, rather, was attacking their conduct - like it makes a difference.<br><br>So, with that in mind, the scumminess in this is not a contradiction but, rather, the fact that he is refusing to actually commit both to defending his position and identifying his suspects and, instead, is just playing word games.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>bgg1996 wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You think I did something scummy, but that doesn't mean you suspect me.

I don't find him scummy because I have seen less-then-adept town including myself play exactly this way, but I haven't seen scum behave quite so textbook scummy. It's much, much more likely in my mind that's he's just a townie who made a mistake and can't do anything to remedy it without looking worse. \"Woops, made a mistake, sorry\" at this point would look just as bad against him as anything else.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>SC wrote:</cite>A quick look over things and Yura's current post continues a rather disturbing trend of contributing nothing, and riding nearly every single bandwagon, or potential bandwagon so far this game. She has rarely missed even one. This is terrible practice, and not at all in the town's favor, possibly bordering on a definitive scumtell. The constant wagoning would combine with the lack of original evidence to keep Yura in my top spot in spite of andrew climbing quickly closer.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Whilst I give a QFT to the second quote above, I want to juxtapose the two, because I don't think your position is inconsistent.<br><br>Both bgg and Yura are playing badly. I also think they are both scummy.  You', however, only think that Yura is scummy (in fact, you indicate that she is your #1 suspect). This is interesting because your defence of bgg (which boils down to \"too scummy to be scum\") should apply equally, if not more so, in the case of Yura. <br><br>I recognise that there is a difference between the two, in that bgg at least has a thread of reasoning to follow, even if I think it's ridiculous.

I simply don't see a mafia making this MANY mistakes, I should say. Slip once or twice, yeah, but even under pressure I consider it more likely a desperate townie fumbling for survival then I do a scum fumbling for his disguise.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Apologies if you already answer this in response to my \"How would his play differ?\" question, but I'd like to know how you think \"fumbling townie\" differs from \"desperate scum\"? Reason is, I am concerned that this might be a case of you sympathetically projecting your own history onto bgg.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> erm bro. i come on once or twice a day. then do my stuff, sleep etc. (and this is the weekends)<br><br>is 'one day' lurking? notice that its my sleeping time when the 2 pages roll in<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> again, you are pointing to my lack of posts to suggest that i am lurking and to discredit my case. do you even know what lurking is? its not 'posting low amounts', its 'cant post a lot'. then, the only confusion about magnetic was the fact that he said 'weak doctor protect fails if attaack by more than 1 person', to me: that was what THE NORMAL DOC does anyway. and also at the end where he listed everyone as likely town.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Andrew, lurking is more about content then it is about number of posts.<br><br>Take the above two posts as a classic example: despite everything that has happened since your previous post, the only thing you see fit to do is to argue that you aren't lurking.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>????<br>on which paricular things<br></div></blockquote> <br><br>The fact you need to ask this is proof that you are lurking. <br><br>Time to issue my tried-and-tested ultimatum: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Read up, or replace out</span><br><br>Please give us, in your next post, two sentences minimum on each player telling us your opinion of them.<br><br>If you can't or won't, for any reason, do that, then leave.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>bgg wrote:</cite>I think that even if it is normal for him to be lurking, if he refuses to post his opinions, and such, then he deserves to be lynched.

On the off chance I'm wrong, hooray, I have a pleasant surprise.<br><br>Vig or SK is completely irrelevant at this point, particularly because if we mislynch today, an SK would have nearly as much motivation to try to NK a mafia member as a vig would. Even if there is a vig, how is it going to change your play? It shouldn't at all. If you're town, either way you should be hunting scum. <br><br>The question of SK or vig concerns mafia more than it concerns town, and I'm pretty worried by the fact that you're still hung up on this issue. I consider it a scum tell both because I feel that it has become a substitute for meaningful scum hunting and because the information you're digging for is more important to mafia than it is to town."}

Speicifically I've SEEN people do the same things as Bgg and turn out scum. I've never really seen any play at all like Yura's, and am, notably, no longer taking him as suspect number 1. And, about sympathetically projecting my own history, it's not exclusively mine.

Who whomever has killing roles is hard evidence that can't be falsified.  Almost everything else in the game is subject to opinion and how you read what they wrote where you know the mafia/sk killed for a reason.  I also believe that it's easier to pin down one person's motivations than a group so I decided to analyze the SK's decision over the mafia's decision first when I had little time to analyze everything the way I would like to.<br>3) Everyone in mafia plays to win.  Non-town try to ensure their survival while town are fine dying if they can catch scum.  Therefore, scum generally get rid of threats to them if and when they think that they can get away with it.  SKs fall into this even moreso than mafias cause they don't have anyone but themselves to rely on so they're more likely to kill off direct threats.

For example, false claiming a power role might prevent you from getting lynched, but it is not pro-town, because it can result in outing a real power role or taking doctor protections from real power roles.

On a theory level, \"more likely\" is neither the proper standard to apply in the game, nor is it the standard that the vast majority of people, in fact, apply. I'm hesitant to start a theory debate on this, because it gets into fairly abstract issues. But, basically, a) since almost everybody can see that almost nothing is scummy divorced of its circumstances (ie. it is terrible play to apply a blanket set of scumtells) and b) nobody has the empirical evidence needed to actually know what scum are \"more likely\" to do, we fall back on a behavioural/motivational approach.

No it's not, explain to me why yura is or was a bad lynch. Stating someone is a bad lynch without being willing to go into discussion showing your reasoning IS a scum-tell because mafia often do it in an attempt to either A) Buddy a townie B) Attempt to seem as if they're scum-hunting.\u201d<br><br>Again, you are taking liberties with what I said.  I SAID IT WAS A BAD VOTE..VOTE...VOTE...it was a bad vote at that point ESPECIALLY FROM vollkan.  <br>Who knows better than voting obvious VIs (village idiots) that early in the game.  Vollkan is one to do some decent scum hunting and a vote on Yuro at that point in the game was bad from vollkan.  And I think he knows that.<br><br>So you think I chose Yuro to buddy with?...really?...after I just insulted him?  Really?  Really?  That is what you want to go with?  And whether you think so or not\u2026questioning someone about a bad vote is scum hunting.<br><br>REG SAID \u201cExplain the relevance of this defence at all, what does his allignment have to do with your play? If you ask someone a question, you either A) Harp over it until you get an answer B) State real reasoning for stopping hunting for that answer. Again you've done neither.\u201d<br><br>Again you are taking shit out of context and avoiding the question, what was scummy about me not following up on a question on someone that wasn\u2019t posting (to answer my question)?  My point about his alignment has to do with questioning your motivation of for attacking me today.  You said it was scummy that I didn\u2019t follow up on a question....if he was town, I could see how that might be scummy (ie trying to bus, but not following up)..but dude flipped town..sans alignment WHAT WAS SCUMMY ABOUT THAT ACTION, especially given the fact he wasn\u2019t posting to answer my question?  It wouldn\u2019t have been scummy to harp on the same question over and over again to someone that wasn\u2019t there? BULLSHIT..not only that...I didn\u2019t follow up my question (you apparently are missing that). <br><br>I said..\u201dlets say I was(somewhere on site), how do you know that and WHY IS THAT FUCKING SCUMMY \u201c<br><br>REG SAID \u201cWhat? Are you saying 'when did you decide things are scumtells?'\u201d<br><br>Again avoiding the questions...you say I was on site, but don\u2019t back the shit up with anything....you are alluding that me being on site right before the quick lynch (that I wasn\u2019t on) was scummy, but you don\u2019t explain how you know that OR why it is scummy.  <br><br>REG SAID in response to asking him when he felt I was scummy\u2026\u201dMid to end of yesterday, if you read back you'll notice me saying it as well.\u201d<br><br>So it really wasn\u2019t an ISO you were doing, it was putting together a case.   You weren\u2019t going into the read thinking, \u201clets see if he is scum\u201d you tunneled into it thinking \u201clets prove CKD is scum\u201d\u2026.yesterday your main gripe with me was what exactly?  That I wanted to pressure vote (ie a new wagon) on someone else?  I didn\u2019t like the wagon yesterday and wanted a different one.<br><br>REG SAID \u201cYou want me to speculate on who I think a town PR is? What benefit does that give us at all, if anything it assists mafia in knowing who to kill. For someone who has been here for 4 years you should know this.\u201d<br><br>Don\u2019t be an asshat, you know exactly why I am asking this question.  Well, let me ask it again so you don\u2019t feel so you cant avoid it twice\u2026HAVE YOU thought about who might be the vig (since you think there is one) given the fucking events of yesterday.  <br><br>@at everyone else, I don\u2019t think we have a vig\u2026I think we have a mafia (shot) and an sk (stab).<br><br>I don\u2019t believe for a second YOU believe the weak ass case you have put together.<br>---<br><blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite>(elephant)<br>The point CKD was making was pretty damn obvious, considering he made it in the two lines directly above his !!!!!s</div></blockquote><br>If you turn out to be scum in the game, this particular post will make me laugh.  You know vollkan, I have developed a thought about you..think I have expressed it in past games...if scum doesn\u2019t kill you night 1...you are probably scum...every time I think that and don\u2019t follow up, you have indeed been scum.  The only thing going for you in this game, is that (i don\u2019t think) no one has played with you before.  <br><br>Also, I know you are not a newbie...but this game feels VERY newbish....like someone attacking a pressure vote because I actually used the word \u201cpressure\u201d when voting.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>The fact you're attempting to compare !!!!! and the elephant picture is beyond mind boggling.

The ISO was done with intent to see if I felt the same way afterwards, and if so to be a partial-case against you.  Thanks for finally providing the reasoning I was after, you only needed to state that Volkon voting a VI was the issue with it, not stating the reasoning behind why something is a bad vote leads to benefit for the town.<br><br>@CKD, I never said you attempted to buddy Yura, you're taking things outside of their context, I said mafia would defend a player for two reasons and then stated what they are. You're attempting to poke holes into an irrelevant statement.<br><br>@CKD, I don't believe I ever said you were on the site at the time of the actual lynch. You did however post just before twilight had occured meaning you were there so denying or discussing that is futile. It's scummy because you witheld your opinion on his allignment at the end, though I will re-read into this more later when I have time.<br><br>@CKD, In response to my thoughts about Vig in the setup, have I thought about who the vig is? Yes. Will I state who I think the vig is? No. You attempt to state that I'm tunneling 'soley' on you, when the truth is I've been in multiple discussions with/about Yura/Bgg, if I were tunnelling I would be merely pushing your lynch rather then considering other suspects.  <br><br>@CKD, Yes I noticed from checking other games that you have a pattern of stating a promise to catch up in the next 24 hour post, then a catching up wall post, then afk'ing for 1-2 days and repeat thus inactivity is a null-tell in regards to you.

I don't see why a town would just make stuff up like that. She completely forgot her suspicion and vote on Bgg. </div></blockquote><br>Isn't it highly evident from Yuras posts that she's obv newbscum/newbtown and either one would fit the defintion of forgetting their FoS's and sheeping other lynches. I don't mean to say that just because Yura is a newb that they shouldn't be lynched, but surely that's very poor reasoning to vote Yura over your two stronger FoS's.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Maxous: iI don't feel I was too indecisive in this game (just plain wrong lol) but here's a game of me as town if you want.<br>I only played two games as town on this site and the other one was really short - over by page 8 or somthing I think :O </div></blockquote><br>Then what led you to say that you're indecisive as town?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Suprise: We have been getting mad at players in this game for refusal to give opinions.

Besides what I've already said about not finding hypocrisy to be a scum tell, I don't think she was being hypocritical. If you read Yura's post, she accuses bgg of \"making useless arguments,\" While she admits not to being \"useless and dumb\" but of being thought of as \"useless and dumb\". Making \"useless arguments\" and being thought of as \"useless and dumb\" are two different things, which invalidates the charge of hypocrisy. Both involve being useless, but one is a judgement by others while the other is a deliberate act of creating dumb arguments. Even if she actually admitted to being useless and dumb, that is still not the same thing as making dumb arguments. <br><br>I want to be clear here. I am not doing this because I want to defend Yura. I am doing this because I want to show that Vollkan is not an infallibly logical scum hunting robot as he would like to portray himself. I think this was a pretty poor post, and an extremely bad set of reasons for switching a vote from another serious scum suspect. If a different player switched votes off of a wagon just as it was gaining steam using this post as justification, I would not have a problem calling it quite scummy. With Vollkan, I'm not quite as sure, because I realize that he's dogmatically following a scoring system that allows this kind of flip flopping. I can't say whether it's the system that's to blame or Vollkan.<br><br>I'm dreading the theory discussion this will probably spawn, but as I said, I was having trouble continuing to bite my tongue on it."}

I'll direct you to my analogy. \"If you hold the dagger up to somebody's neck, and say \"I am only doing this to apply pressure to you so that you tell me this secret\", you are not reducing any pressure of this threat.\" That's mental pressure. The only reason it didn't have much pressure behind it is because Magnetic was as good as lynched.<br>4. I only said that people were tunneling, at least by my definition, and needed to stop. Do you dispute that?<br>5. When I am a member of the town, defending myself is pro-town. That was my point. I wasn't even defending myself, I was attacking a statement that was very clearly false. <br>6. I think that this is true. If I am moderately scummy, and most other people are not scummy at all, then I am probably scum. If most everyone else is extremely scummy,then I probably town. It is basic probability. <br>7. That is not the only evidence against him. Not to mention that I am still using that same speculation."}

We can't ask new player to explain anything Yura said, and new player has the advantage of, in good sense, us being unable to lynch them. THEY haven't done anything scummy.

Extension or no, I don't see a person giving us more information in the next couple of days, then we already have on yura from the past couple of WEEKS. It's not bad logic, I've seen it done numerous times on this site. When someone is close to hammer, and then gets replaced out, things get complicated and impossible to figure unless the hammer is still dropped.

I\u2019m trying a new tactic of reading the game, so bare with me when playing.<br><br>I trust everyone knows the difference between lurking and active lurking, and that I\u2019m not going to have to explain it even once during this game -_-<br><br>Day One!<br>Token/Regfan: Dislikes the RVS, Token does not suggest a suitable alternative, Regfan suggests RQS. All questions were fine except for the 5th one, in which he asked whether people prefer to lead or follow. Any questions like that can give the scum valuable information as to what makes each player tick \u2013 thus why I discourage questions like that. What did Regfan hope to gain from asking this question? If he was scum, he would know who to target for buddying and who would be very easily influenced, giving a good indicator of who they should leave alive until lylo. Answers this question with \u2018leader\u2019 which would give him an easy excuse later on in the game for leading the town in stupid directions. The third question can be used by the mafia to attack a player if they lose interest in the game and lurk. If someone who prefers playing town, is town and still lurks, mafia could use that as an attempt at a case against them. <br><br>1. I\u2019m a Brit.<br>2. Vullkan or CKD. Maybe both. Was definately one of them. \u2013 he made me check my role pm to check if I really was town, cause he convinced me otherwise. Can\u2019t remember his role.<br>3. Refuse to answer.<br>4. Couple of times a day? Sometimes I have a habit of lurking for a few days, then posting several large walls.<br>5. Refuse to answer.<br><br>@ Vollkan \u2013 Can you keep two point scores for me? One with the person who I replaced, and my own? <br><br>I like Surprise_Carcinogen\u2019s post (number 18), pretty much realizes why RQS is bad and is against it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Vollkun wrote:</cite> My avatar is meant to be expressing anger at the use of \"gut\". FWIW, if I have a schtick on this site, it's for hating gut-based play. </div></blockquote><br>Why is this? Just for the record, I\u2019m a very gut based player but have found it holds very little influence over what happens during the game, so I re-read my gutscum players and form logical cases against them.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite>Hm, seems like a pretty powerful tool for giving your completely subjective observations a false air of objectivity. I do not like it.</div></blockquote><br>It\u2019s called \u2018Operationalising\u2019 in Psychology, it\u2019s a tactic often used in research to give something a value like Vollkun is doing. It\u2019s not scummy. I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite pro-town because if we look through his posts and find his pluses and minuses are disproportionate to his opinions, then we have pretty good evidence for him being scum. He\u2019s basically showing his whole hand and holding nothing back, which is what I would expect from a townie.<br><br>Magnetic got banned for being parknourie. /offtopic.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Magnetic wrote:</cite> But for me, Ima genius motherfuck so I can say someone's 100% scum or 100% town. K?</div></blockquote><br>You\u2019re also holding double standards. Don\u2019t say its wrong for one person to say something and for you to say something else.<br><br>For everyone\u2019s information: Even if I was cop with a guilty result, I\u2019d still have 1% doubt in it due to possible unknown sanily. <br><br>I wish people would either claim or not claim, not ask questions about whether they should or not first. It seems scummy. (Carcin)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> I've concluded that two players have a playstyle more cautious then most I've played with in my one other game on mafiascum, and in my experiences playing on other forums.</div></blockquote><br>And this is important, because?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Truant wrote:</cite> Otherwise, vote for sub or possibly pappum's as a third option.</div></blockquote><br>Why those two? Why are you trying to \u2018threaten\u2019 people into voting for whom you want them to? Where were you prior to your first post? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> His metagaming question is dubious at best. Metagaming can tell you, potentially, if someone is playing differently then usual, but it's always going to be debatable evidence</div></blockquote><br>I disagree. Meta can be useful, obviously people shouldn\u2019t be lynched based on that alone, but it can be pretty solid evidence. People can change some of their meta, but there\u2019s always very subtle differences between their posts as town and scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maxeous wrote:</cite> It seems like he does'nt actually suspect anybody he's just pretending to do so because they stood out a little by following the crowd with the RVS - by the way from my experience following the crowd is what the mafia tend to do not the town.</div></blockquote><br>At this stage in the game, do you really expect people to be forming strong cases on other people. You work with what you\u2019ve got in front of you. <br><br>Hello Yura-chi, she\u2019s annoying me cause she\u2019s posting in text language -.-<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Truant wrote:</cite> pappum is a decent 3rd option because he really hasn't said anything. Putting time and effort into following a joke, while throwing down a vote with weak reasoning (and not applying it across the board when it should be very easy to spot with like 40 posts total in the game) is a weak indicator of not wanting to be too out there (hesitant scum)</div></blockquote><br>Hypocrisy. Neither had you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite> 2)Anyone who hasn't posted yet. Granted, it's the weekend and people might have things to do, but lurking isn't cool. At least check in.</div></blockquote><br>ARRRRGH NO! NO NO NO! I am going to explain this once. Lurking is not scummy, it\u2019s anti-game which isn\u2019t scummy, Active Lurking is scummy. People have haven\u2019t posted at that time, weren\u2019t active lurking, they were lurking. If people make jokes all the time, post in other threads but not this one and do a whole load of other things in this criteria, they are active lurking.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> i have to go a tourney now, but i would like to note that yuri speaks like a man...</div></blockquote><br>How is this relevant in any way? This is an example of a real filler post and active lurking.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Token wrote:</cite> It's obvious she's bad at the game, but it's hard to tell if she's actually scum.</div></blockquote><br>She read as lost newbie town to me. Me thinks Token needs to join more newbie games so he can read newbies better.<br><br>People need to stop the HoSing and have the balls to make a vote.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>bgg wrote:</cite> I'll vote: Surprise_Carcinogen because, as of this moment, he has not posted for the longest time.</div></blockquote><br>Good vote. Bad reasoning. Carcin looks scummy at this moment because she left when people stopped putting pressure on her. I half retract this because I didn\u2019t notice it have only been 8hrs. What I\u2019m not liking is that Bgg cast a vote and expected people to follow it before he had posted his reasons. It looks like he\u2019s just flinging a vote down and making something up later.<br><br>Tunneling isn\u2019t scummy, by the way, it\u2019s a perfectly valid scum tactic.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Vollkun wrote:</cite> The obvious newbscum reason, however, is that he doesn't like the little attention that he got and is now being contrite and unvoting to avoid it.</div></blockquote><br>Stop throwing fuel on a fire, she obviously was saying sorry for her ipod not being able to bold properly.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite> I believe that's the definition of a weak doctor, though never played with one before so I'm not sure. For now: Unvote</div></blockquote><br>Wait? You\u2019re unvoting a player who reacted so badly to being voted that he claimed his role?<br><br>Magnetic is making my blood boil. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to read his posts anymore. I HATE cheaters.<br><br>Wait? Regfan DOESN\u2019T vote the admitted liar?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maxeous wrote:</cite> Bgg you are saying we should talk. Okay, but talk about what or who? Espically since you're saying we should lynch Magnetic anyway. There is no difference to lynching him now or in 2 weeks.</div></blockquote><br>Didn\u2019t you get the memo? The only weapon the town has to find out who scum is without outing their power roles is discussion and voting. We need to discuss do we can find out who to vote next day or see if the lynchee is going to accidentally let something slip. Regfan doesn\u2019t get it either?<br><br>If Bgg doesn\u2019t give reasons for voting Carcin, then we pressure him to do so ~.~ We don\u2019t leave it.<br><br>Pg 7: Where\u2019s pappums gone?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> 1) Bgg, when asked \"why don't you change your vote\" \"I wont change my vote\" isn't a real answer</div></blockquote><br>Because he didn\u2019t read the question, he read what question his brain wanted him to see. Using that knowledge, it allows me to see that he is feeling pressured over the vote for some reason. Definitely something to pressure him for a bit later, or pressure him for something else!. <br><br>At this point, I\u2019m leaning scum on Bgg and Regfan.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite> If he does flip mafia, then I would consider Yura town.</div></blockquote><br>Non-sequitor. They haven\u2019t communicated much at all. You can\u2019t consider Yura town just because she voted for Bgg, and that goes for any votes!.<br><br>Andrew\u2019s lurking.<br><br>Day Two<br>Well, it looks like Regfan came into the day knowing that he wanted to get CKD lynched. To me, this indicates that it may have been something discussed during the scum quicktopic/PMs and Regfan just dived right on in there without building up to a vote.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite> I was even thinking of keeping him alive as a kind-of scum-pet. Of course, if we had kept the day going, we may have found real scum, maybe even the SK</div></blockquote><br>You seem to know that there\u2019s an SK in the game, what an interesting thing to presume. It could equally be a Vig, but you instantly decide they\u2019re an SK. Why did you do this?<br><br>Andrew, I don\u2019t see anything scummy about Carcin for hammering CHEATING BASTARD. He was pretty scummy and I think anyone would have hammered him by then. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> Side note, everybody look at Andrew's ISO. Five posts, 2 votes, no substance.</div></blockquote><br>I pretty much agree with this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Carcin wrote:</cite> And aside from that, I dislike his refusal to read 'walls'</div></blockquote><br>He\u2019s going to love this one!<br><br>I\u2019m finding the interactions between Bgg/Vollkan and Vollkun/CKD quite interesting. Will re-read those at a later date.<br><br>I\u2019m more inclined to believe post 281, than I am to believe Bgg\u2019s responses/argument.<br><br>On page 13, I\u2019m thinking Bgg, Andrew and Regfan might be scum.<br><br>Andrew\u2019s not providing content and is pretty much active lurking. It looks like he\u2019s providing content, when he isn\u2019t really.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> hmm? are you saying if everyone calls me town then i cant fos or vote ANYONE since they all think im to win?</div></blockquote><br>No she\u2019s saying you\u2019re reasoning looks like your voting someone for thinking you\u2019re town. Stop strawmanning.<br><br>@ Bgg \u2013 If you\u2019re going to quote Vi, explain why you\u2019re doing it and don\u2019t fuck it up. And don\u2019t make really really bad arguments out of it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite> also, bgg feudin slipped</div></blockquote><br>IIf you see a slip, YOU VOTE FOR HIM IN THAT POST. Otherwise, it makes you scummy for not following through with your accusations. If you\u2019re town, you want to lynch scum so if you see someone slip up, you vote to lynch them.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite> I'll make sure to NK you for that statement.</div></blockquote><br>AND HE IS STILL ALIVE. *headdesk*<br><br>Carcin: Joking around and having fun is not a scumtell, or a towntell. It\u2019s a null tell. Because that\u2019s what these games are about. Having fun.<br><br>Regfan: For the love of god, put spaces between @ and playername. It is really really annoying when people don\u2019t do that. Also, you\u2019re ignoring everything else Andrew has done and are only voting him because you\u2019ve read his scum games. Then you don\u2019t explain what about his play is scummy and similar in this game? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite> yura-chi, I honeslty don't know whether to read him as dumb mafia or dumb town, it's quite frustrating actually.</div></blockquote><br>How about, you could have asked her what her views and opinions were on other players in the game, asked her about situations? That\u2019s lazy, if you don\u2019t knpw what alignment someone is, then take steps to finding out! Or it shows you\u2019re not really scumhunting.<br><br>Not liking Maxeous\u2019s self meta of indecisiveness.<br><br>Bgg is taking back his soft claim of a killing role. Backtracking and lying.

And the above is wrong. I know quite a bit about SK theory and they don\u2019t really tend to do that.<br><br>Bgg\u2019s opportunistic vote of Andrew in Iso 613, is obviously opportunistic. He seems to be trying to sway people away from voting him onto voting for Andrew instead who is also extremely scummy to everyone else.<br><br>Andrew votes CKD without any reasoning? Scummy.<br><br>I\u2019ll probably need to re-read the last few pages when I\u2019m not tired (I read this whole thing and wrote this post all in one session.)<br><br>I will be voting for either Andrew of Bgg depending on what my reread of the last few pages does."}

So instead of rereading ANY of the game so far, but you still find someone scummy enough you think they should hang. Charming.

Plus your last couple of posts combine with that to form a rather defensive opening line.<br><br>@Haylen: you're handily dodging all of my questions, and the threat at the end does you no favors. It's easy enough to pick those three. But I notice you don't really mention Yura-chi, for example, during your read. There are a LOT of players with that much scummy material going around, but you chose those three to more or less zero in on. This is why I find your choice of them suspect. There can't be two scum-teams(we've already gone over why, you'll get there eventually, I just dont' want to repost it). That, your \"I think it's anti-town not to do this\" statement, which is the same thing as saying \"I'm just being a townie\", and the instant defensiveness are all illuminating."}

They also tend to be more afraid of making mistakes that newbie scum are. Newbie scum just like to lurk. Note that she said she doesn't want people to hate her, this implies the majority of the people in the game ie. the rest of the town, if she messes up and loses.<br><br>#1: She tries to vote for Vollkan - based on this years influx of newbies, newbie scum seem to enjoy voting for their fellow newbies rather than for the more experienced players in the game. All anyone needs to do is look at the game and they'll see she voted for the most experienced player.<br><br>#2: She's upset that her ipod didn't work and she failed with her vote. <br><br>#4: Oh hey, girl on the internet gets pissed off at being called a he. Pretty sure that's what the shouting was about. I'm basing this on the fact that she seemed extremely young and less mature than some of us.<br><br>#5: That was a question, posted in a confused tone. Newbies don't see themselves at threats to scum.

But she doesn't know what she's looking for and how to scumhunt. It looks like she played a game too advanced for her and replaced out when she realised this.<br><br>#10: It's a fair question. Shes making an attempt at scumhunting. <br><br>#12: More attempt at scumhunting.<br><br>#13: Seems to be what she was doing. She understood that she needed to vote, so she did. But she didn't know what she was looking for. The scumhunting she did above stuff people had accused other people in the thread of doing which ties in with newbie town who doesn't know what she's doing.<br><br>#14: There we go! A good vote and good reasoning. She votes magnetic for reacting badly to the pressure of one vote.<br><br>#16: Knows Magnetic could be lying about being doc and sticks with her vote.<br><br>#20: Sound reasoning.<br><br>#24: This is where she realises that she's not sure what she's supposed to be doing and should be in a newbie game where she can learn the basics.<br><br>#25: Does not go for appeal to emotion which is what I would expect from newbie scum in this post.<br><br>#28: She's accusing CKD of buddying her. I find paranoia in newbies to be a towntell.<br><br>#29: Scum newbie would stick to CKD buddying her and wouldn't think of the possibility that he wasn't. <br><br>#35: Very very genuinely. She seems happy that town has more time to discuss about who's scum despite the fact that she's likely to be the one lynched.<br><br>#37: Defending herself.<br><br>But.<br><br>#39: Scumhunting.

I do care who gets lynched HENCE why I made sure it wasn't a hammer or even close to a hammer before I voted. If I didn't care who got lynched, I'd throw my vote on the largest bandwagon without reasoning. Instead, I placed my vote on someone who no one had been voting (except the person who replaced out) and I provided extensive reasoning. Also, how is me voting based on a scummy post any different than you putting forth an RVS vote? My vote was based on what I had read (like an RVS vote) and it managed to generate discussion (like an RVS vote).<br><br>3) \"If you put a vote on someone, it's a sign that you want them dead.\" Hmmm, funny that you didn't call Bgg out on that when he voted me? Instead you chose to hardcore buddy Bgg when myself and Haylen put forth suspicion on him. Also, that's untrue. Change it to: \"If you put a vote on someone, it's a sign that you find them scummy based on what you have seen up to this point, and therefore you are willing to show that by placing your vote on them.\" If what you had said was true, then anyone who unvotes is automatically scum because they are saying \"I wanted you dead, but now I don't and instead I want you dead\" which is waffling.<br><br>4) Scummy /=/ Scum : Bgg was scumMY because of that post, that doesn't necessarily automatically make him scum. Nowhere did I say he is automatically scum."}

I can't know whether he is scum based on one scummy post unless a) he claims scum or b) he scumslips which he did neither of. Therefore, he's scummy. So I voted him.

It's ALWAYS more protown of a person to stick to their guns and do what THEY think is right rather than change their opinion based on someone else's opinion or demand. Always. Sometimes even if the entire town is demanding it. Unlike most people, I find it protown of a person to refuse to claim despite the entire town telling them to. 1) They're doing what they think is right and not waffling their opinion just because of everyone else. 2) Scum is far less likely to do something of that nature as they try to blend in by PLEASING the town rather than fighting the town because they're doing what they think is right."}

Aside from the fact that your assertion that he has no scumreads is both wrong in fact and was not a reasonable opinion even from this single post that you based this attack on, your argument here really only proves that the pressure vote was useless - not that it was scummy<br><br>(* by \"conspiracy argument\", I mean an argument based on you attributing a motivation to him without proving why that motivation is the most reasonable explanation for his play)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> ...really?

Thus, your argument is, again, you latching onto the worst possible interpretation.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> Do you REALLY think that? REALLY? That I might come to the computer, see your one vote, and shit my pants and make sure the reread and my posting comes faster because of one vote? I hope not, or whatever...<br><br>*could it get much worse?*<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Again, useless =/= scummy<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite> Translation: Hopefully town would be dumb enough to all drop their scumreads and all come put stupid \"pressure votes\" down all at the same time on CMAR and he will be quick hammered. I'm speculating as to what my buddies should join me in doing. Now I'm going refer to CMAR as a townie. Whoops! A scumslip! Now I'm going to speculate that town will lose if they lynch a townie for no reason. Now I'm going to confirm that I indeed don't think CMAR is scum by saying that he's not yet \"at that level\", but that I'm going to vote him anyway because I damn well please.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>And, as I have already demonstrated, this flat-out contradicts your subsequent explanations - and you still haven't provided any meaningful explanation beyond, in essence, \"I was thinking one thing and typed the exact opposite in staggering detail\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite>She said prior to this that she is a sheep. So perhaps she felt she'd done something wrong when she was criticised and should be voting with everyone else.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>And yet, she'd been comfortable enough with not being sheepish in voting me in the first place.  In fact, she even said:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite> Ahhhhh since no one is choosing volkan for their vote Ima choose him n n ders miles edgeworth Acting funny <br> </div></blockquote><br><br>The above actually shows that, far from following people, she was actually trying to go against the grain.  If she really is just confused and scared about breaking from the pack, such an attitude makes no sense. If, however, it was just newbscum trying to be contrite and avoid the limelight, it makes perfect sense<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite> Because, from her point of view and my point of view, the only people who could find her threatening is scum. Thus why she asked the whether he truly found her to be a threat. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>Which relies on us assuming that, on being voted, Yura would, to begin with, think \"They must be voting me because they are scum and consider me a threat\". The first part is a strange assumption to make, and the second is downright ridiculous.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite>Newbie town are infinately more paranoid than newbie scum. Newbie scum only have to worry that they have been caught out. Newbie town worry that anybody in the game could be scum: \"is it the guy who's claimed cop or the person I've been defending all game\", they worry that they have done the wrong thing (for example: hammer) and that they're going to get lynched next day. They worry that their skills are so shockingly undeveloped that their reads are totally wrong. They worry that they've somehow said something that could be mistaken as a scumslip. Mostly, what they are worried about is that if they're lynched, the town isn't going to win - they have a massive fear of being lynched when it really doesn't matter.<br><br>Scum don't have to worry about anybody buddying them, cause they're the one doing the buddying most of the time! They don't gave to worry that the person they're attacking isn't scum, because they're scum themselves. ect ect.<br><br>Town paranoia is completely different to scum paranoia. In this case, she was worried CKD was buddying her. Only a townie would need to be worried about this.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>All fine as a matter of general theory, but what doesn't make sense is that this gives her an entirely contradictory attitude - she both thinks that anyone who votes her is trying to eliminate her as a \"threat\" but also that anyone who defends her is scum buddying. It's actually unusual for newbie town, given (as you say) the high priority they place on survival, to be worried about somebody defending them; generally, they tend to be thought of as a white knight<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Haylen wrote:</cite>A fallacy that tends to be wrong. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>\"too townie\" is a fallacy where the argument is \"This person is playing too well/too hard, so they must be scum\"<br><br>It isn't a fallacy where it is directed at a person who makes superficial rhetorical attempts to appear town/genuine"}

You kinda just threw it out there \"he must be a little bit experienced [so there is no way he's newb town, so he must be nervous scum].\"<br><br>Though I do like the 2nd big paragraph by <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2871400#p2871400\" class=\"postlink\">S_C here</a>. Good explanation for his vote on Reg, even if I don't agree with it.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2871410#p2871410\" class=\"postlink\">Tclwren here</a>: I agree with your first statement absolutely. Your 2nd one is ridiculous. The miller question is not related to THIS game in the least. Also, claiming that he's reaction testing is terrible. At the least he is acting as if he were reaction testing town to appear more protown herself (which CAN actually have protown motives: Town, especially PRtown, wants to appear more town to gain trust from the town, though scum has the same motive in order to gain the town's trust and appear to blend with the town) and at most (though a bit of a stretch) testing the waters to whether or not she should claim miller herself. The question directed at volkan is pretty easily connected the \"at most\" situation as volkan had the same thought as me and does not want her to know what town thinks before committing herself to a claim.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2871411#p2871411\" class=\"postlink\">Regfan's response</a> is quite protown and explains his reasons very well. RQS generally does yield more results than RVS. The fact that Regfan is very committed to his stance on RVS is quite protown and unwavering. When someone is firm in their stance on something, even despite the entire town disagreeing, that is protown."}

I'm pretty sure you're intelligent enough to gather that.<br>2) I absolutely trust the town that Bg (and apparently S_C) are clear for some reason. However, I am voting based on what I personally know and because I have yet to reread, I have no reason to take your word that andrew or whomever is scum because I can't know.<br>3) I am gathering votes on the premise that I have not reread yet and somehow that is scummy. I am town, I just haven't had the time to reread. That's not scummy, it's lurking, and it's certainly antitown, but it's life. I'm not trying to be stubborn, but I have more important things right now.<br>4) Stubbornness is not a towntell and the \"towntell\" you are referring to me saying I never said in the context of referring to myself. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I said</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">other people</span> were protown because they stuck to what they thought rather than changing their opinion to please the town, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I said</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">other people</span> were scummy because they switched from what they thought to what the town said in order to please the town, <span class=\"noboldsig\">but I never said</span> that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> was protown because I am sticking to my guns and keeping my vote on Bg.

Which is scummy.<br><br>In his last few posts, Andrew has told me that he hasn't lurked. I suggest he goes at looks back at day one where there is a contradiction to that in that he only posts 3 posts, none of which contain proper content. <br><br>He votes for Carcin on Day Two, without providing a case on her and the only explanation being that he finds he disturbing. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>@surprise, im saying that you are attacking the most' suspicious' person- yura, in order to deflect attention.</div></blockquote><br>If he finds yura the most suspicious then he should be voting for her. His suspicions are not in proportion with his votes.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>do you even know what lurking is? its not 'posting low amounts', its 'cant post a lot'. then, the only confusion about magnetic was the fact that he said 'weak doctor protect fails if attaack by more than 1 person', to me: that was what THE NORMAL DOC does anyway. and also at the end where he listed everyone as likely town.<br>and thus u hammered and you were WRONG. BUT U CONTINUED TO START THE DAY WITH A LEAD (PROB FAIL COS UR SCUM)</div></blockquote><br>Pretty much all of this is fail logic.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>bgg1996 is oppourtunistic in attempting to lynch me. where have i said i refuse to post my opinions.</div></blockquote><br>Fail logic again. Why would you not post your opinions? Wouldn't he try to lynch someone who refused to give their opinions on people and play the game? And I do see it as Andrew not giving his opinions, by the way.<br><br>As soon as people put pressure on him, he gets desparate and tells them to 'DIAF'. which is deflection in itself. 'If you think im scum, then you can DIAF :&lt;' <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>i did give opoinions on almost every player apart from volakn himself(who is a bully)</div></blockquote><br>Hypocrit. I can't see a list of opinions either.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>that seems like an epic way to say 'i like it that your contributing now' then 'but ur contribution is bad, this is why etc'.</div></blockquote><br>And it's not OK to say that? Well here you go. I like that you're contributing, but you're not contributing in a town way.<br><br>Andrew has a false sense of what Active Lurking is.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>because then, he doesnt read what happened, just generally commenting. i notice that when you read the whole thing, you will notice that people have already addressed the points.<br><br>thus: wall of fluff</div></blockquote><br>Um no. If everyone in every game started doing what you are suggesting CKD stop doing, then nobody would get anywhere in a game. If he doesn't post at all, then I'm assuming you will call him scum for lurking. Thus it's a catch 22 situation. <br><br> He makes all of these points but he doesn't explain what those points are. Like this, for example:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>alright, and bgg's case is just fail</div></blockquote><br>By not saying why it is fail, he's not giving Bgg the chance to defend himself which is scummy and could be distancing.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Andrew wrote:</cite>it appears that haylen hasnt fully read the game as there was some errors when she was referring to me (such as the lurking for instance)</div></blockquote><br>No there wasn't, you made 2 posts on day one.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Conclusion: Either scummy, or a really really bad player.

In 800 and a number of his previous defence posts, he clearly showed that he KNEW he was voting based on incomplete information. In other words, he had turned his mind to the question of \"Should I vote based on incomplete information?\" and, as he articulated most explicitly in 800, he clearly thought that it was okay for him to do that.<br><br>SubG's post in 801 raised an issue which, if he was genuine, CMAR must have already considered - namely, that a vote based on incomplete information is inherently likely to be inaccurate. Instead, CMAR's 802 makes it seem like some great new revelation. <br><br>Or, to use a simplified analogy:<br><br>X: \"I don't care about the serious health risks in smoking, I am going to smoke anyway!\"<br>Y: \"But smoking poses serious health risks!\"<br>X: \"Oh,wow, you're right! Smoking poses serious health risks. I don't think I will smoke.\"<br><br>In the first quote, X clearly shows that he is aware of the argument against his initial position (ie. \"to start smoking\"), and that he doesn't care about it. And yet, when the issue that he just rejected is pointed out to him, suddenly he changes tune completely. It doesn't make sense."}

Eventually, he soft claimed when it became apparent that nobody was buying his defenses and bgg began to look like a pretty likely lynching candidate.

Three of which occured during my first year on site. One of which was the first large theme game I played which included good players such as Porochaz, Crazy, BloodCovenant, Tajo and Kairyuu. I won that game, 4 months after I joined MS in 2009. As a result of my SK play and win rate, my custom title is 'Life of the Third Party'. The only game I lost was one of UK's Insane Asylum games in which I got lynched for lurking - I'd stayed in the game because UK can be a very scary lady, even though I should have replaced out. So yes, I think I am more familiar with SK's and with how SK's play than you are. That being said, I joined this game under the assumption that I was receiving a TOWN role PM.

Sorry that I've had so many real life commitments, I might as well be trying to play from jail or a coffin -_-<br><br>Scum (SK + maf) is in: Volkan, Haylen, Andrew, and Bgg<br><br>Reg, S_C (though I don't agree with him on near everything), and Max are the most protown in this game. I am confident that they are all town.<br><br>CKD is always hard to read and subgenius, though he comes across as intelligent and working towards the good of the town, could very well be very good scum.<br><br>Volkan doesn't have a single person as protown in his points. No one is below 50. He started D1 by being against S_C, yet it almost seems as if he was trying to stay out of the fight between S_C and Reg. He votes S_C for \"weak arguments\", yet she was firm in her argument that not RVSing was antitown and she didn't \"dance around the issue of why non-RVSers are antitown\", she flat out said why she thought it. But he finds S_C scummy for this and the miller claim question, but then he COMPLETELY drops the case based on 2 posts by noob Yura. Also, his vote was on Yura/Haylen all D2 from the beginning of D2. It seems almost as if he planned to bus her at night personally. He didn't even switch his vote over to Bgg when she was CLEARLY scummy. It's hard to explain why I think Volkan is scum. It's not gut, I see it in his posts, I just can't really put it to words -_-<br><br>Haylen has played quite well, yet her replacee was terrible newb scum. She tried to please the town in everything she did. Yet, Haylen's role can be tested on a town PR therefore we don't lynch her yet. One S_C claims her breadcrumbed role, we can tell Haylen to redirect her to someone based on what S_C is (investigative: someone scummy, protective: someone town, yada yada yada). Yes, I do realize she is likely investigative due to her backing up of Bgg. Also, tclar clearly got killed by the SK for a reason. While mafia can get away with targetting PR's, SK's literally almost have to kill people who suspect them or they risk being lynched the next day with no chance of winning. Mafia can risk losing one member. I think Haylen is the SK. If not, she is scum. I highly doubt that slot is a redirector.<br><br>Andrew. Andrew, andrew, andrew. You contribute to Magnetic's lynch with little reasoning (it was a reasonable lynch) and no contribution, you then say you find tclar to be \"off\". Then you vote S_C because he voted the scummiest people. He says A LOT that means absolutely nothing and has a poor poor case on S_C. He doesn't mention Volkan except to call him a bully (Volkan buddy). He literally does things with very little reasoning or explaining and constantly explains why he is not at the computer which really gets annoying <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">. The definition of lurk doesn't matter and what S_C said wasn't deflecting. If anything, you are active lurking (even though you're not active). You are saying things and getting away from replacement and prods, yet what you say has no meaning. Active lurking IS NOT reading and not posting. He has called my slot, Reg, Sub, CKD, S_C and BGG scum ALL ON D2. Everyone but Volkan and Yura. He flat out defends Yura. He argues with Volkan, yet doesn't find him suspicious. THIS IS A KICKER: He targets S_C for \"picking on\" Yura as an easy lynch target, THEN he fos's Sub for \"coaching Yura\". Nowhere does he FoS Yura though. He is clearly backtracking and backing Yura. His posts are choppy, hold no sense in them, and are scummy. CKD calls him out on finding CKD scummy, but not voting him. So he comes up with a lame excuse to no longer find S_C (who he practically found scummy the entire game) scummy, and vote CKD. This is a prime example of aiming to please town. THEN he continues to find S_C scummy. His unvote and vote on CKD were meant nothing as he didn't change his opinion on them, just his vote to please CKD. But my favorite is yet to come. He drops ALL OF HIS CASES and votes me. Never did he previously suspect my slot. Survival /=/ protown. Pushing legit cases on other people while defending points brought up against you = protown. You have failed to do this. Also, your claim is entirely BS and came so awkwardly it's scummy.<br><br>I have expressed previous suspicion of Bgg. Others have as well. No reason to explain this. I'm not discrediting whatever S_C says, but I still find Bgg incredibly scummy.

He has called my slot, Reg, Sub, CKD, S_C and BGG scum ALL ON D2. Everyone but Volkan and Yura. He flat out defends Yura. He argues with Volkan, yet doesn't find him suspicious. THIS IS A KICKER: He targets S_C for \"picking on\" Yura as an easy lynch target, THEN he fos's Sub for \"coaching Yura\". Nowhere does he FoS Yura though. He is clearly backtracking and backing Yura. His posts are choppy, hold no sense in them, and are scummy. CKD calls him out on finding CKD scummy, but not voting him. So he comes up with a lame excuse to no longer find S_C (who he practically found scummy the entire game) scummy, and vote CKD. This is a prime example of aiming to please town. THEN he continues to find S_C scummy. His unvote and vote on CKD were meant nothing as he didn't change his opinion on them, just his vote to please CKD. But my favorite is yet to come. He drops ALL OF HIS CASES and votes me. Never did he previously suspect my slot. Survival /=/ protown. Pushing legit cases on other people while defending points brought up against you = protown.

CKD, you are on my list after Andrew and Haylen. I'm not sure which of you four I would like to see go down next, but it is DEFINITELY that. There is NO reason to try and decide that, given a good LIST of reasons, it would be scummy to stop trying to hop off the Andrew lynch. Not that I WAS getting off andrew. I was getting off Haylen. But there's absolutely NO reason for you to be watching me that closely, is there? Except, y'know, had you a legitimate attempt to scumhunt me. CMAR needs to claim, as I THINK him and Andrew are both at L-1. Your votecount wasn't qutie right Regfan, but I think it's close enough.<br><br>Also, I'm afraid I'm with Bgg on this one. If someone does something scummy, it SHOULD make you think they're scum, at least more then you once did. Now, on the other hand, Bgg DID play a game that would have, had I not had my own information, made me think he was scum. So town players can play a scummy game. BUT, a scummy game makes you think they're scum. That's the point."}

There's two ways to read Yuras actions, you read it one way he read it the other it seems - You clash, yes but there's going to be no way for him to convince you to change your opinion to his.

The same argument can (and is) made against NLing in any MYLO situation. In fact, the stalemate it leads to is called \"Happily Ever After\". But, in practice, that stalemate (to the point of the game ending in a draw) has only ever happened once, according to the wiki. I think I've been in one game in the past where scum twice refused to kill (meaning two cycles of NL and NK went by), but they gave in in the end.<br><br>The second worst argument was the one raised earlier about LYLO being more dangerous than MYLO because of the risk of one errant townie throwing the game. To an extent, that's an increased risk, but I don't think it's an unreasonably high one.

There will be the scum, who will want to mislynch. They will always be able to switch back to no lynching if the lynch turns to a mafia member. Then, there are the people who won't give in, and only want to no lynch, unless they can lynch a confirmed scum. Finally, there are those who only want to lynch. Type 3:They will pretty much lynch anybody in their top 3 or 4 in favor of not no lynching, just to get the game moving.<br>Do you know how that game would work out? <br>Think about it. Eventually, the scum would build up a wagon on the scummiest non-scum. All of the no lynchers would vote no lynch. All of the lynchers would wagon onto the non-scum, and we would lose. <br><br>Next, the majority of the eight players is 5. Let's assume that there are 5 town, including myself. Since I'm town, and I'm not going to no lynch, you would need a scum on your boat to no lynch, or just wait 'til the deadline. If no lynching benefits town as you say, which it won't, the scum would  never get on it. It won't even work. <br><br>Then, you're assuming that Haylen is the only power role left. That's a pretty big assumption to make, you know. I don't think that anybody here, except maybe you, by assuming that, have claimed a VT position.<br><br>Now, as I've already explained, if we get to lylo, townHaylen's ability won't save us. Therefore, she has to use it after mylo. Out of eight players, I doubt that she can get it right. We will have wasted her ability. <br><br><br>You're saying that the only con to somebody dying is the loss of their role and opinion. That's not true. It... ummm... Hmmm.<br>I'm sure that there's something...<br><br><br><br>Finally, and probably most importantly, When you made your little chart, or whatever you want to call it, you didn't include yourself. To me, that is a major scumslip. I know, townVollkan didn't include himself because he A) didn't want to give any information away about his role, and B) was someone else. But, he is probably the most logical player, and losing him is definitely different than \"someone else\"."}

The reason that games get endgamed when there is a tie is that there is no way for town to win. However, in 3:3, we still can win - by Haylen redirecting at night.

It appears that we'll be receiving two new players, whom I would like to hear from before we finish the current day. <br><br>Only think I have to comment on is this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Vollkan wrote:</cite>I actually think it would clear things up considerably. Both of the current claims (CMAR and Haylen) are scummy, and they've both claimed roles which can plausibly be mafia roles. Nonetheless, their claims have made me more reluctant to lynch either of them. If we are lynching with the prospect of losing (because it is most likely MYLO), then it makes sense to lynch with the clearest picture of game balance possible.<br><br>If, for example, we MC and there are other PRs, that makes it far more likely that CMAR or Haylen is scum. The opposite isn't necessarily true, though, but it would still clarify the situation</div></blockquote><br>Why would you suspect Haylen and CMAR more if more claims appeared rather than the players that made the new claim, particularly since you've announced that a new claim would draw suspicion to the previous claimers rather than the new claimers? New claims wouldn't shed much more light on anything. We'd still have no way of verifying the claims, and we don't have a kill to spare to test any of them out as the game progresses further. I'm just not seeing much benefit to seeing new claims when it's so easy for scum to lie about it.<br><br>In fact, as I write this, I'm becoming more convinced that I'd prefer to NL with no MC. If we MC today, we give scum more information to use when they pick their NK. If we wait until tomorrow, we give them an entire night to discuss their claim strategy. Neither of these is good for town."}

Since they will only choose the worst possible kill, the only things that can come of it is nothing, bad, or worse.</div></blockquote><br><br>We've been over this already but let me reiterate:<br><br>If any of Haylen and CMAR are town, then it is by no means self-evident that you are the most logical NK choice. It would depend, at least, on how much of a risk mafia perceived the claimed powers versus how much of a threat they perceive you to be. Those are by no means the only relevant factors, but even on those two alone, you can see that it's basically impossible to determine what the likely course of action for mafia would be.<br><br>The important point is to remember the touchstone reason as to why NL is widely considered the best choice in MYLO: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">because a lynch that potentially risks the game should be based on as much certainty as possible</span>. Your \"choice\" argument is simply wrong - NL always gives mafia a \"and mafia will always exercise that choice in what they perceive to be their best interests. The point is, though, that town, being in an uninformed position, sees an improvement in their position from the increased certain knowledge<br><br>The fact that you are semi-confirmed makes the case for NL somewhat weaker, but (and this is a point on which people will differ) not sufficiently so to outweigh the certainty that would come if you were NKed. And, critically, we need to remember that, despite how much people keep asserting otherwise, there is a clear chance that the mafia might NK somebody else, in which case there is a clear and, I think indisputable, information gain.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>Assuming they are both town, the mafia would have to be crazy to night kill Haylen or CMAR.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't think that's true at all. Keeping the assumption that Haylen and CMAR are town the powers themselves would be a threat and, beyond that, mafia would be taking a gamble that people would see Haylen/CMAR as preferable lynches over anybody else. The debate this day alone has proven that such a bet is by no means a safe one for mafia.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SB wrote:</cite>vollkan's NL is bad. CKD said that vollkan is experienced. If true, this makes no sense unless you know about the setup. I would be more weary of a MYLO situation if there wasn't a third party, but we have no idea how many scum exist. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>Unless I am misunderstanding you here, you are saying that NL is bad, to the point of making my advocacy of it scummy, because there might only be two scum.<br><br>For starters, it's generally best to approach the game with a worst-case scenario presumption (ie. I would rather NL in pre-MYLO than lynch and lose in MYLO). In this particular case, though, we have good reason to think that three scum is more probable: first, the increase in mini size from 12 to 13 (2 scum and SK was difficult for mafia even under 12 player); and, second, the power roles we have seen so far as well as the claims suggest that this is a town-PR heavy game. In the circumstances, I think it would be simply stupid to not assume that there are three scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SB wrote:</cite>Also the pappums kill N1 was really random. Yeah its gigantic WIFOM but at this point we have little to go on with crappy lynches of crappy players. pappums was only suspicious of Haylen's slot. <br></div></blockquote><br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> I love the irony that you complain that the lynches were crappy, but then proceed to use NK analysis. <br><br>As I've already said, I think PR-hunting and WIFOM are the most viable explanations for the pappum kill. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SB wrote:</cite>Hate the CMAR JK claim. JK is always a scum fake claim I feel. I don't like the appeal to emotion either. SORRY HAD TO CLAIM BC IVE PLAYED SO BADLY SORRY SORRY SORRY <br></div></blockquote><br><br>He claimed in the context of thinking he was going to replace out, and wanted his breadcrumbs to be used. His tone makes sense in the context (though, he should have PMed the mod about the breadcrumbs, rather than claiming)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SB wrote:</cite>Alright after all that, WE ARE THREE DAYS TO DEADLINE. There are FOUR people not voting. This is unacceptable. vollkan is surely scum. The NL idea is awful, just puts us in the same spot tomorrow down a town member most likely. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>See above for a (very potted) summary of the argument for NLing. I've already learned that it depends on theory points on which people seem to vehemently disagree with me, but my reasoning is internally valid."}

His semi-confirmed status means his opinions are probably genuine, but that's really the end of it. Remember: NL always deprives the town of one townie's perspective, but it's still almost uniformly accepted as the best move in MYLO. I may be speaking only for myself here, but I can't conceive of any situation in which, despite his semi-confirmed status, I would trust bgg's judgment over my own.<br>2) I accept that this is a con; but I don't think night discussion is likely to be sufficiently influential on the day game to override the pros<br>3) As somebody who has designed a playstyle that pre-commits my vote, I take a particularly dim view of the value of reaction-gauging, let alone so late in a game.<br>4) Seriously? Given that a Happily Ever After cycle is exceptionally unlikely, the timeframe you are talking about is most likely only the length of a single night phase. I'd be amazed if anybody would lose touch with the game in that time.<br></div></blockquote><br>1) Completely understandable.<br>2) I think night discussion plays a bigger part then you're giving it credit for but aruguing over this is trival.<br>3) I can understand where you're coming from given your play-style but I'm a big fan of reaction testing and pressure voting in certain scenarios so we're going to have to agree to disagree with this con.<br>4) I've seen far too many games end in mafia wins purely due to the fact that town nl'ing too often when they shouldn't have.<br></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bgg wrote:</cite>And I don't think you understand what I'm saying about choice.

Factors that they will have to weigh up in making that decision include:<br>a) Threat posed by CMAR-town's power<br>b) Threat posed by Haylen-town's power<br>c) Threat posed by BGG-town<br>d) Who will be lynched if bgg-town dies?<br>e) Who will be lynched if CMAR-town dies?<br>f) Who will be lynched if Haylen-town dies?<br><br>It's overly-simplistic to think: \"BGG is semi-confirmed and not going to be lynched, so no matter what he will be NKed\" because it ignores all the threat judgments that scum would rationally be need to be making. It's already clear that it is by no means certain that Haylen and CMAR would be lynched, which poses a huge problem for scum if either Haylen or CMAR is town. <br><br>And so, mafia, despite being the informed faction, is left having to make difficult probability and risk judgments. For obvious reasons, I think it's a bad idea to debate what we think the best or even most likely strategy for mafia in that situation would be. Likewise, as SubG has already said, it's a bad idea to debate what would be \"worst\" for town. The point is that, by forcing mafia to make such a difficult judgment and force a flip, we get more information and a more accurate lynch tomorrow. In contrast, lynching today, with a high likelihood of it being MYLO, when nobody has any confident suspicions, is a recipe for disaster."}

And I mostly mod newbie games. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Subgenius wrote:</cite>If her role was valid, I would expect her to be legitimately surprised as well as irritated with the mod for assigning a role that could potentially put so much heat on her.</div></blockquote><br>I enjoy heat. Example: A couple of months ago, I replaced into a Jungle republic game; it was a 1 mafia, 3 town and 2 werewolves situation. Guess which slot I replaced into? It was fun. I like being attacked. I find it difficult to be interested in games where I'm not being attacked regardless of my role. I also drew the role I drew for this game; I don't give a crap what setup is in use. I'd have lol'd so hard if I'd got a role like cult. Why? I'm not exactly normal, mischief like this amuses me greatly. Also, if I was scum, I would have looked into what roles I could feasibly fakeclaim before doing it. <br><br>Loving how Bgg is ignoring the fact that a NORMAL game with SCUM MASONS has just finished.<br><br>I explained why and who Maxeous &gt;_&gt; The people voting me over this stupid thing without looking at what I'm frigging saying.<br><br>Gf is a normal role but last time I checked Town GF is not."}

The Reviewers are not idiots and would not have allowed multiple non-normal roles into a normal game - not only because, obviously, it makes the game non-normal but also because it would lead to precisely this sort of setup debating. Which means that the only logical conclusion is that Haylen is fakeclaiming. <br><br>Frankly, the rationale for NLing all but evaporates in these circumstances, since we have as clear and compelling evidence as is really possible that Haylen is scum (on top of the history of her slot). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>She explained why her role can be in the game, why should she be outraged and surprised if she moderated a game that had a couple of these 'unusual' or whatever roles?</div></blockquote><br><br>She cited the inclusion of GF, which is explicitly mentioned as a normal role to validate her claim of redirector, which is explicitly non-normal. Mentioning a mini-normal with a GF does nothing to make her claim more believable. If she can remember what the other roles are and show that they were outside the normal rules of the time, I would be willing to listen.<br><br>I think a townie's natural reaction to someone pointing out that their claim is contrary to the rules of the game would be to read the rules, recognize that they've been somewhat screwed over by the mod, and protest that regardless of the clearly stated rules, he or she did in fact receive that role. Instead, Haylen is trying to argue that her role is allowable without giving any compelling evidence. I see her putting more effort into showing that her claimed role is feasible than that she actually received that role. I think this is because she fake claimed and she has a bit of pride on the line if she's lynched on the basis of a foolish role choice.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed. If SB had merely told her that the role isn't normal, without quoting the rules, it might have made sense for her to go looking for other games. But faced with the rules which are clear on this point, it's unnatural for her immediate response to be to defend the claim when, if you genuinely held the role, you'd immediately see it as a problem with the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">moderator</span> rather than the claim.<br><br>Which brings me to another point: <span class=\"noboldsig\">@MOD: Does this game depart from the normal requirements as outlined on the wiki? I get that you might feel that it would be inappropriate to do so, but the fact is that, on joining a normal game, the players are meant to be able to assume that the game <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> normal; if we can't make that assumption here, you need to tell us asap.</span>"}

It's the day that I confess to my lies and explain how they came about. Bare in mind, my friends, this was not my fault. I lynched people, I kill people, I intentionally hurt people. But I have no regrets. Nothing is as it seems, I add a clause to my modded games saying 'Expect the Unexpected', this isn't for fun, it's a warning. I am not whom you think I am. They...changed me, something I never believed to be possible. It all happened on one fateful days, one event spiralled and caused an explosive chain of events. Until it happened, suddenly I wasn't in control. <br><br>I joined this website as a newbie on April Fools Day 2009, a young 18 year old looking for a bit of fun. I guess I got it in some ways, just it wasn't my idea of fun. As a newbie fresh out of my first newbie game, I decided to give a mini normal a go (to this day, it's the only game number I've remembered. Mini 800). It started out pretty cool. But then as players started to leave and be replaced, the corruption began. An old player by the name of 'Ether' extended an offer to me...to become a Mith Minion. Craving to be accepted as part of a group, I gave a joyful 'Yes' in reply. In reality, I should have listened to Incognito and camn when they tried to convince me everyone's corrupt. But I'm a pretty stubborn young lady, so Ether's words overruled theirs.<br><br>It was fun for a while, but then the weirdness started. On the missions we were granted by the High Overlord himself, things started to go wrong. Firstly it was silly little things like my uniform being different to the other girls, then it esculated. My equipment started going missing. One the mission to destroy Bluehost, my flame gun disappeared. The only people who had access to the changing rooms and lockers were my fellow minions. So I burrowed an ordinary gun. Our plan seemed to be working; every day we were invading another one of their offices or meeting rooms. The building looked very much like the one where Portal is set, the only difference was we didn't have weird guns like on there. Soon, we had covered a vast area and the only thing left to do was attack Bluehost itself. The plan was simple: split into groups and listen to all instructions given. But something clicked in my head at that very moment. We were killing REAL PEOPLE. People with friends and families and aspirations. People just like us. I tried to convince the others of my brainwave but was accused of being a traitor; knocked out and locked in a cupboard for the night. I was unamused and displayed total apathy when they released me the next day. Their intentions were obvious: help destroy Bluehost. Or die. So I carried on. I tried not to kill anybody but in the end this wasn't possible. I shot Bluehost's primary guard 3 times. 1.2.3. In the chest, stomach and head. Blood splattered against the wall behind him and flowed out of his body like a river of evil. That's what I was part of. Evil. <br><br>I thought after destroying Bluehost, they would leave me alone. This was sadly not the case. I was harrassed, my parents and neighbours were threatened. I was held there doing their bidding for a further two weeks. During those two weeks I concocted numerous escape plans, but each of them were pre-empted. One evening, however, when I was at dinner; I managed to slip away from everyone else. If I couldn't escape, I might as well explore and see what was really going on here. I hid being pillars and round corners to avoid being seen, this was what I was used to doing, I was an expert. My heart pounded whenever I heard a noise or saw anything out of the corner of my ear. Illusions. I went down and down, going deeper and deeper, the corridors got thinner and darker. Security got tighter. But that I couldn't understand, the basement had been abandoned for years! There was only one door open, and that appeared to be an accident. I slipped through it in case someone was in there ready to ambush me. I was shocked at what I saw.<br><br>Clones. There were clones of every player in the game. I knew them well enough to know very few of them were twins. But these looked exactly like their biological counterparts. Computers put them through complicated logic and agility tests. I was fascinated to note that they completely ignored me. It was obvious what was going on here. The High Overlord was planning to create super players! Those who could play mafia using a sense of logic that nobody else in the world possessed. Lost in my thoughts, I did not notice guards creeping up behind me. I was soon consumed by darkness. <br><br>Here I am now, I'm locked in a cell; facing my last day alive on Earth and in this game. I found a dusty old computer in a box of broken belongings and managed to fix it and write you this warning. Tell everyone you know. Trust no one. Right now, the most important thing you can do is stay alive. Don't believe a word people say. It started with my favourite weapon going missing and is resulting in my death. <br><br>There is now only one thing left for me to do. Death is inevitable. But I'm not going to let it be at the hands of those monsters. Slowly, I am going to pull out a gun I have hidden away. It contains one bullet. That one bullet will be my freedom. I hold it to my head and speak my last words. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote. Vote Haylen</span><br><br>Don't mourn for me, for I am free."}

It isn't finished yet, but I may as well post it so I can get some answers/put some opinions up to where I'm at in the game before the mod comes back.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1. What's your time-zone<br>2. Have you played with anyone in here before, if so what was their play-style like? (Remember you can't mention ongoing games)<br>3.

I've played with vollkan, Scott, and Haylen. Vollkan is very analytical and tends to post walls. He's kind of a love-him or hate-him type of guy. He's also very hard to incriminate because he can usually make something that is a scum-tell look illogical; that or he makes no mistakes, which is highly unlikely. I don't think I can read him well. Scott was, well, maybe his play was different since, if I recall, he was a PR, but he seemed like a gut type of person, almost the opposite of vollkan. Maybe he isn't, I don't know. He was lying low for most of that game. Haylen was v/L-A for the time I played with her. She temp-replaced in for a friend, posted a couple of times(everyone was mad at her for replacing in and not posting so she got attacked), mainly angry posts, so I'm assuming that isn't her actual playstyle. <br>3. Town.<br>4. My activity goes up and down but fairly often.<br>5. Leading.<br><br>vollkan, are there walls in all the games you're in? I'm not even to page 3 and I've seen consistent wall o' text'ing.<br><br>So, let's get this straight for Day 1. The game moves out of RVS and Magnetic claims with 1 vote on him. Yeah, this was trolling and, since he's town, mafia and town alike would've lynched him so there isn't a lot of info there. What is to note is the unvoting being done. Tcl obviously had good reason considering his role. Ckd's unvote and vote on Maxous seems like an attempt to garner townie brownies and, at the same time, buddy with bgg who asked for unvotes in order to extend the day and get more info. The whole thing against bgg seems a little over the top, however he doesn't help at all by avoiding questions that would take typing out two names to answer. SC's hammer on Magnetic in reply to bgg was unneeded, as if he was taking the game and making it personal. My predecessor's play really sucks. Yura's most likely obv VI-scum. That said, the game picks up on D2. CKD felt really frantic on 334. Is he always like this? I've seen him on-site a lot and he joined in '07 so this type of reaction really feels off when I read through it.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ckd wrote:</cite>please someone else see this!!!!!!!!!!!</div></blockquote><br>It looks like something Shotty would post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>I voted Magnetic for a reaction at first, unvoted because I was unsure whether to read him as caught mafia or dumb town and didn't vote again because I didn't want to risk shortening the day as much as it ended up.</div></blockquote><br>What? I looked back and you unvoted Magnetic when he had 2 votes on him. Your vote and Andrew's RVS vote. How do 2 votes warrant a reason to think you will help prolong the day by unvoting<br><br>Ok, I haven't gotten to the N2 kill in the game yet but from where I'm at, SC is siding and defending bgg like a boss. In the first post, SC flipped cop. I'm assuming this would mean bgg is possibly confirmed since there's a very likely possibility SC got an innocent on him. SC's 423/430 only re-confirms this in my eyes.<br><br>Vollkan, in your 460, you had given no points to Andrew94 as of posting. What about his play did you find that didn't warrant points? I remember you specifically asking him to post reads or replace out. He posted a few lines on the game and people in the game but did not list anyone as scum or town in doing so. After you asked him to try again, his next post was his attempt to disprove he was not active lurking. He fos'd bgg in the post but did not do anything else beyond that. Why did you not push on this or follow through with it?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite>well i don't mean to bandwagon but i think sub is making sense bgg is getting into useless arguements (tho i don't really think i have any say in this, since everyone also thinks i'm useless and dumb) and i wanna see how he wud react if he face some heat</div></blockquote><br>This is just mirroring what Subgenius just said.(Useless arguements and heat were actually part of what subgenius said) This looks like a very opportunistic bandwagon attempt in an attempt to buddy up to subgenius while at the same time have a place to park her vote.(Yura votes in the post after this post) There was nothing added to the discussion nor does Yura take a solid stance on who she thinks is scum but rather just wants to see \"how he wud react if he face some heat\". Why is this slot still alive?<br><br>I'm surprised noone has asked SC why he is just sitting around and watching the day pass by. Subg, ckd popping in right after his name is mentioned should not entail a \"strong fos\". There is no evidence he was lurking and by at least posting right after his name is mentioned, he is making a promise to attempt to scumhunt and/or participate later on. There is nothing to suggest he was pressured because his name was mentioned. I've done the same type of thing before on a player but it's null tell at best.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite>I don't really have any other big sus for mafia but I do think he can be mafia and just planning when the night comes or he actually IS a sk planning his own kills.

On another note, vig makes no sense. Anyways, again, why is this slot still alive?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>or a townsperson(vig).</div></blockquote><br>Why'd you mention this in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2897237#p2897237\" class=\"postlink\">504</a>?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CKD wrote:</cite>EDIT, he then votes 3 people very quickly...1st vote I get...the two after looks bad.</div></blockquote><br>The two after he mentions here are truant and then Yura. Truant has been someone Max has been display suspicion of whilst Yura is one of CKD's top(tied with bgg) scum leads which tells me one of two things: CKD doesn't like the reaosns Max has presented for voting Yura or CKD needs a suspect so he quotes this one line from Max, misconstrues it to his liking, and uses it as a scum-tell. An important thing to note is that CKD is voting for Regfan and Max, both of who have looked into his case in the past. If anyone has played with him before, meta would be appreciated because I feel it may be helpful to have around for CKD reads.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Yura wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">the bgg vote wasnt much of a strong scum sus like which i kinda have on ckd</span> it was more of to see how he would react and base on it.... and for now my sus are not that big yet for i have no big evidence yet...:/</div></blockquote><br>ITT: Yura outs herself by saying she suspects ckd more but voted bgg but then counteracting it and offering a possible neutral stance on ckd by stating she has no big evidence.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>Just finished briefly reading Andrews scum games, his playstyle in them is almost identical to that of this game.

I think the fact that Haylen's one shot claim was bogus actually casts more doubt on CMAR's claim. It seems quite possible that CMAR was following Haylen's lead after seeing the effectiveness of her one-shot claim. Also, as SB mentioned, if CMAR is a JK, that would mean the town was given two protective roles, which seems somewhat excessive.<br><br>Now, Max, why was it that you were so uninterested in noting how Haylen's claim clearly contradicted the rules of normal setups?

He said he has played with Vollkan, Haylen, and SB, which leads me to believe he is more than experienced enough to realize why you were so insistent that he had to claim immediately and quickly scan the ISO's of Truant and CMAR to see if either had already claimed. Also, lets not forget that SB was extremely vocal about his suspicions of CMAR's claim, which provides an alternative motive for the NK. I think that if mafia thought CMAR was for real, they would have NK'd him rather than you or anyone else. The risk of him successfully protecting someone, thus confirming both himself and his target was too great. Admittedly, this is WIFOM, but that's my take on it."}

This claim strikes me as fairly credible. First, it meshes with my previous suspicions of CMAR/Hindu. Second, I had noticed that Maxous hadn't posted for two days, and his claim explains that. Third, the fact that he clears Regfan makes his claim extremely useful tomorrow. If Hindu flips scum, we could start tomorrow with 2 confirmed innocents, which kicks ass. <br><br>I'm willing to accept his explanation for doubting the case against Haylen, since he has made several references to playing mafia at other sites. In my limited experience, I've found that MS puts a lot of thought into their rules and how to enforce them, so I was quite willing to lynch Haylen for making a claim that contradicted the rules, but I can understand how I would be less eager if the majority of my mafia experience was at a site that wasn't quite as structured and moderated. I'll admit that it's strange to cite experiences from other sites to explain why a claim at this site is within the rules, but I can let it go.<br><br>P.S. I had the following post sitting on my clipboard from last night, and didn't get around to posting it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite>I'm now basically left without a clear suspect. CMAR obviously has the highest score, but his claim obviously complicates things. I agree with SubG that there is a decent chance that CMAR was sheeping Haylen's claim. <br></div></blockquote><br>This statement is unusually equivocal for you, Vollkan. You want to say he's scummy, but then you mention his claim affects your opinion, then you say that there's a good chance that he's lying about it anyway. You don't want to NL, but who are you thinking you want to lynch?<br><br>@Regfan<br>Condensing the VC's like that makes for some interesting reading. In particular, I think 2.20 and 2.21 are interesting, in which Max, Vollkan, and I are voting for CMAR. I'm not sure what to make of it, but it looks like an interesting focal point to investigate. <br><br>As I'm rereading, I'm becoming more and more convinced of CMAR's/Hindu's guilt. In particular, his breadcrumbing and claim seem extremely, extremely suspicious to me.<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, he started breadcrumbing in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2943367#p2943367\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 27</a>, which was very near the end of day 2, shortly after Haylen's claim, and shortly after he garnered three votes. At the end of this very same post, he writes:<br><blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite>I'll be online til around 10 EST if I need claim.</div></blockquote><br>To me, this indicates a certain eagerness to claim. He's almost asking someone to request his claim in the same post that he starts breadcrumbing. This seems odd to me.<br><br>Then, the fact that he claimed yesterday with one vote. If he was town, he wouldn't be worried about his replacement missing his breadcrumbs, his replacement would be able to refer to his pm and claim when it made sense. It seems more likely to me that he didn't want his breadcrumb defense going to waste, so he claimed when he decided he had to be replaced."}

Your claim worked better because it was new and less tarnished. Plus, you would make an extremely unlikely jail keeping target. He would have had to explain why he used his one shot ability in an offensive bid to MAYBE catch scum rather than n defensive move to protect a confirmed innocent. Hindu jailkeeping you would have been a very tough sell. In addition, even if he successfully bussed you, he would have had lower chances to survive the next day, given his slot's spotty history.

Read through the ISO selectively choosing lines that they can pick out and present it in a scummy way. I could look through the ISO of any of the four of us here and do the exact same thing.<br><br>@Vollkan: I have never been in a game where the mafia could use an ability and night kill in the same night period. I don't see any reason why it would be the case here so okay yes, I made an assumption on that.<br><blockquote><div><cite>vollkan wrote:</cite>Have you actually seen mafia hint at the setup in terms of the number of scum? </div></blockquote><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2883896#p2883896\" class=\"postlink\">Might be a relevant example.</a> Seeing as how I should of read more into that quote instead :/<br><br>@Regfan: The point of tracking Hinduragi was not to catch him killing someone. I beleived his jailkeeper claim. Scott told him to use his ability before the N3 period. I wanted to see if and who he would visit during the night and then ask him about his ability on Day 4. I wanted to see if he would lie about who he targeted with his JK role.<br>As for N1 I disagree that using my gunsmith ability would be optimal. I only had one chance to use it and I decided that there was too many people alive in the game and I would probably be better off saving it for later. My gunsmith ability was my most important. As it turns out I was vindicated with that decision because my target was going to be Pappums Rat.<br><br>As for Yura I only begain suspecting her <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2897237#p2897237\" class=\"postlink\">in the middle of Day 2</a>.<br><br>While I am on Yura I want to bring something to your attention. When Yura flaked and was getting a replacement I suggested we should <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2920041#p2920041\" class=\"postlink\">lynch Yura</a> before the replacement came in. I thought it to be unfair of somebody replacing into such a undefendable slot facing an immenent lynch. (I did'nt want to waste somebody's time).<br>Now keep in my mind this is meant to be my mafia partner here. Realisitically there is no scum benefit for calling for that. That was a chance for the slot to redeem it'self.<br>And now <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2991875#p2991875\" class=\"postlink\">this incident</a> in which people started becoming convinced I was mafia. So I have been suspecting Yura/Haylen for about 2 day periods, trying to get them lynched(along with CMAR) and when they are about to get lynched I state how lynching due to set-up speculation is not a good idea. So when the momentum swung towards Haylen I stuck to my guns against the line of fire. But if I was mafia bussing my partner the entire time it would be strange not to go along with the lynch and instead of stick my head out like I did, inviting the suspicion on me.

I thought people were settling on his lynch without much discussion, and I found it concerning considering we were most likely in MYLO. If most of the people on that wagon had given compelling evidence for their voting intentions, I wouldn't have been as concerned. I just thought the lynch was proceeding suspiciously easily. Proclaiming him almost certainly town at the end of D3 really was a bluff in the hopes of getting Mafia to kill him during the night. It didn't work for obvious reasons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>If you guys are more willing to beleive that ....argued against the set-up speculation reasoning during Haylen's lynch inviting the suspicion on me,</div></blockquote><br>I love how defending a confirmed Maf is scummy when I was hesitant to lynch CMAR, but it was townie when you defended Haylen. We both did essentially the same thing, and you're being pretty hypocritical by trying to say that it's only scummy in my case. If Regfan and Vollkan care to look into both events and decide which seemed more genuine, I'd welcome it. I still don't know why you didn't find it interesting that Haylen's role was against the stated rules.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>cleared Regfan as a gambit on Day 3</div></blockquote><br>Again, this served to bolster your credibility, and you only need to lynch one town player, not three. As long as you didn't confirm all of us, you're in good shape.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>...cleared Vollkan as a gambit</div></blockquote><br>To be honest, I'm not sure you thought that part through. I noticed when Regfan suggested the roleblocking plan that you didn't seem especially enthusiastic about it. In hindsight, it might have been because you didn't realize that role blocker would be useful for further narrowing down the suspects. I also recall you questioning a few times today whether or not role blocking blocked night kills, further showing that maybe you hadn't taken that plan into account when you picked roleblocker as your final ability.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>suggested there was only 2 mafia as a deliberate misleading town tell</div></blockquote><br>Again, you were the only player that claimed to think this was likely. Everyone else correctly assumed there were three. You're a smart guy, and so are Vollkan and Regfan. They should ask themselves how much in question the setup actually was. To me, it really wasn't, and we already have two examples of other scum players misleading town in this way. I think it's compelling.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Max wrote:</cite>gloated and suggested myself as bussing Hinduragi</div></blockquote><br>Again, you seem to be missing the point about this piece of evidence. It doesn't matter why you mentioned the possibility of you busing, the fact is that it never crossed the mind of any other player, because it seemed so absurdly unlikely that you would have a connection to Hindu. It's odd that you would have thought of it unless it was actually the case.<br><br><br><br>I suppose I'll go ahead and throw my vote in as well.

In particular, the fact that he did not list the possibility of tracking Hindu to a kill shows an inconsistency in his story. There are quotes from before N3 that show him toying with the possibility of there only being two mafia. If he truly thought a two mafia team was a possibility, he would have also considered the possibility that Hindu would execute the kill, but he didn't mention that at all when he explained his choice to track Hindu. The fact that his explanations for his actions don't fully take into account the opinions he claimed to hold at the time he made his decision shows that he is lying. That is not WIFOM.<br><br>Secondly, I don't think Hindu's response to Max's claim has much WIFOM in it. Technically, it is possible that Maxous is town and Hindu went down easy in a conscious effort to look like a bus, but even when I try to look at it completely objectively (after all I'm quite biased when I consider this scenario), it just strikes me as exceedingly unlikely that a scum player would execute that kind of tactic on the fly without having any opportunity to discuss it with a scum partner. He would be handing a great deal of credibility to Max in the hopes that his partner would pick up on it the next day and be able to make a strong case without ever having the chance to confer with him. It's possible, but it seems overly complex and unlikely. The Max/Hindu bus plan is also complex, but they had an entire night period to plan it, so it seems far more plausible. Admittedly, there is some WIFOM, but one option seems so implausible that I really can't imagine anyone actually executing it. It's possible that I only hold this opinion because I'm not looking at it impartially, but I don't think so."}

The point was that a townie in her situation would have read the rules and realized that her role was explicitly forbidden and set about trying to convince town that regardless of the stated rules, the mod or game reviewers must have made a mistake. Instead, Haylen chose to present a lame series of arguments to show that her role was actually allowed.

In hindsight, yes she was fake-claiming but why would you expect outrage and frustration from the player instead of simply saying 'you do realise one or two non-normal roles are allowed'. Of course you would explain how your role is allowed based on your understanding of the rules. Particulary if you have moderated a game before.<br>I thought it was weird at the time and yeah in hindsight he really looked for any excuse he could to jump on that Haylen bandwagon as soon as trouble started."}

I can understand that you didn't forsee a RB vs RB situation occuring due to the unlikelyhood that they would have targetted each other, especially considering the JOAT was a one-shot RB though I really do disagree with the kill still going through.

If we had won, it would have represented a massive comeback. Anyhow, I don't think there was much chance of getting a lynch through on Vollkan on D5, even if the possibility was suggested, partly because he played very well for the first four days and partly because of the inherent improbability of him being a role blocker and the unclear mechanics that double role blocking involves. I think it would have been extremely difficult to implicate Vollkan based the possibility that he MIGHT be a roleblocker, when the simpler and likelier explanation by far was that I was scum.
