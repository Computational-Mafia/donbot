He made it very clear that his 'no-lynch' vote was just an RVS joke. He could obviously be lying about that since he only made it jokey after he got town's reactions to it, but I don't want to put someone in my scum category for something so flimsy. <br><br>Then, TB came back and said 'well yeah man we were obviously out of RVS when you voted no-lynch. Therefore I find you scummy.' <br><br>1-shot makes it clear that his vote was an RVS vote.<br>TB claims, after the fact, that we were out of RVS. <br><br>Without trying to get at the truth of whether or not we were out of RVS, it's obvious that the two of them are coming to different conclusions because they are relying on different assumptions. It's like one person said 'I think that coat is red' and another says 'nah, I think it's orange, I hate orange' and then the first guy says 'I'm going to buy you that red coat, red is your favorite color.' <br><br>Buying the red coat was based off of an assumption that the second guy would also think it looked red. Obviously this is folly. <br><br>In terms of our game, scum reading somebody for making an RVS joke by way of retroactively saying 'nah man, we were out of RVS, you're scum' is also folly. <br><br>I disagree because if we have two options 'let it flow' and 'declare when we're out of RVS' let it flow is way better - it allows the town to collectively decide when we're out of RVS rather than giving power to the guy who declares we're out of RVS (TB). <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>FTR - I don't at all think we were out of RVS when the no-lynch was declared. TB's opinion that we were out of RVS based on his benchmark (first vote count) is just patently false IMO.

He made it very clear that his 'no-lynch' vote was just an RVS joke. He could obviously be lying about that since he only made it jokey after he got town's reactions to it, but I don't want to put someone in my scum category for something so flimsy. <br><br>Then, TB came back and said 'well yeah man we were obviously out of RVS when you voted no-lynch. Therefore I find you scummy.' <br><br>1-shot makes it clear that his vote was an RVS vote.<br>TB claims, after the fact, that we were out of RVS. <br><br>Without trying to get at the truth of whether or not we were out of RVS, it's obvious that the two of them are coming to different conclusions because they are relying on different assumptions. It's like one person said 'I think that coat is red' and another says 'nah, I think it's orange, I hate orange' and then the first guy says 'I'm going to buy you that red coat, red is your favorite color.' <br><br>Buying the red coat was based off of an assumption that the second guy would also think it looked red. Obviously this is folly. <br><br>In terms of our game, scum reading somebody for making an RVS joke by way of retroactively saying 'nah man, we were out of RVS, you're scum' is also folly. <br><br>I disagree because if we have two options 'let it flow' and 'declare when we're out of RVS' let it flow is way better - it allows the town to collectively decide when we're out of RVS rather than giving power to the guy who declares we're out of RVS (TB). <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>FTR - I don't at all think we were out of RVS when the no-lynch was declared. TB's opinion that we were out of RVS based on his benchmark (first vote count) is just patently false IMO. I put that down here because I don't think I need to be right about this for the above argument to hold water.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>Sure we clearly weren't out of RVS at the time, but that's not what I dislike about one shot's post.

It is neutral as town and beneficial as scum/neutral to not read your role pm. Every roles goal, bar a couple exceptions, is to get town read. If you read your role and it's red you can act townie and neutral to you partners all you want, but psychologically it will affect your gameplay unless you're a very exceptional player. Neutrals have varying wincons so I'm not sure what neutrals are common here besides sk, but I'd imagine most of them are in similar boats to mafia. Bye not reading your role for the early game, something like half of day 1, you can play like you would a townie with no bias inflicted by knowing you aren't actually townie, and late game it can be the difference between winning and losing. But then again gameplay, players here are much more skilled, so of course you're right and I'm just the vi.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: josh</span><br><br>I'll play out my other games but I think I'm done with this site.

I'm inclined to look at the latter part of Josh's wagon to try and identify opportunistic scum smelling blood in the water and going for the kill. Looking at the votes, that suggests to me {Drealmerz, ThinkBig, and LUV}, the 4th, 5th, and 6th votes on him, respectively. The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br><br>That leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. It's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided. Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing. Attack on Flubber in 210 fits with this theory, as it serves to suppress or discredit new perspectives before they appear.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote ThinkBig</span>"}

I'm inclined to look at the latter part of Josh's wagon to try and identify opportunistic scum smelling blood in the water and going for the kill. Looking at the votes, that suggests to me {Drealmerz, ThinkBig, and LUV}, the 4th, 5th, and 6th votes on him, respectively. The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br><br>That leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. It's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided. Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing. Attack on Flubber in 210 fits with this theory, as it serves to suppress or discredit new perspectives before they appear.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote ThinkBig</span></div></blockquote><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote ThinkBig</span><br><br>Not sure why this wasn't counted"}

I'm inclined to look at the latter part of Josh's wagon to try and identify opportunistic scum smelling blood in the water and going for the kill. Looking at the votes, that suggests to me {Drealmerz, ThinkBig, and LUV}, the 4th, 5th, and 6th votes on him, respectively. The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br><br>That leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. I<span class=\"noboldsig\">t's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided.</span> Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing.

If things are outdated, deal with it. This is more for me than it is for you guys. I'll have some comments and questions on just about every page. My goal is to get through at least 15 pages tonight. Anything else, I should have done tomorrow night.<br><br>Page 1:<br>I don't like secret agent opening the game with a boring ego post. Why not vote or make a lame joke or something? I'm sure after 27 pages this won't be significant in any way, but I'd have poked and prodded there if I'd played this game from the beginning. He made a real RVS vote in post 18 anyway.<br><br>Pine's RVS vote on dreal (flipped scum) feels like he's going out of his way to show that his vote is a joke. Secret agent's vote was the same way and then he avoided voting dreal. Yes, this is weak page 1 crap, but I could see either of those as scumbuddy interactions.<br><br>Page 2:<br>Pine calling dreal guaranteed scum is more of what I saw on page 1.<br><br>Can't wait to see where 1 shot's no lynch vote went. His reaction to thinkbig's vote feels town though so consider that my first legit read.<br><br>Page 3:<br>Lil's point about 1 shot trying to prevent discussion is BS. No one actually thinks as scum that they can stop people from talking. That's just not how scum thinks.<br><br>Nn seems to be making real attempts to scumhunt and is openly talking about his scum meta. Town points<br><br>Wow. Pine got pretty serious in the whole no lynch thing. Lol.<br><br>Page 4:<br>I don't like Pine's OMGUS on josh or his attempt to pin it on nn. I guess this is turning into a real scum read.<br><br>Not sure how josh is the only one standing out to secret agent when, as he acknowledges, quite a few people have participated at this point.<br><br>Page 5:<br>This page is all drama around josh and I didn't get anything out of it from living players so on to the next page.<br><br>Page 6/7:<br>Garmr looks town. I like that he recognizes his differences with 1 shot as playstyle and his josh view feels genuine. Also, changing his mind on something while in the shower shows a genuine thought process because it shows that he's actively thinking about the game and his reads even while he's away from it. I've done this at work before.<br><br>At this point, josh is obvtown. It should be clear that he thought he was dead when he claimed. Lil not unvoting doesn't look so good. I realize thinkbig (dead town) didn't unvote either, but he's clearly caught in his tunnel.<br><br>On a related note, I like Pine's unvote of josh. Maybe I was wrong about him.<br><br>Page 8:<br>Yeah, Pine's dreal vote here reads as legit rather than bussing.<br><br>I don't like lil unvoting because of replacement right after a few others unvote. I doubt he's townreading josh for replacing out so it feels more like unvoting because the opportunity to lynch josh is gone.<br><br>And I'm through Day 1. Quick break then I'll read more"}

Reason being, if he's asking me a question in order to discern my motivations, he removes the ability of his question to mean anything by removing you from L-1 himself.

I'd rather do it in LyLo and have the rest of the game speak for itself in regards to how we decide who is real claiming and fake claiming."}

This game is an open. I'm an idiot. There's no SK. I've talked way too much about it to go delete everything and still have any thoughts in this post and I'm not reading all of that again. Um.

If the vig shoots tonight, one of the lynch/vig kill has to be on scum otherwise we are 2:2. Based on the win conditions the mod posted, this wouldn't end the game if the vig is still alive, but we'd have to no lynch and have the vig hit scum (or not shoot and let the role cop figure it out) in order to win. Basically, it gets ugly with a cycle of 3 more town deaths. <br><br>Page 29:<br>I like boring's plan for the vig and rolecop to simply claim power role for a massclaim.

All i can offer is the fact that if you look at my past games i am scummy in all my games and come off as low hanging fruit. I cant seem to ever avoid being anything but scummy no matter my alignment. If you provide a question for me or point to a scummy post, i can answer it but i cant really defend myself against \"he seems scummy\" without you pointing to something. Also, i am with NN, once he claimed VT, that only leaves one unclaimed player and two/three PRs so some people have to be claiming VT when they are scum/pr (the scum claiming town are understandable since they wouldnt claim scum)."}

It's just that I know my alignment, LUV is looking to be a PR, and I could be wrong, but kmd seems really town to me. That leaves just you, nn30, Jin, and garmr. The \"TReds\". Town's huge disorganization points to you fellas being scum too, even without the POE. So while I understand your statement, Pine, you can hopefully understand my frustration. At least one, if not both scum is being townread, and I can't figure out who. To top it off, one of our potential conf. town have lied. It's really sucky because the whole point was to establish leaders or at trustworthy town as a solid ground that we could use to solve the game.

He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing.

Obviously, you pinged me right away, but that feeling is subsiding somewhat. <br><br>He's not quite as strong a read as Jin, but here are a few little things adding together for me. In no particular order:<br>1. He hammered Flubber after Pine, his supposed scum read, put him at L-1. <br>2. He has focused on Pine almost to the exclusion of other players. It's so convenient, too. It allows him the illusion of scum hunting while actually contributing nothing to town.<br>3. He is very twitchy about even the slightest poking and prodding. As if investigation isn't part of the scum hunting process. Though, this could be shoved into NAI if it was the only thing. Some people just get big heads about being town read early, and then won't entertain the idea that eventually, their time will come *throws a significant glance at no one in particular*.<br>4.

I just wanted to see if I could be convinced otherwise first. That's why one of my first actions was to see how the two of them feel about each other. Obviously, you pinged me right away, but that feeling is subsiding somewhat. <br><br>He's not quite as strong a read as Jin, but here are a few little things adding together for me. In no particular order:<br>1. He hammered Flubber after Pine, his supposed scum read, put him at L-1. <br>2. He has focused on Pine almost to the exclusion of other players. It's so convenient, too. It allows him the illusion of scum hunting while actually contributing nothing to town.<br>3. He is very twitchy about even the slightest poking and prodding. As if investigation isn't part of the scum hunting process. Though, this could be shoved into NAI if it was the only thing. Some people just get big heads about being town read early, and then won't entertain the idea that eventually, their time will come *throws a significant glance at no one in particular*.<br>4.

That leave NN, Boring, and LUV. LUV claims PR when no one else has but it doesnt auto-clear him. I see a Boring/NN scum team or an LUV/NN scumteam. I agree that, as a VT, you wouldnt be losing a PR with my lynch but you would be losing a pro-town number in the grand scheme. I agree that i have been slacking this game but i lose steam when i am a VT and dont have night actions to accomplish. I hope to learn to not be so upset when i get a vanilla role, it usually instantly makes me less interested in the game. If you save me today i promise 100% game solving and attention to this game when i wake up tomorrow. I think Boring is what i needed to get involved in this game, she took charge and ran the game as a leader, i hope to play future games with her. She has got me interested in a game that i would normally be slacking in, thank you Boring.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: NN</span>"}
