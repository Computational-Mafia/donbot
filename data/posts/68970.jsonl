It is neutral as town and beneficial as scum/neutral to not read your role pm. Every roles goal, bar a couple exceptions, is to get town read. If you read your role and it's red you can act townie and neutral to you partners all you want, but psychologically it will affect your gameplay unless you're a very exceptional player. Neutrals have varying wincons so I'm not sure what neutrals are common here besides sk, but I'd imagine most of them are in similar boats to mafia. Bye not reading your role for the early game, something like half of day 1, you can play like you would a townie with no bias inflicted by knowing you aren't actually townie, and late game it can be the difference between winning and losing. But then again gameplay, players here are much more skilled, so of course you're right and I'm just the vi.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: josh</span><br>\n<br>\nI'll play out my other games but I think I'm done with this site.

I'm inclined to look at the latter part of Josh's wagon to try and identify opportunistic scum smelling blood in the water and going for the kill. Looking at the votes, that suggests to me {Drealmerz, ThinkBig, and LUV}, the 4th, 5th, and 6th votes on him, respectively. The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. It's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided. Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing.

I'm inclined to look at the latter part of Josh's wagon to try and identify opportunistic scum smelling blood in the water and going for the kill. Looking at the votes, that suggests to me {Drealmerz, ThinkBig, and LUV}, the 4th, 5th, and 6th votes on him, respectively. The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. It's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided. Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing.

I'm inclined to look at the latter part of Josh's wagon to try and identify opportunistic scum smelling blood in the water and going for the kill. Looking at the votes, that suggests to me {Drealmerz, ThinkBig, and LUV}, the 4th, 5th, and 6th votes on him, respectively. The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. I<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">t's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided.</div> Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing. Attack on Flubber in 210 fits with this theory, as it serves to suppress or discredit new perspectives before they appear.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote ThinkBig</div></div></blockquote>\nHis reasoning for day 2 are basically redundant scumtells thanking the vig is common practice on other sites and the votes tell is pretty shit because not only have I seen town only lynches on town before but Scum have grown aware of this because it's common knowledge it's become worthless. None of these tells actually put into details TB Cases or motivations.<br>\n<br>\nThe bolded shows that your case makes TB out to be the villain and josh a poor helpless victim.

I'll have some comments and questions on just about every page. My goal is to get through at least 15 pages tonight. Anything else, I should have done tomorrow night.<br>\n<br>\nPage 1:<br>\nI don't like secret agent opening the game with a boring ego post. Why not vote or make a lame joke or something? I'm sure after 27 pages this won't be significant in any way, but I'd have poked and prodded there if I'd played this game from the beginning. He made a real RVS vote in post 18 anyway.<br>\n<br>\nPine's RVS vote on dreal (flipped scum) feels like he's going out of his way to show that his vote is a joke. Secret agent's vote was the same way and then he avoided voting dreal. Yes, this is weak page 1 crap, but I could see either of those as scumbuddy interactions.<br>\n<br>\nPage 2:<br>\nPine calling dreal guaranteed scum is more of what I saw on page 1.<br>\n<br>\nCan't wait to see where 1 shot's no lynch vote went. His reaction to thinkbig's vote feels town though so consider that my first legit read.<br>\n<br>\nPage 3:<br>\nLil's point about 1 shot trying to prevent discussion is BS. No one actually thinks as scum that they can stop people from talking. That's just not how scum thinks.<br>\n<br>\nNn seems to be making real attempts to scumhunt and is openly talking about his scum meta. Town points<br>\n<br>\nWow. Pine got pretty serious in the whole no lynch thing. Lol.<br>\n<br>\nPage 4:<br>\nI don't like Pine's OMGUS on josh or his attempt to pin it on nn. I guess this is turning into a real scum read.<br>\n<br>\nNot sure how josh is the only one standing out to secret agent when, as he acknowledges, quite a few people have participated at this point.<br>\n<br>\nPage 5:<br>\nThis page is all drama around josh and I didn't get anything out of it from living players so on to the next page.<br>\n<br>\nPage 6/7:<br>\nGarmr looks town. I like that he recognizes his differences with 1 shot as playstyle and his josh view feels genuine. Also, changing his mind on something while in the shower shows a genuine thought process because it shows that he's actively thinking about the game and his reads even while he's away from it. I've done this at work before.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, josh is obvtown. It should be clear that he thought he was dead when he claimed. Lil not unvoting doesn't look so good. I realize thinkbig (dead town) didn't unvote either, but he's clearly caught in his tunnel.<br>\n<br>\nOn a related note, I like Pine's unvote of josh. Maybe I was wrong about him.<br>\n<br>\nPage 8:<br>\nYeah, Pine's dreal vote here reads as legit rather than bussing.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like lil unvoting because of replacement right after a few others unvote. I doubt he's townreading josh for replacing out so it feels more like unvoting because the opportunity to lynch josh is gone.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I'm through Day 1.

Scum would have to out themselves to force them to be more specific, which is also beneficial.  <br>\n<br>\nAs a concession to professor nn30's book report assignment, I'll give you PP/kmd as my most confident town lean.

Garmr makes it sound like it's easy to see scum/scum interaction, but I'm agreeing with 1 shot here.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like to know why nn sheeped pine's vote on thinkbig, but it's probably outdated enough that he doesn't remember. nn, do you?<br>\n<br>\nGood point from nn about secret agent. Dreal's \"prepare to scum read me\" post doesn't look like something he'd say to a scumbuddy.<br>\n<br>\nInteresting. Thinkbig was shaping up to be the lynch, replaced out, and Secret agent thinks it will help everyone see him differently. To me, that sounds like someone who doesn't want thinkbig lynched. But thinkbig was town so maybe it doesn't mean anything. Just sounded weird.<br>\n<br>\nPage 14:<br>\nJust more of the dreal/pine interactions discussion. I still don't agree with garmr. I'm not getting a read on garmr based on it though. Pine is likely town.<br>\n<br>\nPage 15:<br>\nYa know, for all this talk about dreal, nobody has claimed the kill on him. Did that ever happen later? I'm not saying anyone needs to, and I'd rather they didn't, but if it's already happened, that makes things a little easier if I know that.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr's thing about having a gut read on dreal that he didn't tell us about doesn't sound like something scum would say. It's more likely to be genuine than a cheap attempt at town cred for getting a read right when there's no evidence of it in thread.<br>\n<br>\nJust realized it's probably not clear where my guesses for scum are.

I'll expand on it later if I remember.<br>\n<br>\nPage 19:<br>\nDefinitely not buying Garmr's point about Pine coaching dreal in thread. I don't think I've actually seen that happen before even though the accusation pops up about once in every three games.<br>\n<br>\nVery interested to see what Pine did after shadow flipped town.<br>\n<br>\nSo the more I think about these associative tells and how they seem to clear people who otherwise may be scum (Pine, Secret Agent), the more I think we might have one scum and one SK left. It fits with the number of kills each night and the fact that I've got too many town reads. Just a theory for now, but it makes sense to me. Also fits with the Day 1 vote count where I had town reads on the only two living players not on the lynch wagon because a SK obviously wouldn't be coordinating with scum, so if 1 shot and Garmr are both town, I'm even more likely to lean in this direction<br>\n<br>\nPage 20:<br>\nHmm. Pine might be town even if there is a SK. So now I'm thinking Lil for scum and Secret Agent for SK. God, I feel like Titus right now...<br>\n<br>\nPage 21:<br>\nOf course my scum reads swing momentum off of a town lynch. It seems like they'd let the shadow lynch go through as scum, but Lil and Secret Agent were important votes in the Flubber lynch. Then again, if they aren't aligned together, they have less knowledge over remaining alignments. Why is this SK theory making so much damn sense? I don't usually do this but it just fits.<br>\n<br>\nPage 22:<br>\nPine, do you honestly believe that if shadow had been scum, scum wouldn't seize the opportunity to jump that flubber wagon?<br>\n<br>\nLil's 545 and 546 rub me the wrong way. The first feels...like over correcting. Like he's apologetically correcting a mistake that no one cared about. I'm describing it poorly, but it feels off. The second one just repeats a question that was already asked by someone else. It doesn't feel like he's trying to scumhunt at all.<br>\n<br>\nPage 23:<br>\nHoly shit this flubber wagon is bad and I'm sure there's scum on it even if it's not the people I'm already scumreading.<br>\n<br>\nPage 24:<br>\nFunny. Secret Agent's description of normal scum play fits his own play here.<br>\n<br>\nPage 24/25:<br>\nI actually like garmr delaying the hammer to let less active players keep talking. I agree with his follow up after nn called him out for the most part. The only reason for scum to do it is for town points, but he didn't need that with no pressure on him and apparently it wouldn't have worked anyway.<br>\n<br>\nPage 25:<br>\nPine forgetting the non-scum kill makes it less likely that he's SK, if one exists, if that post was genuine and I see no reason to think it wasn't.<br>\n<br>\nOh fuck. This game is an open. I'm an idiot. There's no SK. I've talked way too much about it to go delete everything and still have any thoughts in this post and I'm not reading all of that again. Um. That kind of destroys my whole thought process. Well, I still think Lil is scum. Whoever the other one is, *shrug*. They're doing something right because I'm at a loss. Fuck, I really dropped the ball here.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr's delaying the hammer thing is still a town tell. Pine and Secret Agent still have non-associatives in their favor. Nn is still town as fuck. 1 shot didn't do a single scummy thing. Where am I wrong? Could it be 1 shot?<br>\n<br>\nHave we considered massclaiming? Doing so in LYLO allows for scum counterclaim shenanigans that we'd pretty much get out of the way at the right time if we did it today with 7 alive. And the rolecop could help a ton. There are benefits to holding off such as keeping power roles alive and letting them act one more night, so I'd like everyone to weigh in before we decide.<br>\n<br>\nPage 26:<br>\nNn, why the town read on Lil? And why openly discuss that you thought pine could be vig?<br>\n<br>\nPage 27:<br>\nSecret agent, why the vig speculation? This is dumb and people keep doing it. What the fuck<br>\n<br>\nActually, this whole page secret agent is pretty much the most active he's been and is doing more vig hunting than scum hunting. I'm back to scumreading him.<br>\n<br>\nI like this talk of a Lil lynch. I'm pretty much back to my read of a Lil/secret agent team.<br>\n<br>\nPage 28:<br>\nAfter reading this far, nn reading lil as genuine surprises me.<br>\n<br>\nActually, boring is right. If the vig shoots tonight, one of the lynch/vig kill has to be on scum otherwise we are 2:2. Based on the win conditions the mod posted, this wouldn't end the game if the vig is still alive, but we'd have to no lynch and have the vig hit scum (or not shoot and let the role cop figure it out) in order to win. Basically, it gets ugly with a cycle of 3 more town deaths. <br>\n<br>\nPage 29:<br>\nI like boring's plan for the vig and rolecop to simply claim power role for a massclaim.

The merit of this approach is immediately evident, as Drealmerz scummed right onto the wagon. Regrettably, I spotted that a little too late D1 to save Josh. Fortunately, Vig/SK saw it too and we don't have to spend a lynch on him. That leaves me to look at ThinkBig and LUV. Of the two, LUV seems to not really grok what's going on in this game, and it comes off as a bit unfeigned. I'm inclined to think the sheep onto the Josh wagon was a genuine sheep off of a well-presented (albeit incorrect) case.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves ThinkBig. Drealmerz and TB both went for Josh in rapid succession, elevating that wagon from an early exploration and pressure to L-2. It's hardly a wonder that newbieTown panicked, felt ostracized, and suicided. Taken as a whole, TB's behavior strikes me as opportunistic, as does his daystart congratulating the Vig. He's a bit new too, so it's hardly inconceivable that he just wouldn't know that that sort of thing is a common overcompensating behavior of disappointed scum, on par with betting too big on a bluff in order to cover the fact that you've got nothing.

I just wanted to see if I could be convinced otherwise first. That's why one of my first actions was to see how the two of them feel about each other. Obviously, you pinged me right away, but that feeling is subsiding somewhat. <br>\n<br>\nHe's not quite as strong a read as Jin, but here are a few little things adding together for me. In no particular order:<br>\n1. He hammered Flubber after Pine, his supposed scum read, put him at L-1. <br>\n2. He has focused on Pine almost to the exclusion of other players. It's so convenient, too. It allows him the illusion of scum hunting while actually contributing nothing to town.<br>\n3. He is very twitchy about even the slightest poking and prodding.

I just wanted to see if I could be convinced otherwise first. That's why one of my first actions was to see how the two of them feel about each other. Obviously, you pinged me right away, but that feeling is subsiding somewhat. <br>\n<br>\nHe's not quite as strong a read as Jin, but here are a few little things adding together for me. In no particular order:<br>\n1. He hammered Flubber after Pine, his supposed scum read, put him at L-1. <br>\n2. He has focused on Pine almost to the exclusion of other players. It's so convenient, too. It allows him the illusion of scum hunting while actually contributing nothing to town.<br>\n3. He is very twitchy about even the slightest poking and prodding.
