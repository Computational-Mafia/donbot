Unfortunately, you've arrived the night of a rather extraordinary event. A beloved ordinary person has been found dead, and you're one of the suspects. The people of the town have locked you in a room and told you that no one is allowed to leave until you have identified the wrong doers. <br>\n<br>\nAt least one of you has received the following, rather ordinary, role pm:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Vanilla Townie. Your only abilities are your voice and your vote. You win if at least one town player is alive and all threats to the town are eliminated.\n</div></blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">General Rules</div><br>\n1. This is a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal%20Game\">Normal Game</a>.<br>\n2. All site-wide rules apply. <br>\n3. Punishments for violating the rules may include, but are not limited to: forced replacement or mod-killing.<br>\n4. Pretending to break the rules is the same as breaking the rules.<br>\n<br>\nPost Restrictions<br>\n1. This is my <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0080FF\">color</div>. Don't use it.<br>\n2. No posting after your lynch scene has been posted. No exceptions.<br>\n3. No cryptography or tiny text. <br>\n<br>\nActivity Requirements<br>\n1. By confirming in thread, you commit to participating in this game.<br>\n2. You must, unless you give prior notice of V/LA, post once every 73 hours. <br>\n3. Failure to post regularly will result in a prod by pm.<br>\n4. Repeated proddings or failure to respond to a prod in a timely fashion will result in replacement.<br>\n<br>\nVoting and deadlines<br>\n1. All votes should be in this form - <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>. Players may also <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Player</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: \"No lynch\"</span><br>\n2. Anything that looks likes a vote may be counted as a vote at my discretion. <br>\n3. At the beginning of each day, I will announce a 2 week deadline. This deadline may be extended once at my discretion to account for replacements. <br>\n4. Once a player has reached at least 50% + 1 vote, a lynch has been reached. Votes and unvotes will not be effective.<br>\n5. Once deadline is reached without a majority, no lynch will occur. <br>\n6. When a player is lynched or nightkilled, their role name and alignment will be revealed. <br>\n<br>\nEndgame decisions<br>\n1. These rules are generic and are not meant to imply that any particular role is in a game.<br>\n2. Serial killers win if every other player is dead. They do not have to survive to win. <br>\n3. Mafia wins if at least one mafia player is alive and no other faction has any living players left or nothing can prevent that.<br>\n4. Town wins if at least one town player is alive and all threats to the town are eliminated.", "time": "Fri May 03, 2013 4:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28250&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "28250"}

I'd prefer lynching a loaded town wagon for info over a random lynch. I'd prefer a random lynch over a policy lynch. If that makes much sense. In the second post you quoted, I haven't really reviewed the game in as much detail as the first one (I think those are different posts. If not, ugh, I really need a break). Anyway, where I am right now, I like the Toomai lynch. It's not only a lynch I feel strong about as far as finding scum goes, but if he flips town it'll also provide some solid info to work on.<br>\n2) You're one of the most outspoken players. To have you confirmed town would be nice. To have you confirmed scum would be nicer. Sorry, it's a bit sadistic. Anyway, I've chosen a third path--to believe you are town based on the merits of your posts and to look into the wagon you've built. I find Toomai scummy for the same reasons you do, and I don't really feel like typing them out and, essentially, parroting what you wrote earlier.<br>\n3) I originally put things off to the weekend, which would give us two more days to the end of the cycle.

But I have a question for him. GCBC if there are other more \"scummy\" players to get instead of NicCage who are they? Would you be able to enlighten up on who you think is a bigger threat? Obviously you seem hard struck on Varsoon, but why does he seem more scummy to you then NicCage? Or anyone else for that matter?

Obviously my vote is subject to change pending future postings but as of the moment I am 100% comfortable with lynching Varsoon</div></blockquote>\n\nYou see, I held the same belief once, as well--that people who play scummy should get lynched and people who are town should be substantial with their posts and produce pro-town content. This generally led to me being a D1/D2 lynch or night-kill, with little substantial play built off of what I had posted and/or my death. As it turns out, in a town full of idiots, it's a lot better to play the idiot-savant or even the town fool. It makes people slip scum all over themselves as they point fingers at your play, which is usually not any better than most other players'.<br>\nFeel free to check my other game where I'm playing exactly the same way, except that I spent nearly four hours substantiating my claims and it got me nowhere. There's no reason to put forward tons of effort to find scum, it's far easier to let scum reveal itself.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hp [leaves wrote:</cite> post_id=4951586 time=1368446600 user_id=10128 post_num=284]<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4949929#p4949929\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4949929#p4949929\" data-post-id=\"4949929\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 261</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21402\">hapahauli</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nic Cage</div> - Useless lurker showing more interest in \"smoking weed\" than playing the game.</div></blockquote>\nHey Judge Dredd, I didn't know you played mafia.<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon, how about you stop talking about how you're town and be town instead?

Not only is he making a vote that keeps him closer to a lynch as the leading wagon while easily being able to vote NC, but it also stands the chance of angering a player off the wagon who is defending him.<br>\n<br>\nScum are rarely borderline suicidal like that and I think anypony who really is thinking even shortterm should be able to see the high potential ramifications of making the type of vote he is, continuing the style of play he has gotten slammed for in that type of direction is just bad town play instead of bad scum play.<br>\n<br>\nSo Varsoon wagon.  Go away.<br>\n<br>\nNC is good, SB is good, GCBC is actually quite decent as well.<br>\n<br>\nNeed to talk with my other half but CGBC in 309 is all kinds of scum.  NC still is really scummy (still kinda waiting for that Varsoon lynch reasoning) though, and im happy leaving the vote there.<br>\n<br>\nAlso four days to deadline, and im having mild connection issues (which look like they will persist for a couple weeks).  Nothing that warrents replacing but just less accessable than normal self.</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't buy this about Varsoon though.

They display a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">mentality</div> that is far different from the one you are exhibiting here.  Furthermore, I just used that game 'cause it was the first I happened to look at, and going through every single one of your town games and pointing out every single repeating pattern of this mentality is redundant and serves no purpose.  I can surely pull up a newer game, but given that people will be lynching you, I see no point in doing so.  <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, that \"recent game\" quote vote on Bellasarius is of extremely different context in this game.  Your vote against him in that game was an <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">early game pressure vote</div>.  Secondly, there are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">posts upon posts</div> of questioning and justifications beyond that vote that you post for voting him.

{"number": 427, "id": "4958118", "user": "Jake from Rainbowdash", "user_id": "21386", "content": "Okay because my other half is not quite on the same point I was making in the QT...<br>\n<br>\nA claim like that where you cant actually prove it in any way is not something that you automatically avoid lynching.  Its simply a mild reason not to lynch him (im hesitant to actually call it a towntell) in the situation.  However, part of the claim I like quite a bit from having a (whole lot) more experience here than you do.  Ive been a part (player/mod) of at this point probably over 100 games here, almost EVERY time I see a player claim a limited shot role, ESPECIALLY a non-information limited shot role, they are either town or scum with that exact role.<br>\n<br>\nHim claiming one shot is enough for me to put that wagon on pause.  You have decent enough reasoning, but as Jake has said the way the wagon formed, especially when you compare it to the NC wagon, doesn't feel right.  The only time a wagon just blitzes to L-1 its on scum?  Ehhh... probably not.  Its more of extra things instead of a good/bad case that make ac a bad lynch.  Yes even though you are going to complain about it - he is a bad lynch.  A cop probably shouldn't claim tomorrow or investigate him, but he still is a bad lynch because scum are either going to have to make a more suboptimal kill or take some other course of action.<br>\n<br>\nNC though is scum.  Two more points on the matter are<br>\n<br>\n1) His attack on Toom basically comes AFTER the wagon had started, but then he goes back and basically bases his page 10 vote on page 1/2 posts.

Right now it'd be very difficult to construe your posting as scummy and that's not what I'm doing. I also don't see how this is \"badgering\" or random. That seems to imply it's out of place or that you have some sort of suspicions on what I'm doing.

It sucks we have this limited amount of time at this point with such a claim that should be talked out more. With the time constraints though we don't have that luxury. With my past experience with mafia games (not form mafia) this situation happens a lot. Which makes the lynch both frustrating and hard. It's kind of a 50/50 shot in this case in my opinion, but with me being as skeptical as I am it is hard for me to decide either way. I'd like to see a scum get lynched in our first day, but I'd hate to be wrong and get a power role lynched instead. Given that the mafia knows whether he is scum or not and also knowing that if he isn't scum he may just be the doc. If that is the case they could either kill him off now and save some trouble later, or they could drag it out keep suspicion on him for as long as they need to. Even if it is just to stall the killing of one of there own/pointing the blame at another townie. I would say that it is not a good idea though to have a cop check him tonight if he is not lynched due to the fact that if ACfan is town then both our doc and our cop(if there is one) would then both be revealed weakening our survivability and insight. Or if he is town and the cop just doesn't say anything then we would have the problem of the still hanging suspicion over him which my still get him killed if not already. If he is scum then he has a free ticket to at least another day and the scum will surely use that to their advantage. It would be far better to have the cop search someone else in my opinion due to the pros out weighing the cons.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my vote I'm rattled and torn between 3 possibilities. NicCage and Scott are still on my watch list, but Hapa does make a good case against ACfan. It is just that this PR claim sticks a wrench in that. Do I trust the PR claim myself? I'm not quite sure. Not 100%.But do I want to change my vote? Not exactly. I'm going to keep my vote for now, but it may change before this day is over I need to look some things over real quick.

You need to take more specifics into account.<br>\n<br>\nFor example, the NC wagon (while slow) had zero resistance to it all game long (except from me, but everyone but J thinks I'm town).  So what if it's \"slow\" - the ultimate effect/concept is still the same.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, regarding \"fast\" wagons, 5 votes overnight on someone after a big case and big push is pretty normal for what I\"m used to (scum or town).  A swell of votes is a situation where scum are incredibly afraid to post in, so often there's not much resistance at all to a last-minute wagon (even when scum is on the bloc). \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>hapahauli wrote:</cite>GC - is your aversion to lynching ac1983fan still <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">only</div> based on his claim?</div></blockquote>mostly, not only.</div></blockquote>\n\nWhat are the other reasons?", "time": "Fri May 17, 2013 9:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28250&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "28250"}

But I'm not going to defend ac1983 for no good reason, the only things I've defended are elements around his wagon and the PR claim. What bothers me is none of his behaviour raises any clear cut town stamps, I'm not sure where you're getting this from. As soon as you try to find reasons for him doing one thing and not the other, then you're only looking for answers to an open-ended question \"is ac1983 town or scum?\" to which the answer isn't clear cut.<br>\n<br>\nI've leant town on him for a considerable time, and have let the last hours of the Day trickle by witnessing minimal activity while ac1983 still remained a nose in front of the NC wagon. I want to see a lynch rather than a no lynch. That's where my vote switch has come from. There are plenty of reasons out there for lynching ac1983, I still favour NC over him, but again that wasn't what appeared to be the choice on the table. It feels like you've ninja'd your way in to make a few town points and stated facts that simply aren't there.<br>\n<br>\nRegardless, if it's NC for today then fine. Let's lynch NC.

I think most of their hydra's posting has been them criticizing other player's logic (especially vocal players such as myself and J) rather than actively scumhunting.  Unfortunately I can't make a fancy case on this, and it's up to you (the townies) to look at his filter and get a feel for it.  Read his filter, and note the lack of scumhunting there.  Most of his actions are based off of criticizing players (often those that are in no danger of getting lynched) rather than questioning and/or pursuing his scumreads.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dyslexicon</div> just really hasn't done... anything.  And this read isn't so much that he's done something blatantly scummy, but there's also nothing that he's done that would suggest he's town.  To have no reason to think someone's town (game actions, filter, votes, or otherwise) is strange at this stage of the game.  Likely scum blending in here.

I'm not completely comfortable with them, but I'm leaning town here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scott Brosious</div> - ... is probably town.  Similar to the logic on ac1983fan, he had a golden opportunity to hammer NC when he was the 2nd leading vote candidate and NC was at L-1.  Instead, he was adamant about his suspicions against Varsoon.  There's a lack of self-preservation mentality here. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Zefiend/Dessx</div> - Null/Wildcard.  Zefiend gave me town-vibes, but 6 posts isn't enough to make a concrete read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Daemon</div> - Slight town-read.  He has this enthusiasm about him that feels townie.  Less of a sample-size than ideal, but not someone I'd lynch tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toomai</div> - Completely null.  I'll be pretty concerned about him if NC flips red though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hp[leaves]</div> - His intent to hammer ac1983fan then subsequent \"waiiiiit a darn minute this shit is moving too fast\" makes me think he's town.

For starters, I wasn't under serious suspicion at the time, so there was no reason for me to be shifting the blame. There practically was no blame to shift, and I explained my reasoning for asking that question was to find out what the difference was between Toomai and I. Jake obviously doesn't accept that reasoning, but he never says why it's wrong and has never attempted to understand my motivation from a different perspective. This is part of a pattern of behavior. <br>\n<br>\nHere is the post about why zef is town:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4935369#p4935369\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4935369#p4935369\" data-post-id=\"4935369\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 149</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21386\">Jake from Rainbowdash</a> wrote:</cite>So the \"zef is town\" breakdown.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4929350#p4929350\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4929350#p4929350\" data-post-id=\"4929350\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 50</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21478\">&#576;efiend</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hapahauli wrote:</cite>Of course. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">However I don't understand why he would vote someone</div> on the basis that he hates RVS, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">while effectively making an RVS vote of his own</div>. </div></blockquote>\nA random vote is one that is made randomly, without reasoning or justification.<br>\n<br>\nhp [leaves] placed his vote and gave a reason.

Its town picking up on something that he sees as scum trying to throw out a vote on non-existent reasoning.

He sees where the push is coming from, and although he does appear to still disagree with it, he feels that its town motivated instead of scum motivated.  I can follow him, do you?<br>\n<br>\n@NC - How is that vote \"safe\".  If any vote is \"safe\" its yours on him because its sheeping the vocal player without actually giving any reason of your own as to why you are voting him.

It's actually an enormous part of why I changed my read on zef, in case you were curious. <br>\n<br>\nWhat I find funny about this post is how it points out a really good town quality without actually practicing it. He says that zef is trying to get to the bottom of something rather than just calling someone scum. But at the end that's exactly what Jake does. There really aren't any questions trying to understand my logic behind voting zef, aside from asking how wordy is a scumtell.

He is more of a gut.<br>\n<br>\n3.GoodCopBadCop. While I feel he has been aggressive with some topics to get information I feel there may be something behind what these two are working on. I feel the aggression is a bit less townie and more for themselves. I could just be iffy on the issue but I feel like GoodCopBadCop has been kind of working on their own. And following when it feels convenient. But do feel that they may be town. Or at least I want to think they are.<br>\n<br>\n4.Hapahauli. Now this is much more of me being a skeptic. Now it is good you are the most vocal player in the game and trying to get somewhere. I do think you are town, but I can see how doing all that you have will keep you alive if you were part of the scum. Which would help you turn the tables more to your whim to achieve your goal. You do have a good deal of support I've noticed through the game which can make you dangerous for either side. For right now I think your town but I do worry if you are scum. If you are your playing us quite well. Now needless to say you don't have all the power. This is probably not neither a gut nor a positive scum read, but just my skepticism.<br>\n<br>\nThose are all I have right now that I have been looking into.

Im happy lynching him today.<br>\n<br>\nIts going to be WIFOM but you should follow here too.  Basically the kill is a massive tell.  Look who the likely kills would be: Zef and hap.  Now approach this from a standpoint of town-acfan.  Who is going to die (most likely) assuming both town?  Its very clearly Zef.  That is a quiet quiet spot that has a loud player replacing in and everypony thinks is town.  aka a threat.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hoof, why would scum kill Hap if acfan was town?  They wouldn't.  Pure and simple they wouldn't because it would likely end with a mislynch of acfan.  Scum would be more than happy to keep a prob-town who wants a PR dead alive.<br>\n<br>\nBy that logic, acfan cant be town because the \"protect\" he would have made as town would have been Zef.  While im sure he is going to run in and claim that he protected the player who wanted him dead or something... but it doesn't make any sense.<br>\n<br>\nThe kill seems to line up with acfan being scum and just making that side kill without really thinking about who he would protect as town.  Sometimes the best way to catch scum who has claimed a role (outside of trumping it with role information - which if it exists here shouldn't be said) is to compare it to what they should be doing in that situation.   acfan I don't think approached this as he would town (outside of him about to claim \"oh I got RBed\" or something like that).<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon and Hap are town still though.

You, who's played \"100 games\" on this site should know better than that as town. <br>\n<br>\nAnd if you became slightly suspicious of AC because of the night kill, I'd be OK with that.

Im happy lynching him today.<br>\n<br>\nIts going to be WIFOM but you should follow here too. Basically the kill is a massive tell. Look who the likely kills would be: Zef and hap. Now approach this from a standpoint of town-acfan. Who is going to die (most likely) assuming both town? Its very clearly Zef. That is a quiet quiet spot that has a loud player replacing in and everypony thinks is town. aka a threat.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hoof, why would scum kill Hap if acfan was town? They wouldn't. Pure and simple they wouldn't because it would likely end with a mislynch of acfan. Scum would be more than happy to keep a prob-town who wants a PR dead alive.<br>\n<br>\nBy that logic, acfan cant be town because the \"protect\" he would have made as town would have been Zef. While im sure he is going to run in and claim that he protected the player who wanted him dead or something... but it doesn't make any sense.<br>\n<br>\nThe kill seems to line up with acfan being scum and just making that side kill without really thinking about who he would protect as town. Sometimes the best way to catch scum who has claimed a role (outside of trumping it with role information - which if it exists here shouldn't be said) is to compare it to what they should be doing in that situation. acfan I don't think approached this as he would town (outside of him about to claim \"oh I got RBed\" or something like that).<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon and Hap are town still though.

The debate was had over what to do with our result, I wanted to just try and get him lynched through some odd stuff (which I did somewhat agree with, I did say if we didn't die acfan was somewhat likely scum overnight) but would claim if that's what it took.

Which I thought was silly to think about using on N1. And on that specific person? Sure I can see two people attacking the same target but stilll..wtf. Him RB Scott makes more since. There wasn't a night kill last night so either he is lying and a doc heal the person who really was supposed to die or he isn't. That is how I see it. But if Cherry's claim is true and he did heal the person that was to die last night then that puts an even bigger look see at HP. I would actually honestly believe Cheery's claim better then I would HP's at this current moment.<br>\n<br>\nNow Cheery's claim although rocky with how he has played if he is the doctor he has been doing well on not giving his role away.

I think this is one of them.<br>\n<br>\nContrast this with AC's claim.  His 1-shot doctor claim was incredibly neatly packaged, had a clean story behind it, and had all loose ends tied.  It's incredibly different from this current scenario, in which HP basically assumed his claim was legit (which is a really townie trait), and bombed his claim without worrying about the consequences.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2) HP is showing no survivalist-mentality.</div><br>\n<br>\nWhat does \"scum-HP\" have to gain from this claim?  If he wanted to lynch Scott, he probably could have done so without claiming.  Basically HP put himself in a position where he would get lynched if Scott flipped green, and making that 1-for-1 trade at this stage in the game (right after one of your scum-buddies dies) makes very little sense.  <br>\n<br>\nThis is also why I doubt he's a 3rd party role.  3rd parties often want to lay low and surivive at all costs.  This claim on his part not only puts him at risk to get lynched, but also puts him at risk to get shot by scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3) His \"defense\" makes sense.</div><br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1st, I wasn't here for the majority of the second day (because of the speedlynch, even though it was justified) so I didn't have time to comment at all<br>\n2nd, I do not breadcrumb my targets.

It is not farfetched that scum have daytalk given the kuribo flip, so something ridiculous is certainly feasible. Really? A ridiculous JOAT with roles nobody has ever heard of?

Scott seems more interested in framing Toomai after an AC flip rather than lynching AC.<br>\n<br>\nScott has been suspicious of Toomai all game, and from his filter, seems more interested in calling Toomai scum rather than pushing him or justifying his read.

I have seen 1v1s cost town the game more than won town anything.  This goes for my other half too.  NEVER do this, its a sign of a weak player who probably should not be listened to.<br>\n2) We are town because of balance.  Its the same reason that CP is town.  Balance.  There are three scum because the game is not over.  NO MATTER WHAT the last scum is, the game is scum sided without both of us being town.  Neighborizer is slightly better (if that) than VT.  Doc-Tracker is about even with RB-Goon-Goon/Traitor (we actually have had that discussion regarding Dyslx, I think he is scum except for the N2 result we got).  GCBC is pushing three scum with one useful town PR.  Three GOONS with one useful PR is usually a scum win.<br>\n3) Worst case lynching us outside of F3 is a joke.  Best case we are going to be forced to come up with a 1v1 in F3.<br>\n<br>\nBC part seems to think he is a half decent player or something and is taking a page out of the \"lets be a hated ass\" book of players like LLD and Reck.  Seriously, who are you?  I want to put you on my \"avoid\" list from here on out because players like you do nothing but make the game miserable to play in for the rest of us.  There is a major reason lots of players really dislike the ones I just mentioned, they are NOT fun to play with.<br>\n<br>\nWhen you defy logic by not looking like thing like... how to balance games and stuff like that.

We lynch Daemon today, if he is town we clear Toom tonight or confirm him as scum.<br>\n<br>\n@other part - Compulisve neighborizers are rare because they are horrible.  I would rather the game have a VT then that because its just a very dumb role.  Most mods realize that unless they are trying to make basically a fruit vendor its better as a regular one.<br>\n<br>\n@GCBC - Do you really think RB/Goon/Traitor vs Doc/Neighborizer/VTs is a balanced setup?
