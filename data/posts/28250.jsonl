Unfortunately, you've arrived the night of a rather extraordinary event. A beloved ordinary person has been found dead, and you're one of the suspects. The people of the town have locked you in a room and told you that no one is allowed to leave until you have identified the wrong doers. <br><br>At least one of you has received the following, rather ordinary, role pm:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Vanilla Townie. Your only abilities are your voice and your vote. You win if at least one town player is alive and all threats to the town are eliminated.<br></div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General Rules</span><br>1. This is a <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal%20Game\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game</a>.<br>2. All site-wide rules apply. <br>3. Punishments for violating the rules may include, but are not limited to: forced replacement or mod-killing.<br>4. Pretending to break the rules is the same as breaking the rules.<br><br>Post Restrictions<br>1. This is my <span style=\"color: #0080FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">color</span></span>. Don't use it.<br>2. No posting after your lynch scene has been posted. No exceptions.<br>3. No cryptography or tiny text. <br><br>Activity Requirements<br>1. By confirming in thread, you commit to participating in this game.<br>2. You must, unless you give prior notice of V/LA, post once every 73 hours. <br>3. Failure to post regularly will result in a prod by pm.<br>4. Repeated proddings or failure to respond to a prod in a timely fashion will result in replacement.<br><br>Voting and deadlines<br>1. All votes should be in this form - <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>. Players may also <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Player</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: \"No lynch\"</span><br>2. Anything that looks likes a vote may be counted as a vote at my discretion. <br>3. At the beginning of each day, I will announce a 2 week deadline. This deadline may be extended once at my discretion to account for replacements. <br>4. Once a player has reached at least 50% + 1 vote, a lynch has been reached. Votes and unvotes will not be effective.<br>5. Once deadline is reached without a majority, no lynch will occur. <br>6. When a player is lynched or nightkilled, their role name and alignment will be revealed. <br><br>Endgame decisions<br>1. These rules are generic and are not meant to imply that any particular role is in a game.<br>2. Serial killers win if every other player is dead. They do not have to survive to win. <br>3. Mafia wins if at least one mafia player is alive and no other faction has any living players left or nothing can prevent that.<br>4. Town wins if at least one town player is alive and all threats to the town are eliminated."}

If not, all I can really say is that there are large stylistic differences in our play.  It's my first game on this site, so it's not like I'm going to magically conform to to how things work here.  However I do believe my approach has it's own merits, and it's brought me a ton of success in the past."}

You brought up someone who has no posts and hapahauli went either \"hmm, didn't think of that, but you can't really do much to no-posters early Day 1\" or \"I noticed, but you can't really do much to no-posters early Day 1\".

I find this pretty ungrounded this early in the game - at this point, we had made like... 10 posts each?  Maybe a town feeling, but far too early to call two people town.  This could be excusable on its own, however there's more of a pattern:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4928374#p4928374\" class=\"postlink\">post 32</a>, Toomai wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4927818#p4927818\" class=\"postlink\">post 28</a>, Daemon385 wrote:</cite>Such an interesting start this fine day!<br><br>VOTE: Varsoon    Cause I like the way Toomai thinks</div></blockquote>This looks pretty RVS (referencing my random vote), I don't know why people are jumping on it.

What's odd is that he's willing to defend someone so readily and so early in the game based off one post.

Anyway, where I am right now, I like the Toomai lynch. It's not only a lynch I feel strong about as far as finding scum goes, but if he flips town it'll also provide some solid info to work on.<br>2) You're one of the most outspoken players. To have you confirmed town would be nice. To have you confirmed scum would be nicer. Sorry, it's a bit sadistic. Anyway, I've chosen a third path--to believe you are town based on the merits of your posts and to look into the wagon you've built. I find Toomai scummy for the same reasons you do, and I don't really feel like typing them out and, essentially, parroting what you wrote earlier.<br>3) I originally put things off to the weekend, which would give us two more days to the end of the cycle.

If Varsoon is scum, and because I personally believe NicCage is scum, GCBC is probably a townie (who I had a slight-town read on anyways).  Likewise, because I personally have a town-read on hapahauli, Toomai might be scum (not sure on this one, yet).  I don't understand why Varsoon would list out his lynch-pool and not place a vote in the same post, only to weakly continue on and place a parrot vote on Toomai anyway."}

As it turns out, in a town full of idiots, it's a lot better to play the idiot-savant or even the town fool. It makes people slip scum all over themselves as they point fingers at your play, which is usually not any better than most other players'.<br>Feel free to check my other game where I'm playing exactly the same way, except that I spent nearly four hours substantiating my claims and it got me nowhere. There's no reason to put forward tons of effort to find scum, it's far easier to let scum reveal itself.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4951586#p4951586\" class=\"postlink\">post 284</a>, hp [leaves] wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4949929#p4949929\" class=\"postlink\">post 261</a>, hapahauli wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Nic Cage</span> - Useless lurker showing more interest in \"smoking weed\" than playing the game.</div></blockquote><br>Hey Judge Dredd, I didn't know you played mafia.<br><br>Varsoon, how about you stop talking about how you're town and be town instead?

They display a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">mentality</span> that is far different from the one you are exhibiting here.  Furthermore, I just used that game 'cause it was the first I happened to look at, and going through every single one of your town games and pointing out every single repeating pattern of this mentality is redundant and serves no purpose.  I can surely pull up a newer game, but given that people will be lynching you, I see no point in doing so.  <br><br>Secondly, that \"recent game\" quote vote on Bellasarius is of extremely different context in this game.  Your vote against him in that game was an <span class=\"noboldsig\">early game pressure vote</span>.  Secondly, there are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">posts upon posts</span> of questioning and justifications beyond that vote that you post for voting him.  I'll pull up two to illustrate the point:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4782352#p4782352\" class=\"postlink\">post 532</a>, ac1983fan wrote:</cite>So now we have confirmed town mason Apozzle.<br>I think Belisarius and Edosourist are both scum.

Right now it'd be very difficult to construe your posting as scummy and that's not what I'm doing. I also don't see how this is \"badgering\" or random. That seems to imply it's out of place or that you have some sort of suspicions on what I'm doing. Dealing with questions towards your actions comes with the territory, I'd say it's no different from what you've been doing to others. However, if you feel it is, please elaborate why that's the case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4958177#p4958177\" class=\"postlink\">post 432</a>, hapahauli wrote:</cite>If you are not voting ac1983fan, the onus is on you to explain why.

I'd also consider NicCage for a lynch. The wagon on ac1983fan happened faster than I would've liked and could've reacted to. I was wary of its speed and the PR claim only increases this notion. That's not to say you don't have relevant points, but in the scope of how it played out I've gotten a bad feeling about it all.<br><br>This wagon and the deadline has caught me between a rock and a hard place.

It sucks we have this limited amount of time at this point with such a claim that should be talked out more. With the time constraints though we don't have that luxury. With my past experience with mafia games (not form mafia) this situation happens a lot. Which makes the lynch both frustrating and hard. It's kind of a 50/50 shot in this case in my opinion, but with me being as skeptical as I am it is hard for me to decide either way. I'd like to see a scum get lynched in our first day, but I'd hate to be wrong and get a power role lynched instead. Given that the mafia knows whether he is scum or not and also knowing that if he isn't scum he may just be the doc. If that is the case they could either kill him off now and save some trouble later, or they could drag it out keep suspicion on him for as long as they need to. Even if it is just to stall the killing of one of there own/pointing the blame at another townie. I would say that it is not a good idea though to have a cop check him tonight if he is not lynched due to the fact that if ACfan is town then both our doc and our cop(if there is one) would then both be revealed weakening our survivability and insight. Or if he is town and the cop just doesn't say anything then we would have the problem of the still hanging suspicion over him which my still get him killed if not already. If he is scum then he has a free ticket to at least another day and the scum will surely use that to their advantage. It would be far better to have the cop search someone else in my opinion due to the pros out weighing the cons.<br><br>As for my vote I'm rattled and torn between 3 possibilities. NicCage and Scott are still on my watch list, but Hapa does make a good case against ACfan. It is just that this PR claim sticks a wrench in that. Do I trust the PR claim myself? I'm not quite sure. Not 100%.But do I want to change my vote? Not exactly. I'm going to keep my vote for now, but it may change before this day is over I need to look some things over real quick. I feel ACfan could be buying himself off with the PR ticket to live another day. Scum will do anything they can to survive."}

And given the super fast way the wagon developed it could give us some valuble information in the case he actually is town. And if he is scum, voila!

Right now it'd be very difficult to construe your posting as scummy and that's not what I'm doing. I also don't see how this is \"badgering\" or random. That seems to imply it's out of place or that you have some sort of suspicions on what I'm doing. Dealing with questions towards your actions comes with the territory, I'd say it's no different from what you've been doing to others.

Or do you seriously think Varsoon is a better candidate at this point?</div></blockquote><br>Right, well I thought I gave a rough indication, but a couple of simple points:<br><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">- the wagon developed extremely quickly (at this stage that's not often an indication of town-only involvement)<br>- there are people who jumped on the wagon that I either have suspicion of, or feel they joined it weakly and thus leaves me developing suspicion<br>- there's been a PR claim, not an ideal one, but my preference with these things in the past is to not lynched claimed PR's if there's reasonable opportunity for them to do something with it<br>- we could take the PR claim into consideration for tomorrow, both with possible set-ups and future courses of action eg. should ac1983fan keep his 1 shot for later and bait out a scum kill? or try to protect key targets to help town for tomorrow? etc.<br>- the case on ac1983fan isn't definitive (RE: meta) and so there's no reason to be close minded towards alternative explanations for his actions or lynch targets for today<br>- there are alternative lynches and time (just) to lynch these people</ol></div></blockquote><br><br>I've dismissed all these reasonings in previous posts.  Namely that my case isn't based on meta, and that the chances of making scum do something \"suboptimal\" with his ability (if he's somehow town) are extremely low.  <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wouldn't go so far as to say Varsoon is a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">better</span> candidate, but he feels like a viable alternative. I'd also consider NicCage for a lynch. The wagon on ac1983fan happened faster than I would've liked and could've reacted to. I was wary of its speed and the PR claim only increases this notion. That's not to say you don't have relevant points, but in the scope of how it played out I've gotten a bad feeling about it all.</div></blockquote><br><br>You voting Varsoon implies that you think he's the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">best</span> candidate availible.  If he's not the best candidate in your mind, who is?

So if people aren't going to be moving their votes then I'll hammer if need be.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't like this attitude.  I feel like you've been talking around things and doing everything in your power not to make a vote-committment.  Your plan here is essentially to wait and see, and give the town your \"stamp of approval\" by hammering someone.  This is unacceptable when we have 24 hours left in the day.  We need to be discussing reads, not doing hwat you are proposing."}

You need to take more specifics into account.<br><br>For example, the NC wagon (while slow) had zero resistance to it all game long (except from me, but everyone but J thinks I'm town).

What bothers me is none of his behaviour raises any clear cut town stamps, I'm not sure where you're getting this from.

I'm not as sure about a 3rd scum-suspect, and there's no reason for me to really force one.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cherry Pie</span> is a typical scum \"attempting to contribute w/out actually contributing\" methinks.  I think most of their hydra's posting has been them criticizing other player's logic (especially vocal players such as myself and J) rather than actively scumhunting.  Unfortunately I can't make a fancy case on this, and it's up to you (the townies) to look at his filter and get a feel for it.  Read his filter, and note the lack of scumhunting there.  Most of his actions are based off of criticizing players (often those that are in no danger of getting lynched) rather than questioning and/or pursuing his scumreads.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dyslexicon</span> just really hasn't done... anything.  And this read isn't so much that he's done something blatantly scummy, but there's also nothing that he's done that would suggest he's town.  To have no reason to think someone's town (game actions, filter, votes, or otherwise) is strange at this stage of the game.  Likely scum blending in here.  I'll do an elaborate ISO if I'm alive tomorrow.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Some thoughts on other various players on my mind:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">GCBC</span> - BC's ragequit strikes me as townie.   I'm not completely comfortable with them, but I'm leaning town here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scott Brosious</span> - ... is probably town.  Similar to the logic on ac1983fan, he had a golden opportunity to hammer NC when he was the 2nd leading vote candidate and NC was at L-1.  Instead, he was adamant about his suspicions against Varsoon.  There's a lack of self-preservation mentality here. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zefiend/Dessx</span> - Null/Wildcard.  Zefiend gave me town-vibes, but 6 posts isn't enough to make a concrete read.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Daemon</span> - Slight town-read.  He has this enthusiasm about him that feels townie.  Less of a sample-size than ideal, but not someone I'd lynch tomorrow.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Toomai</span> - Completely null.  I'll be pretty concerned about him if NC flips red though.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">hp[leaves]</span> - His intent to hammer ac1983fan then subsequent \"waiiiiit a darn minute this shit is moving too fast\" makes me think he's town.  Sounds very genuine, and I don't understand why scum wouldn't entertain the idea of a hammer there more (unless ac is scum, but as mentioned earlier by Rainbow, severe doubts about that)."}

For starters, I wasn't under serious suspicion at the time, so there was no reason for me to be shifting the blame. There practically was no blame to shift, and I explained my reasoning for asking that question was to find out what the difference was between Toomai and I. Jake obviously doesn't accept that reasoning, but he never says why it's wrong and has never attempted to understand my motivation from a different perspective. This is part of a pattern of behavior. <br><br>Here is the post about why zef is town:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4935369#p4935369\" class=\"postlink\">post 149</a>, Jake from Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>So the \"zef is town\" breakdown.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4929350#p4929350\" class=\"postlink\">post 50</a>, \u0240efiend wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hapahauli wrote:</cite>Of course. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">However I don't understand why he would vote someone</span> on the basis that he hates RVS, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">while effectively making an RVS vote of his own</span>. </div></blockquote><br>A random vote is one that is made randomly, without reasoning or justification.<br><br>hp [leaves] placed his vote and gave a reason.

Im happy lynching him today.<br><br>Its going to be WIFOM but you should follow here too.  Basically the kill is a massive tell.  Look who the likely kills would be: Zef and hap.  Now approach this from a standpoint of town-acfan.  Who is going to die (most likely) assuming both town?  Its very clearly Zef.  That is a quiet quiet spot that has a loud player replacing in and everypony thinks is town.  aka a threat.<br><br>On the other hoof, why would scum kill Hap if acfan was town?  They wouldn't.  Pure and simple they wouldn't because it would likely end with a mislynch of acfan.  Scum would be more than happy to keep a prob-town who wants a PR dead alive.<br><br>By that logic, acfan cant be town because the \"protect\" he would have made as town would have been Zef.  While im sure he is going to run in and claim that he protected the player who wanted him dead or something... but it doesn't make any sense.<br><br>The kill seems to line up with acfan being scum and just making that side kill without really thinking about who he would protect as town.  Sometimes the best way to catch scum who has claimed a role (outside of trumping it with role information - which if it exists here shouldn't be said) is to compare it to what they should be doing in that situation.   acfan I don't think approached this as he would town (outside of him about to claim \"oh I got RBed\" or something like that).<br><br>Varsoon and Hap are town still though.

Most notably...<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Is your argument, scum who is at L-2 and has claimed a PR is INTENTIONALLY staying off the other wagon at L-2 when there is absolutely no guarantee that they are safe? What scum does that? Really?<br><br>The only way that ac is scum is if NC is also scum and probably something he sees as more valueable than himself (even then, doesn't make much sense, grab the town points and run). Im just not seeing the point behind scum not doing any sort of self-preservation here. Really why does scum avoid that wagon in this spot? Especially when NC may very well vote ac first.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ac is almost for sure town. Indiviudally he is one of my stronger town reads just by behavior.</span> Assuming he is town, chances are really really good that at least of of CP/GCBC are scum, regardless of NC alignment. About half the time ive ended up pushing on a PR-claim wagon that was town ive been scum, you don't do that without excellent reasoning. \"He isn't doing self preservation\" is not excellent reasoning.</div></blockquote><br><br>And you dropped all this because of NK WIFOM.  You, who's played \"100 games\" on this site should know better than that as town. <br><br>And if you became slightly suspicious of AC because of the night kill, I'd be OK with that.  It's the fact that you're now unreservedly screaming for his head that gets to me - NK WIFOM is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">never</span> the sole reason to lynch someone.  <br><br>Overall, your body of analysis/posting that calls ACfan town is far stronger than your recent posts which call AC scum.<br><br>Like the main body of your NK analysis makes no sense...<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@hap - With that kill acfan is very likely scum. Im happy lynching him today.<br><br>Its going to be WIFOM but you should follow here too. Basically the kill is a massive tell. Look who the likely kills would be: Zef and hap. Now approach this from a standpoint of town-acfan. Who is going to die (most likely) assuming both town? Its very clearly Zef. That is a quiet quiet spot that has a loud player replacing in and everypony thinks is town. aka a threat.<br><br>On the other hoof, why would scum kill Hap if acfan was town? They wouldn't. Pure and simple they wouldn't because it would likely end with a mislynch of acfan. Scum would be more than happy to keep a prob-town who wants a PR dead alive.<br><br>By that logic, acfan cant be town because the \"protect\" he would have made as town would have been Zef. While im sure he is going to run in and claim that he protected the player who wanted him dead or something... but it doesn't make any sense.<br><br>The kill seems to line up with acfan being scum and just making that side kill without really thinking about who he would protect as town. Sometimes the best way to catch scum who has claimed a role (outside of trumping it with role information - which if it exists here shouldn't be said) is to compare it to what they should be doing in that situation. acfan I don't think approached this as he would town (outside of him about to claim \"oh I got RBed\" or something like that).<br><br>Varsoon and Hap are town still though. Pretty sure of that one.</div></blockquote><br><br>Firstly, you're assuming that a town AC fan would have played his role perfectly optimally.  This is an absurdly flawed assumption.<br><br>Secondly, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">you</span> were also a plausible NK candidate given how many people thought you were town yesterday.  Your entire analysis breaks down when you factor this into account. <br><br>Finally, there are plenty of other explanations for Zef getting NK'd that you completely gloss over.  The most plausible explanation IMO is that it was a \"clean kill.\"  Mafia liked the direction the town was going in and didn't want to disturb the status-quo."}

Which I thought was silly to think about using on N1. And on that specific person? Sure I can see two people attacking the same target but stilll..wtf. Him RB Scott makes more since. There wasn't a night kill last night so either he is lying and a doc heal the person who really was supposed to die or he isn't. That is how I see it. But if Cherry's claim is true and he did heal the person that was to die last night then that puts an even bigger look see at HP. I would actually honestly believe Cheery's claim better then I would HP's at this current moment.<br><br>Now Cheery's claim although rocky with how he has played if he is the doctor he has been doing well on not giving his role away. Which the longer a doctor lives the better usually (if he can pick and choose the right targets.<br><br>Scott I have been suspicious of since Day 1. Him and NicCage. Though unfortunately Nic wasn't the right target it seems. Though he did give us much insight on who is scum. Scott while still suspicious I'm not sure he is scum. I would believe he could be one of the rest remain or something else.<br><br>And also I'm pretty sure JFR is town the suspicion is nice, but I think it may be a bit misguided. They have proven very useful to town so far so I have no worries so far of them being scum.<br><br>I'd say my 3 biggest suspision right now are HP, Scott, and Dys (Dys being more of a null then a positive scum just not really sure)"}

This is because the kill had to go somewhere N2, and if it wasn't SB being blocked, we got protected.<br>2) If CP is scum, SB is scum.  Same principle applied in reverse.  The kill went somewhere.<br>3) No more than one of me, CP and hp are scum.  Balance<br><br>A couple \"probably\" things<br><br>1) At least one of hp and SB are some sort of scum<br>2) hp probably DOES have a RB ability.  Likely either mafia or third party.<br><br>A few things that need explaining<br><br>1) hp being told that his BP ability is used up.  Yeah RIGHT.  With a doctor you (not only have a BP ability) but get told when its used?  So we can distinguish between that 'no death' and doctor saving somepony?  That doesn't happen<br>2) You claim that you didn't use the 'cop' ability because \"mafia kill with knives\".  How do you come to that conclusion before the N1 death?  Also flavor in normals is meaningless.  Its also against site rules unless the mod puts \"player X - stabbed night Y\".<br>3) In an attempt to say that you wanted to save the cop for the time its most accurate, you use the LEAST accurate role, RB.  Not only do you have to hit scum, but you have to hit scum submitting the kill.  This basically (for gamestate comparison) ment if you used the 'cop' you had a 2/11 chance of catching scum.  Using the RB you had a 1/11 chance.<br>4) You are talking about investigating us.  When as stated - we cant be scum if SB is town.  Checking him and getting a town result clears us and him at once.  This is scum trying to not clear players.<br><br>No lynch was one of those things I was thinking early on, but holes keep appearing in hp claim.

I'll just mention again that I was tracked, although I don't know if it's custom to let players do multiple actions, I'm not used to that were I've played before.

I have seen 1v1s cost town the game more than won town anything.  This goes for my other half too.  NEVER do this, its a sign of a weak player who probably should not be listened to.<br>2) We are town because of balance.  Its the same reason that CP is town.  Balance.  There are three scum because the game is not over.  NO MATTER WHAT the last scum is, the game is scum sided without both of us being town.  Neighborizer is slightly better (if that) than VT.  Doc-Tracker is about even with RB-Goon-Goon/Traitor (we actually have had that discussion regarding Dyslx, I think he is scum except for the N2 result we got).  GCBC is pushing three scum with one useful town PR.  Three GOONS with one useful PR is usually a scum win.<br>3) Worst case lynching us outside of F3 is a joke.  Best case we are going to be forced to come up with a 1v1 in F3.<br><br>BC part seems to think he is a half decent player or something and is taking a page out of the \"lets be a hated ass\" book of players like LLD and Reck.  Seriously, who are you?  I want to put you on my \"avoid\" list from here on out because players like you do nothing but make the game miserable to play in for the rest of us.  There is a major reason lots of players really dislike the ones I just mentioned, they are NOT fun to play with.<br><br>When you defy logic by not looking like thing like... how to balance games and stuff like that.  Or basic \"if I am wrong\" logic regarding PRs.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Daemon</span><br><br>We aren't lynching GCBC.  That's still a derpy move, he is very dumb and a liability town, but he is probably town.  That kill of hap doesnt come from him.  We lynch Daemon today, if he is town we clear Toom tonight or confirm him as scum.<br><br>@other part - Compulisve neighborizers are rare because they are horrible.  I would rather the game have a VT then that because its just a very dumb role.  Most mods realize that unless they are trying to make basically a fruit vendor its better as a regular one.<br><br>@GCBC - Do you really think RB/Goon/Traitor vs Doc/Neighborizer/VTs is a balanced setup?  Because im not sure how that is even close to a balanced setup.  Move the Traitor to VT and I would sign off on it."}

Really didn't think I was going to be able to intimidate scum into not killing and getting stuck in a force loss position.

If it wasn't a forced win and we needed another VT on faith I would have gotten louder, but in a forced win getting rid of those that pose the logic threat to it is always a good thing.  Ive seen groups give away forced wins because they kept the liability around."}
