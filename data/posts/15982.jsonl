Unlike other places where whole towns are at risk of being taken over by a group of maniacs, you are just some people trying to get the day over with a good game.<br>As always, there are some of you, who take the game more seriously and others who join only for fun. All of you, however, share an interest in winning ranging from moderate to obsessive.<br>The best of you (or maybe the luckiest) shall win.<br><br>LET THE GAME BEGIN (and don't forget the rules)!<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1. General Rules</span><br>1.1 This is a game. Have fun.<br>1.2 Rule violations will be dealt case by case. I am not afraid to modkill, should it be necessary.<br>1.3 If you think I made a mistake contact me.<br>1.4 Usually I will post in <span style=\"color: orange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">bolded orange</span></span></span>.<br>1.5 My decision is final on whatever is going on in this game.<br>1.6 What your role PM says has priority over every one of the following rules.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2. Votes and Lynches</span><br>2.1 To vote a person use vote tags, e.g. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tasky</span> or bold your vote. If your vote is already on someone, an unvote would be nice.<br>2.2 You may use abbreviations as long as it's clear who you want to vote.<br>2.3 If I think you meant to vote, I will count the vote.<br>2.4 As soon as the majority of the players vote at the same time for a player, that player is immediately lynched.<br>2.5 You may <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>, as you would vote any player. If half of the players (rounded up) vote No Lynch, the day will end without lynch.<br>2.6 After a lynch, no one is considered dead until I lock the tread. Therefore every player is allowed to post during twilight.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3. Do and Don't</span><br>3.1 The only place you are allowed to talk about this game is in this thread or in a PM addressed at me and only at me.<br>3.2 You may not edit or delete any posts of this thread.<br>3.3 Do not quote or pretend to quote any private communication with me. This includes your role PM.<br>3.4 Play to win. Don't do anything obviously detrimental to your faction on purpose.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4. Prods and Replacements</span><br>4.1 You are allowed to be on V/LA for no more than half day's maximal lenght and only if you are back at least two days before deadline. If you plan on being away for longer, I will replace you.<br>4.2 If you do not post in thread for more than 60 hours without announcing a V/LA, you will be prodded.<br>4.3 If a player fails to pick up his prod and post in thread for more than 36 hours, he will be forced to replaced out or modkilled.<br>4.4 Every player may request a prod or a forced replacement. I will then consider his/her request.<br>4.5 The sooner I know you have to be replaced, the better it is for me and for the game. If you know you will have to replace out, let me know in advance<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">5. Deadlines</span><br>5.1 First day's deadline d<sub>1</sub> will be 21 days after the game starts.<br>5.2 After that, the deadline in days of the k-th day is d<sub>k</sub>=3+n<sub>k</sub>+(d<sub>k-1</sub>-l<sub>k_1</sub>)/2 where n<sub>k</sub> is the number of players alive and l<sub>k-1</sub> is the length of day k-1.<br>5.3 Deadline extensions may be granted in extraordinary situations.<br>5.4 I may reduce day deadline's by up to 50% if I feel activity is low.<br>5.5 Night deadline is always 48 hours.<br>5.6 Night actions I haven't got until deadline, will either not happen or be randomized (whichever I think is more damaging to your faction). If you wish not to perform any action, I want that stated explicitly.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">6. Setup</span><br>6.1 This is a setup for 12 players.<br>6.2 There may be one regular Serial Killer.<br>6.3 There is exactly one mafia faction.<br>6.4 There may be any number of following roles: Mafia Goon, Mafia Godfather, Mafia Framer, Mafia Ninja, Mafia Traitor, Mafia/Town Roleblocker, Mafia/Town (role/alignment-)Cop, Mafia/Town Doctor, Mafia/Town Tracker, Mafia/Town Watcher, Town Jailkeeper, Town Vigilante, Town Masons.<br>6.5 There may be one other role in the game which will either be Town or Mafia aligned. You might never have seen this role before.<br>6.6 There are at least three Vanilla Townies.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">7. Flavor</span><br>7.1 I might write some flavor for this game if I feel like it. All flavor is entirely original.<br>7.2 Every part of flavor is only for my and your enjoyment and has no bearing on the game. This includes kill flavors.<br><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample Role PM's</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>Vanilla Townie wrote:</cite>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span></span>. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Special Abilities:</span><br>You have no special abilities.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win Condition:</span><br>You win iff no living player's win condition requires you to die (or nothing can prevent the same).<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mafia Goon wrote:</cite>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Goon</span></span></span></span>.

However, attempting to make yourself out to be town is very scummy. Town doesn't worry so much about other people thinking they're town.

Seriously. And I want to hear a real reason, not some garbage \"RVS\" reason.<br></div></blockquote><br>Like I said, Neruz got upset about something that shouldn't have upset town. Normally when someone calls you out on a joke that looked scummy, you say \"dude it was a joke let it go\", not \"omg you're so dumb its tempting to policy lynch you\". Scum could potentially get spooked by someone picking up on them too fast.<br><br>If others think the same way about RVS as I do, then what Hiraki did was place a semi-RVS vote. It is the kind of vote placed in the first couple pages that attacks someone's behavior during RVS and sparks discussion, but is almost never based on relevant scum finding discussion. As a result, I doubt anyone can really use Hiraki's reasoning to lynch Neruz at the end of day 1, so it wasn't a \"serious vote\" in that sense. It was, however, the most serious vote Hiraki could make with the information he had available. While I can't put words in to his mouth, I suspect he would have easily unvoted Neruz should a better case have been made against another player 2 pages down the road.<br><br>So why did Neruz get so upset about this? Go back and look at his reaction and how he worded everything. He seems so jumpy and worried."}

Coincidentally, the rushed (perhaps fake) nature of the claim seems to be to persuade the people that he is pro town. Otherwise, there would have been no need for him to claim this early, unless he had something to hide. On the other hand, he could be using this to try and prove his innocence. Leading me to the point that we should kill him as a liability, it was also a mistake for me to believe that a miller was always not informed of his role."}

Considering he intentionally spelled half the words in his post wrong while commenting on a random vote, he obviously wasn't serious and I don't see why you'd expect him to notice you voted Cecily first when you unvoted and then revoted him.  Looks more to me like a ploy to frame someone than it does like a reaction test, considering I don't see what kinds of reactions you would be looking for out of unvoting and revoting someone who OMGUSed you.  Also, the whole \"I'm town for getting us out of RVS\" seems off, whether it was followed by \"amirite\" or not.  It looks like he's trying too hard to make his post look useful.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS Hiraki</span>  On reading the next several posts, I'm getting a feel of town voting for stupid reasons and not scum looking to frame someone.  This post is just me saying things as I notice them, so I won't bother getting rid of the FoS, but I'm not really as suspicious of Hiraki after his next few posts.<br><br>ICEninja's switch from <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2711702#p2711702\" class=\"postlink\">post #35</a> to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2711972#p2711972\" class=\"postlink\">post #40</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2712212#p2712212\" class=\"postlink\">post #43</a> bothers me.  The following quote especially is troubling to me:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>is that the only reason you have a vote for me at the moment?<br><br>It's page 2 man. It isn't like I can build a full case on you.</div></blockquote><br><br>It just looks like a bit of an awkward wagon hop to me.  It's as if he saw Neruz get voted, chainsawed Hiraki to defend Neruz (I feel Neruz is town from my initial skim and my read so far, so he would be defending someone he knows is town), then realized that Neruz was a safer place for his vote.  Not liking it.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: ICEninja</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Like I said, Neruz got upset about something that shouldn't have upset town. Normally when someone calls you out on a joke that looked scummy, you say \"dude it was a joke let it go\", not \"omg you're so dumb its tempting to policy lynch you\". Scum could potentially get spooked by someone picking up on them too fast.<br><br>If others think the same way about RVS as I do, then what Hiraki did was place a semi-RVS vote. It is the kind of vote placed in the first couple pages that attacks someone's behavior during RVS and sparks discussion, but is almost never based on relevant scum finding discussion. As a result, I doubt anyone can really use Hiraki's reasoning to lynch Neruz at the end of day 1, so it wasn't a \"serious vote\" in that sense. It was, however, the most serious vote Hiraki could make with the information he had available. While I can't put words in to his mouth, I suspect he would have easily unvoted Neruz should a better case have been made against another player 2 pages down the road.<br><br>So why did Neruz get so upset about this? Go back and look at his reaction and how he worded everything. He seems so jumpy and worried.</div></blockquote><br><br>Quite interesting that ICEninja decided to turn around and defend Hiraki's post after attacking him for it just half a page earlier.

I'm not sure if it's customary to claim things like that early in a game (as Parama later claims, if I'm remembering correctly) or how common millers are here.  Not really sure what to make of the claim. (There's also controversy later in the thread about whether or not millers are possible, I think.

Voting a player immediately after that player received a vote is basically wagoning, even if those are the only two votes (a wagon has to start somewhere!).  As for your vote on Neruz, it was another example of following another player's vote.  Perhaps I should have used a word other than 'wagon' to be more clear, but I think my point was evident enough.  You followed werewolf's vote on Hiraki and then switched and followed Hiraki's vote, defending Hiraki a few posts later.  If you found Hiraki scummy 10 posts earlier, it seems quite odd for you to turn around and defend him on the basis of gaining a new scum read, especially considering you yourself said you couldn't have strong scum reads on page 2:<blockquote><div><cite>ICE wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hiraki wrote:</cite>is that the only reason you have a vote for me at the moment?</div></blockquote><br><br>It's page 2 man.

If the player claiming is scum, at best, he's trading himself for a miller.  If he's town, we get Parama-scum on a silver platter.

Your claim of miller with little or no possibility for miller in this game means your miller claim was as good as a scum claim anyway.

Not only did we mislynch, but I don't think we learned a whole lot. And yet things are already shaping up the same way today.<br><br>I looked again at each player and took some notes; and thought I might as well post them to try and prompt some discussion on some different topics. These are roughly in order of how townlike each person appears to me.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Vigilante Ventriloquist</span><br>Seems to me his Day 1 posts were the best and most pro-town by a considerable distance. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Neruz</span><br>The subject of a lot of early pressure. I didn't see anything suspicious in his play, and I thought he defended himself pretty convincingly. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Cecily</span><br>Hasn't said much, but came under a bit of pressure and responded plausibly. Has made some good points against Riceballtail.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">sordros</span><br>Again - hasn't said much, but I've agreed with most of it. I'd like to see a lot more before I mark him down as town, though.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Hiraki</span><br>He's one of the most aggressive attackers of Neruz. The reasons still seem poor to me ... but since Parama and ICEninja made very similar cases as townies, it's hard to say that the attacks are suspicious. Of the still-living players, he's the one who has disagreed most with VV. Again his reasoning on those points seems poor/wrong to me, but it's not obvious that the motivation is suspicious. I didn't like his \"unvote\" after Parama reached the lynch point. That looks doubly bad given that he wasn't even voting for Parama. Also somewhat suspicious is his often aggressive tone, occasionally stepping over the line into insults. I think both are anti-town, because they distract town players from effective mafia-hunting. But some people just behave that way online, so it's not a very clear indicator of guilt. Summary: at the moment I read Hiraki as someone who has a very high opinion of his own abilities. I haven't seen anything yet to justify that opinion, but he's not at the top of my list of suspects.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">mockingjaye</span><br>Only 1 real post so far, but made some decent points. I regard lurking as suspicious, and mockingjaye will be on my suspect list until she contributes more.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Nobody Special</span><br>Extremely difficult to read, which I don't like. I think tend to think townpeople should make it easy for other townfolk to recognise them. That also makes it harder for the mafia to fit in. Parama isn't playing that way if he's town. He resists the Neruz lynch, but without explaining why. He pursues a lynch on Parama, then switches to ICEninja - again without giving any reasons. Then NS settles on Parama when he contradicts himself, and says \"My vote will not move from here.\" This is much too inflexible, and doesn't give Parama any chance to explain his actions. I don't like the lack of transparency in NS's play, nor his lack of openness to arguments.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">werewolf555</span><br>Has said very little, and I don't understand the \"I am cool\" breadcrumb thing at all. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Riceballtail</span><br>8 posts but hardly any content. In particular, two votes for Neruz with no explanation whatsoever. My top suspect right now.<br>@Riceballtail: please explain your current vote.<br><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Overall</span><br>There are several players who haven't contributed much to the game so far. To some extent this is explainable by a lot of loud and aggressive play from other people on Day 1. But now that two of the main perpetrators have gone, I hope we'll see a better spread of activity. I'm not going to vote right now because I hope the game will slow down a little and allow time for more discussion - and a wider range of topics.<br><br>----------<br><br>I'd like to encourage other players to post a similar summary of their reads, at some point Today. I think it helps to stimulate discussion on new topics, which is good for the town. It also forces mafia to state their positions on people, and more difficult for them to switch later when the situation demands it. Finally, it helps townfolk to identify each another - which is a crucial part of mafia-hunting."}

They both did quite a bit of attacking, whether serious or in a joking manner, but they both managed to make good arguments. At this point I don't want to make a claim on either of them because there's just so much going on that it's almost impossible that we're going to be able to sort through everything that's been said and decide with certainty who is scummier. <br>I'd still like to explain why a riceballtail lynch today would be a good idea. If he is scum and we overlook it because he's been quiet, then that still means there's going to be a scum running around lynching people in the nighttime. He hasn't been contributing anything worthwhile and has only been contributing to the bandwagon. If we do happen to choose the wrong person [hopefully not] his contribution will just lynch that person faster if he continues to jump on bandwagons.

Ending D1 like we did was stupid.  The re-vote by werewolf was unnecessary; no one bothered to announce that Parama was at L-1 when they voted him; and, based on timestamps of votes, it looks like Sordros was fairly anxious to get the lynch done before the opportunity passed.  Several comments have been made on D2 about how Hiraki's unvote is bad, but no one is commenting about these things.  Does no one else have <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any</span>thing to say about the way the final votes went down?  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Any</span>thing?  <br><br>Right now I am leaning heavily towards the scum most likely being werewolf or sordros; I'm still trying to work out what exactly happened there at the end, but I can't see why werewolf would fake-hammer when he did, and I also don't understand why TOWN-sordros would quick-hammer about two minutes later and end the day when it had barely even started.   <br><br>2.  I think VV is obvious scum.  <br><br>Rereading VV\u2019s introductory post led me to three different possible conclusions, and he is scum in two of them:<br>A)\tVV is Neruz\u2019s buddy; he took a lot of time defending Neruz and attacking Hiraki and Cecily for attacking Neruz, and Parama for his fake-claim, but settled his vote on ICE for a somewhat opportunistic votehop and a scummy comment about voting for Parama with a guilty comment.<br>B)\tVV is scum and Neruz is town, and VV is defending Neruz for town cred when and if Neruz flips town.  (And since a Neruz lynch seemed inevitable at this point of the game, makes sense for scum-VV.)<br>Basically, it seems VV is doing exactly what he accuses ICE of doing: <blockquote><div><cite>VV wrote:</cite>It's as if [ICE] saw Neruz get voted, chainsawed Hiraki to defend Neruz (I feel Neruz is town from my initial skim and my read so far, so he would be defending someone he knows is town)</div></blockquote>C)    VV is town and I'm misreading him (which I don't think I am).<br><br>---<br><br>VV's gratuitous post-lynch post (#163) falls in line with the craptastic end-of-day goings on; way to distance himself from the horrible quickhammer. <br><br>In post #223 on D2, VV comes back with another generic and non-committal post which leaves him open to vote for a number of players later.  His tendency to FOS several different people and vote for one just seems like elaborate fence-sitting.  <br><br>I know VV is replacing out, but right now I want my vote on that slot; maybe his replacement will have something more substantial to contribute, but he's my most substantial read at the moment.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Vigilante Ventriloquist/Replacement</span><br><br>@Nobody Special: I'm not sure why scum would kill ICE since he was the top suspect, but this game is nothing if not unpredictable, so who knows?  <br><br>I'm more curious about the reactions of people to the kill; Neruz's dismissal of the kill having been made by a town PR (and no mention a possible SK kill) is fishy because he was the first person to even suggest the presence of a SK in the game (post 107).  He states that a town PR would have a lot of explaining to do for an ICE kill, but as ICE was one of the top suspects of D1, ESPECIALLY with Parama's town flip, then that doesn't hold water.  Neruz gets MAJOR SK points from me here.  His elaborate explanation for being framed is far-fetched and vaguely narcissistic; why would scum take the time to set him up by killing someone who was also a major suspect?  (Sorry Neruz, not meaning that personally, but from a game perspective, I see it that way.)<br><br>So basically, top scum reads are VV, Sordros, Werewolf, and Neruz (third party)."}

But I don't see an obvious mafia-motivation for them, either. I know someone will cry \"WIFOM\", but sordros's hammer is surely too crass to be a mafia hammer. Maybe there could be some 3rd party motivation ... I haven't played a game with a 3rd party, so I'm just wondering aloud here.

Again it looks too unsubtle to be true. <br><br>(B) is more plausible, but I must say I read the post as genuine and it does contain a lot of good points. VV's motivation could be what you say in (B) - but to me it seems more likely a genuine attempt to stop the reckless bandwagoning of Neruz on a very poor case.

(Note: go back and read posts 147-166 on pages 6-7; the exchange between werewolf and NS reeks of scum-wolf trying to make something up about NS, and when NS and Neruz both refute his comments, he jumps on Parama again, then back to ICE.

(For reference, please see posts 147-166.)<br><br>1) Werewolf first played dumb about the Parama/self-vote/scum-claim, in effect seeming to defend Parama at a time when his vote was already on him.  <br>2) Neruz and NS immediately called werewolf out and pointed him to the posts in question.<br>3) Werewolf then voted for Parama immediately, thus fake-hammering.  The INTENT of casting a vote at that time is apparent: he wanted to follow the leaders and lynch the liar.  The problem is he was already voting Parama.  <br>4) Because he is already voting for Parama, his immediate re-vote of him when chastised by Neruz and NS for not lynching the liar SCREAMS that he wants to appear more town by voting Parama, whom he had been tacitly defending just a few posts prior.  <br>5) Scum want to appear town.  Realizing he had had defended Parama, an admitted liar and claimed scum, werewolf HAD to do something to appear town, so he voted for Parama.  Again.  This is why he forgot about the first vote, by the way.  He was panicked and wanted to detract from his defense. (And in his defense, he seemed to be moving to point an accusing finger at NS.)<br>6) This clears NS and Neruz as scum for me (though I am not ruling Neruz out as 3rd party).  <br>7) After sordros came in and hammered, werewolf decided to jump on ICE for \"rushing\" a lynch (that was already DONE).  This post/attack was done in a zeal to appear more town.  <br><br>Basically, from the moment NS and Neruz called him out, werewolf was in panic-mode.  As town, he wouldn't have been panicking.  He wasn't the one in danger of being lynched, after all.  However, if Neruz and NS had turned around and started questioning him for defending Parama, he might have been.  SCUM are afraid of being lynched.  Not town.  His nervous energy is apparent in all of those posts--he is floundering to appear town and redirect attention away from himself, first to Parama and then to ICE.<br><br>Does anyone want to point out to me where I am wrong or maybe misinterpreting something?"}

The town have a slight statistical advantage on a lynch if there are an odd number of people alive.<br>To see why, it's pretty easy; lets say you have 2 games, 1 with 7p, 1 with 8p, both with two scum. A random lynch in the 7p game has a 2/7 chance of hitting scum, but a random lynch in the 8p game has a 2/8 (1/4) chance, which is slightly less.<br><br>It's not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">hugely</span> significant, if a town player has some form of role related information pointing to scum and are worried that they might be night killed then they should come forward with that now and we'll decide if a no lynch is still the best option. But barring that there's no particular reason why we should lynch today instead of no lynching and waiting till tomorrow, doubly so because i believe it is mylo atm.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mockingjaye wrote:</cite>I could get on board with a no lynch today, but no way do I want to go right into N3 with no discussion time.

Because the discussion won't lead to a lynch, any discussion only serves to help the scum locate any power roles that might be floating around. If we choose to no lynch, discussion at this point only harms the town.<br><br>I know it can sometimes be a hard concept to grasp that the town not doing anything and letting the scum take another night kill is sometimes the best course of action, but sometimes it is. We'd have been better off no lynching right at the start to get us to an odd number of players, since that NL would have had less discussion behind it, but unfortunately it seems no-one who understood the theory noticed we were at 12 instead of 13.<br>Now that we're at mylo we're going to have to no lynch anyway, since lynching at mylo without very compelling evidence is pretty stupid."}

I don't know from whether anyone in the Mafia team was online, and at this point, it's rather impossible to determine that.

Why wouldn't Hiraki jump on that wagon, hoping Cecily would jump back on and I (if I were scum with them) would join them for a quick victory? I can't explain their actions, but this does point to my not being a part of their group.<br><br>4) Let's see what's flipped so far: Two Town Jailkeepers, a Town Doctor, and a Town Vigilante. I'm the Town PGO. In my opinion, PGO is less of a common, widely-known role than Jailkeeper. Your opinion, I guess, is different. I guess this comes down to the perception of which role is less well-known: PGO or Jailkeeper.<br><br>5) Well, yes, which is probably why it's less used (overall), and therefore less well-known, than Jailkeeper. I wasn't thrilled when I got my Role PM, but it's what I've got, and I'm doing my best with it. <br><br>6) Why is it so odd? If no one targeted me, no one would die. VV (&amp;over9000) and I had very little interation; Neruz and I were practically at each other's throats the whole game. I doubt either would protect me. That's the two Jailkeepers; the Doc (sordros) likely would not have protected me, because, again, we had very little interaction. I would think that the Doc would at least interact with someone before protecting them.<br><br>7) Cecily, IMO, played a very poor scum game. (Hiraki, too, but that's a subject for another day.) Who knows why Cecily did anything she did? Maybe it was bussing, maybe not: the point is, we won't know until endgame, if at all.<br><br>8) I honestly can't speak to this; I don't understand balance <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at all.</span><br><br>9) Again, and I hate to keep coming back to this, but I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">deliberately</span> play badly, it just happens.

What I meant was, it would be useful to work out <span style=\"font-style: italic\">who did what</span>, especially on the first 2 nights when our vigilante was still around.<br><br>For example, I'm confused as to what must have happened on Night 1. ICEninja's death looks very unlikely to be a mafia kill, because he was the object of so much suspicion on Day 1. More likely that he was a Vigilante kill. But then: why was there no mafia kill as well?<br><br>We know that one jailkeeper (VV) was jailed by the other (Neruz) on Night 1. So presumably VV couldn't have successfully jailed anyone. So that's 2 of the 3 protective roles accounted for. And Sordros, our doctor, said this at the time of claiming: \"needless to say I have not been very successful so far\". Suggesting that he didn't think he had succeeded with any of his protections.<br><br>So why no mafia kill N1? <br><br>[Right now I wish Sordros had listed his protections, but maybe that's something we can discuss after the game.]"}

It seems pretty clear that Neruz thought NS was the last mafioso - see post 527 in particular. Neruz was a jailkeeper, and yet he died last night. I would have expected him to try to jail NS.
