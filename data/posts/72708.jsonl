I think I found the game you were referring to (Newbie 1797?) Your case in Dunker was because he couldn't give reasoning for his vote and unvoted when pressured. Although it does show that Dunker can be scummy as town, I don't think that's the same as what's happened this game; he wasn't pressured, but he voluntarily gave up his vote and stopped scumhunting while appealing to rb. <br>\n<br>\nI still agree with pretty much everything SD is saying and I have a townread there.<br>\n<br>\nI don't really like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452339#p9452339\">131</a>- it feels like busywork.

He looks like town so far and she's basically used her vote on him to avoid pushing or actually doing anything other than a few statements. I could vote there. (I have no idea why my reads are so similar to rb's.)<br>\n<br>\nI feel like NTRP isn't that suspicious. Sure, he hasn't done that much, but he took the step to call Una scum over PF and has contributed @ Dunkerdoodles.<br>\n<br>\nI'd be willing to vote in {Ciara24, Dunkerdoodles, Flavour Leaf} at this point in time.", "time": "Tue Jul 25, 2017 6:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

Since it doesn't look like he's actually checked the thread since then, being on his own wagon is NAI to me atm. However, his comments were relatively shallow and would be easy for scum to fake.

I don't really see any motivation for him doing this as either alignment. And I just checked the latest vote count . . . and he's still voting for himself. It looks like he hasn't checked the thread since then, tbh. Please unvote. And your thoughts on your wagon would be appreciated.</div></blockquote>\n\nBecause I was fucking around with Rb. I've unvoted in my last post. Yeah, my wagon came out of nowhere and dissipated just as fast, so I HIGHLY doubt there isn't scum on it. The first three on the wagon I'd probably fight for as town. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I dislike Thor's vote (182). He says he wants to lynch FL in order to give us stuff to analyze. It seems like he's willing to vote FL regardless of his alignment in order to generate those reactions. Why not vote for someone you think is actually scummy instead of voting for the sake of having a speedlynch?<br>\n<br>\nAusuka's vote (184). Seems like she's voting here because there happens to be a wagon there. She did say she had planned to vote earlier (between Eddie and Thor), though, and I agree that the self-vote was awkward and that FL's major contributions (130, 131, 151) are kinda flat. </div></blockquote>\n\nOn Thor, I dislike early games, so I kind of understand that. That being said, it's NAI for me. Thor's not a town read.<br>\n<br>\nOn the Ausuka comment, why is the self vote awkward? I obviously wasn't in the game for a bit, so me being near lynch while self voting is moot. I was fucking around because it was still early game and I didn't have really any solidified reads. Plus, I believe it was my entrance into this game, which was pseudo still in the RVS stage, so see it more in that sense of me playing around with Rb.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yeah, Unabombh's probably scum with her flip flop. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Eddie fake-hammers via a revote (191), and then declares FL to be probably town (210), and then switches his vote to . . . himself (221)). ??? I know he self-votes, so I'm not reading too much into that. What I'm confused with here is why Eddie suddenly declared FL to be town despite voting (and fake-hammering via revote) him earlier, especially when FL didn't interact with anyone between Eddie's original vote on FL and Eddie's fake-hammer and Eddie's self-vote. </div></blockquote>\n\nI'm pretty sure you answered this yourself earlier in your post. Reaction testing, and my wagon speed painted me as town likely to him. He did it off of other's interactions, so I'm a little put off by the comment of you being confused why it happened. Most of the people on my wagon moved off, so it's not even like Eddie is the only one who thought similar.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wavemode declares FL to be a mislynch (229). Um, why are you so sure here? This, in conjunction with 238 kinda make it seem like you know he's town? Why exactly do you think FL is so useful here? FL is kinda null to me. He made a couple observations (130, 131, 151) and self-voted, which is at best anti-town, especially since he was on his own L-1 wagon. Since it doesn't look like he's actually checked the thread since then, being on his own wagon is NAI to me atm. However, his comments were relatively shallow and would be easy for scum to fake. I haven't seen enough from him to actually justify lynching him, but I don't see anything here that screams town to me either.</div></blockquote>\n\nPretty much the same thing I said about Eddie here. Maybe I'm being white knighted by one, or both, of them, but if I am, there WK is working. Although, I will admit, Wave does seem like he could be potentially white knighting me, but I understand his side of Ausuka vs Wave more than I do Ausuka's. And I also have a bias towards the pokemon avatar initially, so that's saying something. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>rb moves to Sunlit Diamond, and a bunch of people follow him. Again. I'm kinda surprised that so many people are following him tbh. He throws out reads with little reasoning or explanation, and he seems to have a bunch of followers with every new vote he makes. I need to go through this later to see if there's any interesting patterns here; kinda seems like scum might be exploiting his pushes with how quickly these wagons seem to be building. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nScum are likely to be following him, because they probably feel like they can't lynch him ever, so it probably is just easier to go along when he's pushing town.", "time": "Thu Jul 27, 2017 8:16 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

Your first claim is that 'wiki tells matter according to Thor'. This claim is unfounded; Thor never said that.

I think I found the game you were referring to (Newbie 1797?) Your case in Dunker was because he couldn't give reasoning for his vote and unvoted when pressured.

I know he self-votes, so I'm not reading too much into that. What I'm confused with here is why Eddie suddenly declared FL to be town despite voting (and fake-hammering via revote) him earlier, especially when FL didn't interact with anyone between Eddie's original vote on FL and Eddie's fake-hammer and Eddie's self-vote. <br>\n<br>\nDunker hops on with a naked vote.

Why exactly do you think FL is so useful here? FL is kinda null to me. He made a couple observations (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452331#p9452331\">130</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452339#p9452339\">131</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452421#p9452421\">151</a>) and self-voted, which is at best anti-town, especially since he was on his own L-1 wagon. Since it doesn't look like he's actually checked the thread since then, being on his own wagon is NAI to me atm. However, his comments were relatively shallow and would be easy for scum to fake.

Again. I'm kinda surprised that so many people are following him tbh. He throws out reads with little reasoning or explanation, and he seems to have a bunch of followers with every new vote he makes.

He's playing the town strategy that he espoused years ago. He wasn't complaining that he was getting scumread for following the wiki.

Your first claim is that 'wiki tells matter according to Thor'. This claim is unfounded; Thor never said that. Yes, I agree that wiki tells are not the only way to scumhunt, but Thor was linking articles that he wrote describing what he believes to be pro-town and anti-town behavior.

He's doing exactly what he said he's doing - he's voting for his scumread, and said that instead of voting for their main read, people should try to consolidate on a secondary read so that we can use the time we have productively.

Why is Eddie so high on your list? If you're good with lynching Ausuka, why are you not voting there?</div></blockquote>\n\n(I'll get to the rest of your stuff after this):<br>\n<br>\nThose are exactly the sort of questions I ask when I'm trying to figure out people's motivations. I was having trouble understanding the Thor/Eddie thing, so I wanted to talk to Eddie more about it, but he wasn't really responding to my questions. I explained above why I'm feeling better about him now. Ciara showed up, so I figured since we were both around I'd try to talk to her. Since I wasn't really understanding Eddie, I was hoping she'd be able to explain why she had Eddie so high. Tbh, her answer (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9465849#p9465849\">626</a>) was kinda weird. If you know you have trouble reading people, I don't get why you'd artificially give them townreads? Like, her reasons for townreading eddie/rb were weird and bad, and she basically admitted to making them up. And she never really tried to sort them or like anyone else for that matter. And I wanted to know why she didn't vote Ausuka/MM if she was good with lynching him. Kinda felt like she wasn't putting her money where her mouth was, like Ciara was trying to show she approved of the wagon without actually contributing to it.<br>\n<br>\nAnd she replaced out just after I pushed her on these things. <br>\n<br>\nAnd today Mulch was all sorts of weird, and pushed a scumread on me for BS reasons. Like having a gutread that I'm scum for saying goodbye to TB when we signed up to play together is just ridiculous. Yes, I get that it was a gutread, but since I'd have said the exact same thing to him if I were scum, that post was NAI, and deciding I had to be scum and that me and TB couldn't be partners because of that was just reachy and bad and didn't really make sense.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I disliked how he kept on insisting that I was 'angry'. Yeah, I was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">annoyed </div>with him. I don't really get where he got <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">angry</div> from, tbh. And by insisting that other variables are irrelevant (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473087#p9473087\">1153</a>), he delegitimized any other explanation (like the fact that I was disappointed that I didn't get to play with the dude I signed up to play with) for my goodbye post, and reduced it to somehow being supporting evidence of a BS gutread. <br>\n<br>\nAnd I didn't really understand how MM's reaction to that whole business meant that MM was trying to save *Thor* (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473084#p9473084\">1152</a>). Like, it would at least make some sort of sense to say scum!MM was trying to save scum!me, but dragging Thor into that mess kinda felt like Mulch was trying to link MM to his Thor scumread, for pretty much BS reasons as far as I can tell. How does agreeing with me about this mean that MM was trying to save *Thor*? Like, there's no connection there.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Mulch</span>", "time": "Sun Jul 30, 2017 6:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

I think I explained what I was trying to get at with these questions above, but if you want more from me, let me know.  <br>\n<br>\nAll of my on-site games:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=71332\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=71332</a> (Newbie 1787, scum, played with TB, Paul, MM)<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=71874\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=71874</a> (Newbie 1797, town, modded by TB, played with Paul and Dunker)<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=72357\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=72357</a> (Micro 724, scum, modded by TB, played with Mulch)<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=72576\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=72576</a> (Micro 730, modded by TB, played with Eddie, ended on Saturday and overlapped with this game a bit).<br>\n<br>\nAnd now your wall (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9461469#p9461469\">501</a>)<br>\n(sorry, I know it's been a while, and the game exploded since then. I've been busy).<br>\n<br>\nI think I mostly agree with you about your wagon. I think that scum were taking advantage of rb's early pushes in order to create momentum for wagons that might not have otherwise taken off. I just thought it was strange that yours went to L-1 *and* dissipated within a short period of time. Like, if you're scum, why wasn't there any sort of counterwagon? I mean, one formed eventually, but it was formed by the very same people who promoted yours (ie rb and eddie). So unless they're scum bussing/distancing you (and I'm *pretty* sure Eddie is town, not 100% on rb, but he's also a townlean), it's very odd that a wagon on scum!you dissipated with very little scum interference. And if you're town, why didn't scum take advantage of the quickwagon to get a mislynch? Why did they allow another wagon to form altogether? Like the formation of your wagon was weird, and that's why I took the time to analyze it. <br>\n<br>\nEddie I was confused about because I couldn't really tell what he was doing; like he's one of those players who don't really explain himself, which makes it hard for me to understand him. But, the more I play with him, the more I realize he does random, semi-inscrutable things in order to generate reactions which he can then analyze. So, with that in mind, his role in your wagon makes sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yeah, I thought your self-vote was awkward, cuz I think *all* self-votes are awkward. If you're town, I think it's anti-town to self-vote, and I dislike them greatly.<br>\nI also thought it was interesting that you chose to comment on the fact that I found your self-vote awkward, but neglected to respond to the fact that I thought your attempts at game-solving were kinda shallow. Like, you just kinda glossed over the fact that I was at best null-reading you for that. <br>\n<br>\nI think that's everything.

I think it is logical to believe that rb is of my alignment. <br>\n<br>\nMarioManiac4: the moment Ausuka changed into MM4 my read of the slot improved; reads were explained well (and, I think, generally good) Engagement with suspicious slots, such as UnaBombaH and Mulch, I liked; the emphasis was on drawing out useful information and encouraging participation.<br>\n<br>\nNotTheRealPaul: early game, Paul was very aware of the assumptions he brings into play, which requires an effort I don't think scum would make. His questions have been good and reads, and especially changes of opinion, are explained clearly. Obviously pro-town behaviour does not necessarily indicate alignment with town, but I am comfortable with this read.<br>\n<br>\nUnaBombaH: UnaBombaH has more engagement with wagons than most, and this, combined with post #284, makes him appear a useful player in my eyes. The read posts on Ausuka and Sunlit Diamond indicate a towny mindset in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nskitter30: I had a favourable opinion of skitter, as I said, from the interactions after Ausuka voted for DunkerDoodles early on Day 1. It was useful, early, serious content, clearly attempting to move the game forward without the dangers of dogma and joviality. The catching-up was also good, but later on she seems noncommittal and slightly lurkerish? I will admit there is some gut in that, without which she would be higher in my reads list. <br>\n<br>\nwavemode: I was having trouble sorting wavemode earlier in the game, but a few posts here and there (#314 and #1286) I think come from a town mindset.<br>\n<br>\nDunkerDoodles: no offence intended, but probably the least memorable player in the game for me so far, which makes me think they are lurking actively. Not a good sign<br>\n<br>\nEddie Cain: irreverent half the time, useless the other. Questions have been shallow. It seems like they are trying to insert themselves into everything without having much of an impact.<br>\n<br>\nFlavor Leaf: pushes early Day 1 on spurious issues and does nothing with the 'pressure' they claim to be exerting. After unvoting themselves, they claim to have a few weak townreads and ask little that might solidify these or produce some scumreads. They also seem unusually concerned with their wagon after it dissipated.<br>\n<br>\nthor665: thor has seemed very worried about how he looks and where he sits in relation to other players. The conflicts he has involved himself in have distracted us from useful play and disinterested plenty of players, and this is worse when his request to compromise wagon early Day 1 is considered.

Like, I've been part of too many games where deadline hammers are a thing, and they've tended to be on town because people are in a rush and just lynch anybody cuz they're on a deadline.

I hate the language he uses, and I hate the arguments he's gotten into because they distract from our primary goal of finding scum, but despite all of that, I think he's town. <br>\n<br>\nAnd if SD died via scum and not a vig kill, I'm also confused af why scum!Thor would ever kill SD here tbh.

I actually dislike it on re-read compared to what I first thought, because it actually looks really, really awkward like scum is trying to engage in banter/jabs but not quite hitting the mark. Posts that I don't like:<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9448867#p9448867\">73</a> and the follow-up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9448933#p9448933\">77</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9449413#p9449413\">82</a><br>\n<br>\nIt bothers me that it took him hours to follow-up his reasons for a naked vote, when the game was basically in RVS. The game was kind of slow-paced here but I expect a town player would try and then inject some of their very-early thoughts into the game and keep it moving along. Instead the naked vote just looks like, \"weak player detected, let's jump on it\". <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9449151#p9449151\">80</a> makes me think this is the case also.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9453631#p9453631\">175</a> is a really big red flag. Why would having similar reads in the early game make two players town together, let alone when you're scumreading Ausuka so strongly? Wouldn't it be more likely to think Ausuka and myself were _scum_ together since he scumreads Ausuka? But he doesn't even remotely go with this possibility and takes no notice of me (notice that at this point, I've had wavemode on townread also, and he doesn't ever think to question it but simply goes along with it). <br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454402#p9454402\">211</a> is just bad. Picking a scumteam ~200 posts into the game? It just says that if wavemode is town, he's pushing way too far into potential associative tells. At no point prior to this can I find where he's expressed that he thinks Sunlit + Thor are scum by the way. What I'm taking note of here though, is how wavemode seems to be almost trying to copy my tone tit-for-tat. I make bold statements and push a scumteam theory, and he immediately does it right after - given that I gave him a townread upon his entrance, it looks like he's actually imitating me (consciously or unconsciously) and picking up on my tone/attitude in some way. Not sure what this means really, but an interesting thought nonetheless. <br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454746#p9454746\">238</a> I kind of wonder what wavemode was seeing that was so useful at this point - I'd like him to expand on that.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456738#p9456738\">296</a> is an interesting focus on scum perspective here. It strikes me as really odd that his thoughts automatically drift to the scumchat and how the game is shaping up from the perspective of the scum. This is in conjunction with his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9449151#p9449151\">80</a> where he also brings it up. I honestly can't recall where I've seen town act like this at such an early point in the game, it's just weird as fuck and I think it's scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456738#p9456738\">296</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457080#p9457080\">314</a> don't logically track with me either, and Thor's questioning is warranted. The fact that wavemode is opportunistic on one wagon and not another is interesting, especially when his reasons for townreading Flavor Leaf are pretty average at best, and he's also contested how people could townread Ausuka. It might be reading too far into things too, but I find it pretty bad that SD did end up flipping town after this - but that still begs the question of why SD was killed, we'll have to get to that. <br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460359#p9460359\">402</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460361#p9460361\">403</a> kinda leave a bad taste in my mouth, because it's like he's being serious that activity is NAI but then 403 is almost mockery of that idea? It almost reads as a defence of PerfectFifth/ThinkBig, and one that strikes me as odd. Does he not agree that it's bad for someone to be that inactive? Why? It's like wavemode here is actually trying to imply it's a good thing? I didn't actually make any judgement beyond \"this is bad\" but he seems oddly touchy over it.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460569#p9460569\">414</a> is pretty good, I don't see all that much issue with it. Giving credit where it's due.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9461174#p9461174\">493</a> is aggressive and feels town. Could be that wavemode just has awkward RVS game. One problem though - he plays like newbscum but when Ausuka becomes MarioManiac (not a newb) he doesn't seem to re-evaluate at all. Not necessarily scummy, but definitely an issue in continuity. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9461309#p9461309\">497</a> is also good.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: 631</span> is 50/50, i don't really expect anyone to agree with it because people have trouble believing non-intuitive things even if they're objectively correct <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9466039#p9466039\">633</a> feels downhill. i still don't really understand wavemode's point about shrinking my pool to two people and the way he doubles down on it later on in just feels even worse in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9466274#p9466274\">641</a>. it doesn't logically track that he would agree with a Thor push, as well as have him in his scum-pool but then suddenly latch onto this and think it's not a good push (didn't he just have him in top3 scumreads?). I can't really explain it either since it really, really looks like wavemode's exact lynchpool in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9466379#p9466379\">643</a> is...2 people? SD + Ausuka? Someone correct me if I've read this wrong but that's really what it looks like here, so it feels even WORSE on re-read.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473448#p9473448\">1185</a> pings me pretty badly - like he's so elated by the way Mulch is pushing on MM4. It actually feels to me like it comes from a scum perspective delighted that a town player is doing their work for them.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473476#p9473476\">1189</a> is like the decline of wavemode personified.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9474378#p9474378\">1256</a> it seems like he pretty much just townreads whoever has reads that agree with his - and at no point prior to this does he even interact with Ciara _AT ALL_ - but suddenly he is \"pretty sure Ciara was town\" when Mulch starts pushing on a read he agrees with. Feels awfully like confbias or just outright scum.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9475492#p9475492\">1314</a> again just seems so bad. It reads to me as pretty obstructionist and unnecessarily defensive over a slot that he's out of nowhere decided is town (for reasons that can't be found, and no interactions between wavemode+Ciara exist that I can see that would indicate wave townreads them strongly)<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9475801#p9475801\">1377</a> is just ridiculous. fake dayvig is like the biggest running gag ever on this forum. I find it almost hard to believe someone could last 2 months here and not see it happen once. Still, maybe he's literally never seen it - but he seems to know what a 'desperado' is and also *grabs popcorn* immediately? If he has no idea or thinks it might be real - then wouldn't he like, comment on it? Whenever I see a fake dayvig and there's someone who falls for it in some way, there's SHITLOADS of confusion, but wavemode simply presents detached amusement, and yet is surprised that MM4 doesn't take it seriously and thinks it's scummy that he <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">didn't claim</div>. I actually find this post to be almost fucking impossible to believe as coming from town!wavemode.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9475948#p9475948\">1404</a> again feels like either Thor is a buddy OR he's pocketing Thor. Early game I'm not someone anyone ever fucks with, and Eddie presented with the same swagger right out of the gate. So it makes his early-game Thor scumread feel very appeasing, but when he sees a chink in the armour he suddenly distances from that read and takes potshots at Eddie's credibility. Again - doesn't wavemode themselves have a read on Thor? Or is his entire reading of people just based on <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">what other people say?</div> because it really seems like the bolded, based on how many times wavemode will say, \"that case isn't right so i disagree with your read\" - it's like he has no agenda beyond pushing his own reads and whether or not he agrees with a read is pretty much just based on whether or not the read matches <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">his own</div> agenda, without really trying to read the slot in question himself and seeing if he agrees - as most town players will do.<br>\n<br>\n[/post]1734 is literally awful and reads like a literal fucking scumclaim, even on re-read[/post]<br>\n<br>\n~FIN~<br>\n<br>\nDiscuss.", "time": "Thu Aug 03, 2017 10:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

{"number": 1966, "id": "9491334", "user": "wavemode", "user_id": "29971", "content": "Okay back on my computer. As promised I will give my current outlook on the game. I suppose I must put a bit more effort into putting my thoughts into words now that I'm the top wagon.<br>\n<br>\nLean town:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Una</div> - Una's posts in this game show pretty genuine analysis. If he's scum he's got me fooled. That said, maybe I'm just biased toward Umbreons.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Thor665</div> - Thor's actions and pushes haven't seemed scum-motivated to me and he has approached this game logically. This opinion is weaker now that SD flipped town but that's not really enough for me to completely change my mind here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">skitter30</div> - Er this one's weak tbh but I've just generally seen good town-motivated mindset coming from a lot of her posts so I've had a soft townread here since the early game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">wavemode</div> - This guy's been super towny. I nominate him as town leader. I think someone is going to need to calmly dumb down for me why this mulch thing is such a big deal because I'm not quite getting it. I townread mulch's early posts as well as ciara's, then I didn't really feel like anyone was making compelling arguments for me to scumread him so I stuck with him as town, then he died and flipped town, so I was right. Which part of this makes me scum? I guess I'm mainly addressing Paul since he said he really liked me for town yesterday then is now calling me a scummy scumfuck, so I'm curious what changed so drastically.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flavor Leaf</div> - Uhhh, tbh this guy's still been in my townpool because I'm confirmation biased about the quick wagon. Looking purely logically, though, he has certainly been showing effort to crack the game open and gather information so I'm content to keep him here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Eddie Cane</div> - Obviously I disagree with his reads but overall he seems similar to FL in his attempts to cut through the BS talk and actually solve the game. Somewhat aggressive but he seems to have a willingness to evaluate the game from all angles.<br>\n<br>\nNull:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">frog</div> - As several people have pointed out, town!TB goes inactive all the time so I'm not sure why so much suspicion immediately appeared surrounding him. As for his replacement I don't have any confident read on frog as of yet. Posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9476400#p9476400\">#1533</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9490743#p9490743\">#1955</a> seem towny, but are sort of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">obviously</div> towny so they feel easily fakeable, if that makes sense.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dunkerdoodles</div> - Votes strangely, sheeps strangely, doesn't seem to care what people think about it. Leaning slightly town but I must admit this slot is worth keeping an eye on.<br>\n<br>\nLean scum:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NTRP</div> - I think I'm possibly biased against people who call me a scummy scumfuck. Dunno how I feel about this slot overall, just seems to fade into the background and not contribute much to solving the game. Type of scum who is easy to overlook. Could just be his play style but I need to understand the motivation behind some of his actions because right now I have a bad gut read on most of his recent sheeping.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MM4</div> - This is a more unpopular opinion than I realized it was going to be but yeah I still think Ausuka's scumminess was agenda-driven and not playstyle-related. And MM4 was uncharacteristically aggressive after mulch pushed on him, and what was scummy was not even just the aggression, but the weird automatic certainty he had that mulch had a scum agenda, for weird automatic reasons. It was the exact same thing Ausuka did to me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">rb</div> - Okay so I've already said that I feel like rb's pushes have felt scum-motivated and he has a tendency to automatically scumread and berate people who merely disagree with his logic, or whose logic he disagrees with. The other thing was his argument that we should kill Thor even if he's town. And on reread I also really don't like his push on mulch and his unwillingness to present any case when I asked. Just seems right in line with his stupid \"let's just kill the most useless person\" thing. If you always just kill the most useless person I think you almost always hit town when you're playing with experienced scum. (That said, mulch wasn't even useless if you actually read his posts... he was just town. Sounds more to me like, let's kill anyone who disagrees with me so I get to lead unobstructed.)", "time": "Fri Aug 04, 2017 1:26 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=1950", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

That was genuine. I have wanted some answers out of you at various stages of today, and you have either not been forthcoming or you have given answers that are less than ideally precise. Let me be clear as I can: if you are town, we want to co-operate. I have been trying, and although you are evasive there has been enough doubt in me that, maybe, you want to as well.<br>\n<br>\nHere is what I find strange. You refuse to elaborate on your read of rb, despite there being concerns about buddying. You give a noncomittal answer about how strong your read of rb is, despite at least two players asking you for it. You engage in night speculation, in which rb features to the point where his lack of dying is the focal point of the post. You ask questions of rb to answer whether rb as scum would have killed you last night. I doubt I am the only one to notice all this, and, to me, it suggests that you are party to something the rest of us are not.<br>\n<br>\nI think you are attempting to use rb to stay alive and control the gamestate. I think you are trying to mislead and confuse town. I think you are setting up scenarios about alignments that you will exploit later in the game. I do not think you are trying to gamesolve, I do not think that you are assisting rb in his effort to read others, and I do not buy your responses to my questions.<br>\n<br>\nThe offer of co-operation is not going away, but I am going to need greater effort and, in particular, greater transparency, before I am convinced you are not a good lynch candidate.", "time": "Sat Aug 05, 2017 5:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=2100", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

I'll even push some stuff from today to think he's not scum. His post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9483871#p9483871\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and the fact he did it really early in the day comes off as town to me. I don't think he'd bring it up so early and not yet under pressure if he was scum. He also lowkey protected me in Day 1 when my wagon was forming, and I don't feel he had to. I also agreed with his MM read of not being as obv town as everyone though. Like I said before, he could be WK'ing me, but if he is, then he's done a decent job with it because I don't think he's scum. There doesn't seem much a point to try and do that to me, though, since I'm really not a huge presence in this game. I'm trying to be! I feel like I do a good amount when I do show up!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo Skitter's post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9485510#p9485510\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, about Thor/Wave/Frog stuff...<br>\n<br>\nYou said you have no idea why Thor would ever kill SD, well, in general, that's a reason why he would do it, as has been explained in this game already. Wave used a similar thing as a defense, and I think Wave's seemed genuine. I don't have a strong read on Thor either way. I can see him flipping either way, so I'm trying to POE it out, and find scum elsewhere. I think a scum flip somewhere would make me feel more confident in reading Thor. Also, as I said before...Frog is likely town. <br>\n<br>\nSo you went and made this post in response to Eddie because you only agreed with one of his reads basically?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9485609#p9485609\" class=\"postlink\">Una's post on Eddie</a><br>\n<br>\nI'm scum reading Una.

Besides, why do you think I should be providing massively detailed reads lists as a matter of course when you can't even be bothered to properly ISO one player? Let's call it 'fluff'.

I've isod lots of players btw, so idk where that line comes from, but sure, keep trying to discredit me. it's not \"complete and informative\"... scratch that. it's informative. reporting on information instead of analyzing. hey Thor, found a wiki tell for us to use! you said it yourself, it's informative, it's not analytical and stating things about a bunch of people IS fluff.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: you're getting lynched today. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">", "time": "Tue Aug 08, 2017 5:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=2475", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

I've done some meta diving of Mulch lately, and really, as scum, Mario played the best possible way to make sure the mulch slot got lynched.

But given this player list, I'm not sure. Knowledge on his play? I've seen enough games/been in enough with him but not really any as of recent.<br>\n<br>\nNTRP is always called scum and pushed. He's an awcward player and I've seen him pushed by scum. Even I've pushed him as scum before.<br>\n<br>\nDunker I'm not too sure on and Frog might be town here. But yeah I'll work them out later.<br>\n<br>\nWe'll see with Leaf and Dunker though.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no, ask away. \\o/", "time": "Tue Aug 08, 2017 11:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=2650", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

Notice how I kept dodging whoever it was (frog) who wanted my specific read on rb? I thought I saved him probably. remember when I said specific things had to happen for him to be scum? those specific things was him not being saved and scum killing sd. I was obvious the whole time, the only reason i played like I did was to five scum no shot of thinking I was doc. I am good at prs and it shows.<br>\n<br>\nNight 2. i target rb again. frankly, this was a hard choice. i was pissed at the entire game and couldn't think of a likely nk. after enough analysis (Paul knows just how much effort I put into my night actions) I decided rb was the likely kill. any player with a brain would know that slot was town.  it was never getting lynched. it had an unknown factor via a sub which scum who are winning don't want. it was the best nk I could think of. so, I saved rb. then come day 3, twoinamillion is one of the less skilled beginners I've played with, but regardless I know he's town so I try to keep him from being stupid. scum know their kill was just blocked, so of course I can't be obvious about it like many are with their prs. i make sure to mention how he could be scum (do this after both saves) so scum don't believe I know theyre town as the doctor would. i decide to fish for scum by suggesting a mass claim, ensuring I go first so it never actually happens to gauge reactions. scum quickhammers and the day ends immediately. awesome. <br>\n<br>\nwe enter night 3. at this point this is one of the worst games I've been in and I'm thinking of subbing. i decide to stick it out and not play with most of you for a while. this save was the ahrdest.none of you as scum except maybe vedith are good enough to know that double targeting actually works in a scenario like that. i think about other possible targets. frog comes to mind; if scum want to lynch me they'll want to frame me. frog is a claimed pr as well and scum Will know they're town. so, after thinking for hours, I go frog confidently. turned out to be right call. now we have frog-me-rb slot in MY town block and a third of the game is town to me which is nice. the issue is that scum know someome blocked them twice and will be doc hunting. that's why frog is tossed into my pool earlier despite me not trying to push him. if I confidently townread him even for fake reasons scum Will get the hint and I'll die tn. of course, now I will anyways, but it's fine. I'll solve the game today I think. I'll iso flavor for partners after. next post will get into exactly why flavor is obvious scum and if you vote me over him as town you should quit mafia", "time": "Tue Aug 15, 2017 2:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=2950", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

I want to hear a scenario where none of them is (Thor claimed there is a chance?).<br>\nWhy?<br>\nBecause FL claims he got a \"no result\" from Eddie. Frog confirms that no one blocked FL last night, so the only scenario where a Loyaltown!CopFlavorLeaf gets the result, is when Eddie is scum. Scum FlavorLeaf could just speak the truth (loyal scum gets \"no result\" from town!Eddie), and scum!frog could lie that no one blocked FL. Realize that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">none of them as townies have reason to lie.</div><br>\n<br>\nI have trouble basing everything on TiaM's \"claim\", but I am going to trust it for now, because I do not think scum!TiaM has any reason not to claim night immunity for N1. I was sort of afraid of a BP-claim, but it didn't come.<br>\n<br>\nWhy was it so important for me to know that TiaM wasn't BP/commuter etc N1?<br>\nBecause IF I assumed that Eddie was scum, visiting TiaM for a NK (and for specifically that) N1, there had to be a reason why TiaM (rb) didn't die.<br>\nI wanted to eliminate this simple step before continuing.<br>\n(There also has to be an explanation for Sunlit dying N1, and we should be fairly certain now that it was a scum-kill. SK was novice and I think most agreed that Vig could be too much)<br>\n<br>\nNow I have already said I don't believe there to be any more protective/NK-immune roles other than Dunkers confirmed commuter, and either FL with his roleblockings and such or Eddie with Doc'ing.<br>\nIt just feels excessive. So if you want to discredit this post or me overall, this is the first point to attack.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> <br>\n<br>\nLogical path A: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Eddie is a town doctor</div>. Notice that this path also suggests that frog is a town watcher, because Eddies claim was first, and frogs claimed night-actions support it. In this path Eddie is town, so scum!frog has absolutely no reason to back him up, when he could just avoid claiming anything on Eddies actions, rather than confirm them. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So if Eddie is town doc, frog is town watcher.</div><br>\nEddies first action as Doc is to visit rb, and that also makes sense to me. He would want to protect the most obvious townie to him, and the most valuable player in his eyes. This path makes 100% sense to me as is and could also be the explanation for the consecutive no-kills. (as rb and frog are both very believable targets to me on those specific nights)<br>\n<br>\nLogical path B: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Eddie is a scum doctor</div>. Now this is the weirdest possibility to me personally, but since it is allowed in normal games, I covered it in my mind. This would mean that N1 Eddie tried to save TiaM as scum too. I have reason to believe that unlimited-Doc in scums hands would want to keep his partner alive in a game where SK/Vig is a possibility, and therefore I believe that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">if scum!Eddie saved TiaM -&gt; TiaM is his scumbuddy</div>. The chances of getting towncred from saving town!TiaM N1 from a kill, from a role he didn't know existed for sure? Not reasonable, considering his partner could use the saving in the 1% chance his partner gets capped by the same potential Vig. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So scum!Eddie saving TiaM would surely mean scum!TiaM.</div> This is the least likely path in my mind, but there is a chance, and in the case where Eddie would be forced to flip a scum doc, we would definitely need to go for TiaM next, so easy game from there.<br>\n<br>\nLogical path C: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flavor Leaf is a town JOAT.</div>", "time": "Wed Aug 16, 2017 9:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=3075", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

I have already stated in path B that IF Eddie is scum!doctor, I believe TiaM is almost automatically his buddy, so this would mean frog is town. It is possible though, that scum!frog claimed that FL wasn't r-blocked last night to strongly implicate his scumbuddy Eddie, and thus gain a huge distance in the scenario where Eddie gets lynched. Yet again though, I feel like this is more sub-optimal for scum!frog.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">In a more likely scenario scum!frog lied about FL not being roleblocked.</div> Understand, that this would still give town!FL the same result about a town!Eddie. This is also probably the worst scenario for Town moving forward, because there is no way for us to confirm it today, and it would mean that scum has a roleblocker to use for later nights. This also means, that if we lynch Eddie and he flips town, there is still a chance for FL to also flip town. And frog can't be made to fake his watch-action for next night, because he has claimed an odd-night role..<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This scenario is also only likely to me when frog is scum, because town!Leafs night actions do not explain missed nightkills.</div> Doc-Eddies night actions do.<br>\n<br>\nLogical path D: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flavor Leaf is a scum (JOAT)</div> This claim makes the least sense combined with scum!alignment (with the given night actions). So scum!FL would have lied about them, or fake-claimed altogether. Therefore this isn't a scenario worth even observing, unless we have a rolecop investigation on him that confirms his role (?). JOAT could do so many things on any given night, that we have no reason to speculate what scum!FLeafJOAT would have done in this game so far.<br>\n<br>\nWhere does this leave me?<br>\nAssume that we are left with 50/50 about FL and Eddie. Assume that we can accept either of their roles to be true.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If we lynch Eddie</div> we risk losing our Doc, who could potentially save someone on a future night (though not very likely anymore). And in the scenario where he flips town, we still don't know <br>\nwhich lied, frog or FlavorLeaf. What we then have to value is whether scum has a roleblocker (frog is scum) or FlavorLeaf lied (is much scum).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If we lynch FlavorLeaf</div> we don't lose any night actions (all have been used). In the scenario where he flips town, we still don't know which lied, frog or Eddie. At this point we have to value whether scum has a roleblocker (frog is scum), or Eddie is scum (as proved by LoyalLeafs flip.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IF WE WERE TO LYNCH ANYONE ELSE, LETS SAY FOR EXAMPLE FROG</div> we don't lose any night actions the following night (not odd-night). In the scenario where frog flips town, we get confirmation on FL not being roleblocked. And this leaves scum as either FL+? or Eddie+TiaM. And since I have a hunch that we still have an investigative role unclaimed (which is why I didn't want massclaims yet!!) we can confirm either pair the following night. Also the scum would have to leave our doc alive (in the scenario where Eddie is doc) or confirm us that FL is scum.

I'm now going to operate under the assumption that I'm getting mislynched for the first time in over 20 town games and I am normally confident but honestly with this game I don't care anymore. nobody even attempted to reply to my explained play, it was skipped over even though i have literally played around everything I've said and have the evidence to support it. nobody actually cares to read it, so whatever.<br>\n<br>\nflavor is such obvious scum im dumbfounded how people aren't seeing it and nobody is even trying to say WHY I'm scummier.  first off, his claim is not a role that would ever be made. two protective and an investigative isn't a combination that will ever happen. he has admitted to roleblockong a town pr because he is the mafia roleblocker and wanted an out. since apparently thor and frog are experienced, they, along with vedith, apparently are going to pretend they don't have the experience to know this combination is not a thing. awesome. let's ignore thst for a second. lets also ignore an investigative and two protective not only doesn't exist with a doc but it also somewhat contrasts with even night watcher. let's also ignore flavors magical explanation for the lack of a nk last night is that scum recruited a traitor. let's ignore how exceedingly rare recruitable traitors are - after all, nobody here gets setups anyways. let's ignore how flavor is doing exactly what I said by killing frog since he clearly intended to fake a guilty on me. let's ignore thst the only reason town isn't losing is because I've stopped two kills. let's ignore that rb is obv town regardless and thinking he's scum is laughable. lets ignore flavor shoved the mislynch of a vig down our throats. yes, Mario flipped sk. no, mafia didn't know he was sk and therefore to them it was another mislynch. remember how flavor leaf quickhammered a town pr yesterday before a claim immediately after the 5th vote? sounds pretty scummy, right? let's ignore that too because this game is special. he clearly would've had to explain that, unless he was going to get lynched anyways... awfully convenient he returns from that with a guilty. let's ignore that. i townread flavor up until day 3, and even day 3 it wasn't a strong sr or anything. I'm not going to pretend his earlier content is obvious scum to me, even though mulch/Mario clearly saw it. there is obvious stuff with hindsight I can bring up if needed. why should you vote flavor over me if we ignore every other logical reason? i have single handedly carried town with rb getting fed up with you. my actions make perfect sense and so does my play which I went in great detail to explain. i coudlnt try hard before today at risk of nk. there were no other good buffers. if you seriously think I'm scum after rereading my play with what i said in mind, I don't expect you to listen to any of the above. <br>\n<br>\nfirst of all. twoinamillion. you're new. and I mean NEW. in some dead pt you said you setup specced having never played forum mafia before or something like that. you need to listen to me. your claim might not help game solve, nom you are town so you claim last. your claim is needed for swtup spec purposes. we need to be able to analyze how balanced the setup is. the nrg approves the same level balance roughly and with a pr refusing to claim you are only hurting town. the nks are already lined up, me if I'm not mislynched today and frog after/if I'm lynched. you have nothing to lose. i saved you, and rb is one of the towniest games I've ever seen. i know you're town. you need to claim though. and another thing: you are being a dumbass when it comes to voting me. sorry, its true. vca is one of the most manipulatable things there are for scum and any good player will tell you that. ask around if you don't believe me.  not only that, but ironically, flavours voting is worse than me ANYWAYS. day 1 I voted the mislynch who self hammered while I was offline after being ran up while offline... and flavor was voting the counter wagon aka sd... who was ALSO TOWN. why is being on one town lynch worse than the other? this is ignoring I was not even supporting said lynch strongly and again it happened while I was offline.  day 2 he lynches sk. THAT'S NOT A SCUM LYNCH FOR VCA PURPOSES. you have to remember scum had literally no idea an sk existed. any potential scum that pushed Mario do not get rewarded for hitting an sk. actually, they do, because sk hurts scum as much as town (i don't remember actual stats). day 3, I vote dunker explicitly for a claim which I say. flavor hammers him the post after the l1 vote. no warning, intent, not even a fake accident. yet you're voting me for my votes? seriously dude. i get you're new. i have nothing against you as a person. I'm not even going to omgus you because you're lock town. please, please, try thinking logically. you need to put more thought here because this is probably whether scum wins or loses.<br>\n<br>\ntoday, after we finish our mass claim with rb slot going last you can lynch in me and flavor. first of all, after I flip town you powerlynch flavor and then powerlynch wave. do not discuss your reads for the final scum assuming the game doesn't end.  dont let scum know who they should night kill. in the very off chance wave flips town (I'm close to certain he's scum) Paul is scum.  i genuinely can't force myself to see wave as town and that more than likely makes him scum. whhats cute is in 1786 flavor even acknowledges wave saving him. if people actually see logic and I know my effort won't be wasted, and we get some intents to vote fl, I'll case wave and rip the fuck into him.<br>\n<br>\nmy words to town after my likely mislynch. NEVER EVER LYNCH FROG AND TWOINAMILLION HERE. scum is in {flavor, wave, Paul, thor, una, gr}. flavor is undeniably one of them I don't have the time to hard iso for the partners atm even though I need to today since I'm getting lynched or nkd. i am fairly sure una is town because I doubt he takes his push on me earlier and defends me now. i need game replacement to start posting because he's the last hope I have for an experienced player (hey flavor I'm pocketing him xD) to set y'all straight. could be scum, haven't seen his scum game in fucking ages but I don't believe idling is a scum tell for him. hope his catchuo is good. my main reason for townreading him and thor is that I think the team is flavor/wave/paul. the last spot is the tossup. Paul has only been sheeping me on some parts... flipped town. that soesnt mean much as a stand alone. notice how he was on flavor and wave defended him? classic spreading. Paul voting me today is the most damning. he knows the quality of my play as prs, knows the quality of my reads, and the quick vote of me with almost nothing said means he's probably scum. i will guarantee the team is {flavor}, {wave/paul} and someone else including one of them. I'll try reading them as a team if I have time at some point. seriously listen to me. i get there's scenarios where i didnt heal rb n2. he is still town hard and if you lynch that slot... lol.<br>\n<br>\nand as for all of my omgus. i have nothing against any of you, please don't feel bad about my posts, its not personal. i am used to playing with people who are a lot more experienced. i don't know who's actually playing horribly until post game. we can talk about it there if you want. the thing is, even if you did play horrible, its fine. lynching me is fine. people start somewhere. i havent been mislynched in like 20 town games and usually im confident but here i think my lynch will hapoen. thats perfectly ok. please actually learn from this game though. don't go to post and say \"well Eddie swore a lot and it's his fault he got lynched\". say \"damn, I fucked up. I'll take what went wrong here to my future games\". that much is enough to make this a bad game vs you a bad player. you can call this paragraph ate if ya want but I don't enjoy making games toxic as I have been a bit.", "time": "Wed Aug 16, 2017 12:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=3075", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

Una's claim is literally the only full role in this game besides the doctor, when Wave is a flipped even night tracker, and both Frog/GR claimed odd night investigative. Also, Una posted about willing to \"hear you out\" after Mario said he could have confirmed himself as town, when Una knew that he wasn't going to flip town vigilante from that investigation, so what's the point of hearing him out if he should have been confirmed scum to you.  <br>\n<br>\nScum is Una and Frog.

There's a quote somewhere where I'm talking to RB, and I link Rb's name, too.

Have you not been reading the thread? If you're here, just ask and I'll explain every single one to you.<br>\n<br>\nGame Replacement is a claimed odd night weak Role Cop, weak means he dies if he targets anything not town, so he knows I'm town.<br>\n<br>\nFrog is an odd night watcher who claimed nobody targeted me Night 3, the same day GR got the result. I also got a No Result on my investigation on Eddie. I have the loyal modifier, which means my results will fail if I target scum, which means I'd get a No Result if I target scum. Eddie was town, which means I got role blocked, as there was no other possibility, and since Frog claimed nobody targeted me AFTER Eddie and I had both claimed, I can see why it made sense for ScumFrog to claim there, but he was caught out in the fact that GR targeted me successfully. Had GR not done that, they would have been able to mislynch both myself and Eddie, in any order. Had I been lynched yesterday, this would be Eddie in my spot.<br>\n<br>\nUna is scum because he contradicted himself with his night action claims. Night 1 he said he got a 1-shot BP claim on Mario, yet when Mario claimed Vigilante, Una didn't call him out as lying, even went so far as to let him live and state his actions, and talked about not wanting to talk so that people wouldn't get side tracked. Night 2 he conveniently said he missed his action. Night 3 Thor is vanilla. Night 4, he said GR is Vanilla. This is the big one for me, actually. Una as town would have no need to investigate GR there. Una claimed to be a role cop, and if he were town, he would already know GR was lying, so this was a made up night action. <br>\n<br>\nThor is town, because if he was scum, he had no reason to not want you to vote me earlier. So Thor can only be scum if I am scum with him, if that makes sense. Mixed in with other play and whatnot, but yeah. Had you voted me, Thor could have just hammered and won the game, so I have Thor as lock town. <br>\n<br>\nbecause of this, GR/Myself are in a direct 2v2 with Una/Frog. If there are 3 scum, that means 100% that one of Two and Paul are also scum. With one of the comments they made last page, it shows that either Una/Frog/Paul are the scum team, or Flavor/GR/Two is the scum team. We're in a direct 3v3 now.<br>\n<br>\nThis isn't just my conclusion either. This is the general consensus.", "time": "Mon Aug 21, 2017 10:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=3525", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

I don't feel I need to explain GR why GR is town.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I state that \"town doesn't do this\" and \"this is scummy\" because town doesn't do that and those posts I say it to are fucking scummy. Like, take out the \"Town doesn't do this\" posts. I explain in nearly every single one of my posts that I am calling something scummy in exactly why it is scummy. <br>\n<br>\nThis entire post by you is literally full of lies.<br>\n<br>\nI have proven in this post that they are lies, with statements that can be backed up by just reading the game. <br>\n<br>\nThis is not just me saying \"nuh uh\" to your post. This is me completely explaining why your post is incorrect in explicit detail. Just because Frog states that I'm just \"nuh uh\"ing every thing he is saying, doesn't make it true. <br>\n<br>\nIf anything I am doing \"nuh uh, and here, let me tell you why. It's because......\" and then I go on and explain why. That is what people as town battling scum are supposed to do. Want to know why? Because scum's job is to try and discredit the townie to get the rest of the town to agree with them, while town's job is to explain why scum are scum by pointing out why their push on them is crap, which I have done.<br>\n<br>\nAll you have done is post \"oh, we just are doing circular reasoning back and forth\", when just by reading the thread that is not true. Two even stated he thought my cases were stronger, which further pushes that.", "time": "Mon Aug 21, 2017 11:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=3575", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

It doesn't matter if it was before or not, and that was the entire point. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">That's not actually a lie on his part, and as a defense to his accusation your decision is apparently to start debating definitions as opposed to actually tackling his raised issue. I give this point to frog.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n2) I have stated the exact opposite that my every case of mine has circular reasoning. Literally, the exact opposite. I stated YOUR cases have that, and mine don't, and I have also stated that as a difference between our plays, and this is absolutely not circular reasoning, as this post is using absolutely no zero bias. Sure, I know you are scum, but I'm making cases completely separate from that.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">This rebuttal actually hurts my brain to read. Quite frankly I consider both of you as being functionally equally guilty of this so-called circular reasoning, and I wouldn't even call it circular reasoning in the first place, so debating which of you is \"more right\" in your identical raised issues is pretty meaningless to me. i consider it a null point.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nThis also counters the point of your perspective talk, as I have been actively making non perspective cases, such as this, because this isn't a perspective case. This is me breaking down a case, and explaining to people why you are scummy. This could be done without any confbias.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I may agree with that, though frankly I was making a perspective case to both you and frog and he at least listened to me, so to a certain extent that feels better to me. I think if either or both of you are town you're being really argumentative and not paying a lot of attention to provable facts and I think that issue is something that I wish neither of you were doing. I would call it a tie.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n3) Neither of us can say anything that is valid? What about actual scum hunting? What about making actual scum cases that don't involve conf bias? That is completely valid. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I would agree with that...if either of you were doing it. He has a point, your case on him and Una is *exactly* as viable as his case on you and GR. In fact, the only really valid issue was yesterday, when Eddie should have never been the lynch target but both you and GR decided to ignore lynching frog for...reasons. To be perfectly frank, I'm still not entirely sure why you trust GR over frog - you actually don't seem to have a reason I understand for choosing that. From your perspective their claims should look equally plausible - just like they do to me. Also both seemed to have an agenda for lynching Eddie (something you seem to claim scum were setting up) I'm actually using non-claim relevant info (vote wagons) to draw my conclusions. Why do you like GR for town so strongly over frog? He could easily be the scum playing you right now, and frog is just an innocent watcher.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nI have also stated that I will comment on anything I can to show I am town and actively make more cases that aren't conf bias. I have stated that I am not doing this to communicate with you guys; I don't care to communicate with you guys. This, right here, is me communicating to town. That mindset of yours shows that you see this as you and I communicating without other people involved. I don't see it that way at all, so I will continue if I am able to. You backing off of it is scummy because you see that I'm making actual cases.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I still note that not a single lie has been actually shown. Also, I frankly believe you're kinda lying (either to yourself or to everyone else) that you're talking with town to convince town by walling with frog.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n4) What are you talking about with me and not caring about other assumptions? I have stated why I town read literally everyone else in the game besides you guys. Thor is town because he could have won the game if he were scum instead of actively trying to prolong the day. Two is town for leaning me, even voting me at the beginning of the day and the attempt to vote me later, and now willing to potentially accept that I'm town. I don't feel I need to explain GR why GR is town.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I would like to see you explain why GR is town, frankly. Two isn't town because of rb? That's the only reason he has me - his play has been pretty scummy if you ignore rb.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAlso, I state that \"town doesn't do this\" and \"this is scummy\" because town doesn't do that and those posts I say it to are fucking scummy. Like, take out the \"Town doesn't do this\" posts. I explain in nearly every single one of my posts that I am calling something scummy in exactly why it is scummy. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I will guardedly agree you do this, though I will point out that just like yesterday when you lynched Eddie while I was shouting that it was illogical - if you're town you lie to yourself/don't understand what is or is not actually provable and scum motivated and it leads you down bad roads. That, or you're scum. But frog questioning your logic and methods seems pretty legit to me as a stance.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nThis entire post by you is literally full of lies.<br>\n<br>\nI have proven in this post that they are lies, with statements that can be backed up by just reading the game. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">You actually really haven't - you've disagreed with his opinions of your play quality by offering your opinions of your play quality.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nThis is not just me saying \"nuh uh\" to your post. This is me completely explaining why your post is incorrect in explicit detail. Just because Frog states that I'm just \"nuh uh\"ing every thing he is saying, doesn't make it true. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Considering I asked both sides to zip it - I kind of agree with frog's assessment of the quality of the back and forth. Functionally I think both sides were just saying 'no u!' back and forth. There was not a lot of actual game analysis, otherwise both sides should have had two votes on frog and two votes on GR really quick - because those are by FAR the most logical and provable scum cases if you presume that 2+ of the PRs are lying. Una has since come in with a bit more of a direct counter to GR, but I'm not sure why you don't believe him over GR (or, frankly, why he's so sure you're lying even if GR is) but that's a headache for town later, hopefully after scum kill me for being slightly sane.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nIf anything I am doing \"nuh uh, and here, let me tell you why. It's because......\" and then I go on and explain why. That is what people as town battling scum are supposed to do. Want to know why? Because scum's job is to try and discredit the townie to get the rest of the town to agree with them, while town's job is to explain why scum are scum by pointing out why their push on them is crap, which I have done.<br>\n<br>\nAll you have done is post \"oh, we just are doing circular reasoning back and forth\", when just by reading the thread that is not true. Two even stated he thought my cases were stronger, which further pushes that.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I will agree that Two stated he liked your cases, even though he appears unable to describe why, I don't take that as a ringing endorsement of the back and forth.<br>\n<br>\nWhat do you think of GR's answers to me thus far? he feels like he's trying to slip and slide my questions and not actually gamesolve with me. Do you agree/disagree with that and why? Also, why do you trust him so much? I see no reason for you to, what am I missing?</div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div>", "time": "Tue Aug 22, 2017 8:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72708&start=3625", "forum": "53", "thread": "72708"}

We are probably the weakest players in the game as far as ability to defend and whatnot. The reason TiaM was killed was bcuz we were set up yesterday as having to be against each other.
