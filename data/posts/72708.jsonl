I think I found the game you were referring to (Newbie 1797?) Your case in Dunker was because he couldn't give reasoning for his vote and unvoted when pressured. Although it does show that Dunker can be scummy as town, I don't think that's the same as what's happened this game; he wasn't pressured, but he voluntarily gave up his vote and stopped scumhunting while appealing to rb. <br><br>I still agree with pretty much everything SD is saying and I have a townread there.<br><br>I don't really like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452339#p9452339\">131</a>- it feels like busywork. I don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452393#p9452393\">140</a> either. It just seems like there's no actual good reason to self-vote there; it could be a sarcastic meme, but it's just way too awkward, especially since they haven't unvoted yet.<br>I don't really like Ciara's fixation on Unabombah. He looks like town so far and she's basically used her vote on him to avoid pushing or actually doing anything other than a few statements. I could vote there. (I have no idea why my reads are so similar to rb's.)<br><br>I feel like NTRP isn't that suspicious. Sure, he hasn't done that much, but he took the step to call Una scum over PF and has contributed @ Dunkerdoodles.<br><br>I'd be willing to vote in {Ciara24, Dunkerdoodles, Flavour Leaf} at this point in time."}

He's playing the town strategy that he espoused years ago. He wasn't complaining that he was getting scumread for following the wiki.

Your first claim is that 'wiki tells matter according to Thor'. This claim is unfounded; Thor never said that. Yes, I agree that wiki tells are not the only way to scumhunt, but Thor was linking articles that he wrote describing what he believes to be pro-town and anti-town behavior. He wasn't advocating that we should be following linked wiki tells or anything. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9461044#p9461044\" class=\"postlink\">post 476</a>, Eddie Cane wrote:</cite>stop scumreading me. this is fun! earlier in this thread, thor said, paraphrased, \"I cannot fathom how anyone could scumread me\". lol. moving on, tho, 409 and 446 both basically just omgus and call myself and rb bad for scumreading thor. he attacks the users, as opposed to the premise.</div></blockquote><br><br>There is no OMGUS in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460498#p9460498\">409</a>, and he doesn't call anyone bad in that post.

He's doing exactly what he said he's doing - he's voting for his scumread, and said that instead of voting for their main read, people should try to consolidate on a secondary read so that we can use the time we have productively. Like, he doesn't want a lynch at deadline, which I totally get because those tend to be panic-fueled and often lead to people making hasty decisions under pressure.

On reread, this entire post feels disingenuous in its phrasing, from your \"that's interesting\" right down to \"\"I have no idea why my votes are so similar to rb's\"). It feels like an attempt to be fake-friendly/empathetic/towny. I still don't know what to think of flavor's self-vote, but I have to say that the one \"busy work\" post you linked to was a legitimate question with a legitimate, clarifying response, so that logic is void. Anyway, there was also another attempt to align yourself with me....why? What exactly was so important about what I was saying that you wanted to be associated with it? Townreads are not great when they feel like a clammy handshake.<br><br>[post]184</a> Oh hey there's a handy wagon. Ausuka just jumped on it, amazing!<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454188#p9454188\">188</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454344#p9454344\">198</a> Not really feeling these excuses. <br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456834#p9456834\">306</a> To be fair, I thought wavemode's scumread of me based on that exchange was pretty weak as well until I reviewed it just now. I stand by the first two lines of my post, but agreeing about Flavor and Ciara was dumb.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456982#p9456982\">310</a> I outlined above why rb is likely town, which is relevant to this post. I think if an actual newish person can pick up on how rb is helpful to town, then it should be a glaring billboard for someone who is loudly not-a-newb. So why are you presenting his activity in such simplistic terms? Your note to wavemode seems to be an outright lie, given prior observations. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457020#p9457020\">313</a> You are way overthinking the wagon scenario. There's a thing about overcomplicated explanations that I can't remember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it applies here. Also, you gutread skitter (probably because she's given nothing scum could hope to pick at) which becomes relevant...<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457145#p9457145\">316</a> ...here. From one post to the next you gutread, and then you scumread wavemode for gutreading. This looks a lot like earlier when you sheeped and then voted for sheeping. What exactly is going on here?<br><br>And from this point on you launch into full on angry defensiveness and your credibility drops with every post after.<br><br>So yeah.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ausuka</span>"}

What exactly were you coming on to?<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9446831#p9446831\">174</a> This is where my opinion changes from before, and that's largely because I wasn't paying enough attention to what was going on. On reread, this entire post feels disingenuous in its phrasing, from your \"that's interesting\" right down to \"\"I have no idea why my votes are so similar to rb's\"). It feels like an attempt to be fake-friendly/empathetic/towny. I still don't know what to think of flavor's self-vote, but I have to say that the one \"busy work\" post you linked to was a legitimate question with a legitimate, clarifying response, so that logic is void. Anyway, there was also another attempt to align yourself with me....why? What exactly was so important about what I was saying that you wanted to be associated with it? Townreads are not great when they feel like a clammy handshake.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454146#p9454146\">184</a> Oh hey there's a handy wagon. Ausuka just jumped on it, amazing!<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454188#p9454188\">188</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454344#p9454344\">198</a> Not really feeling these excuses. <br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456834#p9456834\">306</a> To be fair, I thought wavemode's scumread of me based on that exchange was pretty weak as well until I reviewed it just now. I stand by the first two lines of my post, but agreeing about Flavor and Ciara was dumb.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456982#p9456982\">310</a> I outlined above why rb is likely town, which is relevant to this post. I think if an actual newish person can pick up on how rb is helpful to town, then it should be a glaring billboard for someone who is loudly not-a-newb. So why are you presenting his activity in such simplistic terms? Your note to wavemode seems to be an outright lie, given prior observations. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457020#p9457020\">313</a> You are way overthinking the wagon scenario. There's a thing about overcomplicated explanations that I can't remember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it applies here. Also, you gutread skitter (probably because she's given nothing scum could hope to pick at) which becomes relevant...<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457145#p9457145\">316</a> ...here. From one post to the next you gutread, and then you scumread wavemode for gutreading. This looks a lot like earlier when you sheeped and then voted for sheeping. What exactly is going on here?<br><br>And from this point on you launch into full on angry defensiveness and your credibility drops with every post after.<br><br>So yeah.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ausuka</span>[/quote]"}

Her reason for scumreading Ciara was weak; her reason for scumreading Flavor feels fabricated, not a natural belief. I believe this last one even more now I know MM4's been around for two years.

Uh, why exactly? It's anti-town to vote for yourself. I know it's a thing that people do, but I never really understood why. You were on your own wagon when it got to L-1 ffs. If you're scum, thanks for helping us almost-lynch you? And if you're town, what the heck are you doing being the second vote on your own L-1 wagon? I don't really see any motivation for him doing this as either alignment. And I just checked the latest vote count . . . and he's still voting for himself. It looks like he hasn't checked the thread since then, tbh. <br><br>Please unvote. And your thoughts on your wagon would be appreciated.<br><br>Not sure why Eddie voted, tbh. (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452694#p9452694\">159</a>). Wait, continued reading. He's doing it for reactions (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9453430#p9453430\">171</a>). <br><br>I dislike Thor's vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454075#p9454075\">182</a>). He says he wants to lynch FL in order to give us stuff to analyze. It seems like he's willing to vote FL regardless of his alignment in order to generate those reactions. Why not vote for someone you think is actually scummy instead of voting for the sake of having a speedlynch?<br><br>Ausuka's vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454146#p9454146\">184</a>). Seems like she's voting here because there happens to be a wagon there. She did say she had planned to vote earlier (between Eddie and Thor), though, and I agree that the self-vote was awkward and that FL's major contributions (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452331#p9452331\">130</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452339#p9452339\">131</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452421#p9452421\">151</a>) are kinda flat. <br><br>I'm a little bit uncertain about Unabomba's vote. I can understand why he doesn't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452331#p9452331\">130</a> or the self-vote, but since he said <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452499#p9452499\" class=\"postlink\">post 155</a>, UnaBombaH wrote:</cite>For example, Flavor Leafs reaction pinged me as forced, but I dont automatically shoot my vote there.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm not sure why he suddenly decided he was OK with placing FL at L-1? The only post Fl made in between is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9453796#p9453796\">179</a>, and I don't see why that would be enough to change your opinion?<br><br>Eddie fake-hammers via a revote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454307#p9454307\">191</a>), and then declares FL to be probably town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454393#p9454393\">210</a>), and then switches his vote to . . . himself (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9446831#p9446831\">221)</a>). ??? I know he self-votes, so I'm not reading too much into that. What I'm confused with here is why Eddie suddenly declared FL to be town despite voting (and fake-hammering via revote) him earlier, especially when FL didn't interact with anyone between Eddie's original vote on FL and Eddie's fake-hammer and Eddie's self-vote. <br><br>Dunker hops on with a naked vote. (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454607#p9454607\">228</a>). Wow, so much reasoning here.

Um, why are you so sure here? This, in conjunction with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454746#p9454746\">238</a> kinda make it seem like you know he's town? Why exactly do you think FL is so useful here? FL is kinda null to me. He made a couple observations (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452331#p9452331\">130</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452339#p9452339\">131</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9452421#p9452421\">151</a>) and self-voted, which is at best anti-town, especially since he was on his own L-1 wagon. Since it doesn't look like he's actually checked the thread since then, being on his own wagon is NAI to me atm. However, his comments were relatively shallow and would be easy for scum to fake. I haven't seen enough from him to actually justify lynching him, but I don't see anything here that screams town to me either.<br><br>And then the wagon dies for reasons that I don't fully understand.<br><br>rb moves to Sunlit Diamond, and a bunch of people follow him. Again. I'm kinda surprised that so many people are following him tbh. He throws out reads with little reasoning or explanation, and he seems to have a bunch of followers with every new vote he makes. I need to go through this later to see if there's any interesting patterns here; kinda seems like scum might be exploiting his pushes with how quickly these wagons seem to be building. <br><br>I'm not finished catching up yet, will continue later today.<br><br>P-edit: FL showed up while I was writing this lol. Yeah, it looks like he hadn't actually read the thread between now and then.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>This triggers me"}

He's playing the town strategy that he espoused years ago. He wasn't complaining that he was getting scumread for following the wiki.

Your first claim is that 'wiki tells matter according to Thor'. This claim is unfounded; Thor never said that. Yes, I agree that wiki tells are not the only way to scumhunt, but Thor was linking articles that he wrote describing what he believes to be pro-town and anti-town behavior.

He's doing exactly what he said he's doing - he's voting for his scumread, and said that instead of voting for their main read, people should try to consolidate on a secondary read so that we can use the time we have productively.

Scum do that, so you don't necessarily want to do what scum does. But that's just WIFOM coming out, so I guess it's an argument that can be proven both ways.

I have put my thoughts out that I'm not town reading Thor by any means, but I wasn't directly scum reading him either., and it kind of looks like he wanted to test the waters with a potential buddying up to me here. And I don't like the Ciara thing considering the lack of activity from the slot at this point and the small catch up post right before it. Definitely not leafy.

Here's why. One: I liked Wavemode's posting, so I don't see the cases you were making on Wave as legitimate reasons. That's not a lazy read. I am not a lazy player. Sure, I forget to check up on games sometimes, but that isn't lazy.

That said, I'm still in favor of an mm4 lynch, in case that was unclear. I think mm4 and ausuka are still the same person with the same motivations. I'm just not convinced SD is town right now either. Sorry but I find the notion laughable that she hasn't been paying any attention to the arguments against ausuka this whole game but suddenly now finds every single thing she's done since the day started to be scummy. I don't like her repetitive insistence that rd v Thor was town vs. town (for basically no logical reason, I might add), then when someone took issue with it, suddenly she's like \"well let me double check his ISO\" and then now she's willing to vote him. and call this tinfoil hattery but, as ive said before, I really really don't like this simultaneous turnaround from both mm4 and sd from scumreading me to scumreading each other. I don't like how weirdly certain SD suddenly is about mm4, almost to the point of being willing to put herself on the line for it.

I was having trouble understanding the Thor/Eddie thing, so I wanted to talk to Eddie more about it, but he wasn't really responding to my questions. I explained above why I'm feeling better about him now. Ciara showed up, so I figured since we were both around I'd try to talk to her. Since I wasn't really understanding Eddie, I was hoping she'd be able to explain why she had Eddie so high. Tbh, her answer (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9465849#p9465849\">626</a>) was kinda weird. If you know you have trouble reading people, I don't get why you'd artificially give them townreads? Like, her reasons for townreading eddie/rb were weird and bad, and she basically admitted to making them up. And she never really tried to sort them or like anyone else for that matter. And I wanted to know why she didn't vote Ausuka/MM if she was good with lynching him. Kinda felt like she wasn't putting her money where her mouth was, like Ciara was trying to show she approved of the wagon without actually contributing to it.<br><br>And she replaced out just after I pushed her on these things. <br><br>And today Mulch was all sorts of weird, and pushed a scumread on me for BS reasons. Like having a gutread that I'm scum for saying goodbye to TB when we signed up to play together is just ridiculous. Yes, I get that it was a gutread, but since I'd have said the exact same thing to him if I were scum, that post was NAI, and deciding I had to be scum and that me and TB couldn't be partners because of that was just reachy and bad and didn't really make sense.<br><br>And I disliked how he kept on insisting that I was 'angry'. Yeah, I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">annoyed </span>with him. I don't really get where he got <span style=\"font-style: italic\">angry</span> from, tbh. And by insisting that other variables are irrelevant (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473087#p9473087\">1153</a>), he delegitimized any other explanation (like the fact that I was disappointed that I didn't get to play with the dude I signed up to play with) for my goodbye post, and reduced it to somehow being supporting evidence of a BS gutread. <br><br>And I didn't really understand how MM's reaction to that whole business meant that MM was trying to save *Thor* (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473084#p9473084\">1152</a>). Like, it would at least make some sort of sense to say scum!MM was trying to save scum!me, but dragging Thor into that mess kinda felt like Mulch was trying to link MM to his Thor scumread, for pretty much BS reasons as far as I can tell. How does agreeing with me about this mean that MM was trying to save *Thor*? Like, there's no connection there.</div></div></div><br><br>So yeah, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Mulch</span>"}

I've been busy).<br><br>I think I mostly agree with you about your wagon. I think that scum were taking advantage of rb's early pushes in order to create momentum for wagons that might not have otherwise taken off. I just thought it was strange that yours went to L-1 *and* dissipated within a short period of time. Like, if you're scum, why wasn't there any sort of counterwagon? I mean, one formed eventually, but it was formed by the very same people who promoted yours (ie rb and eddie). So unless they're scum bussing/distancing you (and I'm *pretty* sure Eddie is town, not 100% on rb, but he's also a townlean), it's very odd that a wagon on scum!you dissipated with very little scum interference. And if you're town, why didn't scum take advantage of the quickwagon to get a mislynch? Why did they allow another wagon to form altogether? Like the formation of your wagon was weird, and that's why I took the time to analyze it. <br><br>Eddie I was confused about because I couldn't really tell what he was doing; like he's one of those players who don't really explain himself, which makes it hard for me to understand him. But, the more I play with him, the more I realize he does random, semi-inscrutable things in order to generate reactions which he can then analyze. So, with that in mind, his role in your wagon makes sense to me.<br><br>And yeah, I thought your self-vote was awkward, cuz I think *all* self-votes are awkward. If you're town, I think it's anti-town to self-vote, and I dislike them greatly.<br>I also thought it was interesting that you chose to comment on the fact that I found your self-vote awkward, but neglected to respond to the fact that I thought your attempts at game-solving were kinda shallow. Like, you just kinda glossed over the fact that I was at best null-reading you for that. <br><br>I think that's everything. If I missed something, let me know.</div></div></div>"}

So that is why Im again hesitant to let my instinct on Sunlit go.<br><br>I do however dislike mulch-rb interactions as much as I did eddie-thor, and since mulch could be the one actually happening before deadline..eh. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">"}

The catching-up was also good, but later on she seems noncommittal and slightly lurkerish? I will admit there is some gut in that, without which she would be higher in my reads list. <br><br>wavemode: I was having trouble sorting wavemode earlier in the game, but a few posts here and there (#314 and #1286) I think come from a town mindset.<br><br>DunkerDoodles: no offence intended, but probably the least memorable player in the game for me so far, which makes me think they are lurking actively. Not a good sign<br><br>Eddie Cain: irreverent half the time, useless the other. Questions have been shallow. It seems like they are trying to insert themselves into everything without having much of an impact.<br><br>Flavor Leaf: pushes early Day 1 on spurious issues and does nothing with the 'pressure' they claim to be exerting. After unvoting themselves, they claim to have a few weak townreads and ask little that might solidify these or produce some scumreads. They also seem unusually concerned with their wagon after it dissipated.<br><br>thor665: thor has seemed very worried about how he looks and where he sits in relation to other players. The conflicts he has involved himself in have distracted us from useful play and disinterested plenty of players, and this is worse when his request to compromise wagon early Day 1 is considered. Further specifics deliberately left out to avoid a thor argument."}

You had a wave/thor/mulch theory and that was shown to be wrong but you're still dead-set on believing you had it partially right so you're just running down the rest of that list. You have no real case except by association. I'm struggling to see anything scummy in those posts you referenced, just certain things you consider to be bad town play, or associative reads with thor. Only thing is maybe being sure that flavor was a mislynch, but I mean, I say things like that just generally. I've seen enough day 1 mislynches to know one when I see one... the day I'm wrong is the day I'll stop saying that.<br><br>You're also giving me a migraine, sorry to say, and I'm not getting in some 10 page debate with you just so you can turn around and say I'm scummy for being defensive. You make a big stink about everything and you talk like you know everything and everyone is an idiot and nobody is allowed to disagree with your scumreads or else they're scum. It would be fine if we were getting results but here you are tunneling on 3 people and simply wrong on 2 of them, and also probably the third, and just leading the town off a cliff at this point.

And after that, she's suddenly the person he second-most wants to lynch. (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454385#p9454385\">209</a>). And then he accuses her of being opportunistic and continues saying he supports the wagon . . . without actually voting her. <br><br>And his vote on her is a pressure vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457334#p9457334\">332</a>) . . . which he sticks with for the rest of the game. <br><br>But despite his SD tunnel, I still think Thor is town. <br><br>Like, I come to posts like this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460368#p9460368\" class=\"postlink\">post 405</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>We're starting to flounder around with side vanity projects - I think people should consider voting secondary or tertiary scum reads if it helps consolidate wagons.<br><br>I'd much rather get a L-1 and claim now, so we have time to discuss said claim and potentially run up another option, than to wait until five hours before deadline for a derp rush where we end up hammering without a claim.<br>I know this goes against site meta, but I'm a rebel.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is ridiculously pro-town. Like, I've been part of too many games where deadline hammers are a thing, and they've tended to be on town because people are in a rush and just lynch anybody cuz they're on a deadline. Like, scum *like* deadline hammers because it forces town to make hasty, bad decisions. Like, I don't see scum going opposite site meta to push this approach towards lynching/claiming. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460996#p9460996\" class=\"postlink\">post 454</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>How am I following the wiki other than ARTICLES I MYSELF WROTE - WHICH IS CALLED FOLLOWING YOUR OWN BELIEFS?</div></blockquote><br><br>And again, I feel like he's getting angry because he feels like eddie/rb don't understand that he feels he's playing his optimal towngame. Like, I feel like he thinks he's obviously town, and he's getting frustrated that people aren't seeing it. <br><br>Like, I just went through his ISO to re-examine him after the SD flip, and I just don't see scum!Thor, despite the weird SD thing. I hate the language he uses, and I hate the arguments he's gotten into because they distract from our primary goal of finding scum, but despite all of that, I think he's town. <br><br>And if SD died via scum and not a vig kill, I'm also confused af why scum!Thor would ever kill SD here tbh. I don't see why he would kill the person he had tunneled and was trying to mislynch.</div></div></div><br><br>I agree with you about wave, but this post kinda became a Thor post, so he'll get his own shortly. (And I guess I can do a Mario one too, but that isn't happening tonight. I'm not even sure I'll manage to finish wave tonight.)<br><br>I don't know how I feel about frog atm. Like, he's just kinda around and I have no opinion of him. TB had lurked, and I know that's a thing scum!TB has a tendency to do, but he was apparently moving, so yeah. frog is just null. I want to say that I want more content from him, but we're already at day2 and that slot has had like no content."}

I actually dislike it on re-read compared to what I first thought, because it actually looks really, really awkward like scum is trying to engage in banter/jabs but not quite hitting the mark. Posts that I don't like:<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9448867#p9448867\">73</a> and the follow-up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9448933#p9448933\">77</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9449413#p9449413\">82</a><br><br>It bothers me that it took him hours to follow-up his reasons for a naked vote, when the game was basically in RVS. The game was kind of slow-paced here but I expect a town player would try and then inject some of their very-early thoughts into the game and keep it moving along. Instead the naked vote just looks like, \"weak player detected, let's jump on it\". <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9449151#p9449151\">80</a> makes me think this is the case also.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9453631#p9453631\">175</a> is a really big red flag. Why would having similar reads in the early game make two players town together, let alone when you're scumreading Ausuka so strongly? Wouldn't it be more likely to think Ausuka and myself were _scum_ together since he scumreads Ausuka? But he doesn't even remotely go with this possibility and takes no notice of me (notice that at this point, I've had wavemode on townread also, and he doesn't ever think to question it but simply goes along with it). <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454402#p9454402\">211</a> is just bad. Picking a scumteam ~200 posts into the game? It just says that if wavemode is town, he's pushing way too far into potential associative tells. At no point prior to this can I find where he's expressed that he thinks Sunlit + Thor are scum by the way. What I'm taking note of here though, is how wavemode seems to be almost trying to copy my tone tit-for-tat. I make bold statements and push a scumteam theory, and he immediately does it right after - given that I gave him a townread upon his entrance, it looks like he's actually imitating me (consciously or unconsciously) and picking up on my tone/attitude in some way. Not sure what this means really, but an interesting thought nonetheless. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9454746#p9454746\">238</a> I kind of wonder what wavemode was seeing that was so useful at this point - I'd like him to expand on that.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456738#p9456738\">296</a> is an interesting focus on scum perspective here. It strikes me as really odd that his thoughts automatically drift to the scumchat and how the game is shaping up from the perspective of the scum. This is in conjunction with his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9449151#p9449151\">80</a> where he also brings it up. I honestly can't recall where I've seen town act like this at such an early point in the game, it's just weird as fuck and I think it's scummy.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9456738#p9456738\">296</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9457080#p9457080\">314</a> don't logically track with me either, and Thor's questioning is warranted. The fact that wavemode is opportunistic on one wagon and not another is interesting, especially when his reasons for townreading Flavor Leaf are pretty average at best, and he's also contested how people could townread Ausuka. It might be reading too far into things too, but I find it pretty bad that SD did end up flipping town after this - but that still begs the question of why SD was killed, we'll have to get to that. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460359#p9460359\">402</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460361#p9460361\">403</a> kinda leave a bad taste in my mouth, because it's like he's being serious that activity is NAI but then 403 is almost mockery of that idea? It almost reads as a defence of PerfectFifth/ThinkBig, and one that strikes me as odd. Does he not agree that it's bad for someone to be that inactive? Why? It's like wavemode here is actually trying to imply it's a good thing? I didn't actually make any judgement beyond \"this is bad\" but he seems oddly touchy over it.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9460569#p9460569\">414</a> is pretty good, I don't see all that much issue with it. Giving credit where it's due.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9461174#p9461174\">493</a> is aggressive and feels town. Could be that wavemode just has awkward RVS game. One problem though - he plays like newbscum but when Ausuka becomes MarioManiac (not a newb) he doesn't seem to re-evaluate at all. Not necessarily scummy, but definitely an issue in continuity. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9461309#p9461309\">497</a> is also good.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: 631</span> is 50/50, i don't really expect anyone to agree with it because people have trouble believing non-intuitive things even if they're objectively correct <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9466039#p9466039\">633</a> feels downhill. i still don't really understand wavemode's point about shrinking my pool to two people and the way he doubles down on it later on in just feels even worse in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9466274#p9466274\">641</a>. it doesn't logically track that he would agree with a Thor push, as well as have him in his scum-pool but then suddenly latch onto this and think it's not a good push (didn't he just have him in top3 scumreads?). I can't really explain it either since it really, really looks like wavemode's exact lynchpool in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9466379#p9466379\">643</a> is...2 people? SD + Ausuka? Someone correct me if I've read this wrong but that's really what it looks like here, so it feels even WORSE on re-read.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473448#p9473448\">1185</a> pings me pretty badly - like he's so elated by the way Mulch is pushing on MM4. It actually feels to me like it comes from a scum perspective delighted that a town player is doing their work for them.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9473476#p9473476\">1189</a> is like the decline of wavemode personified.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9474378#p9474378\">1256</a> it seems like he pretty much just townreads whoever has reads that agree with his - and at no point prior to this does he even interact with Ciara _AT ALL_ - but suddenly he is \"pretty sure Ciara was town\" when Mulch starts pushing on a read he agrees with. Feels awfully like confbias or just outright scum.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9475492#p9475492\">1314</a> again just seems so bad. It reads to me as pretty obstructionist and unnecessarily defensive over a slot that he's out of nowhere decided is town (for reasons that can't be found, and no interactions between wavemode+Ciara exist that I can see that would indicate wave townreads them strongly)<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9475801#p9475801\">1377</a> is just ridiculous. fake dayvig is like the biggest running gag ever on this forum. I find it almost hard to believe someone could last 2 months here and not see it happen once. Still, maybe he's literally never seen it - but he seems to know what a 'desperado' is and also *grabs popcorn* immediately? If he has no idea or thinks it might be real - then wouldn't he like, comment on it? Whenever I see a fake dayvig and there's someone who falls for it in some way, there's SHITLOADS of confusion, but wavemode simply presents detached amusement, and yet is surprised that MM4 doesn't take it seriously and thinks it's scummy that he <span class=\"noboldsig\">didn't claim</span>. I actually find this post to be almost fucking impossible to believe as coming from town!wavemode.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9475948#p9475948\">1404</a> again feels like either Thor is a buddy OR he's pocketing Thor. Early game I'm not someone anyone ever fucks with, and Eddie presented with the same swagger right out of the gate. So it makes his early-game Thor scumread feel very appeasing, but when he sees a chink in the armour he suddenly distances from that read and takes potshots at Eddie's credibility.

As promised I will give my current outlook on the game. I suppose I must put a bit more effort into putting my thoughts into words now that I'm the top wagon.<br><br>Lean town:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Una</span> - Una's posts in this game show pretty genuine analysis. If he's scum he's got me fooled. That said, maybe I'm just biased toward Umbreons.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Thor665</span> - Thor's actions and pushes haven't seemed scum-motivated to me and he has approached this game logically. This opinion is weaker now that SD flipped town but that's not really enough for me to completely change my mind here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">skitter30</span> - Er this one's weak tbh but I've just generally seen good town-motivated mindset coming from a lot of her posts so I've had a soft townread here since the early game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">wavemode</span> - This guy's been super towny. I nominate him as town leader. I think someone is going to need to calmly dumb down for me why this mulch thing is such a big deal because I'm not quite getting it. I townread mulch's early posts as well as ciara's, then I didn't really feel like anyone was making compelling arguments for me to scumread him so I stuck with him as town, then he died and flipped town, so I was right. Which part of this makes me scum? I guess I'm mainly addressing Paul since he said he really liked me for town yesterday then is now calling me a scummy scumfuck, so I'm curious what changed so drastically.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Flavor Leaf</span> - Uhhh, tbh this guy's still been in my townpool because I'm confirmation biased about the quick wagon. Looking purely logically, though, he has certainly been showing effort to crack the game open and gather information so I'm content to keep him here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Eddie Cane</span> - Obviously I disagree with his reads but overall he seems similar to FL in his attempts to cut through the BS talk and actually solve the game. Somewhat aggressive but he seems to have a willingness to evaluate the game from all angles.<br><br>Null:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">frog</span> - As several people have pointed out, town!TB goes inactive all the time so I'm not sure why so much suspicion immediately appeared surrounding him. As for his replacement I don't have any confident read on frog as of yet. Posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9476400#p9476400\">#1533</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9490743#p9490743\">#1955</a> seem towny, but are sort of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">obviously</span> towny so they feel easily fakeable, if that makes sense.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dunkerdoodles</span> - Votes strangely, sheeps strangely, doesn't seem to care what people think about it. Leaning slightly town but I must admit this slot is worth keeping an eye on.<br><br>Lean scum:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NTRP</span> - I think I'm possibly biased against people who call me a scummy scumfuck. Dunno how I feel about this slot overall, just seems to fade into the background and not contribute much to solving the game. Type of scum who is easy to overlook. Could just be his play style but I need to understand the motivation behind some of his actions because right now I have a bad gut read on most of his recent sheeping.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MM4</span> - This is a more unpopular opinion than I realized it was going to be but yeah I still think Ausuka's scumminess was agenda-driven and not playstyle-related. And MM4 was uncharacteristically aggressive after mulch pushed on him, and what was scummy was not even just the aggression, but the weird automatic certainty he had that mulch had a scum agenda, for weird automatic reasons. It was the exact same thing Ausuka did to me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">rb</span> - Okay so I've already said that I feel like rb's pushes have felt scum-motivated and he has a tendency to automatically scumread and berate people who merely disagree with his logic, or whose logic he disagrees with. The other thing was his argument that we should kill Thor even if he's town. And on reread I also really don't like his push on mulch and his unwillingness to present any case when I asked. Just seems right in line with his stupid \"let's just kill the most useless person\" thing. If you always just kill the most useless person I think you almost always hit town when you're playing with experienced scum. (That said, mulch wasn't even useless if you actually read his posts... he was just town. Sounds more to me like, let's kill anyone who disagrees with me so I get to lead unobstructed.)"}

That was genuine. I have wanted some answers out of you at various stages of today, and you have either not been forthcoming or you have given answers that are less than ideally precise. Let me be clear as I can: if you are town, we want to co-operate. I have been trying, and although you are evasive there has been enough doubt in me that, maybe, you want to as well.<br><br>Here is what I find strange. You refuse to elaborate on your read of rb, despite there being concerns about buddying. You give a noncomittal answer about how strong your read of rb is, despite at least two players asking you for it. You engage in night speculation, in which rb features to the point where his lack of dying is the focal point of the post. You ask questions of rb to answer whether rb as scum would have killed you last night. I doubt I am the only one to notice all this, and, to me, it suggests that you are party to something the rest of us are not.<br><br>I think you are attempting to use rb to stay alive and control the gamestate. I think you are trying to mislead and confuse town. I think you are setting up scenarios about alignments that you will exploit later in the game. I do not think you are trying to gamesolve, I do not think that you are assisting rb in his effort to read others, and I do not buy your responses to my questions.<br><br>The offer of co-operation is not going away, but I am going to need greater effort and, in particular, greater transparency, before I am convinced you are not a good lynch candidate."}

His post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9483871#p9483871\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and the fact he did it really early in the day comes off as town to me. I don't think he'd bring it up so early and not yet under pressure if he was scum. He also lowkey protected me in Day 1 when my wagon was forming, and I don't feel he had to. I also agreed with his MM read of not being as obv town as everyone though. Like I said before, he could be WK'ing me, but if he is, then he's done a decent job with it because I don't think he's scum. There doesn't seem much a point to try and do that to me, though, since I'm really not a huge presence in this game. I'm trying to be!

Wave used a similar thing as a defense, and I think Wave's seemed genuine. I don't have a strong read on Thor either way. I can see him flipping either way, so I'm trying to POE it out, and find scum elsewhere. I think a scum flip somewhere would make me feel more confident in reading Thor. Also, as I said before...Frog is likely town. <br><br>So you went and made this post in response to Eddie because you only agreed with one of his reads basically?<br><br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9485609#p9485609\" class=\"postlink\">Una's post on Eddie</a><br><br>I'm scum reading Una.

So now you don't want the catch-up. Scum if I do write the catch-up, scum if I don't. You're making premises for a chosen conclusion. I agree that the read post is cursory, I stated as much at the beginning. That does not, however, mean it is fluff. You had the opportunity to use it as a vehicle for elaboration. Besides, why do you think I should be providing massively detailed reads lists as a matter of course when you can't even be bothered to properly ISO one player? Let's call it 'fluff'. It's far more complete and informative than any of your posts.<br><br>P-edit: I really don't want to vote wavemode when Eddie is still alive"}

So now you don't want the catch-up. Scum if I do write the catch-up, scum if I don't. You're making premises for a chosen conclusion. I agree that the read post is cursory, I stated as much at the beginning. That does not, however, mean it is fluff. You had the opportunity to use it as a vehicle for elaboration. Besides, why do you think I should be providing massively detailed reads lists as a matter of course when you can't even be bothered to properly ISO one player? Let's call it 'fluff'. It's far more complete and informative than any of your posts.<br><br>P-edit: I really don't want to vote wavemode when Eddie is still alive</div></blockquote><br>irrelevant bullshit level: 10<br><br>saying I'm doing the same things as you and I can't scumread you for them is admitting you're being a scumfuck because I'm intentionally being scummy. good point! and being a hypocrite means jack shit in mafia, I don't care if I shitpost, shitposting and posting one liners isn't the same as attempting to make a constructive catch up and flat our failing because you aren't experienced  enough to fake a real catch up.  i have lots of posts, you having less doesn't make you scum, but you're attempting to look contributing while doing nothing. your catchup offered nothing productive to the thread as does the test of your content. <br><br>that's not what a misrep is, nice buzzwording though.  you already acknowledged it was a valid point by saying you answered it earlier so don't try and play the misrep card.  i didn't \"understand\" it, I stopped commenting on it because there were bigger fish to fry.  never mind how hard you're peddling me and thor as your strongest scum reads when anyone who isn't a squawking cactus can tell we almost certainly aren't partners. lolz. and advice for the future: next time just fake a 4th scumread so it isn't blatantly obvious you're scum faking a team read and confbiasing it to fit.<br><br>I never said I don't want the catchup. show me where I said that. you wanna talk about misrepping? you just openly did it.  your catchup was awful, that doesn't even close to equate to the bullshit you're trying to pedal. i never said \"scum if you do, scum if you don't\" in any world. losing another 30 pages of horrible catchup isn't a big loss, which is true. random snips at random comments followed by disconnected reads is not a good catchup.  I've isod lots of players btw, so idk where that line comes from, but sure, keep trying to discredit me. it's not \"complete and informative\"... scratch that. it's informative. reporting on information instead of analyzing. hey Thor, found a wiki tell for us to use! you said it yourself, it's informative, it's not analytical and stating things about a bunch of people IS fluff.<br><br>P-edit: you're getting lynched today. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">"}

I've done some meta diving of Mulch lately, and really, as scum, Mario played the best possible way to make sure the mulch slot got lynched. Have him self destruct, as Mulch has seemed to do that on multiple occasions, so I'm sure Mario knew exactly what he was doing there. I can get more, if you like; Mario has by far the scummiest ISO in the game."}

If what I produced was bad and useless and you had already sorted me, then it stands to reason that any more is, at best, superfluous. Maybe saying you do not want the catch-up was a stretch, but you certainly did not enjoy it and you certainly did not need it, which is near enough not wanting it in my eyes.<br>4) I said 'ISO' where perhaps I meant something more like 'pbpa'. A phrase that might have served the same purpose is 'a post where you tried'.<br><br>I think, unless you manage to read a post without misunderstanding and without recourse to the Oxford English Dictionary to produce overfine distinctions to use in your excuses for responses, we had better not engage again. Your posting when irreverent was not enlightening, but it seems that it only gets worse when you begin to expend energy.</div></blockquote><br>1) criteria for scun as a whole aren't a thing. it's a player by player thing. that is literally how the concept  of meta works.<br>2) no?<br>3) no?<br>4) that's not what iso means. if you meant something else fine. don't spread your b.s. though.<br><br>now for someone who likes big words such as \"overfine distinctions\" to cover up for critical thinking, try actually understanding how to play mafia at above the level of a 12 year old. maybe next time you'll last past day 2 as scum."}

Notice how I kept dodging whoever it was (frog) who wanted my specific read on rb? I thought I saved him probably. remember when I said specific things had to happen for him to be scum? those specific things was him not being saved and scum killing sd. I was obvious the whole time, the only reason i played like I did was to five scum no shot of thinking I was doc. I am good at prs and it shows.<br><br>Night 2. i target rb again. frankly, this was a hard choice. i was pissed at the entire game and couldn't think of a likely nk. after enough analysis (Paul knows just how much effort I put into my night actions) I decided rb was the likely kill. any player with a brain would know that slot was town.  it was never getting lynched. it had an unknown factor via a sub which scum who are winning don't want. it was the best nk I could think of. so, I saved rb. then come day 3, twoinamillion is one of the less skilled beginners I've played with, but regardless I know he's town so I try to keep him from being stupid. scum know their kill was just blocked, so of course I can't be obvious about it like many are with their prs. i make sure to mention how he could be scum (do this after both saves) so scum don't believe I know theyre town as the doctor would. i decide to fish for scum by suggesting a mass claim, ensuring I go first so it never actually happens to gauge reactions. scum quickhammers and the day ends immediately. awesome. <br><br>we enter night 3. at this point this is one of the worst games I've been in and I'm thinking of subbing. i decide to stick it out and not play with most of you for a while. this save was the ahrdest.none of you as scum except maybe vedith are good enough to know that double targeting actually works in a scenario like that. i think about other possible targets. frog comes to mind; if scum want to lynch me they'll want to frame me. frog is a claimed pr as well and scum Will know they're town. so, after thinking for hours, I go frog confidently. turned out to be right call. now we have frog-me-rb slot in MY town block and a third of the game is town to me which is nice. the issue is that scum know someome blocked them twice and will be doc hunting. that's why frog is tossed into my pool earlier despite me not trying to push him. if I confidently townread him even for fake reasons scum Will get the hint and I'll die tn. of course, now I will anyways, but it's fine. I'll solve the game today I think. I'll iso flavor for partners after. next post will get into exactly why flavor is obvious scum and if you vote me over him as town you should quit mafia"}

I want to hear a scenario where none of them is (Thor claimed there is a chance?).<br>Why?<br>Because FL claims he got a \"no result\" from Eddie. Frog confirms that no one blocked FL last night, so the only scenario where a Loyaltown!CopFlavorLeaf gets the result, is when Eddie is scum. Scum FlavorLeaf could just speak the truth (loyal scum gets \"no result\" from town!Eddie), and scum!frog could lie that no one blocked FL. Realize that <span class=\"noboldsig\">none of them as townies have reason to lie.</span><br><br>I have trouble basing everything on TiaM's \"claim\", but I am going to trust it for now, because I do not think scum!TiaM has any reason not to claim night immunity for N1. I was sort of afraid of a BP-claim, but it didn't come.<br><br>Why was it so important for me to know that TiaM wasn't BP/commuter etc N1?<br>Because IF I assumed that Eddie was scum, visiting TiaM for a NK (and for specifically that) N1, there had to be a reason why TiaM (rb) didn't die.<br>I wanted to eliminate this simple step before continuing.<br>(There also has to be an explanation for Sunlit dying N1, and we should be fairly certain now that it was a scum-kill. SK was novice and I think most agreed that Vig could be too much)<br><br>Now I have already said I don't believe there to be any more protective/NK-immune roles other than Dunkers confirmed commuter, and either FL with his roleblockings and such or Eddie with Doc'ing.<br>It just feels excessive. So if you want to discredit this post or me overall, this is the first point to attack.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"> <br><br>Logical path A: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Eddie is a town doctor</span>. Notice that this path also suggests that frog is a town watcher, because Eddies claim was first, and frogs claimed night-actions support it. In this path Eddie is town, so scum!frog has absolutely no reason to back him up, when he could just avoid claiming anything on Eddies actions, rather than confirm them. <span class=\"noboldsig\">So if Eddie is town doc, frog is town watcher.</span><br>Eddies first action as Doc is to visit rb, and that also makes sense to me. He would want to protect the most obvious townie to him, and the most valuable player in his eyes. This path makes 100% sense to me as is and could also be the explanation for the consecutive no-kills. (as rb and frog are both very believable targets to me on those specific nights)<br><br>Logical path B: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Eddie is a scum doctor</span>. Now this is the weirdest possibility to me personally, but since it is allowed in normal games, I covered it in my mind. This would mean that N1 Eddie tried to save TiaM as scum too. I have reason to believe that unlimited-Doc in scums hands would want to keep his partner alive in a game where SK/Vig is a possibility, and therefore I believe that <span class=\"noboldsig\">if scum!Eddie saved TiaM -&gt; TiaM is his scumbuddy</span>. The chances of getting towncred from saving town!TiaM N1 from a kill, from a role he didn't know existed for sure? Not reasonable, considering his partner could use the saving in the 1% chance his partner gets capped by the same potential Vig. <span class=\"noboldsig\">So scum!Eddie saving TiaM would surely mean scum!TiaM.</span> This is the least likely path in my mind, but there is a chance, and in the case where Eddie would be forced to flip a scum doc, we would definitely need to go for TiaM next, so easy game from there.<br><br>Logical path C: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Flavor Leaf is a town JOAT.</span>"}

I have already stated in path B that IF Eddie is scum!doctor, I believe TiaM is almost automatically his buddy, so this would mean frog is town. It is possible though, that scum!frog claimed that FL wasn't r-blocked last night to strongly implicate his scumbuddy Eddie, and thus gain a huge distance in the scenario where Eddie gets lynched. Yet again though, I feel like this is more sub-optimal for scum!frog.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">In a more likely scenario scum!frog lied about FL not being roleblocked.</span> Understand, that this would still give town!FL the same result about a town!Eddie. This is also probably the worst scenario for Town moving forward, because there is no way for us to confirm it today, and it would mean that scum has a roleblocker to use for later nights. This also means, that if we lynch Eddie and he flips town, there is still a chance for FL to also flip town. And frog can't be made to fake his watch-action for next night, because he has claimed an odd-night role..<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">This scenario is also only likely to me when frog is scum, because town!Leafs night actions do not explain missed nightkills.</span> Doc-Eddies night actions do.<br><br>Logical path D: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Flavor Leaf is a scum (JOAT)</span> This claim makes the least sense combined with scum!alignment (with the given night actions). So scum!FL would have lied about them, or fake-claimed altogether. Therefore this isn't a scenario worth even observing, unless we have a rolecop investigation on him that confirms his role (?). JOAT could do so many things on any given night, that we have no reason to speculate what scum!FLeafJOAT would have done in this game so far.<br><br>Where does this leave me?<br>Assume that we are left with 50/50 about FL and Eddie. Assume that we can accept either of their roles to be true.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">If we lynch Eddie</span> we risk losing our Doc, who could potentially save someone on a future night (though not very likely anymore). And in the scenario where he flips town, we still don't know <br>which lied, frog or FlavorLeaf. What we then have to value is whether scum has a roleblocker (frog is scum) or FlavorLeaf lied (is much scum).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">If we lynch FlavorLeaf</span> we don't lose any night actions (all have been used). In the scenario where he flips town, we still don't know which lied, frog or Eddie. At this point we have to value whether scum has a roleblocker (frog is scum), or Eddie is scum (as proved by LoyalLeafs flip.)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">IF WE WERE TO LYNCH ANYONE ELSE, LETS SAY FOR EXAMPLE FROG</span> we don't lose any night actions the following night (not odd-night). In the scenario where frog flips town, we get confirmation on FL not being roleblocked. And this leaves scum as either FL+? or Eddie+TiaM. And since I have a hunch that we still have an investigative role unclaimed (which is why I didn't want massclaims yet!!) we can confirm either pair the following night. Also the scum would have to leave our doc alive (in the scenario where Eddie is doc) or confirm us that FL is scum. So we gain information any way.<br><br>I would lynch either frog(least risk imo) or FL (lesser risk) today, but not Eddie in any scenario for now.<br><br>Discuss and bash me if you feel like I'm full of shit, I go to sleep now and return in ~8 hours if I can."}

I'm now going to operate under the assumption that I'm getting mislynched for the first time in over 20 town games and I am normally confident but honestly with this game I don't care anymore. nobody even attempted to reply to my explained play, it was skipped over even though i have literally played around everything I've said and have the evidence to support it. nobody actually cares to read it, so whatever.<br><br>flavor is such obvious scum im dumbfounded how people aren't seeing it and nobody is even trying to say WHY I'm scummier.  first off, his claim is not a role that would ever be made. two protective and an investigative isn't a combination that will ever happen. he has admitted to roleblockong a town pr because he is the mafia roleblocker and wanted an out. since apparently thor and frog are experienced, they, along with vedith, apparently are going to pretend they don't have the experience to know this combination is not a thing. awesome. let's ignore thst for a second. lets also ignore an investigative and two protective not only doesn't exist with a doc but it also somewhat contrasts with even night watcher. let's also ignore flavors magical explanation for the lack of a nk last night is that scum recruited a traitor. let's ignore how exceedingly rare recruitable traitors are - after all, nobody here gets setups anyways. let's ignore how flavor is doing exactly what I said by killing frog since he clearly intended to fake a guilty on me. let's ignore thst the only reason town isn't losing is because I've stopped two kills. let's ignore that rb is obv town regardless and thinking he's scum is laughable. lets ignore flavor shoved the mislynch of a vig down our throats. yes, Mario flipped sk. no, mafia didn't know he was sk and therefore to them it was another mislynch. remember how flavor leaf quickhammered a town pr yesterday before a claim immediately after the 5th vote? sounds pretty scummy, right? let's ignore that too because this game is special. he clearly would've had to explain that, unless he was going to get lynched anyways... awfully convenient he returns from that with a guilty. let's ignore that. i townread flavor up until day 3, and even day 3 it wasn't a strong sr or anything. I'm not going to pretend his earlier content is obvious scum to me, even though mulch/Mario clearly saw it. there is obvious stuff with hindsight I can bring up if needed. why should you vote flavor over me if we ignore every other logical reason? i have single handedly carried town with rb getting fed up with you. my actions make perfect sense and so does my play which I went in great detail to explain. i coudlnt try hard before today at risk of nk. there were no other good buffers. if you seriously think I'm scum after rereading my play with what i said in mind, I don't expect you to listen to any of the above. <br><br>first of all. twoinamillion. you're new. and I mean NEW. in some dead pt you said you setup specced having never played forum mafia before or something like that. you need to listen to me. your claim might not help game solve, nom you are town so you claim last. your claim is needed for swtup spec purposes. we need to be able to analyze how balanced the setup is. the nrg approves the same level balance roughly and with a pr refusing to claim you are only hurting town. the nks are already lined up, me if I'm not mislynched today and frog after/if I'm lynched. you have nothing to lose. i saved you, and rb is one of the towniest games I've ever seen. i know you're town. you need to claim though. and another thing: you are being a dumbass when it comes to voting me. sorry, its true. vca is one of the most manipulatable things there are for scum and any good player will tell you that. ask around if you don't believe me.  not only that, but ironically, flavours voting is worse than me ANYWAYS. day 1 I voted the mislynch who self hammered while I was offline after being ran up while offline... and flavor was voting the counter wagon aka sd... who was ALSO TOWN. why is being on one town lynch worse than the other? this is ignoring I was not even supporting said lynch strongly and again it happened while I was offline.  day 2 he lynches sk. THAT'S NOT A SCUM LYNCH FOR VCA PURPOSES. you have to remember scum had literally no idea an sk existed. any potential scum that pushed Mario do not get rewarded for hitting an sk. actually, they do, because sk hurts scum as much as town (i don't remember actual stats). day 3, I vote dunker explicitly for a claim which I say. flavor hammers him the post after the l1 vote. no warning, intent, not even a fake accident. yet you're voting me for my votes? seriously dude. i get you're new. i have nothing against you as a person. I'm not even going to omgus you because you're lock town. please, please, try thinking logically. you need to put more thought here because this is probably whether scum wins or loses.<br><br>today, after we finish our mass claim with rb slot going last you can lynch in me and flavor. first of all, after I flip town you powerlynch flavor and then powerlynch wave. do not discuss your reads for the final scum assuming the game doesn't end.  dont let scum know who they should night kill. in the very off chance wave flips town (I'm close to certain he's scum) Paul is scum.  i genuinely can't force myself to see wave as town and that more than likely makes him scum. whhats cute is in 1786 flavor even acknowledges wave saving him. if people actually see logic and I know my effort won't be wasted, and we get some intents to vote fl, I'll case wave and rip the fuck into him.<br><br>my words to town after my likely mislynch. NEVER EVER LYNCH FROG AND TWOINAMILLION HERE. scum is in {flavor, wave, Paul, thor, una, gr}. flavor is undeniably one of them I don't have the time to hard iso for the partners atm even though I need to today since I'm getting lynched or nkd. i am fairly sure una is town because I doubt he takes his push on me earlier and defends me now. i need game replacement to start posting because he's the last hope I have for an experienced player (hey flavor I'm pocketing him xD) to set y'all straight. could be scum, haven't seen his scum game in fucking ages but I don't believe idling is a scum tell for him. hope his catchuo is good. my main reason for townreading him and thor is that I think the team is flavor/wave/paul. the last spot is the tossup. Paul has only been sheeping me on some parts... flipped town. that soesnt mean much as a stand alone. notice how he was on flavor and wave defended him? classic spreading. Paul voting me today is the most damning. he knows the quality of my play as prs, knows the quality of my reads, and the quick vote of me with almost nothing said means he's probably scum. i will guarantee the team is {flavor}, {wave/paul} and someone else including one of them. I'll try reading them as a team if I have time at some point. seriously listen to me. i get there's scenarios where i didnt heal rb n2. he is still town hard and if you lynch that slot... lol.<br><br>and as for all of my omgus. i have nothing against any of you, please don't feel bad about my posts, its not personal. i am used to playing with people who are a lot more experienced. i don't know who's actually playing horribly until post game. we can talk about it there if you want. the thing is, even if you did play horrible, its fine. lynching me is fine. people start somewhere. i havent been mislynched in like 20 town games and usually im confident but here i think my lynch will hapoen. thats perfectly ok. please actually learn from this game though. don't go to post and say \"well Eddie swore a lot and it's his fault he got lynched\". say \"damn, I fucked up. I'll take what went wrong here to my future games\". that much is enough to make this a bad game vs you a bad player. you can call this paragraph ate if ya want but I don't enjoy making games toxic as I have been a bit."}

Also, GR claimed Rolecop, why would Una need to investigate GR? Also, as of now, Una's the only full investigative role that claimed. Una's claim is literally the only full role in this game besides the doctor, when Wave is a flipped even night tracker, and both Frog/GR claimed odd night investigative. Also, Una posted about willing to \"hear you out\" after Mario said he could have confirmed himself as town, when Una knew that he wasn't going to flip town vigilante from that investigation, so what's the point of hearing him out if he should have been confirmed scum to you.  <br><br>Scum is Una and Frog.

I have spoken around 5 times this game, maybe more, of how there by no means should be a confirmed 3 scum on the same team this game due to the SK. I even linked a SK game to Eddie yesterday about a SK with a vig in the game as well, and guess what, there was a 2 scum team that game. Town has a lot of power this game, so I guess a 3 stack makes sense, especially with Eddie's traitor comments, as it makes it effectively 2 and a half scum members, and also can add to the thrill in a no kill setup."}

These are some posts that hopefully can help you out when reading me. I have constantly been posting about scum likely knowing the PR's as it was obvious at the time. There's a quote somewhere where I'm talking to RB, and I link Rb's name, too.

Have you not been reading the thread? If you're here, just ask and I'll explain every single one to you.<br><br>Game Replacement is a claimed odd night weak Role Cop, weak means he dies if he targets anything not town, so he knows I'm town.<br><br>Frog is an odd night watcher who claimed nobody targeted me Night 3, the same day GR got the result. I also got a No Result on my investigation on Eddie. I have the loyal modifier, which means my results will fail if I target scum, which means I'd get a No Result if I target scum. Eddie was town, which means I got role blocked, as there was no other possibility, and since Frog claimed nobody targeted me AFTER Eddie and I had both claimed, I can see why it made sense for ScumFrog to claim there, but he was caught out in the fact that GR targeted me successfully. Had GR not done that, they would have been able to mislynch both myself and Eddie, in any order. Had I been lynched yesterday, this would be Eddie in my spot.<br><br>Una is scum because he contradicted himself with his night action claims. Night 1 he said he got a 1-shot BP claim on Mario, yet when Mario claimed Vigilante, Una didn't call him out as lying, even went so far as to let him live and state his actions, and talked about not wanting to talk so that people wouldn't get side tracked. Night 2 he conveniently said he missed his action. Night 3 Thor is vanilla. Night 4, he said GR is Vanilla. This is the big one for me, actually. Una as town would have no need to investigate GR there. Una claimed to be a role cop, and if he were town, he would already know GR was lying, so this was a made up night action. <br><br>Thor is town, because if he was scum, he had no reason to not want you to vote me earlier. So Thor can only be scum if I am scum with him, if that makes sense. Mixed in with other play and whatnot, but yeah. Had you voted me, Thor could have just hammered and won the game, so I have Thor as lock town. <br><br>because of this, GR/Myself are in a direct 2v2 with Una/Frog. If there are 3 scum, that means 100% that one of Two and Paul are also scum. With one of the comments they made last page, it shows that either Una/Frog/Paul are the scum team, or Flavor/GR/Two is the scum team. We're in a direct 3v3 now.<br><br>This isn't just my conclusion either. This is the general consensus."}

It doesn't matter if it was before or not, and that was the entire point.<br><br>2) I have stated the exact opposite that my every case of mine has circular reasoning. Literally, the exact opposite. I stated YOUR cases have that, and mine don't, and I have also stated that as a difference between our plays, and this is absolutely not circular reasoning, as this post is using absolutely no zero bias. Sure, I know you are scum, but I'm making cases completely separate from that.<br>This also counters the point of your perspective talk, as I have been actively making non perspective cases, such as this, because this isn't a perspective case. This is me breaking down a case, and explaining to people why you are scummy. This could be done without any confbias.<br><br>3) Neither of us can say anything that is valid? What about actual scum hunting? What about making actual scum cases that don't involve conf bias? That is completely valid. <br><br>I have also stated that I will comment on anything I can to show I am town and actively make more cases that aren't conf bias. I have stated that I am not doing this to communicate with you guys; I don't care to communicate with you guys. This, right here, is me communicating to town. That mindset of yours shows that you see this as you and I communicating without other people involved. I don't see it that way at all, so I will continue if I am able to. You backing off of it is scummy because you see that I'm making actual cases.<br><br>4) What are you talking about with me and not caring about other assumptions? I have stated why I town read literally everyone else in the game besides you guys. Thor is town because he could have won the game if he were scum instead of actively trying to prolong the day. Two is town for leaning me, even voting me at the beginning of the day and the attempt to vote me later, and now willing to potentially accept that I'm town. I don't feel I need to explain GR why GR is town.<br><br>Also, I state that \"town doesn't do this\" and \"this is scummy\" because town doesn't do that and those posts I say it to are fucking scummy. Like, take out the \"Town doesn't do this\" posts. I explain in nearly every single one of my posts that I am calling something scummy in exactly why it is scummy. <br><br>This entire post by you is literally full of lies.<br><br>I have proven in this post that they are lies, with statements that can be backed up by just reading the game. <br><br>This is not just me saying \"nuh uh\" to your post. This is me completely explaining why your post is incorrect in explicit detail. Just because Frog states that I'm just \"nuh uh\"ing every thing he is saying, doesn't make it true. <br><br>If anything I am doing \"nuh uh, and here, let me tell you why. It's because......\" and then I go on and explain why. That is what people as town battling scum are supposed to do. Want to know why?

Remaining three, we are watching.</div></blockquote><br><br>K, I'll point out every lie in this post of his. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Okay, I am ready for this.</span></span></span><br><br>1) I didn't claim they were prior to my reasons, I said they are separate from the preconceived. It doesn't matter if it was before or not, and that was the entire point. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">That's not actually a lie on his part, and as a defense to his accusation your decision is apparently to start debating definitions as opposed to actually tackling his raised issue. I give this point to frog.</span></span></span><br><br>2) I have stated the exact opposite that my every case of mine has circular reasoning. Literally, the exact opposite. I stated YOUR cases have that, and mine don't, and I have also stated that as a difference between our plays, and this is absolutely not circular reasoning, as this post is using absolutely no zero bias. Sure, I know you are scum, but I'm making cases completely separate from that.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This rebuttal actually hurts my brain to read. Quite frankly I consider both of you as being functionally equally guilty of this so-called circular reasoning, and I wouldn't even call it circular reasoning in the first place, so debating which of you is \"more right\" in your identical raised issues is pretty meaningless to me. i consider it a null point.</span></span></span><br><br>This also counters the point of your perspective talk, as I have been actively making non perspective cases, such as this, because this isn't a perspective case. This is me breaking down a case, and explaining to people why you are scummy. This could be done without any confbias.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I may agree with that, though frankly I was making a perspective case to both you and frog and he at least listened to me, so to a certain extent that feels better to me. I think if either or both of you are town you're being really argumentative and not paying a lot of attention to provable facts and I think that issue is something that I wish neither of you were doing. I would call it a tie.</span></span></span><br><br>3) Neither of us can say anything that is valid? What about actual scum hunting? What about making actual scum cases that don't involve conf bias? That is completely valid. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I would agree with that...if either of you were doing it. He has a point, your case on him and Una is *exactly* as viable as his case on you and GR. In fact, the only really valid issue was yesterday, when Eddie should have never been the lynch target but both you and GR decided to ignore lynching frog for...reasons. To be perfectly frank, I'm still not entirely sure why you trust GR over frog - you actually don't seem to have a reason I understand for choosing that. From your perspective their claims should look equally plausible - just like they do to me. Also both seemed to have an agenda for lynching Eddie (something you seem to claim scum were setting up) I'm actually using non-claim relevant info (vote wagons) to draw my conclusions. Why do you like GR for town so strongly over frog? He could easily be the scum playing you right now, and frog is just an innocent watcher.</span></span></span><br><br>I have also stated that I will comment on anything I can to show I am town and actively make more cases that aren't conf bias. I have stated that I am not doing this to communicate with you guys; I don't care to communicate with you guys. This, right here, is me communicating to town. That mindset of yours shows that you see this as you and I communicating without other people involved. I don't see it that way at all, so I will continue if I am able to. You backing off of it is scummy because you see that I'm making actual cases.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I still note that not a single lie has been actually shown. Also, I frankly believe you're kinda lying (either to yourself or to everyone else) that you're talking with town to convince town by walling with frog.</span></span></span><br><br>4) What are you talking about with me and not caring about other assumptions? I have stated why I town read literally everyone else in the game besides you guys. Thor is town because he could have won the game if he were scum instead of actively trying to prolong the day. Two is town for leaning me, even voting me at the beginning of the day and the attempt to vote me later, and now willing to potentially accept that I'm town. I don't feel I need to explain GR why GR is town.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I would like to see you explain why GR is town, frankly. Two isn't town because of rb? That's the only reason he has me - his play has been pretty scummy if you ignore rb.</span></span></span><br><br>Also, I state that \"town doesn't do this\" and \"this is scummy\" because town doesn't do that and those posts I say it to are fucking scummy. Like, take out the \"Town doesn't do this\" posts. I explain in nearly every single one of my posts that I am calling something scummy in exactly why it is scummy. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I will guardedly agree you do this, though I will point out that just like yesterday when you lynched Eddie while I was shouting that it was illogical - if you're town you lie to yourself/don't understand what is or is not actually provable and scum motivated and it leads you down bad roads. That, or you're scum. But frog questioning your logic and methods seems pretty legit to me as a stance.</span></span></span><br><br>This entire post by you is literally full of lies.<br><br>I have proven in this post that they are lies, with statements that can be backed up by just reading the game. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">You actually really haven't - you've disagreed with his opinions of your play quality by offering your opinions of your play quality.</span></span></span><br><br>This is not just me saying \"nuh uh\" to your post. This is me completely explaining why your post is incorrect in explicit detail. Just because Frog states that I'm just \"nuh uh\"ing every thing he is saying, doesn't make it true. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Considering I asked both sides to zip it - I kind of agree with frog's assessment of the quality of the back and forth. Functionally I think both sides were just saying 'no u!' back and forth. There was not a lot of actual game analysis, otherwise both sides should have had two votes on frog and two votes on GR really quick - because those are by FAR the most logical and provable scum cases if you presume that 2+ of the PRs are lying. Una has since come in with a bit more of a direct counter to GR, but I'm not sure why you don't believe him over GR (or, frankly, why he's so sure you're lying even if GR is) but that's a headache for town later, hopefully after scum kill me for being slightly sane.</span></span></span><br><br>If anything I am doing \"nuh uh, and here, let me tell you why. It's because......\" and then I go on and explain why. That is what people as town battling scum are supposed to do. Want to know why? Because scum's job is to try and discredit the townie to get the rest of the town to agree with them, while town's job is to explain why scum are scum by pointing out why their push on them is crap, which I have done.<br><br>All you have done is post \"oh, we just are doing circular reasoning back and forth\", when just by reading the thread that is not true. Two even stated he thought my cases were stronger, which further pushes that.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I will agree that Two stated he liked your cases, even though he appears unable to describe why, I don't take that as a ringing endorsement of the back and forth.<br><br>What do you think of GR's answers to me thus far? he feels like he's trying to slip and slide my questions and not actually gamesolve with me. Do you agree/disagree with that and why? Also, why do you trust him so much? I see no reason for you to, what am I missing?</span></span></span></div></blockquote></div></div></div>"}

And now that I'm lock certain on Two being town, I stand by my Day 2 reasonings for town reading him even. As scum, there was no reason to risk targeting Rb the way they did it. I talked about this today, and said it would make sense as busing. I saw GR's play in general as townie, and I have nearly the entire game, since he replaced in anyways. The fact that he then went on to help me with Eddie, and isn't trying to lynch me at all, or attempt to get the votes off of him and onto me fits exactly with me being confirmed town in his eyes."}

Lemme explain.<br><br>So like i said i think frog/boon is the rest of team and are pushing each other to get cred fpr a mislynch that is me. If either gets lynched, they'll get tc and can use that next day to mislynch. Now the part about the nk. TiaM and I were being set up as final scum in yesterdays 2v2. We are probably the weakest players in the game as far as ability to defend and whatnot. The reason TiaM was killed was bcuz we were set up yesterday as having to be against each other. So with him flipping town, im the easy to push third scum with either frog or boon depending on who wins todays 1v1 and gets the tc. TiaM is much more wild then me on his voting and is kind of stubborn with not the best reasoning. I however am the more sheepy player and was left alive to be setup as a mislynch or too be manipulated in mylo/lylo.<br><br>Tldr frog and boon are pushing each other to get tc to mislynch me. TiaM was killed bcuz he is more wild and this points to me as most likely final scum since thor is being treated as practically confirmed.<br><br>Another thing. Two seems more stubborn and seems to think that scum always vote town. Like the way he does VCA is overly simplistic. So in order to mislynch him, he'd meet them with much stronger resistance than me and/or fake a guilty from frog due to boon's fakeclaim. A fake guilty on me isnt even needed as im the most sred by everyone minus who they believe in frog/boon.<br><br>sorry ik its jumbled/hard to understand."}
