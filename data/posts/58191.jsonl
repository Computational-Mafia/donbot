Among you, however, are some not-so-goodnicks who plan to get As by killing everyone else. O no! This is an unusual sort of class where that kind of thing is allowed. Lynching is also cool, so you can do that too.<br>\n<br>\nThere will also be exciting facts from neuroscience included in the vote counts which have absolutely nothing to do with the game of mafia. No matter how academically adept you are, the only way to get an A in kagami's class is to fulfill your win condition. You can get an A posthumously, too, because that's just the kind of magnanimous instructor kagami is.<br>\n<br>\nAll dead people who aren't on the winning team get a B-, because of grade inflation. No one fails at anything but being alive. <br>\n<br>\nNow, let's learn Neuroscience! ...and lynch people.<br>\n</div><br>\n</div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive and Victorious!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';

He correctly surmised that the brain had an important role in sensation and intelligence because of all the nerves that connected the sensory organs to the brain. <br>\n<br>\nAround 200 AD, the Greek physician Galen noticed a major difference between two parts of the brain, the cerebellum (the bally thing near the brainstem) is hard and the cerebrum (the wrinkly part that we usually think of) is soft. He figured that the cerebellum must therefore command the muscles, while the cerebrum is soft so the sense and memory can be imprinted onto it. The reasoning is pretty silly, but the conclusion is pretty much right. <br>\n<br>\nHe also believed that the fluid filled ventricles of the brain were where sensations are registered which is pretty much completely wrong.

The first is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=28540\" class=\"postlink\">Rob13's normal last year</a>--which I feel is going to be the closest parallel to this game on site, and the other is <a href=\"http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/outside-magic/mafia/549368-deusex-mafia-game-over-springtime-for-sarif\" class=\"postlink\">this recent 12p mini on MTGS</a>. Now, these might be very odd games to pull chords from, but they're what I immediately bring to mind--I'm fairly certain we're looking at 9-2-1 at the moment and we have an...excess of night actions. <br>\n<br>\nNow, where was I? Kagami is a very mechanical player when it comes to setups--she loves them in a similar way to me, but she keeps a mechanism to them reminiscent of FakeGod(who I feel has a lack of respect for player behavior and focuses purely on a numbers game). Kagami isn't as much into numbers as she is into actions, per say and a load of light night actions make sense--in such a format where we will have a glut of weak abilities, that means by definition a lot of protective/blocking actions and thus it's easy to ratchet up the kill count and add an SK. This game was likely built around one kill a night with a single additional kill one of the nights due to protective etc actions. Multiball makes little sense to me mostly due to the Review Group being pansies, especially given all the people who would allow a multiball game to exist are currently pushed to the sidelines in the NRG meta sense(i've discussed that with you before I think). <br>\n<br>\nI would propose a setup that I would think fits Kagami's inclinations, but I'm unsure how much we want that out in the open on page one.<br>\n<br>\nDid that, um, go anywhere?<br>\n(I actually find it odd you consider multiball before Serial Killer, by the way)</div></div></div>", "time": "Sat Jun 21, 2014 5:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

Firstly, you need to have a fairly thin section of brain in order to view it under a microscope, but because neural tissue has a consistency not unlike Jello, it's really hard to slice. So we general have to \"fix\" brain tissue by immersing it in a substance that will cause it to harder. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, this was typically done with formaldehyde.<br>\n<br>\nNow you've sliced up a brain, what does it look like? Well, it looks like nothing. The neurons all have a uniform, creamy color and that's all you'll see. We need to \"stain\" individual neurons to look at them, and fairly sparsely. If you stain too many neurons in the tissue, you'll never be able to tell individual neurons apart, and it will look like a huge mess.<br>\n<br>\nGolgi discovered that soaking brain tissue in a silver chromate solution gave pretty awesome results. Only a few neurons in the tissue would take in the silver, and the silver would spread through the entirety of the neuron, allowing one to see the whole thing under a microscope. We could finally see what a brain cell looks like!<br>\n<br>\nHere's a golgi stained slice of neural tissue:<br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NzZSurO.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nOddly enough, no one really know why this stain works the way it does.</div></div></div>", "time": "Sun Jun 22, 2014 1:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

Kagami is a very mechanical player when it comes to setups--she loves them in a similar way to me, but she keeps a mechanism to them reminiscent of FakeGod(who I feel has a lack of respect for player behavior and focuses purely on a numbers game). Kagami isn't as much into numbers as she is into actions, per say and a load of light night actions make sense--in such a format where we will have a glut of weak abilities, that means by definition a lot of protective/blocking actions and thus it's easy to ratchet up the kill count and add an SK. This game was likely built around one kill a night with a single additional kill one of the nights due to protective etc actions. Multiball makes little sense to me mostly due to the Review Group being pansies, especially given all the people who would allow a multiball game to exist are currently pushed to the sidelines in the NRG meta sense(i've discussed that with you before I think). <br>\n<br>\nI would propose a setup that I would think fits Kagami's inclinations, but I'm unsure how much we want that out in the open on page one.<br>\n<br>\nDid that, um, go anywhere?<br>\n(I actually find it odd you consider multiball before Serial Killer, by the way)</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nYou're efforting rather much for it not being Day 2+, nati-chan.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965159#p5965159\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965159#p5965159\" data-post-id=\"5965159\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 21</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24164\">Aneninen</a> wrote:</cite>My dice are rolled. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fat_Tony</span><br>\n<br>\nReason: that's the only username containing an understrike ( _ ).<br>\n<br>\nI'm reading your posts as soon as I can.</div></blockquote>\nThis post is gross.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965218#p5965218\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965218#p5965218\" data-post-id=\"5965218\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 24</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23899\">BlueBloodedToffee</a> wrote:</cite>Hello to all.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965182#p5965182\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5965182#p5965182\" data-post-id=\"5965182\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 22</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8773\">Fat_Tony</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nQuestion for everyone: How experienced are you at the game both on- and off-forum?</div></blockquote>\n\nI have only played two newbie games, this is my first game outside of Road to Rome.

It would be too suspicious after emphasizing the word \"maybe\" like that.  His capitalization of \"maybe\" also drew a ton of attention to that post.

It could be bussing, that's fair and perhaps a bit of a blind spot of mine...I've just found that scum rarely start early wagons on their buddies that they actually want to go through.

Basically, neurons talk to each other (typically) with chemical signals, while they conduct signals down their dendrites and axons electrically. <br>\n<br>\nSo let's talk about electrical charge and what a neuron is up to when it's just chilling in extracellular fluid.<br>\n<br>\nA neuron is surrounded by a membrane that keeps some stuff in and keeps other stuff out. It also has little gates, called ion channels, that can let certain ions through. The extent to which the channels allow ions to pass through is called the membrane's permeability to that ion. <br>\n<br>\nOk, what ions are important? Basically there's potassium (K+), Sodium (Na+), and Chloride (Cl-). There's also calcium, but in pretty small concentrations that aren't relevant here. At rest, there's lots of K+ inside the neuron, and lots of Na+ and Cl- outside. This is probably because the circulatory systems creatures have evolved are basically acting as a replacement for being surrounded by seawater (which has lots of salt, NaCl). There are also some other anions that hang out outside of the cell and <br>\n<br>\nSo let's imagine my membrane is permeable only to Na+. What happens? Basically, all the Na+ that's outside would want to flow in, because chemicals like to flow from more densely concentrated regions to less densely concentrated regions. As it does that, though, a charge builds up. The more Na+ goes into the cell, the more positively charged the cell becomes. As a result, because positively charged ions don't want to go into a positively charged cell, an electrical force starts pushing against the inward force of the Na+ diffusion. These forces eventually perfectly counteract each other, leaving the cell with a net change in potential.<br>\n<br>\nThis potential is called the Nernst Potential of an ion. The Nernst potential of Na+ is around 62 mV, so a cell that is only permeable to Na+ will quickly reach a potential of 62 mV. Neurons, however, are also permeable to K+, which has a potential of -80 mV (it's negative because the concentration of K+ is higher inside, so the positive ions want to leave the cell). So what's the resting potential of a cell? It's somewhere in between -80mV and 62mV, but where? This is determined by <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">how</div> permeable the cell is to the different ions. At rest, neurons are much more permeable to K+ than Na+, so it's closer to -80mV. <br>\n<br>\nAt rest, a neuron has a potential of around -65mV.</div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Jun 23, 2014 11:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

Essentially, the cell starts at -65ish mV in it's resting state. As the cell \"depolarizes\" (becomes more positively charged), Na+ channels open up. As a result, the permeability of Na+ ions through the membrane shoots way up, and they all rush in, causing the potential of the cell to lean more toward the Nernst potential of Na+ (65 mV). <br>\n<br>\nThe Na+ channels close after being open for a little while, so the permeability of Na+ relative to K+ drops down again. Lots of K+ leaves because the cell has become too positive for them to want to hang out anymore, causing the potential of the cell to drop down to normal.

The one hydra I played in with roflcopter it wasn't a pre-planned choice but as scum it is what our playstyle evolved into.

He posted nothing about MDD in his previous posts.<br>\nRight now I'm unsure whether I wanted to answer that sentence you quoted to Hiraki at all.<br>\n<br>\nI only remember that someone responded something on MDDs' \"scumhunt reads\" and I wanted to point out that his posts are inconsistent therefore we shouldn't care about them. I hope that I'm gonna find that part. Even worse, it's also possible that I simply misread something again. <br>\n<br>\nOh My Gods! You thought that I fudged your questions. I simply didn't understand the situation. Now I can see your point. Try to see mine: I asked \"why would anyone think that I'm defending a player whom I found useless and I bet, who finds me annoying?\" The answer for my question is your quote. The answer for your question is this post.</div></blockquote>\n\nIs this the only part you're going to respond to from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5972133#p5972133\">228</a>?

It was the fact that Garruk and Muffinman were also both unsorted but they both had extra comments on what you think they should be doing to be 'sorted'. MDD had nothing, he was just unsorted with no further comment. You're intentionally trying not to provide a read on MDD, I find this scummy.</div></blockquote>\n\nFirst of all I DID try getting a read on MDD, even if I admitted that I was ingoring their posts. (Excluding those parts in which they quoted me. [sarcasm] Those were <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">super-informative</div>, on the other hand. [/sarcasm].) Search it back, I thought that being insconsistent is a town-tell. Then Konowa told that it could be a scum-tell as well. Due to the latter post changed my read back to unsorted.<br>\nBut, don't worry, I'll read MDDs' posts too as soon as I have time. It seems that I should stop ignoring them.<br>\n<br>\nI've already explained that \"missing comment\". I didn't think that I should repeat myself like \"Inconsistent, thatswhy unsorted\".<br>\n<br>\nAnd why did I focus on the part which was quoted by someone else too? Isn't it obvious? I didn't understand the logic behind that \"defending MDD\" subject. I thought that it was clear that they're definitely not among my favorite players. When I saw that someone had quoted it I started pondering \"what if BBT <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">really</div> thinks that I'm performing some soft-defense\"? Then I re-read the post you quoted. And some others. (Before that I had posted that short post from my mobile, showing that \"I noted the question, working on the answer\".)

The first is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=28540\" class=\"postlink\">Rob13's normal last year</a>--which I feel is going to be the closest parallel to this game on site, and the other is <a href=\"http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/outside-magic/mafia/549368-deusex-mafia-game-over-springtime-for-sarif\" class=\"postlink\">this recent 12p mini on MTGS</a>.

Kagami is a very mechanical player when it comes to setups--she loves them in a similar way to me, but she keeps a mechanism to them reminiscent of FakeGod(who I feel has a lack of respect for player behavior and focuses purely on a numbers game). Kagami isn't as much into numbers as she is into actions, per say and a load of light night actions make sense--in such a format where we will have a glut of weak abilities, that means by definition a lot of protective/blocking actions and thus it's easy to ratchet up the kill count and add an SK. This game was likely built around one kill a night with a single additional kill one of the nights due to protective etc actions. Multiball makes little sense to me mostly due to the Review Group being pansies, especially given all the people who would allow a multiball game to exist are currently pushed to the sidelines in the NRG meta sense(i've discussed that with you before I think). <br>\n<br>\nI would propose a setup that I would think fits Kagami's inclinations, but I'm unsure how much we want that out in the open on page one.<br>\n<br>\nDid that, um, go anywhere?<br>\n(I actually find it odd you consider multiball before Serial Killer, by the way)</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nI think you have a greater appreciation for the nuances of SK design than most game designers.

These containers are called vesicles. Now, remember all that stuff about ion channels way back~ I mentioned that there's calcium floating around and it's not very important for the resting neuron. It's important now.<br>\n<br>\nThere are Calcium (Ca2+) channels in the presynaptic butons of neurons that open once the buton is depolarized. This causes Ca2+ to rush in (these is very very little calcium inside the neurons normally). This calcium influx is the signal that tells the neuron to release its neurotransmitter.<br>\n<br>\nPostsynaptically, the neurotransmitter binds to receptors that often are also ion channels, causing them to open. Sometimes there an indirect mechanism, but the result is roughly the same, an ion binds to a receptor causing an ion channel to open. Excitatory neurotransmitters usually open Na+ channels, while inhibitory neurotransmitters usually open Cl- channels. As a result, ions rush in and change the voltage potential of the post-synaptic cell.</div></div></div>", "time": "Thu Jun 26, 2014 3:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

So you're saying it can be difficult to develop a solid read so early in the game? But you town-read Scarab. This town-read is justified by no reasons whatsoever (other than appeasement). I keep asking you and you keep saying 'I don't think he was scum so he's town but I don't have any reasons for why he's town.<br>\n<br>\nYou said town vs town. You didn't say 'Leaning town', 'I'm starting to think you're town' or 'I'm getting a town vibe' or anything along those lines. You said town vs town.

I still think he was forming scum reads awfully fast right off the mark, but overall it feels like a playstyle thing.<br>\n<br>\nScarab - 2nd game with him and I want to review it.

So far he is reminding me a lot of his first MS game, which I replaced into on day 1. he was town, but he didn't come under a lot of pressure early in that game iirc.  however, he did some srs tunneling, played zealously and showed that he had done a lot of homework prior to the game and was eager to try out stuff he'd read about.

He replaced in on day 2, into a slot that had claimed PR and gotten scum lynched on day 1 thanks to Who's N1 gunsmith guilty.  It wasn't a super-active game.  He made 60+posts.

What I'm seeing here is 5 posts over the week-ish, and the posts are low engagement and a little longer.

So while something like \"Hi everyone, someone tell me what to do\" is more disruptive than it is anything else, I see it as more likely \"Hey guys, I'm here to post, what do you need me for?\" than \"I don't know what to do, but I need to post to fit in\".

I can understand why he's pinging for some players, and some of the players who are pursuing him look town in the way they are doing it.  That's separate from my read of him.  I'm assuming he's inexperienced based on bits and pieces about his approach to the game.  If I'm wrong about that, then I'd be wrong for townreading him on the basis I'm using.

{"number": 806, "id": "6005746", "user": "Lowercase", "user_id": "23069", "content": "Since I was asked for reads:<br>\n<br>\nScarab- Town.  His initial reaction to cadb's post seemed pretty natural.  I also like posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5966301#p5966301\">68</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5966563#p5966563\">76</a>, which aren't really huge posts but seem like someone trying to figure the game out.  Update:  I didn't put this in for obvious reasons but based on early day 1 posts, I thought it was possible that scarab and reinoe were masons/lovers which seems to have not been the case.<br>\n<br>\nGarruk/Fitz- Lean town.  I don't think an early day one soft-claim is likely as scum; the slot would probably have to claim on day 2, then they have a high chance of being countered or lynched anyway if they claim something silly like BP.  I only know a little about Natirasha and basically nothing about MSSK, so I don't know if replacing out is alignment indicative.  Update: I kind of expected him to be a body guard based on his first post.<br>\n<br>\nzMuffinMan- Null-town.  I tend to follow Kagami's games and Muffin was in touhou u-pick 2 and touhou: mafia in the land of fantasy, where he survived to endgame as scum with a pretty good number of townreads in both cases.  For this reason, I trust my ability to read him less than I would with other players.  That said, I think he's been a pro-town presence in general and find claims that he hasn't been doing anything to be a little skeevy.  Update:  The fact that Garruk was scum doesn't really mean much to me.  But I thought he was sort of dickish to a couple slots in a way that might have been a liability to scum if he wanted to make it to endgame.  Towner than before.<br>\n<br>\nBBT- Lean town. His first comment is a little bit scummy, I don't know how I feel about his second post but I definitely don't like the responses to it.  I don't doubt that BBT didn't attach a vote because he was afraid of being accused of OMGUS (which eventually happened anyway), which might imply an unhealthy amount of survivalism.  Cadb's response takes what is at best mildly scummy and frames an argument in a way such that it is completely impossible to respond to (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5965251#p5965251\">33</a>).  His push on Aneninen looked pretty town to me.  Update:  I agree with recent posts about BBT and I'm aware that he voted me without explicit reasoning in about the same way as Fat_Tony, but I'm just don't really feel the case on him/.<br>\n<br>\nReinoe- Town.  I think his first post is too hamfisted to be an attempt at scum-town buddying.  Mentioning the freudian slip thing and never bringing it up again is pretty close to something I did in my first game on-site, it looks to me like just an attempt to show that he was thinking something about the game.  I haven't really read most of his posts directed at Hiraki, but aside from claiming slayer's gambit, I don't see a problem.  Update:  Wasn't really thinking much about him at all for reasons stated in Scarab read.<br>\n<br>\nHiraki- Lean town.  I generally think his posts have a town vibe.  Toward the end of his argument with Reinoe his insults seemed to indicate that he thought Reinoe was bad-town instead of scum, hence my question at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5977720#p5977720\">423</a>.  His answer was fine, and my thought process was probably a little paranoid anyway.  Update:  Not much has changed here really.<br>\n<br>\nKonowa- Lean town.  I don't remember all that much about him.  His point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5967613#p5967613\">105</a> is similar to my own thoughts on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5965251#p5965251\">33</a> and I think in general he makes pretty good points.  Update: not much to say here.<br>\n<br>\nSlots that I had not gotten to yet:<br>\n<br>\nAneninen: Prob town. I didn't really want to change my read on him much because people were calling me out on it honestly, but I think the slot is probably town; at the time, I wanted to know if his Reinoe case came from a town mindset.  His response didn't really answer my question, but I still feel better about his slot now.<br>\n<br>\nMDD: Flipped mason. I didn't really like the way he was passing out town reads in day one;  They seemed stronger and less warranted than I would expect from town, but obviously he was a mason so not much to say about that.<br>\n<br>\nFat_Tony: Scum. My position on him hasn't changed much since the post specifically about him.<br>\n<br>\nFferyllt: Lean scum.

(I mean, he's not faking it, he really wants to find scums.) Paradox but true, his Day1 case against me even strengthens this read. Mark: 1<br>\n<br>\nHiraki &#8211; hmmm... he used to appear town-ish but his recent posts, especially that fake-Vig claim was a thing, which I didn't like. Right now I don't know what to think. His general activity (higher than average) is one more town tell, on the other hand (in this particular game, see my remark below!) Mark: 3<br>\n<br>\nReinoe &#8211; Having metaread him a bit his posts are mostly about \"being Reinoe\" (in other words: he appears to be scum even if he's not). His latest posts (basicly almost anything above 900) contain good thoughts. Maybe I was wrong about him before...? Mark: 2<br>\n<br>\nFat_Tony &#8211; Strange. I don't think he's scum. He used to give away \"town wibes\" which might have stopped later due to his IRL things. But, it IS possible that he's a SK. A problem with the latter statement is that we don't know whether we have a SK at all... Mark: 1 (...but if we DO have a SK, for that it's at least 4!)<br>\n<br>\nFferyllt &#8211; Consistent, town-wibe Day1 but that has been ruined a bit Today as for her latest post. (Eg. in 912 the \"even town-me\"... excusemeWTF). Mark: 3 (Though, it's not very likely that she and Lowercase are scum partners, see eg. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6025102#p6025102\">920</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6025161#p6025161\">922</a>...)<br>\n<br>\nMuffin &#8211; Trolling and acting as if he had done something. He would be my best scum tip &#8211; but, he was the one who pushed the Day1 the hardest. And HavingFitz was a scum. (And I don't think Day1 bussing is a good strategy). Mark: 2<br>\n<br>\nScarab &#8211; Nnnnno, I strongly disbelieve that his ask for being replaced is a town-tell. See the part below! That slot is a possible scum-shot. Mark: 4<br>\n<br>\nLowercase &#8211; Where is he at all? Was he on V/LA? No posts = no reads. But, I remember that he was my strongest scumread before my V/LA. Mark: 4.<br>\n<br>\n(3) I think it's hard to get useful and stabile reads because there are too few posts and many of the posts contain no useful info at all. (Yes I know, this goes for my posts as well.) I'm strongly afraid that only the scums can make profit out of this phenomenon: they don't really need to do anything, they can get some \"chips-and-coke\" and wait 'till the townies lynch themselves. I know that this part might not be true and it's only my intuition.<br>\nBut still, I would search for scums amongst the least active players. In general. (Yes, this includes the Scarab slot too, maybe he realized that as a scum his best strategy is doing nothing, which is boring. I'm not saying that I'm sure in it but it is a possibility.)<br>\n<br>\nI've been in a hurry but this post has been the best I've been able to write now.", "time": "Sun Jul 20, 2014 2:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

Also, Fat Tony mentioned something about him suddenly becoming confident and with daytalk, that seems pretty telling. I don't like his posts much today, especially with the shade he's casting on muffin. Also, Fat Tony is shady, but BBT's obsession with calling him SK seems out of place. I'm thinking BBT has two scumbuddies (Fitz and one more) and knows this <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">isn't</div> multiball, so he's accusing Fat Tony of being a serial killer instead. Otherwise, I don't know why he would jump to that of all things. Scumread here.<br>\n<br>\nLowercase - He seems like an easy lynch, but for a good reason? He is a lurksack with barely any content and poor reads. Plus, he randomly showed up after ffery called him out on something and that's never good. I also found it strange that of the four people he didn't get to on his reads list, both people he actually voted throughout the course of the game (Anneneneinienin and Fat Tony) were in that group of four. (Discounting his RVS vote for Cabd of course) You would think he would solidify his reads there first. Scumread here too.<br>\n<br>\nzMuffinMan - Strongest townread. He pushed for Nati early and although he wasn't pushing for it throughout the day, he was always willing to lynch him. Plus, he's had some really good posts and I feel it in my gut that he's town. And other reasons I don't want to share.<br>\n<br>\nHiraki - He's had arguments with both reinoe and BBT and I've agreed with him in both of them. He has sound logic and can defend himself against accusations against him. I'm townreading him. Also, you kept saying you would look at BBT v Anneinnin. I might have just missed that part but did you ever get to it? <br>\n<br>\nFat Tony - Probably the biggest enigma for me. No actually that's annenenenininnn. Anyway, I thought Fat Tony was pretty solidly town for day 1 but his day 2 has been suspicious. Talking about four possible scum is weird and his explanation is a little fishy, though plausible. I don't see him as scum with fitz though. If this does turn out to be multiball and another team shows up, he'll jump up on my suspect list.<br>\n<br>\nreinoe - If I hadn't played with him before he would be a strong scumread, but he's just soooo different than the last time. He tried to derail the fitz wagon after fitz's horrible posts, asks other people for direction, votes for people I'm townreading (muffin, Hiraki), and gets hung up on something as insignificant as Hiraki calling him \"elusive\". It seems like he's disconnected from the majority of players and trying to skate by by just arguing with a few people here and there. I don't think he's trying to find scum. He's another scumread.<br>\n<br>\nfferyllt - She's a townread of mine. Her questions have been helpful and inquisitive and I feel like she's actually scumhunting. She also seems to pick up on things I pick up on myself, which is always nice. I do have a question for her regarding Fat Tony that I asked in my spoilered portion that I would like answered. Otherwise she seems logical and intelligent.<br>\n<br>\nRight now I'd vote for Lowercase, reinoe, or BBT (in that order) but since Lowercase is being replaced that seems futile until a replacement comes.<br>\n<br>\nSo<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: reinoe</span>", "time": "Sun Jul 20, 2014 3:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

In retrospect, this early scumread is rubbish.  Null up as far as post 70 where he clarifies his position on MDD with a vote.  Weirdly tries to link me with MDD in post 94 but again explains this out sarcastically (sarcasm is a super tool on the internet) over the following few posts. <br>\n<br>\nIn 106 says he is scumreading me (for voting him) - also addresses a weird (and rare!) post from Konowa.  Can understand the scumread based on the fact that I completely missed his sarcasm in some of his early posts (26, 96 for example). His explanations are methodical and at this point he reads town.  Does some useless shit with muffin for a while.<br>\n<br>\nIn 218 he turns his guns on Anen based on some confusing read-stuff on Scarab.  This goes on and on until 487 where he sort of just... gives up.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Q: BBT, where do you stand on Aneninen at the moment? No, wait, you recently posted reads and said he's town.  Why is he town now?</div><br>\n<br>\nIn 488 he decides to sheep muffin and run up lowercase (now... Thor?) a bit without much explanation. Then starts asking muffin if he is rolefishing, apparently expecting to get some sort of answer. In 575 he asks some good questions of Hiraki.  Continues to press for answers to specific questions in 615.  At this point I am confident that I am reading a town-aligned player.<br>\n<br>\nIn 618 he implies the lowerThor wagon was a bit scummy and hits the MDD wagon and keeps pressing muffin on rolefishing etc, asks why we are running up a possible PR in 680.<br>\n<br>\nEnd of day 1 and the transition to the Fitz wagon is weird.  I think it is worth questioning why he was so reluctant to make the switch.  For my part, I was almost policy-antagonising muffin.  He was refusing to be helpful to me by imparting his powerful scumhunting tactics, so I was being stubborn.  Not sure what BBT was doing though and wouldn't mind his take on it. <br>\n<br>\n812 reads weirdly.  He expresses confusion at Hiraki and then votes me?  It just reads oddly.  Then Hiraki does the weird fakeclaim thing.  Then BBT votes me AGAIN without unvoting me.  Which is just weird. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n888 accuses me of contradiction (I can see why, but I don't feel what I said was strictly contradictory - softened from obvtown to pretty town), but softens his view on me and says my explanation \"somehow feels town\". 889 votes Hiraki seemingly based off my argument for one of Hiraki and reinoe being scum, plus Hiraki's weird attack on BBT at the start of D2 based on him mentioning the NKs (Cardinal sin!).<br>\n<br>\n923 gives up on pushing Hiraki, and 934 decides I'm an SK? Which feels super odd.  And that reinoe is scum.  Which seems less odd.<br>\n<br>\n945 - wait, hold up - didn't it \"somehow feel town\"? *reads back* Oh wait, so you're not happy with it but it feels town?  So you're not happy with me seeming town there?  This confuses me.<br>\n<br>\n974 - Gets on reinoe-wagon, then disappears into prodworld and is annoyed that I noticed??? <br>\n<br>\n1113 - not sure who you are addressing in this post BBT.  Also, do you think I'm scum or am I still an SK to you?  just so I know what I'm accused of.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then we have our recent weird interaction.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOverall, I believe BBT is town, although some of his Day 2 play has struck me as being a bit odd.  I absolutely do not support a BBT lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nFrom this ISO I want to take a closer look at Anen and Hiraki in particular.  BBT has had really interesting (or at least protracted) interactions with both of you, and I'm not sure that in either case his questions were truly adequately addressed.<br>\n<br>\nQuestions from within the cut if you don't want to fight a massive Wall of Text (TM) - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BBT, why do you now have Aneninen as a townread?

Not to mention, the conclusion is completely unreasonable.<br>\n<br>\nWhy couldn't Elyse think that Fat Tony was scum with someone else? You can have scumreads but not make the connections. Honestly, I find that making connections between plausible scum is completely useless. Even once scum flips, it's not very helpful for town and is more helpful for scum. I'm sure there's a bunch of debate at the discussion forums (which I never read) for it.<br>\n<br>\nYou then call yourself dumb for it and unvote. The reason I went through that is because I don't think a majority of the game understands how much grabbing there was here. I can understand if Thor just read something wrong but the lack of explanation doesn't justify it. I wasn't ready to kill Thor at this moment but it did put some sirens on his name.<br>\n<br>\nAP even states that here:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>AP wrote:</cite>Thor feels very Un-Thor this game and I don't know what to make of it. He seems to be everyone's go to scumread today and I kind of understand that give my previous statement, but I don't know how to feel about it right niw. I should probably rectify that.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>Regardless of your reputation and skill, you will look bad if you push an easy mislynch. Your current standing in this game isn't too strong and you would definitely be extra cautious with your votes and pursuits.</div></blockquote>I understand how this looks bad. It's like one of those old time mafia boss movies. I don't see how it's scummy enough for a push in the least.<br>\n<br>\nThe problem with the Elyse/Thor lynch is that it's based off of Elyse' opinion. I'm okay with a lynch based on that if it has scummy presence. When it's creative thinking, there should be no penalty. I've done the same in many town and scum roles and I don't think that there's much of a change between those roles.<br>\n<br>\nI completely agree with the following two quotes:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>If I assumed one way or the other, you would vote me for not being open to all possibilities and accuse me of having inside knowledge or something.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>I thought he said 4. <br>\n<br>\nIt is time to spare.<br>\n<br>\nIt looks bad to hammer without a claim, ESPECIALLY someone who already claimed a PR.<br>\n<br>\nAlso are you seriously arguing the second part? I used public knowledge to entertain the possibility of a third party. I still don't know what the setup is. That's it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>AP wrote:</cite>Huh it looks like there are 3 concrete pieces of information that you are using.

I expect better from you than this shit.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hiraki wrote:</cite>I feel more confident in my vote on Thor because he and Elyse are voting on really bullshit stuff.</div></blockquote>I want to come back to this to clarify that I think Elyse's and Thor's votes are shit but I think Thor's vote is scummy and Elyse's vote is clouded in too much theory.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Anienien wrote:</cite> Nnnnnnnnnnn, Elyse, nnnnnnnnnnnn!

(It's like \"anyone can be the SK, why not try this lynch?\") Also, the quicker the players die the more chance has the SK and with a living scum faction there are more Nightkills in general. It's especially good for an SK to have a living scum faction in the game if the SK also has an X-shot Bulletproof ability too. (That would be a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possible</div> reason for the Bulletproof Mafia in the setup.)

His posts were anti-town Yesterday. His recent posts haven't impressed me at all. Eg. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6074307#p6074307\">1457</a> about \"diplomacy\". <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076742#p6076742\">1479</a> about pointing out that he's never played SK. (Frankly, having an SK in a setup is rare. Even if there is one the probability of getting that role is lower than to get a scum role. I think there are many players who haven't played SK so far.) Spotting a single expression/word in an ESL-player's post and using it as a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">single</div> argument for giving a vote is an Auto-FoS from my side. (By the way: the same will go for playing the \"language barrier\" card against me. Deal with it because this will go for all of my forthcoming games and I have damm good reasons for acting like this.) But, that's not all. Hiraki has been nightkilled. AP's slot had a constant fight with Hiraki before and the main reason why I found Reinoe's rage-replaceout post scummy(SK-y &#8211; see my explanation above!) was the fact that he raged against Hiraki as well who hadn't been involved in our conversation by that time at all!!!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BBT</div> &#8211; unsure. His late-Day2 vote on AP was odd. He keeps his vote on Tony while he \"soft-fights\" Muffin. As if he weren't cared who would be lynched. (? &#8211; I'm not sure about the latest sentence.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fferyllt</div> &#8211; most probably town. Nothing scummy here. By the way, as for your post: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076784#p6076784\">1487</a> you can find my reasons for thinking someone is scum/SK/whatever-antitown-faction above in this post. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elyse</div> &#8211; lean town. Since Thor flipped scum it's unlikely that Elyse is the SK (or a scum, if we have that). As for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6074286#p6074286\">1455</a>: that summarizes my thoughts as well about the topic perfectly.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tony</div> &#8211; unsure. Too few posts with too little content Today. This might mean that he's lurking as an SK (?). Though, I don't find his Day1/Day2 particularly anti-town (scummy/SK-y).

I agree that it seems as if she's playing it safe today and not really going after anyone. It's valid and I definitely see the argument that she could be waiting for a wagon to pop up and then jump on it, or at least wait to see where the wind is blowing. <br>\n<br>\nBut, as muffin more eloquently stated I don't feel like you really think she's scum for that. It's like you're trying to come up with a reason to scumread someone, found a decent one, and are hoping people latch on to it. You did your work and now it's in everyone else's hands to join you or not. If you truly believed ffery was a serial killer I feel like you would be more passionate about it and get people to join you and I'm just not feeling that at all. I get that you're unsure but it's almost as if you're doing what you accused ffery of doing before - not going after her too much in case someone else gets run up and you're stuck on her wagon.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah I like you AP and I think you're a great player and I don't want to be a bitch to you (I tend to do that) BUT I think you're the serial killer.

Like FT has barely posted and if BBT was on him for that, I'd get it, but he's acting as if he's scummed it up recently and I'm like ????. He's barely even posted. His vigor seems insincere and I could totally see him just tunneling on Tony for the remainder of the game and let everyone else rip each other to shreds.<br>\n<br>\nmuffin is town on town on town on town lol at people hinting he's scum.

Also him townreading AP is weird to me and I don't see him really doing that as a serial killer either. AP is a prime lynch target for a serial killer (if it's not AP) and him shutting that down immediately makes me think he's town.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think Aneineineinin is the serial killer. If he is, he's playing well, but his read on me changed from scum -&gt; town in a townie way. As a serial killer, he technically could have continued to scumread me because lynching scum doesn't get you a bona fide townread when a serial killer is in play.

It resulted in something like my baseline SK play from a couple years ago on steroids.  The game exemplified what works and doesn't work about my motivations as an SK and I think that would be more than enough of a hot stove experience to push me some other direction if I drew SK again so soon.

I guess you could argue that using PoE and coming up with a pool of people (like Elyse seems to be doing) is a viable and more preferable way, but eh.<br>\n<br>\nthe thing about my Ffery case is that .. I don't believe it myself that much.  You'll notice I have unvoted her and mentioned things that I've liked.  I had a really paranoid moment about her and I feel rather lost this game.  The 'ulterior motive' to my ffery push didn't really exist until I started posting at her, at which point the motive transitioned into \"Troll ffery a little to try and get a better read on her\".  So I can't really disagree with much of what you are saying although I think the conclusions you're making are wrong.  What is scummy about me asking why you are still alive?, idgi.  You rolled Garruk so hard it just seemed natural that you would be killed.  I don't really have a conclusion to draw from it, I pointed it out because it was weird to me.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo Elyse: Same point I guess.  I unvoted Ffery, so I don't see why you guys are making this out to be like \"Omg AP is faking a push\".  If I were confident Ffery was the droids we are looking for then I'd be voting her.  Of course you can argue that I'm just faking all this, but the argument that I \"don't really believe the push\" is kind of bad in context of everything.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6082069#p6082069\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6082069#p6082069\" data-post-id=\"6082069\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1617</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20873\">Elyse</a> wrote:</cite>AP is a prime lynch target for a serial killer (if it's not AP) and him shutting that down immediately makes me think he's town.</div></blockquote><br>\n-shrug-.

{"number": 1720, "id": "6092163", "user": "AngryPidgeon", "user_id": "19184", "content": "AP makes a case.<br>\n<br>\nI think people have been hesitant to look inside Muffin/Anemone because one of them has to be a mason (probably, I mean I HAVE seen masons vote each other before so lel).  If Muffin is SK, he has to whiteknight Anen because he knows Anen is the Mason and its in his best interest to PR hunt anyways since we probably have a tracker or doctor or something if I had to guess that can incriminate him.  The comment about finding the doctor crumb made me think he was a mason and was faking having seen a doctor crumb to draw NKs elsewhere.  I also realized its possible hes an SK and maybe trying to 'conftown' himself by pointing out that he DID find an actual crumb or just faking the former.  Im concerned that he has put more effort into finding crumbs than he has trying to draw actual conclusions and reads from the thread.<br>\n<br>\nI feel that muffin isn't really taking in new information today.  We are getting hollow promises to reread (can't blame too much) and my attempts to banter with him have been met with a rather sturdy wall.  He will play with me a little bit, but I don't get the feeling that he is stopping to consider my alignment at all.  He has decided that there is a lynch list and I'm at the top of it.  I see no passion, no game solving, just some (funny) jokes about how game-solving is so 2013 and reading is for people who give a darn.  Im concerned that he is misreading me and concerned that the questions he asks me are in response to me pointing out that he isn't really doing much to update his read (on me in particular).  Further, there is a general decline in his prowess since this has become single faction.  This is a more minor point because I can reasonably make this same point against everyone in the thread (except BBT I guess) but muffin in particular was rather passionate on previous days and is actively taking a more lackadaisical approach to the game Today.<br>\n<br>\nI disliked that post I found when rereading parts of the thread.  BBT made the same observation that I did when that it was odd that muffin was still alive on D2.  Muffin is arguing with me that since I asked Muffin about it, that is different than BBT simply pointing it out.  All that really means is that I was making an extraverted perception and BT was making an introverted one, so there really is no notable difference other than personality types, but muffin is determined that there is and that I am agenda driven for asking it.  We both admit that the question itself was rather pointless, so I don't see what agenda anyone can feign that I had for asking it in the first place.  I think he is faking confirmation bias on me (blatantly) with the whole \"I just want to lynch AP today because Im deadset on it\" routine and people are ok with that because Im a popular lynch and muffin has established himself as the god of scumhunting already.<br>\n<br>\nGut.  Muffin feels wrong this game.  This is partially due to the whole not updating his reads point that I already made.  Partially just...gut.  I'm not seeing the fervor I would expect to see, especially not today.  I see pbpa responses and pinning logic on me and missing the bigger picture.  Granted I've never seen scummuffin before, but all of his posts feel ...intentional... today for lack of a better word.  My final concern is that the whole vig debate on D2.  Muffin demanded that we out a vigilante at the start of D2.  While I can understand arguments that another vig shot is negative utility, outting the vig is a little bit unnecessary at that point.  If there is a vig who just takes one shot and leaves it at that, there is little reason to out them as they are basically just confirmed town at that point hiding in wait.  I think the push to have the vig out was unnecessary when all that had to be done was force them to not take another shot.  The zero tolerance policy muffin adopted -could- make sense but I find it a little weird.  I think its possible muffin knew there would be no vig and was just putting on a little show to distance from being an SK and knowing there is none.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nAlso its possible muffin is just a mason and Im a retard, shrug.", "time": "Wed Aug 06, 2014 7:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=1700", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

He's willing to lynch anyone pretty much and has gone back and forth between literally everyone on the playerlist.

He doesn't care who is lynched as long as it's not him.<br>\n<br>\nAP also knows that is play is slightly shitty, and is a good enough player to use that as a tool to make him seem town.

Ffery was clearly leaning towards him through PoE most of the day.  BBT himself gave up in post 1879 and basically said he didn't care any more.  I didn't think the game was going to progress until we lynched BBT despite thinking he was town.  Muffin sort of baited me into voting him (not trying to blame muffin, but it was a factor).  It was evident to me that none of the lynches I was interested were going to happen, so I voted him out of frustration.  Its actually rather extremely consistent in post 21885 when I stipulate that BBT is going to flip town and that I am already being pessimistic about going into the next game Day without much changing from the previous one.  The \"what the hell, you tricked me\" was a joke, intended to express sarcastically that this was a crappy lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMy changes in opinion today have been largely influenced by the ffery flip (I thought she was a good candidate for scum and actually was intending to vote her out the gates) and a slight revelation/belief about the state of the game that I am willing to sit on for now.  I mentioned that I think I've moreorless figured out what is going on in this game setupwise so that has influenced my vote on Tony today.  I even stated that I think we are on cruise control so long as we don't screw it up by mislynching me.", "time": "Thu Aug 14, 2014 9:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58191&start=1900", "forum": "53", "thread": "58191"}

I have seen other people fake that as scum before (Titus in street racers) it just seemed really not genuine to me that you were somehow not noticing a recent VC and you decided to claim immediately without really being aware of how many votes you had or at least stopping to say \"Wait do not hammer me before I claim\" or something like that.  Now you are bringing it up again (why?).  If you are on painkillers, I can't really testify what effect that may have because I have never been on them.
