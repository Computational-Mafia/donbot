The first is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=28540\" class=\"postlink\">Rob13's normal last year</a>--which I feel is going to be the closest parallel to this game on site, and the other is <a href=\"http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/outside-magic/mafia/549368-deusex-mafia-game-over-springtime-for-sarif\" class=\"postlink\">this recent 12p mini on MTGS</a>. Now, these might be very odd games to pull chords from, but they're what I immediately bring to mind--I'm fairly certain we're looking at 9-2-1 at the moment and we have an...excess of night actions. <br><br>Now, where was I? Kagami is a very mechanical player when it comes to setups--she loves them in a similar way to me, but she keeps a mechanism to them reminiscent of FakeGod(who I feel has a lack of respect for player behavior and focuses purely on a numbers game). Kagami isn't as much into numbers as she is into actions, per say and a load of light night actions make sense--in such a format where we will have a glut of weak abilities, that means by definition a lot of protective/blocking actions and thus it's easy to ratchet up the kill count and add an SK. This game was likely built around one kill a night with a single additional kill one of the nights due to protective etc actions. Multiball makes little sense to me mostly due to the Review Group being pansies, especially given all the people who would allow a multiball game to exist are currently pushed to the sidelines in the NRG meta sense(i've discussed that with you before I think). <br><br>I would propose a setup that I would think fits Kagami's inclinations, but I'm unsure how much we want that out in the open on page one.<br><br>Did that, um, go anywhere?<br>(I actually find it odd you consider multiball before Serial Killer, by the way)</div></div></div>"}

Firstly, you need to have a fairly thin section of brain in order to view it under a microscope, but because neural tissue has a consistency not unlike Jello, it's really hard to slice. So we general have to \"fix\" brain tissue by immersing it in a substance that will cause it to harder. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, this was typically done with formaldehyde.<br><br>Now you've sliced up a brain, what does it look like? Well, it looks like nothing. The neurons all have a uniform, creamy color and that's all you'll see. We need to \"stain\" individual neurons to look at them, and fairly sparsely. If you stain too many neurons in the tissue, you'll never be able to tell individual neurons apart, and it will look like a huge mess.<br><br>Golgi discovered that soaking brain tissue in a silver chromate solution gave pretty awesome results. Only a few neurons in the tissue would take in the silver, and the silver would spread through the entirety of the neuron, allowing one to see the whole thing under a microscope.

The first is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=28540\" class=\"postlink\">Rob13's normal last year</a>--which I feel is going to be the closest parallel to this game on site, and the other is <a href=\"http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/outside-magic/mafia/549368-deusex-mafia-game-over-springtime-for-sarif\" class=\"postlink\">this recent 12p mini on MTGS</a>. Now, these might be very odd games to pull chords from, but they're what I immediately bring to mind--I'm fairly certain we're looking at 9-2-1 at the moment and we have an...excess of night actions. <br><br>Now, where was I? Kagami is a very mechanical player when it comes to setups--she loves them in a similar way to me, but she keeps a mechanism to them reminiscent of FakeGod(who I feel has a lack of respect for player behavior and focuses purely on a numbers game). Kagami isn't as much into numbers as she is into actions, per say and a load of light night actions make sense--in such a format where we will have a glut of weak abilities, that means by definition a lot of protective/blocking actions and thus it's easy to ratchet up the kill count and add an SK. This game was likely built around one kill a night with a single additional kill one of the nights due to protective etc actions. Multiball makes little sense to me mostly due to the Review Group being pansies, especially given all the people who would allow a multiball game to exist are currently pushed to the sidelines in the NRG meta sense(i've discussed that with you before I think). <br><br>I would propose a setup that I would think fits Kagami's inclinations, but I'm unsure how much we want that out in the open on page one.<br><br>Did that, um, go anywhere?<br>(I actually find it odd you consider multiball before Serial Killer, by the way)</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>You're efforting rather much for it not being Day 2+, nati-chan.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5965159#p5965159\" class=\"postlink\">post 21</a>, Aneninen wrote:</cite>My dice are rolled. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fat_Tony</span><br><br>Reason: that's the only username containing an understrike ( _ ).<br><br>I'm reading your posts as soon as I can.</div></blockquote><br>This post is gross.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5965218#p5965218\" class=\"postlink\">post 24</a>, BlueBloodedToffee wrote:</cite>Hello to all.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5965182#p5965182\" class=\"postlink\">post 22</a>, Fat_Tony wrote:</cite><br>Question for everyone: How experienced are you at the game both on- and off-forum?</div></blockquote><br><br>I have only played two newbie games, this is my first game outside of Road to Rome.

Basically, neurons talk to each other (typically) with chemical signals, while they conduct signals down their dendrites and axons electrically. <br><br>So let's talk about electrical charge and what a neuron is up to when it's just chilling in extracellular fluid.<br><br>A neuron is surrounded by a membrane that keeps some stuff in and keeps other stuff out. It also has little gates, called ion channels, that can let certain ions through. The extent to which the channels allow ions to pass through is called the membrane's permeability to that ion. <br><br>Ok, what ions are important? Basically there's potassium (K+), Sodium (Na+), and Chloride (Cl-). There's also calcium, but in pretty small concentrations that aren't relevant here. At rest, there's lots of K+ inside the neuron, and lots of Na+ and Cl- outside. This is probably because the circulatory systems creatures have evolved are basically acting as a replacement for being surrounded by seawater (which has lots of salt, NaCl). There are also some other anions that hang out outside of the cell and <br><br>So let's imagine my membrane is permeable only to Na+. What happens? Basically, all the Na+ that's outside would want to flow in, because chemicals like to flow from more densely concentrated regions to less densely concentrated regions. As it does that, though, a charge builds up. The more Na+ goes into the cell, the more positively charged the cell becomes. As a result, because positively charged ions don't want to go into a positively charged cell, an electrical force starts pushing against the inward force of the Na+ diffusion. These forces eventually perfectly counteract each other, leaving the cell with a net change in potential.<br><br>This potential is called the Nernst Potential of an ion. The Nernst potential of Na+ is around 62 mV, so a cell that is only permeable to Na+ will quickly reach a potential of 62 mV. Neurons, however, are also permeable to K+, which has a potential of -80 mV (it's negative because the concentration of K+ is higher inside, so the positive ions want to leave the cell). So what's the resting potential of a cell? It's somewhere in between -80mV and 62mV, but where? This is determined by <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how</span> permeable the cell is to the different ions. At rest, neurons are much more permeable to K+ than Na+, so it's closer to -80mV. <br><br>At rest, a neuron has a potential of around -65mV.</div></div></div>"}

Essentially, the cell starts at -65ish mV in it's resting state. As the cell \"depolarizes\" (becomes more positively charged), Na+ channels open up. As a result, the permeability of Na+ ions through the membrane shoots way up, and they all rush in, causing the potential of the cell to lean more toward the Nernst potential of Na+ (65 mV). <br><br>The Na+ channels close after being open for a little while, so the permeability of Na+ relative to K+ drops down again. Lots of K+ leaves because the cell has become too positive for them to want to hang out anymore, causing the potential of the cell to drop down to normal. Then Sodium-Potassium pumps kick in to actively restore the original concentration gradients (this is the only part of the process that forces the cell to expend energy).<br><br>The whole process is call a \"spike\" or an \"action potential.\" It is more or less an all or nothing process, once the cell reaches a certain threshold of depolarization, the Na+ floodgates open. If there's only a slight depolarization, they won't open at there will be no spike.<br><br>Not all neurons have action potentials like this, but most in the cerebrum do. Some cells (e.g. almost all the cells in the retina) have \"graded potentials\" that have more of a linear activity relative to their input.</div></div></div>"}

With Lowercase being Kagami's brother, it makes sense that he would be interested in the early setup spec posts and the way he went about it from a scumhunting standpoint sits well with me - it reads very much like he was looking at Cabd's setup spec from a \"Why did he think this was true?\" kind of way rather than a \"I know this better than he does and he just doesn't understand\" kind of way that I would expect to be really natural for Lowercase as scum in that position.<br><br><br>As far as Cabd goes, I'm really hoping the \"actual responses\" referred to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5967996#p5967996\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> are still coming because his posts since then are really lacking."}

It was the fact that Garruk and Muffinman were also both unsorted but they both had extra comments on what you think they should be doing to be 'sorted'. MDD had nothing, he was just unsorted with no further comment. You're intentionally trying not to provide a read on MDD, I find this scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>First of all I DID try getting a read on MDD, even if I admitted that I was ingoring their posts. (Excluding those parts in which they quoted me. [sarcasm] Those were <span class=\"noboldsig\">super-informative</span>, on the other hand. [/sarcasm].) Search it back, I thought that being insconsistent is a town-tell. Then Konowa told that it could be a scum-tell as well. Due to the latter post changed my read back to unsorted.<br>But, don't worry, I'll read MDDs' posts too as soon as I have time. It seems that I should stop ignoring them.<br><br>I've already explained that \"missing comment\". I didn't think that I should repeat myself like \"Inconsistent, thatswhy unsorted\".<br><br>And why did I focus on the part which was quoted by someone else too? Isn't it obvious? I didn't understand the logic behind that \"defending MDD\" subject. I thought that it was clear that they're definitely not among my favorite players. When I saw that someone had quoted it I started pondering \"what if BBT <span class=\"noboldsig\">really</span> thinks that I'm performing some soft-defense\"? Then I re-read the post you quoted. And some others. (Before that I had posted that short post from my mobile, showing that \"I noted the question, working on the answer\".) You can see the conclusion in my previous post. <br><br>That's all I can say."}

The first is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=28540\" class=\"postlink\">Rob13's normal last year</a>--which I feel is going to be the closest parallel to this game on site, and the other is <a href=\"http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/outside-magic/mafia/549368-deusex-mafia-game-over-springtime-for-sarif\" class=\"postlink\">this recent 12p mini on MTGS</a>. Now, these might be very odd games to pull chords from, but they're what I immediately bring to mind--I'm fairly certain we're looking at 9-2-1 at the moment and we have an...excess of night actions. <br><br>Now, where was I? Kagami is a very mechanical player when it comes to setups--she loves them in a similar way to me, but she keeps a mechanism to them reminiscent of FakeGod(who I feel has a lack of respect for player behavior and focuses purely on a numbers game). Kagami isn't as much into numbers as she is into actions, per say and a load of light night actions make sense--in such a format where we will have a glut of weak abilities, that means by definition a lot of protective/blocking actions and thus it's easy to ratchet up the kill count and add an SK. This game was likely built around one kill a night with a single additional kill one of the nights due to protective etc actions. Multiball makes little sense to me mostly due to the Review Group being pansies, especially given all the people who would allow a multiball game to exist are currently pushed to the sidelines in the NRG meta sense(i've discussed that with you before I think). <br><br>I would propose a setup that I would think fits Kagami's inclinations, but I'm unsure how much we want that out in the open on page one.<br><br>Did that, um, go anywhere?<br>(I actually find it odd you consider multiball before Serial Killer, by the way)</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>I think you have a greater appreciation for the nuances of SK design than most game designers.

It's important now.<br><br>There are Calcium (Ca2+) channels in the presynaptic butons of neurons that open once the buton is depolarized. This causes Ca2+ to rush in (these is very very little calcium inside the neurons normally). This calcium influx is the signal that tells the neuron to release its neurotransmitter.<br><br>Postsynaptically, the neurotransmitter binds to receptors that often are also ion channels, causing them to open. Sometimes there an indirect mechanism, but the result is roughly the same, an ion binds to a receptor causing an ion channel to open. Excitatory neurotransmitters usually open Na+ channels, while inhibitory neurotransmitters usually open Cl- channels. As a result, ions rush in and change the voltage potential of the post-synaptic cell.</div></div></div>"}

So you're saying it can be difficult to develop a solid read so early in the game? But you town-read Scarab. This town-read is justified by no reasons whatsoever (other than appeasement).

Even though it must have been palpable that doing so is absolutely not my regular method.<br><br>Later, I started to get slightly disappointed, because neither your posting style, nor your acceptance on my answers had changed. I also developed an impression that you might reiterate the same things, regardless my posts. In Mafia terms, this phenomenon might be described by the word \"tunnelling\".<br><br>I am also slightly disappointed, forasmuch as I have been forced to get wise of the fact that our mutual cooperation in resolving the issues which were proposed on your side does not seem to be fruitful.<br> <br>The iteration process which I have been applying in order to reduce your distresses which might have been caused by the descrepancies of my former posts seemed to be an unilateral process.<br><br>Although the events described above might be a direct result of your increased emotional stressfulness, I regret to say that until I get a proof that your attitude is based exclusively upon your increased emotional stressfulness, I consider your behaviour a \"scummy\" one (quoting the appropriate Mafia expression). A demeanor like this may or must be a direct consequence of a possible role which is determined by stochastic factors prior to the game. Therefore you can not be incriminated for it. Nevertheless, your role and your probable subsequent acts will have a detrimental effect on the faction I represent (in Mafia terms: \"town\" or \"townies\").

It's not often that associative tells give themselves away so obviously but I think I've hit the jackpot between you and zMuffinman.  And if you feel that I'm \"not a threat\" then why are you voting for me if I'm a member of the mafia?  Town do not shut each other down under routine questioning, they cooperate to get questions answered.  If you say something you should be willing to prove it, not to myself but to the entire town.

He replaced in on day 2, into a slot that had claimed PR and gotten scum lynched on day 1 thanks to Who's N1 gunsmith guilty.  It wasn't a super-active game.  He made 60+posts.  In that game he played pretty much in the moment with a preponderance of short, incisive posts.  What I'm seeing here is 5 posts over the week-ish, and the posts are low engagement and a little longer.  His vote on aneninen is pretty sketchy (primarily because of one post) given the amount of data aneninen has put into the thread.  Thinking aneninen is  scum, one could build a pretty big case for it without much difficulty.<br><br>Garruk - also a meta read.  I feel like Nati is dodging the thread after the initial flurry of setup spec.  I don't like that her reaction to Cabd's reach-out as a sounding board/wall for bouncing ideas was a vote, especially given the strength of the wagon at that point.  Her apparent reason for voting was consolidating the bandwagon, nothing about Cabd's alignment or reasons for thinking he was scum.<br><br>The list is not seriatim."}

I can understand why he's pinging for some players, and some of the players who are pursuing him look town in the way they are doing it.  That's separate from my read of him.  I'm assuming he's inexperienced based on bits and pieces about his approach to the game.  If I'm wrong about that, then I'd be wrong for townreading him on the basis I'm using.  He could still be town, but I'd assume he could emulate this style of play as scum."}

I'm not sure what to think here. BBT does have a legitimate point here that your read changed for no reason. That being said, I believe you're being stubborn at the same time about this whole situation. I'm not sure if that's scum stubborness or town stubborness.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Anienien wrote:</cite>When our argument began, I thought he was a townie.

Looking at his content posts though, they're very low-key and direct, which isn't what I would expect from scum in his position (i.e. spending most of his time on defense).

His initial reaction to cadb's post seemed pretty natural.  I also like posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5966301#p5966301\">68</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5966563#p5966563\">76</a>, which aren't really huge posts but seem like someone trying to figure the game out.  Update:  I didn't put this in for obvious reasons but based on early day 1 posts, I thought it was possible that scarab and reinoe were masons/lovers which seems to have not been the case.<br><br>Garruk/Fitz- Lean town.  I don't think an early day one soft-claim is likely as scum; the slot would probably have to claim on day 2, then they have a high chance of being countered or lynched anyway if they claim something silly like BP.  I only know a little about Natirasha and basically nothing about MSSK, so I don't know if replacing out is alignment indicative.  Update: I kind of expected him to be a body guard based on his first post.<br><br>zMuffinMan- Null-town.  I tend to follow Kagami's games and Muffin was in touhou u-pick 2 and touhou: mafia in the land of fantasy, where he survived to endgame as scum with a pretty good number of townreads in both cases.  For this reason, I trust my ability to read him less than I would with other players.  That said, I think he's been a pro-town presence in general and find claims that he hasn't been doing anything to be a little skeevy.  Update:  The fact that Garruk was scum doesn't really mean much to me.  But I thought he was sort of dickish to a couple slots in a way that might have been a liability to scum if he wanted to make it to endgame.  Towner than before.<br><br>BBT- Lean town. His first comment is a little bit scummy, I don't know how I feel about his second post but I definitely don't like the responses to it.  I don't doubt that BBT didn't attach a vote because he was afraid of being accused of OMGUS (which eventually happened anyway), which might imply an unhealthy amount of survivalism.  Cadb's response takes what is at best mildly scummy and frames an argument in a way such that it is completely impossible to respond to (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5965251#p5965251\">33</a>).  His push on Aneninen looked pretty town to me.  Update:  I agree with recent posts about BBT and I'm aware that he voted me without explicit reasoning in about the same way as Fat_Tony, but I'm just don't really feel the case on him/.<br><br>Reinoe- Town.  I think his first post is too hamfisted to be an attempt at scum-town buddying.  Mentioning the freudian slip thing and never bringing it up again is pretty close to something I did in my first game on-site, it looks to me like just an attempt to show that he was thinking something about the game.  I haven't really read most of his posts directed at Hiraki, but aside from claiming slayer's gambit, I don't see a problem.  Update:  Wasn't really thinking much about him at all for reasons stated in Scarab read.<br><br>Hiraki- Lean town.  I generally think his posts have a town vibe.  Toward the end of his argument with Reinoe his insults seemed to indicate that he thought Reinoe was bad-town instead of scum, hence my question at the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5977720#p5977720\">423</a>.  His answer was fine, and my thought process was probably a little paranoid anyway.  Update:  Not much has changed here really.<br><br>Konowa- Lean town.  I don't remember all that much about him.  His point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5967613#p5967613\">105</a> is similar to my own thoughts on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5965251#p5965251\">33</a> and I think in general he makes pretty good points.  Update: not much to say here.<br><br>Slots that I had not gotten to yet:<br><br>Aneninen: Prob town. I didn't really want to change my read on him much because people were calling me out on it honestly, but I think the slot is probably town; at the time, I wanted to know if his Reinoe case came from a town mindset.  His response didn't really answer my question, but I still feel better about his slot now.<br><br>MDD: Flipped mason. I didn't really like the way he was passing out town reads in day one;  They seemed stronger and less warranted than I would expect from town, but obviously he was a mason so not much to say about that.<br><br>Fat_Tony: Scum. My position on him hasn't changed much since the post specifically about him.<br><br>Fferyllt: Lean scum. While my activity was indeed lower than in either of my completed games, her case on me is pretty hollow.  The assertions she made about my town game were pretty much just wrong."}

This game is getting boring. However, as far as I can see, it's in an \"ESS = do nothing\" state. (The Evolutional Stabile Strategy is not being active.) Mostly because if there are only a couple of active players with long and/or many posts, those get the majority of votes. NO, it's not a general attribute of a Mafia game but, sometimes happens. (I may be wrong as well but it happens sometimes IRL games.)<br><br>(2) Unfortunately, basicly due to the low amount of content I don't have strong scum reads, though, I can name some players who are most probably towns. <br>Let's see my list with some probabilities of being scum. (My theoretic scale: 1 = most probably town 2 = lean town 3 = unsorted, null, inconsistent data etc. 4 = lean scum 5 = most probably scum.)<br><br>BBT \u2013 pretty active and his posts appear to be genuine scumhunting. (I mean, he's not faking it, he really wants to find scums.) Paradox but true, his Day1 case against me even strengthens this read. Mark: 1<br><br>Hiraki \u2013 hmmm... he used to appear town-ish but his recent posts, especially that fake-Vig claim was a thing, which I didn't like. Right now I don't know what to think. His general activity (higher than average) is one more town tell, on the other hand (in this particular game, see my remark below!) Mark: 3<br><br>Reinoe \u2013 Having metaread him a bit his posts are mostly about \"being Reinoe\" (in other words: he appears to be scum even if he's not). His latest posts (basicly almost anything above 900) contain good thoughts. Maybe I was wrong about him before...? Mark: 2<br><br>Fat_Tony \u2013 Strange. I don't think he's scum. He used to give away \"town wibes\" which might have stopped later due to his IRL things. But, it IS possible that he's a SK. A problem with the latter statement is that we don't know whether we have a SK at all... Mark: 1 (...but if we DO have a SK, for that it's at least 4!)<br><br>Fferyllt \u2013 Consistent, town-wibe Day1 but that has been ruined a bit Today as for her latest post. (Eg. in 912 the \"even town-me\"... excusemeWTF). Mark: 3 (Though, it's not very likely that she and Lowercase are scum partners, see eg. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6025102#p6025102\">920</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6025161#p6025161\">922</a>...)<br><br>Muffin \u2013 Trolling and acting as if he had done something. He would be my best scum tip \u2013 but, he was the one who pushed the Day1 the hardest. And HavingFitz was a scum. (And I don't think Day1 bussing is a good strategy). Mark: 2<br><br>Scarab \u2013 Nnnnno, I strongly disbelieve that his ask for being replaced is a town-tell. See the part below! That slot is a possible scum-shot. Mark: 4<br><br>Lowercase \u2013 Where is he at all? Was he on V/LA? No posts = no reads. But, I remember that he was my strongest scumread before my V/LA. Mark: 4.<br><br>(3) I think it's hard to get useful and stabile reads because there are too few posts and many of the posts contain no useful info at all. (Yes I know, this goes for my posts as well.) I'm strongly afraid that only the scums can make profit out of this phenomenon: they don't really need to do anything, they can get some \"chips-and-coke\" and wait 'till the townies lynch themselves. I know that this part might not be true and it's only my intuition.<br>But still, I would search for scums amongst the least active players. In general. (Yes, this includes the Scarab slot too, maybe he realized that as a scum his best strategy is doing nothing, which is boring. I'm not saying that I'm sure in it but it is a possibility.)<br><br>I've been in a hurry but this post has been the best I've been able to write now."}

Also, Fat Tony mentioned something about him suddenly becoming confident and with daytalk, that seems pretty telling. I don't like his posts much today, especially with the shade he's casting on muffin. Also, Fat Tony is shady, but BBT's obsession with calling him SK seems out of place. I'm thinking BBT has two scumbuddies (Fitz and one more) and knows this <span style=\"font-style: italic\">isn't</span> multiball, so he's accusing Fat Tony of being a serial killer instead. Otherwise, I don't know why he would jump to that of all things. Scumread here.<br><br>Lowercase - He seems like an easy lynch, but for a good reason? He is a lurksack with barely any content and poor reads. Plus, he randomly showed up after ffery called him out on something and that's never good. I also found it strange that of the four people he didn't get to on his reads list, both people he actually voted throughout the course of the game (Anneneneinienin and Fat Tony) were in that group of four. (Discounting his RVS vote for Cabd of course) You would think he would solidify his reads there first. Scumread here too.<br><br>zMuffinMan - Strongest townread. He pushed for Nati early and although he wasn't pushing for it throughout the day, he was always willing to lynch him. Plus, he's had some really good posts and I feel it in my gut that he's town. And other reasons I don't want to share.<br><br>Hiraki - He's had arguments with both reinoe and BBT and I've agreed with him in both of them. He has sound logic and can defend himself against accusations against him. I'm townreading him. Also, you kept saying you would look at BBT v Anneinnin. I might have just missed that part but did you ever get to it? <br><br>Fat Tony - Probably the biggest enigma for me. No actually that's annenenenininnn. Anyway, I thought Fat Tony was pretty solidly town for day 1 but his day 2 has been suspicious. Talking about four possible scum is weird and his explanation is a little fishy, though plausible. I don't see him as scum with fitz though. If this does turn out to be multiball and another team shows up, he'll jump up on my suspect list.<br><br>reinoe - If I hadn't played with him before he would be a strong scumread, but he's just soooo different than the last time. He tried to derail the fitz wagon after fitz's horrible posts, asks other people for direction, votes for people I'm townreading (muffin, Hiraki), and gets hung up on something as insignificant as Hiraki calling him \"elusive\". It seems like he's disconnected from the majority of players and trying to skate by by just arguing with a few people here and there. I don't think he's trying to find scum. He's another scumread.<br><br>fferyllt - She's a townread of mine. Her questions have been helpful and inquisitive and I feel like she's actually scumhunting. She also seems to pick up on things I pick up on myself, which is always nice. I do have a question for her regarding Fat Tony that I asked in my spoilered portion that I would like answered. Otherwise she seems logical and intelligent.<br><br>Right now I'd vote for Lowercase, reinoe, or BBT (in that order) but since Lowercase is being replaced that seems futile until a replacement comes.<br><br>So<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: reinoe</span>"}

In retrospect, this early scumread is rubbish.  Null up as far as post 70 where he clarifies his position on MDD with a vote.  Weirdly tries to link me with MDD in post 94 but again explains this out sarcastically (sarcasm is a super tool on the internet) over the following few posts. <br><br>In 106 says he is scumreading me (for voting him) - also addresses a weird (and rare!) post from Konowa.  Can understand the scumread based on the fact that I completely missed his sarcasm in some of his early posts (26, 96 for example). His explanations are methodical and at this point he reads town.  Does some useless shit with muffin for a while.<br><br>In 218 he turns his guns on Anen based on some confusing read-stuff on Scarab.  This goes on and on until 487 where he sort of just... gives up.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Q: BBT, where do you stand on Aneninen at the moment? No, wait, you recently posted reads and said he's town.  Why is he town now?</span><br><br>In 488 he decides to sheep muffin and run up lowercase (now... Thor?) a bit without much explanation. Then starts asking muffin if he is rolefishing, apparently expecting to get some sort of answer. In 575 he asks some good questions of Hiraki.  Continues to press for answers to specific questions in 615.  At this point I am confident that I am reading a town-aligned player.<br><br>In 618 he implies the lowerThor wagon was a bit scummy and hits the MDD wagon and keeps pressing muffin on rolefishing etc, asks why we are running up a possible PR in 680.<br><br>End of day 1 and the transition to the Fitz wagon is weird.  I think it is worth questioning why he was so reluctant to make the switch.  For my part, I was almost policy-antagonising muffin.  He was refusing to be helpful to me by imparting his powerful scumhunting tactics, so I was being stubborn.  Not sure what BBT was doing though and wouldn't mind his take on it. <br><br>812 reads weirdly.  He expresses confusion at Hiraki and then votes me?  It just reads oddly.  Then Hiraki does the weird fakeclaim thing.  Then BBT votes me AGAIN without unvoting me.  Which is just weird. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>888 accuses me of contradiction (I can see why, but I don't feel what I said was strictly contradictory - softened from obvtown to pretty town), but softens his view on me and says my explanation \"somehow feels town\". 889 votes Hiraki seemingly based off my argument for one of Hiraki and reinoe being scum, plus Hiraki's weird attack on BBT at the start of D2 based on him mentioning the NKs (Cardinal sin!).<br><br>923 gives up on pushing Hiraki, and 934 decides I'm an SK? Which feels super odd.  And that reinoe is scum.  Which seems less odd.<br><br>945 - wait, hold up - didn't it \"somehow feel town\"? *reads back* Oh wait, so you're not happy with it but it feels town?  So you're not happy with me seeming town there?  This confuses me.<br><br>974 - Gets on reinoe-wagon, then disappears into prodworld and is annoyed that I noticed??? <br><br>1113 - not sure who you are addressing in this post BBT.  Also, do you think I'm scum or am I still an SK to you?  just so I know what I'm accused of.<br><br>And then we have our recent weird interaction.</div></div></div><br><br>Overall, I believe BBT is town, although some of his Day 2 play has struck me as being a bit odd.  I absolutely do not support a BBT lynch today.<br><br>From this ISO I want to take a closer look at Anen and Hiraki in particular.  BBT has had really interesting (or at least protracted) interactions with both of you, and I'm not sure that in either case his questions were truly adequately addressed.<br><br>Questions from within the cut if you don't want to fight a massive Wall of Text (TM) - <span class=\"noboldsig\">BBT, why do you now have Aneninen as a townread?  What changed your read on him?</span><br><br>Unlikely to be able to do another full ISO tonight but will try to fit one in tomorrow and finish it up on Sat."}

He's arguing that if he's scum, he's solely trying to lynch a third party member, which is highly unlikely given we don't even know there is one!<br><br>I'm trying to think of an analogy that would explain what I am saying, but it's hard to come up with one.

Not to mention, the conclusion is completely unreasonable.<br><br>Why couldn't Elyse think that Fat Tony was scum with someone else? You can have scumreads but not make the connections. Honestly, I find that making connections between plausible scum is completely useless. Even once scum flips, it's not very helpful for town and is more helpful for scum. I'm sure there's a bunch of debate at the discussion forums (which I never read) for it.<br><br>You then call yourself dumb for it and unvote. The reason I went through that is because I don't think a majority of the game understands how much grabbing there was here. I can understand if Thor just read something wrong but the lack of explanation doesn't justify it. I wasn't ready to kill Thor at this moment but it did put some sirens on his name.<br><br>AP even states that here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AP wrote:</cite>Thor feels very Un-Thor this game and I don't know what to make of it. He seems to be everyone's go to scumread today and I kind of understand that give my previous statement, but I don't know how to feel about it right niw. I should probably rectify that.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>Regardless of your reputation and skill, you will look bad if you push an easy mislynch. Your current standing in this game isn't too strong and you would definitely be extra cautious with your votes and pursuits.</div></blockquote>I understand how this looks bad. It's like one of those old time mafia boss movies. I don't see how it's scummy enough for a push in the least.<br><br>The problem with the Elyse/Thor lynch is that it's based off of Elyse' opinion. I'm okay with a lynch based on that if it has scummy presence. When it's creative thinking, there should be no penalty. I've done the same in many town and scum roles and I don't think that there's much of a change between those roles.<br><br>I completely agree with the following two quotes:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>If I assumed one way or the other, you would vote me for not being open to all possibilities and accuse me of having inside knowledge or something.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elyse wrote:</cite>I thought he said 4. <br><br>It is time to spare.<br><br>It looks bad to hammer without a claim, ESPECIALLY someone who already claimed a PR.<br><br>Also are you seriously arguing the second part? I used public knowledge to entertain the possibility of a third party. I still don't know what the setup is. That's it.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AP wrote:</cite>Huh it looks like there are 3 concrete pieces of information that you are using. I think you were a bit over-the-top in stating you don't know anything about the setup, especially considering you immediately follow it up by proclaiming to have an idea about the setup.</div></blockquote>Really? I expect better from you than this shit.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hiraki wrote:</cite>I feel more confident in my vote on Thor because he and Elyse are voting on really bullshit stuff.</div></blockquote>I want to come back to this to clarify that I think Elyse's and Thor's votes are shit but I think Thor's vote is scummy and Elyse's vote is clouded in too much theory.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Anienien wrote:</cite> Nnnnnnnnnnn, Elyse, nnnnnnnnnnnn! I don't like this! Should Thor be just as cautious if he voted on eg. me? ^_^</div></blockquote>It's one vote. I have a bit more faith in Elyse than that.<br><br>I'll admit that I've been glossing over the argument for the next few pages because I'm pretty sure it's more of the same. I'm very content with my vote. Thor has been grabbing a lot this game and I don't like it one bit."}

His recent posts haven't impressed me at all. Eg. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6074307#p6074307\">1457</a> about \"diplomacy\". <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076742#p6076742\">1479</a> about pointing out that he's never played SK. (Frankly, having an SK in a setup is rare. Even if there is one the probability of getting that role is lower than to get a scum role. I think there are many players who haven't played SK so far.) Spotting a single expression/word in an ESL-player's post and using it as a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">single</span> argument for giving a vote is an Auto-FoS from my side. (By the way: the same will go for playing the \"language barrier\" card against me. Deal with it because this will go for all of my forthcoming games and I have damm good reasons for acting like this.) But, that's not all. Hiraki has been nightkilled. AP's slot had a constant fight with Hiraki before and the main reason why I found Reinoe's rage-replaceout post scummy(SK-y \u2013 see my explanation above!) was the fact that he raged against Hiraki as well who hadn't been involved in our conversation by that time at all!!!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BBT</span> \u2013 unsure. His late-Day2 vote on AP was odd. He keeps his vote on Tony while he \"soft-fights\" Muffin. As if he weren't cared who would be lynched. (? \u2013 I'm not sure about the latest sentence.)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fferyllt</span> \u2013 most probably town. Nothing scummy here. By the way, as for your post: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076784#p6076784\">1487</a> you can find my reasons for thinking someone is scum/SK/whatever-antitown-faction above in this post. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse</span> \u2013 lean town. Since Thor flipped scum it's unlikely that Elyse is the SK (or a scum, if we have that). As for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6074286#p6074286\">1455</a>: that summarizes my thoughts as well about the topic perfectly.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tony</span> \u2013 unsure. Too few posts with too little content Today. This might mean that he's lurking as an SK (?). Though, I don't find his Day1/Day2 particularly anti-town (scummy/SK-y). He keeps repeating \"I'm town, you must realize it\" all the time, but this may from a frustrated town, not from an SK.</div></div></div>"}

I may still go down but you can bet I'm taking you with me if you are scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Actually I'm feeling the exact opposite of stage fright.<br><br>Yesterday I worried about being mislynched today if we lynched wrong yesterday.  Today, I don't have to worry about being mislynched so much because town has the breathing room with Thor's flip.<br><br>Think Bork's newbie and the agonizing I went through trying to solve the game a day early if you flipped town.<br><br>That's what was going through my mind yesterday, mostly because zmuffin wasn't townreading me and there's no question in my mind that he could get me mislynched.  He's one of a handful of players I think could get me mislynched in any game, any time.  And I'd rather that happen sooner than later.<br><br>Today, if anything I'm too relaxed and I'm not going back over the game the way I should be doing.<br><br>If I were SK I most likely would have killed you thinking you were the strongest player not likely to get protection.<br><br>You being alive today worries me more than zmuffin being alive does.  It's one of two puzzle pieces that I think could make an SK-you picture.  The other puzzle piece was something in a Reinoe post.<br><br>It's all really, really tenuous, though.  One of the most tenuous cases I've ever contemplated in mafia.  I'd like to find something more solid on any player, including you."}

I agree that it seems as if she's playing it safe today and not really going after anyone. It's valid and I definitely see the argument that she could be waiting for a wagon to pop up and then jump on it, or at least wait to see where the wind is blowing. <br><br>But, as muffin more eloquently stated I don't feel like you really think she's scum for that. It's like you're trying to come up with a reason to scumread someone, found a decent one, and are hoping people latch on to it. You did your work and now it's in everyone else's hands to join you or not. If you truly believed ffery was a serial killer I feel like you would be more passionate about it and get people to join you and I'm just not feeling that at all. I get that you're unsure but it's almost as if you're doing what you accused ffery of doing before - not going after her too much in case someone else gets run up and you're stuck on her wagon.<br><br>So yeah I like you AP and I think you're a great player and I don't want to be a bitch to you (I tend to do that) BUT I think you're the serial killer.

Like FT has barely posted and if BBT was on him for that, I'd get it, but he's acting as if he's scummed it up recently and I'm like ????. He's barely even posted. His vigor seems insincere and I could totally see him just tunneling on Tony for the remainder of the game and let everyone else rip each other to shreds.<br><br>muffin is town on town on town on town lol at people hinting he's scum. Like bye.<br><br>Tony is someone who's always been a low key scumread of mine but he does have a scummy undertone to his playstyle and I just don't see him as a serial killer anymore. Also him townreading AP is weird to me and I don't see him really doing that as a serial killer either. AP is a prime lynch target for a serial killer (if it's not AP) and him shutting that down immediately makes me think he's town.<br><br>I don't think Aneineineinin is the serial killer. If he is, he's playing well, but his read on me changed from scum -&gt; town in a townie way. As a serial killer, he technically could have continued to scumread me because lynching scum doesn't get you a bona fide townread when a serial killer is in play. However he's now townreading me and I find that townie of him because he's eliminating a potential lynch option, and one he had a legitimate scumread on before.<br><br>ffery could be serial killer because I never really secured a townread on her, but I don't want to deal with that until I have to.

I did notice how she was like \"I'd have no idea how I'd even <span style=\"font-style: italic\">play</span> serial killer nowadays\" but before she was talking about how she doesn't play serial killer how a typical SK does and that was kinda fishy.

I want to get the game solved and that involves finding the right person.  I guess you could argue that using PoE and coming up with a pool of people (like Elyse seems to be doing) is a viable and more preferable way, but eh.<br><br>the thing about my Ffery case is that .. I don't believe it myself that much.  You'll notice I have unvoted her and mentioned things that I've liked.  I had a really paranoid moment about her and I feel rather lost this game.  The 'ulterior motive' to my ffery push didn't really exist until I started posting at her, at which point the motive transitioned into \"Troll ffery a little to try and get a better read on her\".  So I can't really disagree with much of what you are saying although I think the conclusions you're making are wrong.  What is scummy about me asking why you are still alive?, idgi.  You rolled Garruk so hard it just seemed natural that you would be killed.  I don't really have a conclusion to draw from it, I pointed it out because it was weird to me.<br><br>---<br><br>To Elyse: Same point I guess.  I unvoted Ffery, so I don't see why you guys are making this out to be like \"Omg AP is faking a push\".  If I were confident Ffery was the droids we are looking for then I'd be voting her.  Of course you can argue that I'm just faking all this, but the argument that I \"don't really believe the push\" is kind of bad in context of everything.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6082069#p6082069\" class=\"postlink\">post 1617</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>AP is a prime lynch target for a serial killer (if it's not AP) and him shutting that down immediately makes me think he's town.</div></blockquote><br>-shrug-. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think he is calling me town because Reinoe was town.

I felt that should have been a consideration for you that I was willing to say it and go so far to call it that, but in response, all you did was throw up some smoke about how other people called themselves town as well.  Objectively, your point is logically sound that me calling myself town does not make it so, and the other people doing it does not make that so, but that seemed rather short-sighted.  I might expect that from a newbie or someone like Thor, but I don't really expect you to be so blind to context and emotional energy in the thread.  Its a large reason why I respect you as a player.  The way you handwaved my reachout/plea felt really divey to me as if it is convenient for you not to consider it so you just discarded it with logic.  (yay logic!).<br><br>Your case on me for my ffery push is still not something I really understand although I think Elyse sheeped it (so meh).  I'm trying to engage with people, and that IS 100% consistent with me proclaiming to not have a good sense of direction in the game.  I guess you haven't played with me that much but it was kind of funny when I realized that Thor (if reading this thread) probably realizes Im obviously town BECAUSE of the nature of me bouncing my vote around all over the place.  I know how to keep up appearances as scum, its why I don't get lynched as scum.  FFS I outright scumslipped hardcore in Tales and sweet talked my way out of it.

If Muffin is SK, he has to whiteknight Anen because he knows Anen is the Mason and its in his best interest to PR hunt anyways since we probably have a tracker or doctor or something if I had to guess that can incriminate him.  The comment about finding the doctor crumb made me think he was a mason and was faking having seen a doctor crumb to draw NKs elsewhere.  I also realized its possible hes an SK and maybe trying to 'conftown' himself by pointing out that he DID find an actual crumb or just faking the former.  Im concerned that he has put more effort into finding crumbs than he has trying to draw actual conclusions and reads from the thread.<br><br>I feel that muffin isn't really taking in new information today.  We are getting hollow promises to reread (can't blame too much) and my attempts to banter with him have been met with a rather sturdy wall.  He will play with me a little bit, but I don't get the feeling that he is stopping to consider my alignment at all.  He has decided that there is a lynch list and I'm at the top of it.  I see no passion, no game solving, just some (funny) jokes about how game-solving is so 2013 and reading is for people who give a darn.  Im concerned that he is misreading me and concerned that the questions he asks me are in response to me pointing out that he isn't really doing much to update his read (on me in particular).  Further, there is a general decline in his prowess since this has become single faction.  This is a more minor point because I can reasonably make this same point against everyone in the thread (except BBT I guess) but muffin in particular was rather passionate on previous days and is actively taking a more lackadaisical approach to the game Today.<br><br>I disliked that post I found when rereading parts of the thread.  BBT made the same observation that I did when that it was odd that muffin was still alive on D2.  Muffin is arguing with me that since I asked Muffin about it, that is different than BBT simply pointing it out.  All that really means is that I was making an extraverted perception and BT was making an introverted one, so there really is no notable difference other than personality types, but muffin is determined that there is and that I am agenda driven for asking it.  We both admit that the question itself was rather pointless, so I don't see what agenda anyone can feign that I had for asking it in the first place.  I think he is faking confirmation bias on me (blatantly) with the whole \"I just want to lynch AP today because Im deadset on it\" routine and people are ok with that because Im a popular lynch and muffin has established himself as the god of scumhunting already.<br><br>Gut.  Muffin feels wrong this game.  This is partially due to the whole not updating his reads point that I already made.  Partially just...gut.  I'm not seeing the fervor I would expect to see, especially not today.  I see pbpa responses and pinning logic on me and missing the bigger picture.  Granted I've never seen scummuffin before, but all of his posts feel ...intentional... today for lack of a better word.  My final concern is that the whole vig debate on D2.  Muffin demanded that we out a vigilante at the start of D2.  While I can understand arguments that another vig shot is negative utility, outting the vig is a little bit unnecessary at that point.  If there is a vig who just takes one shot and leaves it at that, there is little reason to out them as they are basically just confirmed town at that point hiding in wait.  I think the push to have the vig out was unnecessary when all that had to be done was force them to not take another shot.  The zero tolerance policy muffin adopted -could- make sense but I find it a little weird.  I think its possible muffin knew there would be no vig and was just putting on a little show to distance from being an SK and knowing there is none.<br><br>--<br><br>Also its possible muffin is just a mason and Im a retard, shrug."}

Not an amazing point, but eh.  I also reflected on his comment about thinking that muffin was scum and had mislynched PR-natirasha and boasted about it.  I decided that it was more likely to come from town than SK, but still not a conclusive point by any means.  Also his handling of the Aneninen wagon is going to look bad and I think scum would be less likely to so blatantly play buddy buddy sheep sheep with BBT.<br><br>BBT...this is more gut I guess.  So I guess I'd rather reverse my previous preference about which of these I'd lynch within this pool :S.  I was going to say his stance on me, but .. meh?

He said that having the vig claim was pro-town so I sarcastically suggested that we all just mass claim right now for fun.  In response to the accusations about mason-hunting: -shrug-.  Like I said, anybody with a half a brain can reasonably narrow down the mason to one of you/muffin by looking at MDD's posts and the votecounts. The problem is that I don't really have townreads on either of you and people have been largely giving both of you a pass which worries me.  If I were scum, I wouldn't be pushing possible masons, that draws attention (note it drew YOUR attention)."}

Muffin thought he was scummy.  Tony thought he was scummy.  Ffery was clearly leaning towards him through PoE most of the day.  BBT himself gave up in post 1879 and basically said he didn't care any more.  I didn't think the game was going to progress until we lynched BBT despite thinking he was town.  Muffin sort of baited me into voting him (not trying to blame muffin, but it was a factor).  It was evident to me that none of the lynches I was interested were going to happen, so I voted him out of frustration.  Its actually rather extremely consistent in post 21885 when I stipulate that BBT is going to flip town and that I am already being pessimistic about going into the next game Day without much changing from the previous one.  The \"what the hell, you tricked me\" was a joke, intended to express sarcastically that this was a crappy lynch.<br><br>My changes in opinion today have been largely influenced by the ffery flip (I thought she was a good candidate for scum and actually was intending to vote her out the gates) and a slight revelation/belief about the state of the game that I am willing to sit on for now.  I mentioned that I think I've moreorless figured out what is going on in this game setupwise so that has influenced my vote on Tony today.  I even stated that I think we are on cruise control so long as we don't screw it up by mislynching me."}

I choose people I want to tunnel on and tunnel on them.

Also, WHY WOULD I KILL FFERY AS SCUM?  \"But AP, thats just WIFOM because you are bringing it up now!!\"  No it fucking isn't.

If that is what you are talking about, then ok?  I have faked that as scum before (Elyse knows this).  I have seen other people fake that as scum before (Titus in street racers) it just seemed really not genuine to me that you were somehow not noticing a recent VC and you decided to claim immediately without really being aware of how many votes you had or at least stopping to say \"Wait do not hammer me before I claim\" or something like that.  Now you are bringing it up again (why?).  If you are on painkillers, I can't really testify what effect that may have because I have never been on them.  You stating your emotions \"I'm feeling lost\" looks like an attempt to fit into the emotional state of the thread - townies may very well be lost but that should be obvious in your posts without having to be explained.  Although I may have said something similar Yesterday, so -shrug-.<br><br>I also didn't like you arguing that you couldn't possibly be scum with Fitz.  I thought that was a rather silly opinion to hold and I didn't like you arguing that rather than arguing you are town, in general.  I feel like a townie is less likely to care about the intricacies of what type of scum they may be...because they are neither."}

That is just an always on ability.  You CAN block the SK from making a kill, which would probably incriminate the SK, making it more likely they will end up lynched.  SK has no way of knowing what power is out there, but suffice to say the mafia team is a notable threat to the SK.  SK play is going to vary depending on who is playing the card.<br><br>P-edit: @ Elyse: I'm fully aware of that (I think I said as much just now earlier?).  Its easier to point to things I've done that make me town since I remember my own actions and perspective.  This game is a cluster and I honestly think its best to claim right now before going forward with crackpot theories.  I wont deny that Im good at escaping lynches, its why my scum winrate is pretty damn high.  That doesn't make me scum here though, it just makes me a pidgeon.  Have you ever tried to grab a pidgeon?  Were slippery as hell.  The game is only on autopilot form my PoV IF I survive &gt;.&gt;.  Im assuming there are 2 town PRs that can claim and become obvious town.  That leaves tony and someone else in the pool of scum.  Sorry for being apathetic but ya'll lynched someone I thought was obvious town yesterday and the person I thought was scum flipped town so I'm just sitting here with this face:  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> .<br><br>IDK, I could see you killing Ffery because she hadn't given a hard stance on you yet.  She said she was trusting muffin's read on you, so she could reasonably be expected to reverse that.  I think it was fairly obvious Tony and me weren't getting NKs because we are lynchable and claimed Vts.  Anyone could think she was a Doc.<br><br>Alright, until we claim at least Im going to go ahead and <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aneninen</span>"}
