The vegas gang owned it all, cops being bribed, judges being bribed, witnesses being bribed, then it comes to the un-bribed people to stop the mafia and lynch them. (Yeah sorry for it being crap, i'm tired...).<br>So...welcome to Vegas Mafia and i'll (Ender 241) shall be hosting your game, here are the rules:<br>Rules To Not Break:<br>1. Mafia is a game. Please try to have fun while playing it. Blatant personal attacks on other players will result in warning optional modkill and auto-loss to the offending player.<br>2. You have been given a win condition and it is your job to try and fulfill it. Do not deliberately play against your win condition and/or deliberately hurt your faction with your play.<br>3. Do not quote your role PM. Do not quote from any mod-provided private QT. Both these will result in modkill and auto-loss.<br>4. Talking about the game outside the thread or any mod-provided QT is forbidden. Unless the offense is incredibly minor (i.e. brief mention of the game without discussing any of its content), this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>5. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts, do not do so, this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>6. Unreadable text is forbidden. This includes but is not limited to cyphers, incredibly small text and invisible text.<br>7. Dead players may not speak in the thread once they are dead. Not even a simple \u201cBah\u201d post.<br><br>Rules Of Voting And Deadlines:<br>8. Votes must be bolded and in the form Vote: Havingfitz. I suggest using the vote button when placing your vote to ensure it is formatted properly and easily noticed.<br>9. You have the option to Vote: No Lynch.<br>10. Unvotes are not required but should be bolded when used.<br>11. A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1. For example, Day 1 will have 13 players alive, and ((13+1)/2) = 7 votes to lynch.<br>12. After a lynch or no lynch occurs the thread will be locked once I announce the result. Posting can continue until the thread is locked.<br>13. Day 1 will last 3 weeks. All future days will last 2 weeks unless mod says otherwise. All nights will last 72 hours unless otherwise stated.<br>14. If no player reaches a majority of votes by the deadline on a given day, No Lynch will occur.<br>15. If a player does not submit a night action by the end of any given night, they will not act that night.<br><br>Rules Of Activity And Prods:<br>16. If a player goes 48 hours without posting in-thread, they will be prodded. If they do not post in-thread within 24 hours following a prod, they will be replaced.<br>17. Please let your mod know if you will be on V/LA \u2013 post it in-thread and bolded.<br>18. Players are allowed two prods. Player replacement takes the place of a third prod.<br>19. Players may request a prod on another player if a player has gone without posting for 72 hours and I have missed prodding them.<br>19 1/2. If you flake in my game you will be unable to join another of my games for 3 months, do it again and you will never be able to play my game again.<br>Rules Unrelated To The Previous Categories:<br>20. Though I am the mod, I'm not exempt from making mistakes. If I screw up something, please PM me and point it out.<br>21. My color is green. Do not use it.<br>22. Vote counts will be posted at my discretion and by request if necessary.<br>23. Anything game related that needs brought to my attention (ie votecount and prod requests, v/LAs, etc) must be bolded and preferably start with \u201cMod, \u201c<br><br>1. <strike>Zdenek</strike> <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla townie</span></span><br>2.<strike>Regfan</strike> (Who replaced Mysterio) <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">2-shot tracker</span></span><br>3. <strike>don_johnson</strike> <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla townie</span></span><br>4.

There are countless variables he seems unwilling to account for. It seems fishy. His past few posts have been a little off. \"Hikari and Emp are town\" - \"Link are you so sharp/experienced\". Seems like a nice little detour for the pressure on him.</div></blockquote><br>Hardly a good detour. He's still got the votes on him and I don't think it's likely to change soon. I'm just not really pushing it right now because I'm not completely convinced of his scumhood yet. I'm sure we'll see more pressure on him once other players start coming in and reading him."}

Albert plays and plays, then plays some more - but he will never be as good as Bobbie. I'm not some super great mafia player. I'm pretty terrible.

Having compared this to Mafia in Canada (which is completed), that seems to be at least a little true. Plus the Timeater vote is great.<br><br>What I have to say about Timeater:<br><br>Since self provided meta is always garbage, Timeater should just be taking what DH said about himself and comparing it to what others say.

Unlike Link I am not going to give you a pass, especially after the quote at the top of this post. 4. I set up nothing. I merely asked for a meta citation on your playstyle. You are attempting to create this elaborate construction of a \"meta argument\" where there is none. The only architect is you. You got super aggressive early game, you are going to draw the inquisitional eye.

I'm working on it. Can't get better without playing&gt; screwed things up. then when he did quit his replacement &lt;ankamius&gt; seems town enough to me.<br><br>don johnson: got nothing. 2 posts that don't say anything gives me nothing.<br><br>Empking: umm...page12. anyway on to my thoughts. you haven't really said anything. you have posted a lot, but havent really said anything. after the confirm and the RVS you make a real vote which is fine and dandy I guess &lt;would've liked a little more than what you gave as a reason, but that early on there isnt exactly a wealth of info and scum tells to go off of&gt;. your next post you are saying Link is town and then compare him to you. sounds like you are advertising yourself more than anything and I don't think I like that. within your next couple posts you call some things out on people briefly then go on to little tidbits of commenting &lt;\"No\", \"that post told me nothing\", \"that discussion was worth nothing\" etc&gt;. then proceed to ask a few people what page it is for whatever reason...I wanna say for inactivity considering at least johnson, mysterio, and myself have posted relatively little. cant recall if the others on the list have, but I suppose if they haven't I'll find out in a bit. if it was, calling me out seems a little pointless since in my last post at the time I stated that I would be posting tonight,a nd relatively late tonight at that since I had work. if inactivity wasn't the reason then, well im curious as to what it was. and i really hope its not something obvious and im brain farting &gt;_&gt;<br><br>overall It almost seems like active lurking. posting and staying \"active\" without seeming to really do anything. so a possible temporary <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: empking</span> until either a satisfactory case comes up or I just find someone more suspicious while ISOing.<br><br>Ender: yes, yes i know its the mod. I was just going down the name list and i had a question for him. about your name. reference to the Ender series of books&lt;game, shadow, etc&gt;? or something else? or is it not even a reference and you are just the \"ender\"?<br><br>hellbound: another person who hasn't posted much. but I guess in the little that has been said he seems on the town side of null.<br><br>Link: at first seemed to be more of a commentator than a participant. but then, I suppose except for me defending myself and DH attacking me and then defending against the votes he was getting himself, combined with how early it was in the game...pretty much everyone seems that way to an extent. and on some level it wasnt his fault, lots of people either asking questions about his name or trolling him about it. later he seems to start actually playing and seems town enough. though I also dont think I like how confident he was in a \"town\" getting killed by the \"day vig\". his explanation seems...well I want to say I believe him, but his explanation seems to be more saying that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in his mind </span> the \"day vig\" killed someone he strongly believed was town...but the way he said it originally implies he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">knew</span> he was town. for now I suppose i'll let the explanation slide unless something else comes up<br><br>maruchan: long story short I think he's town because of his response to kinda almost sorta getting killed. I mean I guess a mafia could realize that its maybe not a real day vig &lt;or at least consider it&gt; and play town till the death is official just in case...but  I dunno, getting in to what scum MIGHT be thinking or not seems like it wont get us anywhere. I'm choosing to believe the claim for now unless he does something super scummy.<br><br>mysterio: same deal as don johnson. though he claims to be catching up as I write this so maybe I'll be able to get a read of some kind on him tonight. though that was a while ago...so unless he's posting a wall even more massive than mine, gonna say its not happening tonight and he's strictly catching up on what has been going on and will comment at a later date.<br><br>nintendoaddict: *reads name* hmm town points already! I jest of course. I dont necessarily agree with everything you have said, you SEEM town enough. at least at first. in 149 &lt;his ISO 9&gt; when he votes for DH, he does so after pointing out that he was quitting for being angry. now, there were lots of quotes in that post and earlier in the post he DID say that he thought DH was scummy...it just seems like an odd place to put the vote. why not put it higher up during the parts where the actual case was? it makes it seem like you voted because he quit. maybe im just being nit picky. or heck, maybe the rage quit was scummy in some way and was relevant to the case? if so then let me know. then later there was the way he took maru's \"prove im innocent\" as \"trying to be innocent\" which, as link pointed out, implies 2 very different things. you do something similar with twistedspoon in 249 &lt;ISO 17&gt;...seems pretty obvious he didn't mean that every PR who doesn't come out and say \"im role X\" is scummy behavior. he was just asking someone who had either made a claim or fakeclaim, and did so in a way that we would find out the truth eventually &lt;due to maru being alive or not&gt; relatively soon anyway. you seem to be twisting peoples words/meanings to your liking to make them look scummy. you later claim you were just tired...but i dunno. as with link, i suppose I'll believe your explanation for now unless something else comes up. difference being though that, counting maru, this is already the second time. sorta turning into a fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me kind of situation.<br><br>The Tick: ahh, your name and avatar bring up so many memories. havent seen that dude in forever. anyway, yeah. *sigh* can't really find anything that stands out. though like with Link he seems to act more like a commentator than a player. but he eventually stepped out of that a bit. answered questions when asked of him. says why he believes person X did thing Y. though one thing gets to me is that he retracts his defenses of timeater and basically says he WILL vote for him assuming timeaters defense was lacking...but I don't think he gave a reason for the take back he did. maybe he did and i missed it. after reading so many posts i could see my brain auto skipping stuff to get through with the work faster. So my question to you tick, why the retraction of your defense?<br><br>timeater: near the beginning, seems to be more fighting with DH than actually...how to word this. more fighting than debating? disagreeing? i dunno. continue on for a while and...wait you unvoted? wha- wh-. huh? just unvote, with no reason given? *is confused* maybe future posts will tell me why...you had an inner realization that had nothing to do with anything he &lt;and by implying inner realization nothign anybody else either&gt; said? how did you come to this inner realization? seeing some of your thought process would be nice. wait. you say your realization was that he's a bad player? sir, at the risk of getting votes since I myself have done dumb things, the roles are chosen randomly...a bad player can be scum. I mean I can sorta understand it on some level. its not like I havent seen someone do something...not optimal, and chose to believe it was due to inexperience or something and writing it off to an extent. but the way you did ait seems like you just suddenly happened to drop the case  completely. seems shifty. while i dont think that was the \"nicest\" way you could have put it, I will say that on some level you were \"pushed\" into saying DH is a bad player. and im not going to call you our for saying it. its not like I can dictate your opinions or anything.  however in 147 &lt;ISO 17&gt; after saying you were pushed into it...you continue on. at this point it isn't you being pushed into saying something mean, you are just being antagonistic. to say you are better than him AND say you are terrible and he should just get over it?<br><br>at this point that seems to possibly be a mafia trying to start shit with someone to distract us from hunting, to watching a boxing match &lt;btw, low blows are a no no in boxing sir&gt;. then after the bell rings and DH forfeits the boxing match you say you are sorry to everyone for that? if you are so sorry why not just have ended it earlier? you then go absent for a while for no reason other than you feel like it. \"emp needs to stop active lurking\" says the guy who is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">apparently</span>  vla yet miraculously still posts and who's last several posts were:<br><br>an apology, you telling the mod something, telling us you are on your wii as well as saying 2 people are probably the same alignment, calling someone &lt;i assume zdenek&gt; a moron for commenting on you being online but not voting with the excuse of you being vla...yet you have posted and were ON, so saying \"but i dont have to, i told you guys i wouldnt be on\" is kinda BS. anyway, continuing with the list, you then requested a vote count, and saying zdenek is backpeddling...<br><br>yet you call someone out on active lurking? scratch that, you call someone out on active lurking while not only active lurking, but after basically asking freaking permission for it by saying you were vla. posting kinda voids your vla, particularly when your reasons were basically just because you wanted to. dont get me wrong, i believe he's active lurking too. but coming from you this is just laughable. so, pot, what color is that kettle again?<br><br>\"real meat in a few hours\" *over 12 hours later*...im hungry, wheres muh meat foo? I mean i understand being busy with rl stuff and all, i was busy too and couldnt post till now. but I said i would post tonight, and here I am.<br><br>overall read: thinking scum<br><br>pheew, this is taking longer than i thought.<br><br>twistedspoon: you fool, there is no spoon! town? nothing particular really stands out to me thats negative. nothing to see here folks. unless, as with tick, i missed something. i mean ive been at this for *looks at clock* GEEZ! how the. anyway, so yeah, nothing here seems worth commenting on.<br><br>zdenek: not sure I understand the vote on \"me\" on 77 &lt;ISO 1&gt;. i mean for all intents and purposes the vote WAS meant for me. DH said \"you dont understand RVS\" i said \"that doesnt make me scum, that just means i dont understand RVS\". you seemed to think that made me auto scum. why? also gotta say that within 4 posts you voted 4 times on 3 people. seems...wishy washy. a little later you vig. as of now because of that I really wanna say you are town because...well claiming &lt;or pretending to claim to put someone in a position like that&gt; takes bawlz. seems risky enough that I'm not sure a scum would do it. hmm, but at the same time, what if you had hit a PR and they claimed cop/blocker/whatever. that would mean you outed a PR. thinking about it that way, the plan seemed to involve more risk than gain. dont think I like it anymore. and in 293 &lt;iso 15&gt; where you explain...ahh hell <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>Except, when I Was scum my mod told me that day-communications between scum in any form of code were EXPRESSLY not allowed, and in order for them to make this code, they would have had to talk about it in the QT, where the mod would have told them it wasn't allowed?

I've been scummy as fuck this game. I've said a lot of dumb shit.

He was playing like a medieval inquisitor who wants his witch burned no matter the cost, no matter if he's wrong or right. Evidence of this could be gleaned from one of his first posts, where he says \"Town acts like X all the time, Scum acts like Y all the time\". I dont normally have split-second changes of heart, but since I did, and I rolled with it - I faced the consequences. My unvoting of demon was strange and should have been questioned.

He held on to it and used it greedily. The way he hopped from me to link then back to me again with the reasoning of a turnip. Trying to mollify Demon with an apology is apparently \"the story of blathering scum\". His vig was transparent as fuck. If wanted to gambit to get more information, it should NOT have been on Maruchan. I was his number #1 suspect, remember?

Granted that happens A LOT in the early phases, but still...it's off-putting, given the strange stuff he's been doing all game.<br></div></blockquote><br>He expresses suspicion of him and a willingness to vote him, but doesn't outright say that anything he's doing is scummy. This could either be scum semi-busing while trying to keep the heat down on a scum buddy or scum trying to stay off a townie lynch. I lean to the former.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I'll be straight up. I've been scummy as fuck this game.<br></div></blockquote><br>At least you know why you're being lynched.<br><blockquote><div><cite>timeater wrote:</cite>I've said a lot of dumb shit. About Demon - because of the way he construed his arguments, the way he put together his cases - I felt they lacked any sort of empiricism, utterly rooted in passion, and ultimately holding up a sort of \"I'm right-your-wrong-no-matter-what\" style of logic. He was playing like a medieval inquisitor who wants his witch burned no matter the cost, no matter if he's wrong or right. Evidence of this could be gleaned from one of his first posts, where he says \"Town acts like X all the time, Scum acts like Y all the time\". I dont normally have split-second changes of heart, but since I did, and I rolled with it - I faced the consequences. My unvoting of demon was strange and should have been questioned. I am not 100% he isn't scum. I'd say I'm 51%.<br></div></blockquote><br>You attacked DH for not providing meta well enough and for attacking ryuu in RVS, so this seems to be a misinterpretation of your own reasons for attacking him. Plus you still aren't really saying that he's done anything scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I dont like the way Zdenek has chainsawed for Demon. He's pretty much done it all game. I feel that either Demon is town and Zdenek is scum OR they are both scum. Zdenek was too quick to agree to my post about him being linked with Demon. He held on to it and used it greedily. The way he hopped from me to link then back to me again with the reasoning of a turnip. Trying to mollify Demon with an apology is apparently \"the story of blathering scum\". His vig was transparent as fuck. If wanted to gambit to get more information, it should NOT have been on Maruchan. I was his number #1 suspect, remember? He tried to justify it with \"oh Timeater isn't RESPONDING HE MUST BE SCUM\" - what a retarded line of reasoning. Another example of him ammunition-gathering instead of posting with real consequence.<br></div></blockquote><br>The chain-saw defense is not a scum-tell.<br>Being quick to notice a scum-slip is not scummy.<br>Most of my reasoning behind voting for link turns out to be part of his play style, and I was willing to forgive him for it because his vote was in a good place.<br><br>I'll finish reading the things from yesterday later."}

He could've been in a bad mood, it could have been worse this time than it was in the past, etc. There are any number of reasons for him to get pissed and replace out, but I can't really see a scum motivation. He could just as easily try to get Timeater mislynched or night-killed.

Here's the other half. I think it comes first.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>claim: vt<br><br>I'll be straight up. I've been scummy as fuck this game. I've said a lot of dumb shit. About Demon - because of the way he construed his arguments, the way he put together his cases - I felt they lacked any sort of empiricism, utterly rooted in passion, and ultimately holding up a sort of \"I'm right-your-wrong-no-matter-what\" style of logic. He was playing like a medieval inquisitor who wants his witch burned no matter the cost, no matter if he's wrong or right. Evidence of this could be gleaned from one of his first posts, where he says \"Town acts like X all the time, Scum acts like Y all the time\". I dont normally have split-second changes of heart, but since I did, and I rolled with it - I faced the consequences. My unvoting of demon was strange and should have been questioned. I am not 100% he isn't scum. I'd say I'm 51%.</div></blockquote><br>So that means after all that, the best you have is essentially a null read on him? Cause you know 51% is only about half, right? That's generally null. Just saying, maybe use better percentages in the future? Nitpicking aside, I could see this.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I dont like the way Zdenek has chainsawed for Demon. He's pretty much done it all game. I feel that either Demon is town and Zdenek is scum <span class=\"noboldsig\">OR</span> they are both scum. Zdenek was too quick to agree to my post about him being linked with Demon. He held on to it and used it greedily.</div></blockquote><br>He mentioed it like twice. And considering you apparently thought DH/Ankamius was town at the time, due to unvoting him, that was a perfectly legitimate argument. If you thought DH was town and thought that his alignment was linked to Zdenek, then what would that make Zdenek?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>The way he hopped from me to link then back to me again with the reasoning of a turnip. Trying to mollify Demon with an apology is apparently \"the story of blathering scum\". His vig was transparent as fuck. If wanted to gambit to get more information, it should NOT have been on Maruchan. I was his number #1 suspect, remember? He tried to justify it with \"oh Timeater isn't RESPONDING HE MUST BE SCUM\" - what a retarded line of reasoning. Another example of him ammunition-gathering instead of posting with real consequence.</div></blockquote><br>Not too sure about this argument, but I could see the Maruchan pick as a way to find out if a minor scum read would crack if he thought he was dying.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Zdenek</span><br><br>A LIST!<br><br>1. Zdenek- scum<br>2. Mysterio - null<br>3. don_johnson - scummy<br>4. Hellhound1 - null<br>6. Hikari Link - town<br>7. hahonryuu - obvtown<br>8. nintendoaddict1 - scummy<br>9. Empking - null<br>10.

Ankamius - town... <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"></div></blockquote><br>I was trying to figure out what I don't like about this list. Then it hit me, no real explanations, granted, we've seen allusions to some of the suspicions here or there, but those things can change over time as new content is added. I want an updated list with justifications of these reads, not just saying you read them that way. Especially the \"obvtown\" reads. If they re so obvious, then you must have justification up the ass. I'm not even saying I don't agree with some or all of these, but that's all the more reason you need to justify that shit. Scum can read the flow of the game and composite a list that they think the town will like.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I wasn't saying I got something against vt claims, just that one in particular (because of the meta, he said didn't have time for TS, and just quoted me in his crybaby style. + Next post the misrep). I gotta be honest, I was REALLY tempted to say something like TRACKER or fakeclaim cop just to stick it to this game. But I knew that if I did that I'd only be lynchbait down the line. I WISH I had a PR this game.</div></blockquote><br>I don't really like this statement. Fakeclaiming is super anti-town. Especially if you had been counter-claimed. But you don't even note that, you just say you were worrying about being lynch bait.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>hahonryuu wrote:</cite>speaking of zdenek's vig thing...perhaps no one got to it in my wall &lt; <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very sad\"> come on guys, dont tell me i did all that for nothing&gt; but AM curious as to what the rest of you think on my thoughts of it being unnecessarily risky. what if a PR was a target? if the PR claimed because they thought they were going to die then he exposed a PR to the mafia and we gain nothing from it really. even with how it turned out, at best we ended up gaining/losing nothing. maybe there is something I missed so, I ask again, what others think about the plan? am I just crazy/overly cautious/reading too much into it? or am I right?</div></blockquote><br>I do agree it was a bit over-kill (not just cuz I was the one that thought I was dead.  -.-), but I think it would have been a terribly unlikely move for scum to do.  Why play a gambit to FIND scum, when you are scum so you know THEY aren't, and bring unwanted attention to yourself.  So as much as I dislike him for (pretending to) killing me, I don't find it as in any way shape or form scum-motivated.</div></blockquote><br>As hahonryuu pointed out here, it could have been a scum ploy to out a PR. Not saying hat was the motivation, but remember that scum would know you aren't scum, so they aren't trying to find scum. Overall, I'm calling it a null tell.<br><blockquote><div><cite>don_johnson wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>maruchan wrote:</cite>Just curious, how does this work \"Pretend my vote is on timeater as I wait for him to claim, but wait I'm voting Maruchan.\"</div></blockquote><br><br>it works just how it sounds. <br><br>ryu: its nothing personal. everyone plays differently. i have several different styles i employ and i choose which one depending on the game, playerlist, my availalble time, etc. unfortunately, you have drawn \"lackidaisical\" dj. though this may upset you, you should(by virtue of my record) realize that i am a good player and should thusly be more inclined to work with me than against me. if you are town, then you should be able to trip lackidaisicalscumdj up easier with questions and such. with lackidaisicaltowndj, my answers to your questions should be able to help you solidify your own reads. so whatevz. it is what it is.</div></blockquote><br>Not a shot at you, but technically based on your record alone, you are a mediocre town player and a really good scum player, so that's not a great deal of comfort...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>don_johnson wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>ankamius wrote:</cite>Your post made it sound incredibly conclusive that you plan to end the day.</div></blockquote><br><br>patently false. my post did not contain an actual vote, which means that everything i did still left timeeater in the same position he was in before i posted. i also clearly asked for more input and explicitly requested that noone hammer. you seem to like the word \"incredibly\". if you continue to be this \"incredibly\" ridiculous, i will vote you. in fact,<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote ankamius</span><br><br>see, i didn't even have to do all that reading and i have found you guys your first scum.(hint: both maruchan and timeeater are likely town at this point.)<br><br>your welcome.</div></blockquote>Uh, I'm really not inclined to agree with this, especially with how DH was behaving pre-replacement, so... thanks?

DH's vote was placed because he found Hahoryuus vote to be opportunistic and nothing more, his explanation of it is entirely reasonable and the fact that he somehow got to L-2 and needed to claim that early in the game is immensely frustrating.<br><br>I'm also reading the whole Timeeater vs DemonHybrid spat to be town on town to be perfectly honest, they both got incredibly riled up and instead of standing back to realize that they were pushing useless cases on each other they got personal. I'm actually finding minimal scum motivation for either of there play early on. I do want to read back and take a look at peoples stances on the situation later because I'm expecting that there would have been mafia attempting to 'mediate' the dispute while doing nothing beneficial themselves.<br><br>Although I'm unsure what to make from Twisteds avoidance from mentioning his great scum win recently in the list of his games completed and his under-rating his own scum ability I'm finding a great deal of his posts to be very spot on and logical and thus have a strongish town-read on him at the moment, similarly I'm finding myself agreeing with a lot of the points suggested by Zdenek early on though I disagree with his push on Maruchan. I'm reading Maruchans defensiveness to be play style related rather than alignment related and considering I'm finding a lot of his thing rather than a scum-tell, his opening few posts as well as his meta-comparison draw to Link read as geninue town scumhunting.<br><br>So far The Tick has been incredibly wishy-washy in his posts and has avoided and refrained from posting anything that can be considered as legitimate scumhunting or geninue town thinking. His willingness to drop his entire scum-read on DH just because he replaced out makes no sense whatsoever and reads as him attempting to avoid being the last person on the inevitable dying wagon. <br><br>I'm not liking Nintendos play so far and I actually have significant meta experience with him, his play has been incredibly off this game and his votes so far have read as opportunistic and nothing more. I'm also disliking Hahonryuus reaction to DH's pressure and her decline in posting after it occurred, it honestly looks like mafia feeling like they're incriminating themselves by posting and therefore lurking until the focus moves elsewhere. <br><br>Overall the the moment my reads are:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town: </span>DemonHybrid, Timeater, Twistedspoon, Maruchan, Zdenek (Weaker).<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Null: </span>Don, Link, Empking, Hellhound.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum: </span> The Tick, Nintendo, Hahonryuu (Weaker).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@ Link and Maruchan - </span>Can you both please stop quote-walling.

Half way through page 14 now and I need another break, probably going to take a run and continue when I get back (Yes I know, don't run after you eat but oh well).<br><br>Maruchans reaction to the dayvig gambit reads as incredibly town and the motivation behind Zdenek doing it also looks highly town motivated. I'm stuggling to find any legitimate reason for Zdenek to 'reaction test' a supposed scummy town player giving them a chance to redeem their image if he were mafia, it seems highly counter-productive.<br><br>I'm unsure what to make of Hahoryuu's catch up post, a lot of it reads as nonsensical logic and a lot of fluff included and involved in it though I like the fact that her vote went towards Empking. I personally don't have a scum-read on Empking at the moment but I'm not a fan of his actions thus far in the game, it revolves around him active lurking and throwing in useless comments here and there.<br><br>I'm reading Timeaters #325 and #327 as major town-tells, his geninuity and suggestion of wanting to fake claim to stick it to the game although wrong and very stupid read as town. As does the fact he's attempting to push Zdenek someone that has had no traction for lynching previously. Mafia that know there's a good chance they get lynched will either A) Fake claim a PR or B) Push elsewhere hardcore, he's done neither. I'm very much of the opinion that his wagon is highly scum motivated so I'll focus on reading and looking into that later as well.<br><br>I hate Dons attitude of it's only day one thus he doesn't have much to contribute but personally I've had a very bad experience with him in the past therefore this sort of play by him doesn't seem that alignment related. I'll await his future days play before I attempt to judge him. Links interaction with him though shines very well on Link, reading his comments and frustration thrown towards Don to read as genuine town frustration though I'm still disliking his votes and cases this game.<br><br>Updated reads list at the moment:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town: </span><strike>DemonHybrid</strike> Ankamius, Timeater, Maruchan, Zdenek, Twistedspoon (Weaker), Link (Weaker).<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Null: </span>Don, Empking.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum: </span>The Tick, Nintendo, Hahonryuu (Weaker), Hellhound (Weaker).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Hahoryuu </span>- Do you always scumhunt solely of ISO's or do you actually read the game in context?

There is something I want him to clarify though which is upon entering this game you state that you love the playerlist and then later state that you're less motivated to put forward the effort due to the playerlist not being good. Can you explain that please? Overall leaning weak town on him though waiting for his answer.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hellhound1: </span>His only focus and thoughts this game have revolved around Timeater the popular lynch wagon, the fact he's avoiding commenting on everyone and everything else reads as scum sliding by though I want more content from him before I can strengthen this read. Overall leaning weak scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Timeater:</span> There's so much making him town, the spat between him and DH read as T v T, his claim, his continued scumhunting and meta research, his push on Zdenek, none of these seem scum motivated at all. Overall leaning strong town on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hikari Link:</span> Yeah, this is where I have problems and believe I'll continue to have problems. Your play style and wall posting is highly mechanical and often leads towards a lot of your posts being completely nonalignment related making this a hard read to attain. Overall I go back and forth between weak town and weak scum so null.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hahonryuu: </span>Was one of my initial stronger suspects, really disliked his play at the start of the game however it's picked up significantly since then. His suspicion of Zdenek and his eagerness to have people focus on his walls both read as geninue town-tells. Overall leaning medium town on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Nintendoaddict1:</span> There is something very, very off about his play this game and I mean very off. For anyone who is interested in reading into his meta his scum game was Mafia Band 00's and his Town Game was Mini 1160. He has managed to skate by with providing minimal of his own input into this game thus far and I'm not liking it at all. Overall leaning medium scum on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Empking: </span>Yeah, not going to bother going into this one too much, Empking is always very useless and almost unreadable on D1. Overall obviously null on him at the moment.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Twistedspoon: </span>This is a read I'm currently unsure on, his earlier day play read as strongly town however I'm not liking his intense scum read on Maruchan at all, that along with the fact that he's somehow managed to slide by with providing near no content since his catch up posts make me feel bad about this slot. Overall leaning medium scum on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The Tick -</span> I've gone into my thoughts on him multiple times; His suspicion and change of reads is highly illogical and the fact he's attempting to defend that rather than review his read continues to enforce my read on him. Overall leaning strong scum on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Maruchan -</span> There's a lot that make me think Maruchan is town including his reaction to the vig-shot, his genuine scumhunting efforts before and after it, his continued meta research and ability to reanalyze and change his reads on logical reasoning. Overall leaning strong town on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ankamius -</span> I had a strong town read on DH and it's the sole reason why I believe this slot is still town. DH has a tendency to get overly emotionally involved with games as town whereas he's more carefree as mafia, his spat and reasoning behind his actions before replacing out read strongly as town. Overall leaning strong town on him.</div></div></div>"}

Regfan replaced mysterio, the town lurker/flaker and proceeded to become the town leader. My experiences with Regfan tell me that he is a very through player who considers all possibities and has both practical and theoretical brilliance as a player at times. At others he can underestimate players (cough) or put too much weight on things that aren't particularly significant imho. However the positives vastly outweigh the negatives and this is even more true when he is hydraing. My experiences with scum Regfan are vastly limited though so I cannot speculate on this front.

Tick pings my scumdar in certain (albeit unusual) ways. If he is scum I find his playstyle and vote conservatism to be one of the more unusual scum playstyles. However I have a small feeling that he might be myslynch fodder as time was. However from Time's posts I get a better feeling of genuineness<br><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>Maruchans reaction to the dayvig gambit reads as incredibly town and the motivation behind Zdenek doing it also looks highly town motivated.

I wasn't being questioned or provoked or even argued with at that point.  I did the research solely to show that VT scum claims are very very common, which had nothing to do with me.

Why? How else better to get town cred than to be on the Day one wagon into scumville? And of the people on the wagon, the votes most likely to be scum-bussing are those at the beginning or those towards the end.  Why? Scum would either try to get town cred by beginning the bus on a partner, due to this would get them the most town-cred, OR, scum tend to hold their vote off till they see a useful wagon (like I pointed out The Tick was doing), then hop that wagon.  If that wagon happens to be a scum buddy, so be it.  Nintendoaddict was the Hammer on this particular wagon, and lets read his hammer post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>nintendoaddict1 wrote:</cite>Screw it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: The Tick.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>No explanation as to his vote, so I ISO'd him to see if maybe he explained his vote earlier on. Get this: The ONLY time nintendoaddict has quoted, or said anything at all about The Tick, all game, WAS TO COMMENT ABOUT PAST GAMES.<br><br>So he has avoided saying anything at all (good OR bad) about Tick all game, till he decides to throw in a hammer, without explaining his hammer.<br><br>I'm also going to go back alter and ISO some of the other not voting for TIck to see if any of them appear to be buddying/deferring to Tick's arguments or seem to ignore Tick at all.  I would guess a 3-person scum team, with a possible third-party alignment also. Considering two peopel died last night, I would say the likliehood of an SK.  However, sicne one was empking, I would be willing to believe vig.<br><br>On another note, I ISO'd last nights victim, which was relatively easy with only 17 posts, and I find it intersting that nintendo was the second-scummiest player in every one of her reads.<br><br>She died because nintendo was feeling unsafe? Or to frame nintendo?  Combined with the fact that regfan found nintendo THAT SCUMMY all-game, the fact that mafia were already down one, and the WOW hammer, I think it more likely that regfan died to save nintendo's skin rather than to frame nintendo.  I could be wrong however, so I would like to leave this up to discussion.<br><br>He was also willing to be the hammer on the timeater wagon earlier in the day, when he hadn't really been stating that he saw timeater as scummy.  It just seemed like he was trying to offer to help town with whatever wagon town wanted more than he was trying to hammer someone he thought was scum.<br><br>His post #343, is where i first start seeing some actual pro-town interaction from him, but it is after being called scummy from a few other pro-town players, so overall its a null-tell for me whether this increased activity of scumhunting is because he IS town or because he wants to APPEAR town.  He continues to build pro-town cases for a few more posts before declining into his early-game habit of just answering direct attacks at him or statements posed at him and such, but that is again a null tell, I do much the same during most of the end of my Day 1's too.<br><br>Over-all, the hammer, the flip, the night death, and the re-read I find nintendo the most scummy out of anyone else in the game.  I invite you all to prove me wrong however, as doing so increases activity which is good for town."}

Regfan asked for my current reads and I stated that I couldn't oblige because I didn't have the time to read through everyone before I left for about 24 hours. And I came back to find that the day had ended. As I general rule, I don't make reads during the night for several reasons. 1. I could die and end up wasting time. 2. Night deaths can greatly affect those reads, as newly confirmed roles can help cement the meanings of certain posts. 3. Night is a time for me to take a bit of a breather and/or focus on other games more intensely.<br><br>I'm both pleased and disappointed to see that almost everything that's happened so far today is some excellent content with a lot of thought. Pleased because it gives me a lot to help strengthen and better define my reads and disappointed because it means that I have almost nothing to comment on offhandedly in this catch-up. Almost everything is just fodder for my reads and requires no comment. So unless someone has any questions for me, I imagine you can expect my detailed reread post tomorrow or the next day.

IE: even if QT was made before game started, scum didn't know about it till after game started.<br><br>The Day <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3345135#p3345135\" class=\"postlink\">officially started</a> at 5:57.

Which I find is TOTALLY long enough for them to come up with an elaborate day-vig the scum-partner scheme, WHEN THEY COULDN'T EVEN GUARANTEE THE SCUM PARTNER WAS GOING TO LOOK SCUMMY.<br><br>I mean lets start being realistic guys?

When I was going back and looking at the way Tick was playing, I wanted to try to understand Tick - as a player. That is how my play is evolving. I look at how a player IS.

Just because I think about what I say before I say it doesn't mean anything. I'm deliberate in my actions because I don't wish to create unnecessary misunderstandings. When misunderstandings do arise, I'm quick to correct them so that it is clear to everyone what the score is. And walls most certainly are not anti-town, sir. They aren't inherently pro-town either, but there is nothing about them indicative of scum activity. It's simply a players chosen style of writing.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>When I asked Tick what he felt about Link, he says two things: That he has a good head on his shoulders and his feelings are null. He is reluctant to give me a read either way; which I take as some evidence of Tick being a little torn on what to do. Tick wasn't the most experienced scum, and often I got the vibe from him that he should just avoid sticky situations without comitting, like how he did in most of his posts. <br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3347546#p3347546\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 6#p3347546</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote><br>But he didn't give reads on anybody. What is your fucking point?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>When Link attacked me for my rage-out escapades (which was pretty predatory but ultimately understandable - again, Link is a slippery fellow) Tick butts into the conversation, trying to be useful but ultimately saying nothing of consequence (in my opinion). He defends me and says a real goon would have kept tunneling, consequences be damned. The fact that he felt the need to quote link and DEFEND ME says to me he was possibly breadcrumbing if his buddy died. Its a bit of a stretch but its what I'm feeling on that post.<br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3349863#p3349863\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 3#p3349863</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote><br>I'm not even sure what you are saying happened here.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>When Zdenek attacks Link, Tick defends him because I was on Zdenek. He probably felt I was most likely to die, so he could set up Zdenek for tomorrow. Normally scum dont defend each other, but again Tick wasn't the most advanced scum around.<br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3356076#p3356076\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 6#p3356076</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote><br>There's absolutely no bearing to this argument. It's entirely speculation and conjecture.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>As I said - I dont like the people who joined the wagon late. Link was one of them.</div></blockquote><br>Considering he was my chief sspect at the time, since you were looking town, that's hardly a point against me. Also, I wanted to put my vote somewhere before I was gone for a day. How was I even supposed to know he'd be lynched? What kind of Day 1 ends that quickly? Why would I even leave my vote unattended on my scum partner with a large waagon before going off for a day? That shit doesn't even make sense.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>About my \"quote wall implication post\" - That post generated a good bit of speculation and wifom. The thing I did not like about it was Link's tiny little role, and I was hoping someone else would pick up on it. He is more than willing to speculate on the goings on of scum:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Link wrote:</cite>Quicktopic could have been open prior to PMs, he could have sent scum PMs first, and discussion might have been open during in-thread confirmation since it was the confirmation phase. If what you say is true, I count about 37 minutes that could have contained discussion.</div></blockquote><br><br>That sort of paranoia, while entirely subtle and slippery (which is Link's MO) is scummy.</div></blockquote><br>How is paranoia scummy? And how is it paranoia? It's a statement of a real possibility that could have occurred. And how is it subtle or slippery? And don't act like you know what my MO is.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I <span class=\"noboldsig\">urge</span> you guys to lynch Link and kill him before the game progresses much further, because he's just going to get harder and harder to kill.</div></blockquote><br>I don't really see how that's a problem. If there's no reason to kill me, then it probably means I'm town. Just looking at it statistically, I'm far more likely town than scum. If my actions are such that would seem to point to me being town and the odds are in favor of me being town, then you know what that means? I'm probably town.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>HELLHOUND? GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT WEAK SHIT<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>HIKARI READING THE THREAD<br><br>NOT POSTING<br><br>SCUM NOT POSTING BECAUSE HE DOESNT HAVE TO, BETTER TO LURK IN THIS SITUATION AND HE KNOWS IT<br><br>LYNCH THIS SUCKER</div></blockquote>1. Don't call me Hikari, bro. 2. Reading on my phone. Thanks to your bullshit, I'm actually gonna have to post tonight instead of taking a break.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hey, <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">BRO</span></span><br><br>Whats it like to be tunneled by a real-life psychic? YOU SCARED? ID BE.<br><br>IM LIKE MEWTWO BUT BETTER<br><br>LYNCH HIKARI ALREADY</div></blockquote><br>Well, for starters, thanks for being a dick. Based on how you were towards DH, I imagine that's just how you operate. So aside from this looking like little more than a drunken tirade, I really can't figure you out. You seem more of a stupid dick than scummy. Your motivations seem town, they're just dumb.I see no reason to take you seriously at this point, but maybe that's your goal? Appear so blatantly stupid that nobody would suspect you as scum (see, I can speculate too) and cruise to victory. What really interests me is that you so willingly accepted a lynch on you when I flip town. I'm not sure if that's dumb town motivation not realizing that two town lynches back to back helps nobody or scum motivation in that you think you can talk your way out of it. Considering how bad you are with words and people, I'm really more inclined to believe the former though. Long story short, you aren't worth the towns time to lynch, but you'll add nothing of value to the game if you stay alive. <br><br>Now I'm tired from a long day of video games, so I'm going to sleep. If I feel like it, I'll get to work on those reads tomorrow, otherwise expect them Wednesday. If anything else is addressed in my general direction, I'll likely respond, as I lie to keep abreast of the situation to some extent, even if I'm not reading thoroughly."}

And here I was hoping you had come to your senses. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll contrive more reasons to call me scum later and I'm sure that once again, they will bear no fruit. Not to make you feel any worse, but to make matters worse, scum have a tendency to keep me alive the stronger the general town read gets on me. I'd call it a combination of fear of a Doctor and hoping that they can inject the town with paranoia. And I won't even be surprised if you call this scum WIFOM trying to establish a legitimate reason for me to not get killed all the way until the end. I don't really care if I fuel your suspicion, because I'm convinced at this point that nothing I say will change it. Just giving you some fair warning."}

Then he comes out of the gate with just a bunch of honest scumhunting and good analysis.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">don_johnson</span>: I didn't really like his start, but he has more or less delivered today. He actually went back and read the thread like he promised and he's showing extreme signs of scumhunting. He's a bit sure that he's caught scum in Timeater and Maruchan, but in my experience, that isn't necessarily scummy. I've seen plenty of town sure that they've caught scum and shouting it to the heavens. Confidence is a key part of charisma and it can be a great tool to get a wagon going. Though I honestly don't agree with his Timeater read and I think his Maruchan case might be reaching a little. But I do agree that Maruchan's coming off as a bit scummy. Worth keeping an eye on Maruchan, but scummy town really just looks like his meta. My read on dj is kinda null right now. Not sure if his suspicions are genuine or an attempt at a mislynch.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">hahonryuu</span>: He doesn't post very often, but what he does post feels town. He questions things that he thinks are off, but he's not quick top point fingers. This is what I feel is exemplary new town. That's not to say that his play is optimal, just that he's doing what I feel new town should do. The best way to grow is to question the things that you don't agree with and understand what the reasons are and whether or not those reasons make sense. Other than that, he appears to be scumhunting to the best of his abilities.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">hellhound1</span>: His Day 1 was next to useless. His vote on Timeater wasn't really scummy, but as someone previously mentioned, the way it was placed was. I've seen the \"forgot to vote\" excuse before and it's even happened to me, so it's really null. But the way that he placed it just seemed off. Coming into Day 2, he starts off by accusing the fairly townie Zdenek and Twistedspoon. His WIFOM with why he wouldn't have killed Empking or Regfan really isn't a legitimate defense either, because of the WIFOM. From that point on I can't even really follow his train of thought. Does he think I'm scum? Was it a ploy to see if I came out looking scummy? I don't know. All I really know is at this point is that his current scum reads are shit. Me because a claimed vanilla townie might be a power role (though I can't tell if he really suspects me). Timeater because he was scummy yesterday, even though Timeater really didn't even look that scummy by the end of the day and still doesn't. TS because of allegedly trying to set up a mislynch, but not Zdenek, who he thinks is his partner? And why does he have a problem with Zdenek tunneling Timeater if he thinks Timeater may be scum too? I'm honestly not following his train of thought. And where is his vote? He seems to have a hard time placing it if not asked.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: hellhound1</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Maruchan</span>: Ongoing games are ongoing, so I can just say meta. Don't like his assertion that there was no time for scum talk at the beginning of the game, but he still reads town to me. Still, don_johnson and nintendoaddict1 make some decent arguments and he will be watched.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">nintendoaddict1</span>: Wow, he's posted a lot more than I thought. Not too sure on him. His vote history looks kinda scummy, particularly the TS vote today, and I really don't buy the Tick hammer excuse, could just be a vie for towncred. On the other hand, his case against Maruchan is decent. I'm more inclined to lean scum on him than Maruchan though. I'd say that if Maruchan flipped town, he's more likely scum, though not necessarily vice versa. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timeater</span>: What's to say about him that I haven't already said? The guy is unstable and I don't think he's a credit to the town, but I think that he is a townie and it seems like a waste to lynch him. I'm not sure if him deciding he's gonna sheep TS is a good thing or a bad thing at this point. If Ts is town, it's good. If he's not, it's bad.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Twistedspoon</span>: I've been complimented several times by him for my play and it makes me wary. But he doesn't read scum at all. I'm pretty sure he's town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Zdenek</span>: Seems pretty townish, but I'm really not positive on him. He is apparently V/LA right now, so I am waiting for content from him today to pass judgment.<br><br>Town<br>Ankamius<br>hahonryuu<br>Twistedspoon<br>Timeater<br>Maruchan<br>Zdenek<br>don_johnson<br>nintendoaddict1<br>hellhound1<br>Scum<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@Everyone</span>: I would like a list from everyone, just in terms of where you stand on everyone else. It helps keep people consistent, I believe. With no list, a player is free to vote for anyone they like and it's harder to pin down where there head is at because they can jump around. By laying down where your reads stand, we can see if there is inconsistency in your actions more easily. For example, voting for your listed top town read with no clear catalyst can be very telling. And there has to be at least some reasoning. By the way, this is entirely optional, but it would be very helpful."}

Still going to keep it in mind if you flip town. I've got reads over him, even with that flip, but he's worth watching closer at least.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>Welcome Casey we'll get along just fine us 2 once you've read the whole thread<br><br>I don't want a hammer until you've caught up; hence my unvote</div></blockquote><br>Considering he admitted to laziness, I sense this will end up very similarly to don_johnson. Why slog through reading the day when he's just gonna throw a hellhound vote out in the end? That's what I'm imagining from him, at least.</div></blockquote><br>I think anyone can see 4 pages is nothing compared to where we are. Thus i expect him to read the whole thread, even if he doesn't make a <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3182667#p3182667\" class=\"postlink\">catchup post as big as the one I did last time I replaced into a game</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite>I hadn't noticed that either.

And it would be kind of hypocritical to let dj get away with it and not nocase. I mean, he's coming in a relatively unsuspected slot and there's the chance he could be night killed. I'd hate to make him read 30 pages just to die when we all know hellhound is getting it today. He could stand to at least look at the general case against hellhound, but reading everything seems a bit harsh when we already haven't held everyone to those standards. If he wants to, that would be great, but if he doesn't, I see no reason to make him.</div></blockquote><br>point taken<br><br>I just assume replacements will read the thread though as that's what replacements do<br><br>If he's alive tommorow then I guess he could do with a read up<br><br>I just feel he (may) be sheeping voting hellhound without reading the whole thread.

First, it looks as though he placed that vote on timeater just to satisfy ankmius. his earlier posts often have like 100 posts in between them. lurking? in 521 &lt;iso 5&gt; he doesn't REALLY defend himself. he just goes \"but im town...oh well whatever\" basically. he then goes on to say that if TS went on to push for his lynch then TS and zdenek were good choices for scum team. sounds a bit OMGUSish. though on the other hand if he knows he's scum, trying to pin 2 people when you know that when you die no one would believe you anyway seems...odd. mild town points for that. but very mild. you then say that you can't be scum because empking thought you were town and he's dead now and as scum you would NEVER kill someone who thought you were town...<br><br>problem being that that requires us to take you at your word. oh, and 2 people died last night. what makes you so sure the mafia was the one who killed empking hmm? and killing regfan would have been the last thing you would've done? really? at the risk of sounding scummy, he would be pretty high on the list of people I would kill whether he suspected me or thought I was as town as town could be. what scum would allow a player that good to live? seems not pro. also considering you were using empking as proof first almost seems like you realized \"oh crap, that makes it sound like i know for a fact which one was killed by scum and which was killed by a vig/SK. better talk about regfan too\"<br><br>you didn't put much explanation into your reads. setting up for an easy flip-flop perhaps? in fact you even said they were likely to change. now im all for someone you thought was scummy proving their innocents somehow or a town all of a sudden doing something super scummy and you shouldn't ignore such things...but it just seems so indecisive. i mean im pretty indecisive myself but at least I explain myself as best I can. i'm not saying write novels like I do, but more than what you are giving would be nice<br><br>when i confront you on some problems I had with your tells, specifically why ankmius was apparently being treated more or less like null leaning scum for being \"wrong\" when i was town while being wrong. you claim it was because ankmius was coming after YOU. sounds a bit OMGUSy. not completely since you arent voting him and don't have him as a total scum read. but it does seem odd. you've done some iffy things in your play, he isnt the only oen to call you out on them. voting you isn't a crime. <br><br>also you sheep one of your scum reads who is going after one of your null reads...wut? and yes, even though he's on your scum list he's obviously a null read since when i confronted you about it before you said you had nothing on him and were just doing it because of timeater and you actually had no read on him.<br><br>also, even if he doesn't get back on int im for your lynch if it happends, TS is quite obviously anti you. its not like we would let him get away with saying \"look guys i wasn't on his wagon\" assuming you do flip town.<br><br><br>maybe i am just too gullible but I kind of believe you. but at the same time you have been doing/saying some shady things. null leaning scum for now.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">nocase:</span> pretty interesting slot. first it was scum, then frustrated town, then almost obv town, and then the newest incarnation says some iffy things right away. we'll see what happends after some more posts.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">don johnson:</span> I don't really like the way you operate but I don't think you are scum as of now. you come in and choose to openly sheep the top choice at the time, in fact you even said you didn't really think he was very scummy &lt;near the bottom of post 350: \"i never felt that strongly he was scum\"&gt;. agreed with some points on timeater and nintendo, but after whats happened since, im actually thinking timeater is just a townie who is unstable IRL. speaking of which <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: timeater</span>. honestly not sure what to make of you. you are definitely scum hunting but im not sure I care for your methods. it almost seems like you are policy lynching timeater. anyway, null leaning town<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">nintendo:</span> gotta say, even if you are right, your early defenses of me seem kinda shady. I now know I was wrong to vote for DH/ankmius/nocase the way i did...so you defending my reasoning just seems like you were trying to make them the badguy for an early mislynch and coming to the defense of, as dj put it, \"poor newbie ryu\". you even made a reference to a past game where DH did what he did and said that they were town. that sounds similar to ticks \"i was wrong, but my logic is sound\" argument before...and look what role he turned out to be. \"even RVS votes have reasons\"...really. random votes have reasons. sir, its random. the reasons are null and void. the \"reasons\" are practically there for comedic purposes a chunk of the time. I mean I was defending myself because, it was myself. but you defending me seems kind of sketchy. I also dislike that hammer. sure, it was scum, but the way it came out of nowhere is shady. and no i dont mean your suspicion came from nowhere, but the hammer itself. <br><br><br>theres more, not just on nintendo but on everyone in general. unfortunately im going to work <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">.<br><br>later"}

My whole thing is looking at shit from multiple angles. Do you honestly believe I'm going to overlook the possibility that the claim is fake? I'm just saying that given the claim, I'm more inclined to believe it. A fake Doc claim is hard, because we can direct his protection at night and then even if he isn't the Doc, Mafia cant kill that person or he's outted as a fake. Yes, he could claim to be roleblocked, which isn't totally unlikely considering I'd be kind of surprised if there were no hookers in Vegas, so it just means that if we should take out a roleblocker, he has no excuses anymore.<br><br>For now I'd say the best bet is to just direct his protections. If they die, we can take it to indicate that either he is a liar or they have a roleblocker, either of which is useful information. If a roleblocker flips after that, we can infer he is probably town. If not, we can infer that he is probably scum. It's no guarantee, but it's the safest plan I can think of. Either way though, the death is not indicative of his alignment and it can actually hinder the Mafia if he is legit or if he isn't, so it seems like a solid plan. Any objections?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">in fact the vig doesn't need to claim<br></span><br>we just have to direct the vig to a target and tell nintendo to protect the same target<br><br>the plan would work like this<br><br>1) we tell the vig to vig a general scumread tonight (hellhound?

What I'm actually far more concerned about is you. Yesterday, you sort of disregarded the possibility of multi-shot or one-shot Vig yesterday and now you've got a few more things added to the list. You haven't factored in that<br><br>1. There could be an SK.<br>2. Both Mafia and Vig/SK could have targeted dj last night.<br>3. Vig/SK could've targeted DJ and Mafia targeted Zdenek.<br>4. Vig could be 2-Shot, like the Tracker and just didn't have a target they were confident in last night. (Couldn't be an SK, because they don't have such a problem)<br>5. Vig/SK could have the Odd Night or Non-Consecutive Night modifier, as seen below:<br><blockquote><div><cite>wiki wrote:</cite>Modifiers which are explicitly Normal include:<br>Even/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Bulletproof, Compulsive, Macho, Weak, Backup (with or without primary role present) </div></blockquote><br>Obviously can't be Even Night, since a kill didn't happen last night and did happen the first night.<br><br>It's entirely possible that one of your three assertions is correct, but by no means a guarantee. Right now I'm sort of torn because I feel like TS could be scum, but at the same time, I don't want to see another PR lynch today. Still, my reasons for suspicion:<br><br>1. Call for a Vig claim without presenting all of the facts. If there is a Roleblocker and we still have a useful Vig that claims, he would become useless. The worst part is that he can just brush this off as being forgetful or not thinking about it and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.<br>2. Two protective roles seems really powerful, especially when one is semi-permanent. As explained earlier, this could have been exploited very much if it had been discovered and used.<br>3. Push for Zdenek (and myself to a lesser extent) as seemingly town above town could be seen as an attempt to buddy/protect scum buddy/implicate townie as scum.<br>4. Hammer on nintendoaddict yesterday after the certainty he presented that nintendo was town.<br>5. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3368562#p3368562\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> calls Maruchan near-confirmed town for his reponse to the Vig gambit, yet he went after Maruchan a few times after the gambit and even now has his vote on Maruchan.  <br>6. Seems kinda certain that dj must have been the Mafia target and that Zdenek wasn't. Granted, he was making a lot of assumptions, but that one doesn't sit right with me.<br><br>Admittedly this is WIFOM and circumstantial evidence at best. This is by no means a certainty, but we've got to consider the possibility carefully as time goes on. We really should've lynched TS yesterday. The fact that he asked for it first is in no means indication of him being town though, since scum could just as easily make the statement to look town. There's really just no good way of telling at this point.<br><br>Regardless of whether or not he is town though, there's really no need for the Vig claim at this point. All of us unclaimed guys should keep quiet so that is there is a Vig, he can stay hidden. Even if he was roleblocked last night, I believe I've now created enough uncertainty that the Mafia can't even determine whether or not they actually successfully blocked anything. If there's a Serial Killer, he could just as easily be any of the claimed vanilla townies, so the narrowing down is useless.<br><br>Right now I'd say our best bet is to continue on the hellhound wagon from yesterday, but I'll list everyone right now and my stance on them.<br><br>Zdenek: Seems townish, but he's still done nothing for the town of particular value. Nonetheless, he could be the Vig and so we can't lynch him yet. I don't generally endorse teamhunting, but I feel like if he or TS flipped scum, the other would be more likely to flip scum.<br>hellhound1: Still scummy, but he did place his vote on TS yesterday. If he flipped town, I'd have a stronger suspicion of TS.<br>Timeater: Not sure if VI or evil genius masquerading as VI.<br>hahonryuu: Seems town enough and a potential Vig. Can't and shouldn't lynch.<br>Twistedspoon: Seems scummy to me, but I am subject to bouts of paranoia. Nonetheless, claimed Doc and we really shouldn't lynch him right now.<br>Maruchan: It occurs to me that both dj and nintendo made arguments against him and now they have both flipped town and he's well on my radar.<br>nocase: I want some real work put in from him today, but his slot has looked clean so far, so no complaints about him.<br><br>Analyzing NK reasoning is far too WIFOM, especially with a potential Vig/SK, so I'm not even gonna bother looking at that to determine scum. <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: hellhound1</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>@maru:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">so why would I claim doc after a doc already claimed if I wasn't one? that's just asking for a lynch after the original doc flipped town?<br><br>IT MAKES NO SENSE</span></div></blockquote><br>That's entirely debatable.

The only reason I claimed is because of my level of certainty that you are the Roleblocker. What possible reason would I have as scum to claim Vig today or right now? Surely not to protect TS. If so, I wouldn't have put him at L-1 and I most certainly would not call him and you my 2 suspects. It's not like I was at L-1 and needed to claim to survive. I claim the moment I think that it's most beneficial to the town. Maruchan can vouch for that.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>He's scum. No doubt.</div></blockquote>And again we come to where you fucked up. Too much emphasis on trying to discredited the uncounter-claimed Vig and not enough emphasis on not doing dumb shit. Props to both you and TS. You played a pretty good Day 1. The Day 2 not so much and you fell apart today. Bu then I'm your opponent, so I really can't blame you for not being able to outdo me.<br><br>@Town: If Zdenek and TS don't flip scum and I'm not dead tomorrow, then feel free to lynch me if you honestly believe I'm town. For today, humor me and I guarantee victory. What is the worst that can happen? We can mislynch a townie, but it's not gonna put us in MyLo if we do or anything. You give this a shot and we can end this right now and if not, then Zdenek is probably right and I'm scum that must be lynched tomorrow, right? It's win-win."}

He's scum. No doubt.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>I already explained this, but I'll do so again. I thought for certain that Zdenek was scu8m, based on his own actions. For starters, I didn't like where his votes had been for the previous days. Day 1 he didn't vote Tick and Day 2 he voted nintendoaddict. Then Day 3 he voted you, which seemed like bussing to me. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3389138#p3389138\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> was the last straw. It wasn't that he wanted to lynch me, it was the certainty with which he stated that we'd win if we did it, when if any two of those people weren't scum, we'd actually lose. He left no room for contingency or chance for any other scum, he just stated that doing that meant we would win. From there, as I stated before, he attempted to discredit me rather than convince me he was town. His Vig ploy earlier also seemed like he was setting up to claim Vig at some point to me, which I knew was impossible.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Also, his reasons for killing Empking look like scum trying to justify a kill rather than just taking out the person he is most suspicious of. <br>Already explained this, but it was a perfectly legitimate reason. Of my four suspects from Day 1, he was the only one still living that I'd probably never get enough info on to confirm as scum or town, so I went with a Vig.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Also, this sort of reactive statement designed to cut off conversation is scum bread and butter<br><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari wrote:</cite>. . . . because I can almost hear Zdenek calling us scum right now.<br></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>That's just my style. I don't have a problem stating exactly what I think will happen. You'll notice I didn't say something like \"see, I told you\", I only responded normally like I do to everything.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Here's why I don't believe it by the way.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Link wrote:</cite>Zdenek: Seems townish, but he's still done nothing for the town of particular value. Nonetheless, he could be the Vig and so we can't lynch him yet.<br></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>I'm fairly certain I already said that this is not an argument. I've literally already responded to all of these already, so why are you asking them again? The answers aren't changing because he flipped town because I didn't know he was at the time and the what I said then was based on what I thought at the time. When I still thought he could be town, there was no reason not to say that he could be the Vig if it meant that I might not be targeted by scum. It's why the statement was so vaguely worded. I called him townish rather than town because I was mildly suspicious, but I wasn't anywhere near sure.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>zdenek, lets not split up our bandwaggons now. -.-<br></div></blockquote><br>Hmmmm, I'll stick with Link for the time being.</div></blockquote>[/quote]<br>What's to say to that? He was as wrong as I was. Both of us suspected one another above all others and we were both wrong.<br><br>Right now this is an extremely bad situation. There can't be more than 3 scum total, since 4 would mean we already lost. So far, the PRs we've seen flip are the White Mage and the 2-Sot Tracker, I believe. In addition, I'm the Odd Night Vig. As stated before, this leads me to believe that the TS claim is untrue. At this point, I have to be the Vig. There is nobody who can counter-claim me and an SK wouldn't have been roleblocked last night and could've easily targeted TS. I've got no problem with a TS lynch today, but the problem is tomorrow. We can't mislynch anymore, which is admittedly my fault, but it also means that we need to be very thorough in our selection. hellhound seems like the most likely option and I think it definitely had to be someone on the Zdenek wagon yesterday, which again points to him.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Twitedspoon</span><br><br>From this point on, I probably won't be Night Killed, sinc I can't afford to misVig tomorrow night, I'd probably be roleblocked anyway, and I'm a perfect mislynch target. It's possible that could change if the town believes my claim though, but not a sure thing. I'm just saying this so that everyone understands that there is every reason for the Mafia not to kill me at night from this point on. I can understand if you want to lynch me because I got Zdenek killed, but I really did believe he was scum and I was fairly certain we had the game won. The fact of the matter is though, I must be the Vig because nobody else can be the Vig. And there must be a Vig or there would be no way of explaining the Night 1 kill of Empking and then no other kills. Well, other than a one-shot SK. But why would I claim as scum then? Thee was no reason for it. As I explained yesterday, my claim only made sense as town. As scum, the real Vig would counter-claim and I'd die along with TS or the SK would kill me at night. As SK, I'd draw unnecessary attention to myself and would be the guaranteed lynch after all scum are killed. These are the only 3 options, because we know for a fact that the Empking death came from somewhere. So in closing, I'm town and we need to lynch TS, but I really can't be sure what to do from there. I suppose hellhound is probably the way to go. Their conflict could have been mutual bussing, I suppose."}

What's so hard about that?</div></blockquote><br>There's a Roleblocker. I'd have to lynch him. And I don't think I can because I'm not sure it's hellhound. I think you are the Mafia Doc though.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>and if there's only one mafioso, and one SK, it's even more likely you could win. All you're doing is playing down the SK's winning odds to make yourself seem town. That's the logical fallacy. Also the fact that you think an SK could be trusted to work alongside the town is bizzare as well. \"well if you do prove me to be the SK, I promise I can play with the town too :3\"</div></blockquote><br>First of all, how am I playing it down? I've listed every possible scenario I can think of here. Second of all, I made no such promise. I simply said that if I were the SK, the town would be better off keeping me around. Mafia would have to kill me at night if they don't want me to win, right? So again, how does it help to lynch me if I'm SK?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>anyways you say 2 docs can't exist, yet you say a roleblocker must exist as your kill didn't occur last night.

That's just a fucking dumb question.</div></blockquote><br>language padr\u00e9</div></blockquote><br>No dice.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>you're missing the point anyways. I know an RB would be scum aligned, I'm not as stupid as you're making me out to be. Your story is that a scum RB exists which stopped your kill last night. this may be true and all, yet you also say 2 docs is broken and therefore I should be lynched, however once you accept that scum have an RB, then 2 docs is no-longer broken. So your case just fell apart. again.</div></blockquote><br>Completely and utterly wrong. Two-shot Tracker, White Mage, Doctor, and Odd Night Vig against a Goon, Roleblocker, and what, another goon? Nope, not happening. The scenario you are describing is utterly ridiculous. A Rleblocker does not make two protective roles not broken, especially when one of them lasts for two nights. Your argument is still utter shit.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>My theory still is that you either puposefuly NK'd last night to incriminate myself,</div></blockquote><br>That's not particularly incriminating.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>or tried to kill nocase, who I protected. </div></blockquote><br>Why would I ever target nocase? If I were SK, then I'd obviously be trying to get scum out of the way.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>Both would make sense. The first probably moreso.</div></blockquote><br>Not really. Both seem dumb. And funny that you're not even acknowledging a Roleblocker here when you say that two Docs is balanced by a Roleblocker.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite>I already explained this, but I'll do so again. I thought for certain that Zdenek was scu8m, based on his own actions. For starters, I didn't like where his votes had been for the previous days.

It wasn't that he wanted to lynch me, it was the certainty with which he stated that we'd win if we did it, when if any two of those people weren't scum, we'd actually lose. He left no room for contingency or chance for any other scum, he just stated that doing that meant we would win. From there, as I stated before, he attempted to discredit me rather than convince me he was town.

The difference there is that I said if Zdenek was Roleblocker, wed win. Obviously, I ended up being wrong, which I admit. Like I said, if you honestly don't think I'm town, you can lynch me.

Scum win.<br><br>So considering a town loss is pretty much decided and my lynch is almost inevitable, I'll take this opportunity to apologize to all of the town. This loss was on me because I pushed the Zdenek lynch yesterday. I was sure he was scum by the way he was acting, but I should've played it more cautiously and just continued with the TS lynch. It doesn't help that I miscalculated the situation. And to make matters worse, I completely didn't consider that the only way we could ever get a scum lynch at this point is with Timeater. I knew from the beginning he would be dangerous in MyLo, but I didn't consider him being this bad. So short of a miracle, I guess we lost. Good game guys. I'm still gonna fight to the last breath, because I don't give up, but it really probably is a lost cause."}

My play and analysis say I'm town, as well as my meta. If you want to know why I'm town though you 're probably best off asking the others as even as scum I'd say my play has been town. (but srsly, I know I'm town)<br>3) there is probably an RB. I have been saying it from d2. If not there is a 'Black mage' or some other scum power.<br>4) you or scum (if you are an SK)were either roleblocked or targeted protected player on nights when only one killed occured. Either this or you purposefully no-killed on non-odd nights to create a plausible fakeclaim of odd-night vig. It makes sense since odd-night SKs are incredibly rare and unfair and it would create a believeable and safe, fakeclaim.<br>5) scum could have powers. How about that roleblocker? I've been in more confusing setups anyways. Hoppster's mathamathia was a mini normal which screwed us over much worse than this. Here it's a simple case of 2 docs to at least one scum RB. I wouldn't call a tracker an investigative role anyways."}

I've seen him flip in two games as town where he was as scummy as this, if not more so. <br><br>I'd like to suggest \"Doc\" on hellhound tonight and this nocase lynch. Here's my reasoning:<br><br>Timeater: Believes the TS claim. He probably won't be killed tonight.<br>Maruchan: A scum suspect of some. Good mislynch. If he died, it would be one less person to mislynch.<br>Me: Flipping Vig would essentially invalidate the TS calim, so it's not going to happen.<br>TS: Can't because he's the \"Doctor\". Also, he's scum, so it won't happen.<br><br>hellhound is the only one I can see being killed without TS losing much. Of course, TS is likely to say that he protected Timeater, but I think if we can agree that hellhound should be the target, he'll have no choice. Of course, if nocase isn't the Roleblocker, he'll probably just claim to have been blocked.<br><br>What does everyone who isn't nocase or TS think of this?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>lynch me tomorrow.

For me, the biggest tell that hellhound and Maruchan aren't scum is that they haven't voted for me today. It was all too easy for scum to push a mislynch on me earlier today and end the game, but those guys didn't. The reason nocase doesn't get a pass for that is his general scumminess. Also, he came in kind of late for that. And the reason you don't get scum points is because it was entirely within my predictions that you'd vote for me.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>Did we have a double kill night besides reg+emp?

You aren't confirmed town technically, but you aren't scum either and even if you were, it wouldn't matter. If we lynch nocase and he's not scum, we lose. But he's probably scum, so we're fine there. And there's almost no chance you are scum and TS isn't. TS is scum. I can tell almost for certain based on our exchange today. I've dealt with scum before who have acted exactly like that in my native forum. So quick to discredit every word I said, to come up with wild and improbable scenarios, to nitpick every single  thing I say and twist it against me, to push and push to the edge of my patience, to speak as though he is the epitome of town and I am worse than Hitler.

The fact is, the town absolutely needs you and everyone else united on a nocase and TS lynch t win and you are the wild card. Everyone else, I can see lynching TS, but if I'm not there to talk it through with you, I can't be anywhere near as sure. I mean, just look at how Maru acts with you. He'd never get you to vote TS. And hellhound isn't around nearly enough and I know far too little about him to trust him with the job. And so I need to try to make sure that even if I die tonight, you'll still lynch TS tomorrow."}

You never should have walked away from Day 2 alive. I claim responsibility for Day 3 Zdenek did some dumb shit to turn a minor suspicion into a major one.
