The vegas gang owned it all, cops being bribed, judges being bribed, witnesses being bribed, then it comes to the un-bribed people to stop the mafia and lynch them. (Yeah sorry for it being crap, i'm tired...).<br>\nSo...welcome to Vegas Mafia and i'll (Ender 241) shall be hosting your game, here are the rules:<br>\nRules To Not Break:<br>\n1. Mafia is a game. Please try to have fun while playing it. Blatant personal attacks on other players will result in warning optional modkill and auto-loss to the offending player.<br>\n2. You have been given a win condition and it is your job to try and fulfill it. Do not deliberately play against your win condition and/or deliberately hurt your faction with your play.<br>\n3. Do not quote your role PM. Do not quote from any mod-provided private QT. Both these will result in modkill and auto-loss.<br>\n4. Talking about the game outside the thread or any mod-provided QT is forbidden. Unless the offense is incredibly minor (i.e. brief mention of the game without discussing any of its content), this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>\n5. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts, do not do so, this will result in a modkill and auto-loss.<br>\n6. Unreadable text is forbidden. This includes but is not limited to cyphers, incredibly small text and invisible text.<br>\n7. Dead players may not speak in the thread once they are dead. Not even a simple &#8220;Bah&#8221; post.<br>\n<br>\nRules Of Voting And Deadlines:<br>\n8. Votes must be bolded and in the form Vote: Havingfitz. I suggest using the vote button when placing your vote to ensure it is formatted properly and easily noticed.<br>\n9. You have the option to Vote: No Lynch.<br>\n10. Unvotes are not required but should be bolded when used.<br>\n11. A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1. For example, Day 1 will have 13 players alive, and ((13+1)/2) = 7 votes to lynch.<br>\n12. After a lynch or no lynch occurs the thread will be locked once I announce the result. Posting can continue until the thread is locked.<br>\n13. Day 1 will last 3 weeks. All future days will last 2 weeks unless mod says otherwise. All nights will last 72 hours unless otherwise stated.<br>\n14. If no player reaches a majority of votes by the deadline on a given day, No Lynch will occur.<br>\n15. If a player does not submit a night action by the end of any given night, they will not act that night.<br>\n<br>\nRules Of Activity And Prods:<br>\n16. If a player goes 48 hours without posting in-thread, they will be prodded. If they do not post in-thread within 24 hours following a prod, they will be replaced.<br>\n17. Please let your mod know if you will be on V/LA &#8211; post it in-thread and bolded.<br>\n18. Players are allowed two prods. Player replacement takes the place of a third prod.<br>\n19. Players may request a prod on another player if a player has gone without posting for 72 hours and I have missed prodding them.<br>\n19 1/2. If you flake in my game you will be unable to join another of my games for 3 months, do it again and you will never be able to play my game again.<br>\nRules Unrelated To The Previous Categories:<br>\n20. Though I am the mod, I'm not exempt from making mistakes. If I screw up something, please PM me and point it out.<br>\n21. My color is green. Do not use it.<br>\n22. Vote counts will be posted at my discretion and by request if necessary.<br>\n23. Anything game related that needs brought to my attention (ie votecount and prod requests, v/LAs, etc) must be bolded and preferably start with &#8220;Mod, &#8220;<br>\n<br>\n1. <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Zdenek</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla townie</div><br>\n2.<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Regfan</div> (Who replaced Mysterio) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">2-shot tracker</div><br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">don_johnson</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla townie</div><br>\n4.

I'm not really sure on the Maruchan case, because I know that I personally play more of a defensive townie game when I'm under fire, to an extent. I don't particularly see it as a scumtell and almost see it as more townie, just because I think trying to redirect suspicion to another is more scummy than trying to make oneself look innocent.

I'd say Maruchan is definitely still worth keeping an eye on though.<br>\n<br>\nTimeater is definitely my top suspect now. To answer your question why I didn't vote on anyone after DemonHybrid, it was because as I said, it was a \"brief reprieve\" and so I was waiting to see if he could convince me he was town, particularly since my Timeater potential read was partially based on how town DH looked. If he had continued to appear scummy to me, I had planned to put my vote back on him.

Mostly he critics and argues against points that others are making without really expressing his own thoughts.

Having compared this to Mafia in Canada (which is completed), that seems to be at least a little true. Plus the Timeater vote is great.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I have to say about Timeater:<br>\n<br>\nSince self provided meta is always garbage, Timeater should just be taking what DH said about himself and comparing it to what others say. His choice to attack him over providing meta that wasn't  good enough, looks like an attempt to discredit DH without really calling him scummy for it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite><br>\nAfter your blatant misrepping/floundering/desperation I'd like to see you lynched. Unlike Link I am not going to give you a pass, especially after the quote at the top of this post. 4. I set up nothing. I merely asked for a meta citation on your playstyle. You are attempting to create this elaborate construction of a \"meta argument\" where there is none. The only architect is you. You got super aggressive early game, you are going to draw the inquisitional eye. Get over it, sister.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIf you're scum, and you're playing aggressively to start, you are going to be aware that you will attract attention, and react to it accordingly. On the other hand, if you're town and you do it, and then you attract negative attention, you might act exactly as DH did - Timeater fails to consider this. <br>\n<br>\nI agree with what others have said about Timeater not being impressed with the VT claim - another time when he disparages DH to push his lynch without calling him scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite><br>\nDemon I didn't want to be a dick. . . .

I mean I guess a mafia could realize that its maybe not a real day vig &lt;or at least consider it&gt; and play town till the death is official just in case...but  I dunno, getting in to what scum MIGHT be thinking or not seems like it wont get us anywhere. I'm choosing to believe the claim for now unless he does something super scummy.<br>\n<br>\nmysterio: same deal as don johnson. though he claims to be catching up as I write this so maybe I'll be able to get a read of some kind on him tonight. though that was a while ago...so unless he's posting a wall even more massive than mine, gonna say its not happening tonight and he's strictly catching up on what has been going on and will comment at a later date.<br>\n<br>\nnintendoaddict: *reads name* hmm town points already! I jest of course. I dont necessarily agree with everything you have said, you SEEM town enough. at least at first. in 149 &lt;his ISO 9&gt; when he votes for DH, he does so after pointing out that he was quitting for being angry. now, there were lots of quotes in that post and earlier in the post he DID say that he thought DH was scummy...it just seems like an odd place to put the vote. why not put it higher up during the parts where the actual case was? it makes it seem like you voted because he quit. maybe im just being nit picky. or heck, maybe the rage quit was scummy in some way and was relevant to the case? if so then let me know. then later there was the way he took maru's \"prove im innocent\" as \"trying to be innocent\" which, as link pointed out, implies 2 very different things. you do something similar with twistedspoon in 249 &lt;ISO 17&gt;...seems pretty obvious he didn't mean that every PR who doesn't come out and say \"im role X\" is scummy behavior. he was just asking someone who had either made a claim or fakeclaim, and did so in a way that we would find out the truth eventually &lt;due to maru being alive or not&gt; relatively soon anyway. you seem to be twisting peoples words/meanings to your liking to make them look scummy. you later claim you were just tired...but i dunno. as with link, i suppose I'll believe your explanation for now unless something else comes up. difference being though that, counting maru, this is already the second time. sorta turning into a fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me kind of situation.<br>\n<br>\nThe Tick: ahh, your name and avatar bring up so many memories. havent seen that dude in forever. anyway, yeah. *sigh* can't really find anything that stands out. though like with Link he seems to act more like a commentator than a player. but he eventually stepped out of that a bit. answered questions when asked of him. says why he believes person X did thing Y. though one thing gets to me is that he retracts his defenses of timeater and basically says he WILL vote for him assuming timeaters defense was lacking...but I don't think he gave a reason for the take back he did. maybe he did and i missed it. after reading so many posts i could see my brain auto skipping stuff to get through with the work faster. So my question to you tick, why the retraction of your defense?<br>\n<br>\ntimeater: near the beginning, seems to be more fighting with DH than actually...how to word this. more fighting than debating? disagreeing? i dunno. continue on for a while and...wait you unvoted? wha- wh-. huh? just unvote, with no reason given? *is confused* maybe future posts will tell me why...you had an inner realization that had nothing to do with anything he &lt;and by implying inner realization nothign anybody else either&gt; said? how did you come to this inner realization? seeing some of your thought process would be nice. wait. you say your realization was that he's a bad player? sir, at the risk of getting votes since I myself have done dumb things, the roles are chosen randomly...a bad player can be scum. I mean I can sorta understand it on some level. its not like I havent seen someone do something...not optimal, and chose to believe it was due to inexperience or something and writing it off to an extent. but the way you did ait seems like you just suddenly happened to drop the case  completely. seems shifty. while i dont think that was the \"nicest\" way you could have put it, I will say that on some level you were \"pushed\" into saying DH is a bad player. and im not going to call you our for saying it. its not like I can dictate your opinions or anything.  however in 147 &lt;ISO 17&gt; after saying you were pushed into it...you continue on. at this point it isn't you being pushed into saying something mean, you are just being antagonistic. to say you are better than him AND say you are terrible and he should just get over it?<br>\n<br>\nat this point that seems to possibly be a mafia trying to start shit with someone to distract us from hunting, to watching a boxing match &lt;btw, low blows are a no no in boxing sir&gt;. then after the bell rings and DH forfeits the boxing match you say you are sorry to everyone for that? if you are so sorry why not just have ended it earlier? you then go absent for a while for no reason other than you feel like it. \"emp needs to stop active lurking\" says the guy who is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">apparently</div>  vla yet miraculously still posts and who's last several posts were:<br>\n<br>\nan apology, you telling the mod something, telling us you are on your wii as well as saying 2 people are probably the same alignment, calling someone &lt;i assume zdenek&gt; a moron for commenting on you being online but not voting with the excuse of you being vla...yet you have posted and were ON, so saying \"but i dont have to, i told you guys i wouldnt be on\" is kinda BS. anyway, continuing with the list, you then requested a vote count, and saying zdenek is backpeddling...<br>\n<br>\nyet you call someone out on active lurking? scratch that, you call someone out on active lurking while not only active lurking, but after basically asking freaking permission for it by saying you were vla. posting kinda voids your vla, particularly when your reasons were basically just because you wanted to. dont get me wrong, i believe he's active lurking too. but coming from you this is just laughable. so, pot, what color is that kettle again?<br>\n<br>\n\"real meat in a few hours\" *over 12 hours later*...im hungry, wheres muh meat foo?

DH said \"you dont understand RVS\" i said \"that doesnt make me scum, that just means i dont understand RVS\". you seemed to think that made me auto scum. why? also gotta say that within 4 posts you voted 4 times on 3 people. seems...wishy washy. a little later you vig. as of now because of that I really wanna say you are town because...well claiming &lt;or pretending to claim to put someone in a position like that&gt; takes bawlz. seems risky enough that I'm not sure a scum would do it. hmm, but at the same time, what if you had hit a PR and they claimed cop/blocker/whatever. that would mean you outed a PR. thinking about it that way, the plan seemed to involve more risk than gain. dont think I like it anymore. and in 293 &lt;iso 15&gt; where you explain...ahh hell <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><br>\nExcept, when I Was scum my mod told me that day-communications between scum in any form of code were EXPRESSLY not allowed, and in order for them to make this code, they would have had to talk about it in the QT, where the mod would have told them it wasn't allowed?

About Demon - because of the way he construed his arguments, the way he put together his cases - I felt they lacked any sort of empiricism, utterly rooted in passion, and ultimately holding up a sort of \"I'm right-your-wrong-no-matter-what\" style of logic. He was playing like a medieval inquisitor who wants his witch burned no matter the cost, no matter if he's wrong or right. Evidence of this could be gleaned from one of his first posts, where he says \"Town acts like X all the time, Scum acts like Y all the time\". I dont normally have split-second changes of heart, but since I did, and I rolled with it - I faced the consequences. My unvoting of demon was strange and should have been questioned. I am not 100% he isn't scum. I'd say I'm 51%.<br>\n<br>\nI dont like the way Zdenek has chainsawed for Demon. He's pretty much done it all game. I feel that either Demon is town and Zdenek is scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">OR</div> they are both scum. Zdenek was too quick to agree to my post about him being linked with Demon. He held on to it and used it greedily. The way he hopped from me to link then back to me again with the reasoning of a turnip. Trying to mollify Demon with an apology is apparently \"the story of blathering scum\". His vig was transparent as fuck. If wanted to gambit to get more information, it should NOT have been on Maruchan. I was his number #1 suspect, remember? He tried to justify it with \"oh Timeater isn't RESPONDING HE MUST BE SCUM\" - what a retarded line of reasoning.

About Demon - because of the way he construed his arguments, the way he put together his cases - I felt they lacked any sort of empiricism, utterly rooted in passion, and ultimately holding up a sort of \"I'm right-your-wrong-no-matter-what\" style of logic. He was playing like a medieval inquisitor who wants his witch burned no matter the cost, no matter if he's wrong or right. Evidence of this could be gleaned from one of his first posts, where he says \"Town acts like X all the time, Scum acts like Y all the time\". I dont normally have split-second changes of heart, but since I did, and I rolled with it - I faced the consequences. My unvoting of demon was strange and should have been questioned. I am not 100% he isn't scum. I'd say I'm 51%.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nYou attacked DH for not providing meta well enough and for attacking ryuu in RVS, so this seems to be a misinterpretation of your own reasons for attacking him. Plus you still aren't really saying that he's done anything scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite><br>\nI dont like the way Zdenek has chainsawed for Demon. He's pretty much done it all game. I feel that either Demon is town and Zdenek is scum OR they are both scum. Zdenek was too quick to agree to my post about him being linked with Demon. He held on to it and used it greedily. The way he hopped from me to link then back to me again with the reasoning of a turnip. Trying to mollify Demon with an apology is apparently \"the story of blathering scum\". His vig was transparent as fuck. If wanted to gambit to get more information, it should NOT have been on Maruchan. I was his number #1 suspect, remember? He tried to justify it with \"oh Timeater isn't RESPONDING HE MUST BE SCUM\" - what a retarded line of reasoning. Another example of him ammunition-gathering instead of posting with real consequence.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThe chain-saw defense is not a scum-tell.<br>\nBeing quick to notice a scum-slip is not scummy.<br>\nMost of my reasoning behind voting for link turns out to be part of his play style, and I was willing to forgive him for it because his vote was in a good place.<br>\n<br>\nI'll finish reading the things from yesterday later.", "time": "Wed Aug 17, 2011 11:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18764&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "18764"}

I think it comes first.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>claim: vt<br>\n<br>\nI'll be straight up. I've been scummy as fuck this game. I've said a lot of dumb shit. About Demon - because of the way he construed his arguments, the way he put together his cases - I felt they lacked any sort of empiricism, utterly rooted in passion, and ultimately holding up a sort of \"I'm right-your-wrong-no-matter-what\" style of logic. He was playing like a medieval inquisitor who wants his witch burned no matter the cost, no matter if he's wrong or right. Evidence of this could be gleaned from one of his first posts, where he says \"Town acts like X all the time, Scum acts like Y all the time\". I dont normally have split-second changes of heart, but since I did, and I rolled with it - I faced the consequences. My unvoting of demon was strange and should have been questioned. I am not 100% he isn't scum. I'd say I'm 51%.</div></blockquote><br>\nSo that means after all that, the best you have is essentially a null read on him? Cause you know 51% is only about half, right? That's generally null. Just saying, maybe use better percentages in the future? Nitpicking aside, I could see this.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I dont like the way Zdenek has chainsawed for Demon. He's pretty much done it all game. I feel that either Demon is town and Zdenek is scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">OR</div> they are both scum. Zdenek was too quick to agree to my post about him being linked with Demon. He held on to it and used it greedily.</div></blockquote><br>\nHe mentioed it like twice. And considering you apparently thought DH/Ankamius was town at the time, due to unvoting him, that was a perfectly legitimate argument. If you thought DH was town and thought that his alignment was linked to Zdenek, then what would that make Zdenek?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>The way he hopped from me to link then back to me again with the reasoning of a turnip. Trying to mollify Demon with an apology is apparently \"the story of blathering scum\". His vig was transparent as fuck. If wanted to gambit to get more information, it should NOT have been on Maruchan. I was his number #1 suspect, remember? He tried to justify it with \"oh Timeater isn't RESPONDING HE MUST BE SCUM\" - what a retarded line of reasoning. Another example of him ammunition-gathering instead of posting with real consequence.</div></blockquote><br>\nNot too sure about this argument, but I could see the Maruchan pick as a way to find out if a minor scum read would crack if he thought he was dying.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Zdenek</div><br>\n<br>\nA LIST!<br>\n<br>\n1.

Then it hit me, no real explanations, granted, we've seen allusions to some of the suspicions here or there, but those things can change over time as new content is added. I want an updated list with justifications of these reads, not just saying you read them that way. Especially the \"obvtown\" reads. If they re so obvious, then you must have justification up the ass. I'm not even saying I don't agree with some or all of these, but that's all the more reason you need to justify that shit. Scum can read the flow of the game and composite a list that they think the town will like.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I wasn't saying I got something against vt claims, just that one in particular (because of the meta, he said didn't have time for TS, and just quoted me in his crybaby style. + Next post the misrep). I gotta be honest, I was REALLY tempted to say something like TRACKER or fakeclaim cop just to stick it to this game. But I knew that if I did that I'd only be lynchbait down the line. I WISH I had a PR this game.</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't really like this statement. Fakeclaiming is super anti-town. Especially if you had been counter-claimed.

So as much as I dislike him for (pretending to) killing me, I don't find it as in any way shape or form scum-motivated.</div></blockquote><br>\nAs hahonryuu pointed out here, it could have been a scum ploy to out a PR.

DH's vote was placed because he found Hahoryuus vote to be opportunistic and nothing more, his explanation of it is entirely reasonable and the fact that he somehow got to L-2 and needed to claim that early in the game is immensely frustrating.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also reading the whole Timeeater vs DemonHybrid spat to be town on town to be perfectly honest, they both got incredibly riled up and instead of standing back to realize that they were pushing useless cases on each other they got personal. I'm actually finding minimal scum motivation for either of there play early on. I do want to read back and take a look at peoples stances on the situation later because I'm expecting that there would have been mafia attempting to 'mediate' the dispute while doing nothing beneficial themselves.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough I'm unsure what to make from Twisteds avoidance from mentioning his great scum win recently in the list of his games completed and his under-rating his own scum ability I'm finding a great deal of his posts to be very spot on and logical and thus have a strongish town-read on him at the moment, similarly I'm finding myself agreeing with a lot of the points suggested by Zdenek early on though I disagree with his push on Maruchan. I'm reading Maruchans defensiveness to be play style related rather than alignment related and considering I'm finding a lot of his thing rather than a scum-tell, his opening few posts as well as his meta-comparison draw to Link read as geninue town scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nSo far The Tick has been incredibly wishy-washy in his posts and has avoided and refrained from posting anything that can be considered as legitimate scumhunting or geninue town thinking. His willingness to drop his entire scum-read on DH just because he replaced out makes no sense whatsoever and reads as him attempting to avoid being the last person on the inevitable dying wagon. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not liking Nintendos play so far and I actually have significant meta experience with him, his play has been incredibly off this game and his votes so far have read as opportunistic and nothing more. I'm also disliking Hahonryuus reaction to DH's pressure and her decline in posting after it occurred, it honestly looks like mafia feeling like they're incriminating themselves by posting and therefore lurking until the focus moves elsewhere. <br>\n<br>\nOverall the the moment my reads are:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town: </div>DemonHybrid, Timeater, Twistedspoon, Maruchan, Zdenek (Weaker).<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null: </div>Don, Link, Empking, Hellhound.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum: </div> The Tick, Nintendo, Hahonryuu (Weaker).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ Link and Maruchan - </div>Can you both please stop quote-walling.

Overall leaning medium scum on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The Tick -</div> I've gone into my thoughts on him multiple times; His suspicion and change of reads is highly illogical and the fact he's attempting to defend that rather than review his read continues to enforce my read on him. Overall leaning strong scum on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Maruchan -</div> There's a lot that make me think Maruchan is town including his reaction to the vig-shot, his genuine scumhunting efforts before and after it, his continued meta research and ability to reanalyze and change his reads on logical reasoning. Overall leaning strong town on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ankamius -</div> I had a strong town read on DH and it's the sole reason why I believe this slot is still town.

My experiences with Regfan tell me that he is a very through player who considers all possibities and has both practical and theoretical brilliance as a player at times. At others he can underestimate players (cough) or put too much weight on things that aren't particularly significant imho. However the positives vastly outweigh the negatives and this is even more true when he is hydraing. My experiences with scum Regfan are vastly limited though so I cannot speculate on this front.

Why? How else better to get town cred than to be on the Day one wagon into scumville? And of the people on the wagon, the votes most likely to be scum-bussing are those at the beginning or those towards the end.  Why? Scum would either try to get town cred by beginning the bus on a partner, due to this would get them the most town-cred, OR, scum tend to hold their vote off till they see a useful wagon (like I pointed out The Tick was doing), then hop that wagon.  If that wagon happens to be a scum buddy, so be it.  Nintendoaddict was the Hammer on this particular wagon, and lets read his hammer post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nintendoaddict1 wrote:</cite>Screw it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: The Tick.</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo explanation as to his vote, so I ISO'd him to see if maybe he explained his vote earlier on. Get this: The ONLY time nintendoaddict has quoted, or said anything at all about The Tick, all game, WAS TO COMMENT ABOUT PAST GAMES.<br>\n<br>\nSo he has avoided saying anything at all (good OR bad) about Tick all game, till he decides to throw in a hammer, without explaining his hammer.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also going to go back alter and ISO some of the other not voting for TIck to see if any of them appear to be buddying/deferring to Tick's arguments or seem to ignore Tick at all.  I would guess a 3-person scum team, with a possible third-party alignment also. Considering two peopel died last night, I would say the likliehood of an SK.  However, sicne one was empking, I would be willing to believe vig.<br>\n<br>\nOn another note, I ISO'd last nights victim, which was relatively easy with only 17 posts, and I find it intersting that nintendo was the second-scummiest player in every one of her reads.<br>\n<br>\nShe died because nintendo was feeling unsafe? Or to frame nintendo?  Combined with the fact that regfan found nintendo THAT SCUMMY all-game, the fact that mafia were already down one, and the WOW hammer, I think it more likely that regfan died to save nintendo's skin rather than to frame nintendo.  I could be wrong however, so I would like to leave this up to discussion.<br>\n<br>\nHe was also willing to be the hammer on the timeater wagon earlier in the day, when he hadn't really been stating that he saw timeater as scummy.  It just seemed like he was trying to offer to help town with whatever wagon town wanted more than he was trying to hammer someone he thought was scum.<br>\n<br>\nHis post #343, is where i first start seeing some actual pro-town interaction from him, but it is after being called scummy from a few other pro-town players, so overall its a null-tell for me whether this increased activity of scumhunting is because he IS town or because he wants to APPEAR town.  He continues to build pro-town cases for a few more posts before declining into his early-game habit of just answering direct attacks at him or statements posed at him and such, but that is again a null tell, I do much the same during most of the end of my Day 1's too.<br>\n<br>\nOver-all, the hammer, the flip, the night death, and the re-read I find nintendo the most scummy out of anyone else in the game.  I invite you all to prove me wrong however, as doing so increases activity which is good for town.", "time": "Sun Aug 21, 2011 2:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18764&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "18764"}

Combined with the fact that regfan found nintendo THAT SCUMMY all-game, the fact that mafia were already down one, and the WOW hammer, I think it more likely that regfan died to save nintendo's skin rather than to frame nintendo.

He's too good. He's too slippery. Slippery I think is the best way to describe him. Unlike TS, who is obvtown to the umpth degree, Link has this faintly calculated air about him that makes him hard to pin down and hard to label. This quality forged my initial suspicions of him. When I was going back and looking at the way Tick was playing, I wanted to try to understand Tick - as a player. That is how my play is evolving. I look at how a player IS. I take in all their little eccentricities as data then use that data to look for fakeness. And fakeness isn't always a scumtell - sometimes I've been fake as town. Knowing how skilled a player is helpful for looking for this.<br>\n<br>\nLink exhibits a very skilled style - some players have even complimented him about it. But that skilled air doesn't seem to jive with legit scumhunting or legit towniness. Its feels fake to me for several reasons (not going to post a walls as I fell walls are anti-town)<br>\n<br>\nnext post!</div></blockquote>I'd say I'm a fairly calculated player, but I don't know that you can accuse me of being fake. Just because I think about what I say before I say it doesn't mean anything. I'm deliberate in my actions because I don't wish to create unnecessary misunderstandings. When misunderstandings do arise, I'm quick to correct them so that it is clear to everyone what the score is. And walls most certainly are not anti-town, sir. They aren't inherently pro-town either, but there is nothing about them indicative of scum activity. It's simply a players chosen style of writing.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>When I asked Tick what he felt about Link, he says two things: That he has a good head on his shoulders and his feelings are null. He is reluctant to give me a read either way; which I take as some evidence of Tick being a little torn on what to do. Tick wasn't the most experienced scum, and often I got the vibe from him that he should just avoid sticky situations without comitting, like how he did in most of his posts. <br>\n<a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3347546#p3347546\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 6#p3347546</a></div></blockquote><br>\nBut he didn't give reads on anybody. What is your fucking point?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>When Link attacked me for my rage-out escapades (which was pretty predatory but ultimately understandable - again, Link is a slippery fellow) Tick butts into the conversation, trying to be useful but ultimately saying nothing of consequence (in my opinion). He defends me and says a real goon would have kept tunneling, consequences be damned. The fact that he felt the need to quote link and DEFEND ME says to me he was possibly breadcrumbing if his buddy died. Its a bit of a stretch but its what I'm feeling on that post.<br>\n<a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3349863#p3349863\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 3#p3349863</a></div></blockquote><br>\nI'm not even sure what you are saying happened here.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>When Zdenek attacks Link, Tick defends him because I was on Zdenek. He probably felt I was most likely to die, so he could set up Zdenek for tomorrow. Normally scum dont defend each other, but again Tick wasn't the most advanced scum around.<br>\n<a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3356076#p3356076\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 6#p3356076</a></div></blockquote><br>\nThere's absolutely no bearing to this argument. It's entirely speculation and conjecture.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>As I said - I dont like the people who joined the wagon late. Link was one of them.</div></blockquote><br>\nConsidering he was my chief sspect at the time, since you were looking town, that's hardly a point against me. Also, I wanted to put my vote somewhere before I was gone for a day. How was I even supposed to know he'd be lynched? What kind of Day 1 ends that quickly? Why would I even leave my vote unattended on my scum partner with a large waagon before going off for a day? That shit doesn't even make sense.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>About my \"quote wall implication post\" - That post generated a good bit of speculation and wifom. The thing I did not like about it was Link's tiny little role, and I was hoping someone else would pick up on it. He is more than willing to speculate on the goings on of scum:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Link wrote:</cite>Quicktopic could have been open prior to PMs, he could have sent scum PMs first, and discussion might have been open during in-thread confirmation since it was the confirmation phase. If what you say is true, I count about 37 minutes that could have contained discussion.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat sort of paranoia, while entirely subtle and slippery (which is Link's MO) is scummy.</div></blockquote><br>\nHow is paranoia scummy? And how is it paranoia? It's a statement of a real possibility that could have occurred. And how is it subtle or slippery? And don't act like you know what my MO is.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>I <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">urge</div> you guys to lynch Link and kill him before the game progresses much further, because he's just going to get harder and harder to kill.</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't really see how that's a problem. If there's no reason to kill me, then it probably means I'm town. Just looking at it statistically, I'm far more likely town than scum. If my actions are such that would seem to point to me being town and the odds are in favor of me being town, then you know what that means? I'm probably town.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>HELLHOUND?

Based on how you were towards DH, I imagine that's just how you operate. So aside from this looking like little more than a drunken tirade, I really can't figure you out. You seem more of a stupid dick than scummy. Your motivations seem town, they're just dumb.I see no reason to take you seriously at this point, but maybe that's your goal? Appear so blatantly stupid that nobody would suspect you as scum (see, I can speculate too) and cruise to victory. What really interests me is that you so willingly accepted a lynch on you when I flip town. I'm not sure if that's dumb town motivation not realizing that two town lynches back to back helps nobody or scum motivation in that you think you can talk your way out of it. Considering how bad you are with words and people, I'm really more inclined to believe the former though. Long story short, you aren't worth the towns time to lynch, but you'll add nothing of value to the game if you stay alive. <br>\n<br>\nNow I'm tired from a long day of video games, so I'm going to sleep.

And here I was hoping you had come to your senses. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll contrive more reasons to call me scum later and I'm sure that once again, they will bear no fruit. Not to make you feel any worse, but to make matters worse, scum have a tendency to keep me alive the stronger the general town read gets on me. I'd call it a combination of fear of a Doctor and hoping that they can inject the town with paranoia. And I won't even be surprised if you call this scum WIFOM trying to establish a legitimate reason for me to not get killed all the way until the end.

Then he comes out of the gate with just a bunch of honest scumhunting and good analysis.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">don_johnson</div>: I didn't really like his start, but he has more or less delivered today. He actually went back and read the thread like he promised and he's showing extreme signs of scumhunting. He's a bit sure that he's caught scum in Timeater and Maruchan, but in my experience, that isn't necessarily scummy. I've seen plenty of town sure that they've caught scum and shouting it to the heavens. Confidence is a key part of charisma and it can be a great tool to get a wagon going. Though I honestly don't agree with his Timeater read and I think his Maruchan case might be reaching a little. But I do agree that Maruchan's coming off as a bit scummy. Worth keeping an eye on Maruchan, but scummy town really just looks like his meta. My read on dj is kinda null right now. Not sure if his suspicions are genuine or an attempt at a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">hahonryuu</div>: He doesn't post very often, but what he does post feels town. He questions things that he thinks are off, but he's not quick top point fingers. This is what I feel is exemplary new town. That's not to say that his play is optimal, just that he's doing what I feel new town should do. The best way to grow is to question the things that you don't agree with and understand what the reasons are and whether or not those reasons make sense. Other than that, he appears to be scumhunting to the best of his abilities.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">hellhound1</div>: His Day 1 was next to useless. His vote on Timeater wasn't really scummy, but as someone previously mentioned, the way it was placed was. I've seen the \"forgot to vote\" excuse before and it's even happened to me, so it's really null. But the way that he placed it just seemed off. Coming into Day 2, he starts off by accusing the fairly townie Zdenek and Twistedspoon. His WIFOM with why he wouldn't have killed Empking or Regfan really isn't a legitimate defense either, because of the WIFOM. From that point on I can't even really follow his train of thought. Does he think I'm scum? Was it a ploy to see if I came out looking scummy? I don't know. All I really know is at this point is that his current scum reads are shit. Me because a claimed vanilla townie might be a power role (though I can't tell if he really suspects me). Timeater because he was scummy yesterday, even though Timeater really didn't even look that scummy by the end of the day and still doesn't. TS because of allegedly trying to set up a mislynch, but not Zdenek, who he thinks is his partner? And why does he have a problem with Zdenek tunneling Timeater if he thinks Timeater may be scum too? I'm honestly not following his train of thought. And where is his vote? He seems to have a hard time placing it if not asked.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: hellhound1</span><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Maruchan</div>: Ongoing games are ongoing, so I can just say meta. Don't like his assertion that there was no time for scum talk at the beginning of the game, but he still reads town to me. Still, don_johnson and nintendoaddict1 make some decent arguments and he will be watched.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">nintendoaddict1</div>: Wow, he's posted a lot more than I thought. Not too sure on him. His vote history looks kinda scummy, particularly the TS vote today, and I really don't buy the Tick hammer excuse, could just be a vie for towncred. On the other hand, his case against Maruchan is decent. I'm more inclined to lean scum on him than Maruchan though. I'd say that if Maruchan flipped town, he's more likely scum, though not necessarily vice versa. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Timeater</div>: What's to say about him that I haven't already said? The guy is unstable and I don't think he's a credit to the town, but I think that he is a townie and it seems like a waste to lynch him. I'm not sure if him deciding he's gonna sheep TS is a good thing or a bad thing at this point. If Ts is town, it's good. If he's not, it's bad.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Twistedspoon</div>: I've been complimented several times by him for my play and it makes me wary. But he doesn't read scum at all. I'm pretty sure he's town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Zdenek</div>: Seems pretty townish, but I'm really not positive on him.

It helps keep people consistent, I believe. With no list, a player is free to vote for anyone they like and it's harder to pin down where there head is at because they can jump around. By laying down where your reads stand, we can see if there is inconsistency in your actions more easily. For example, voting for your listed top town read with no clear catalyst can be very telling.

First, it looks as though he placed that vote on timeater just to satisfy ankmius. his earlier posts often have like 100 posts in between them. lurking? in 521 &lt;iso 5&gt; he doesn't REALLY defend himself. he just goes \"but im town...oh well whatever\" basically. he then goes on to say that if TS went on to push for his lynch then TS and zdenek were good choices for scum team. sounds a bit OMGUSish. though on the other hand if he knows he's scum, trying to pin 2 people when you know that when you die no one would believe you anyway seems...odd. mild town points for that. but very mild. you then say that you can't be scum because empking thought you were town and he's dead now and as scum you would NEVER kill someone who thought you were town...<br>\n<br>\nproblem being that that requires us to take you at your word. oh, and 2 people died last night. what makes you so sure the mafia was the one who killed empking hmm? and killing regfan would have been the last thing you would've done? really? at the risk of sounding scummy, he would be pretty high on the list of people I would kill whether he suspected me or thought I was as town as town could be. what scum would allow a player that good to live? seems not pro. also considering you were using empking as proof first almost seems like you realized \"oh crap, that makes it sound like i know for a fact which one was killed by scum and which was killed by a vig/SK. better talk about regfan too\"<br>\n<br>\nyou didn't put much explanation into your reads. setting up for an easy flip-flop perhaps? in fact you even said they were likely to change. now im all for someone you thought was scummy proving their innocents somehow or a town all of a sudden doing something super scummy and you shouldn't ignore such things...but it just seems so indecisive. i mean im pretty indecisive myself but at least I explain myself as best I can. i'm not saying write novels like I do, but more than what you are giving would be nice<br>\n<br>\nwhen i confront you on some problems I had with your tells, specifically why ankmius was apparently being treated more or less like null leaning scum for being \"wrong\" when i was town while being wrong. you claim it was because ankmius was coming after YOU. sounds a bit OMGUSy. not completely since you arent voting him and don't have him as a total scum read. but it does seem odd. you've done some iffy things in your play, he isnt the only oen to call you out on them. voting you isn't a crime. <br>\n<br>\nalso you sheep one of your scum reads who is going after one of your null reads...wut? and yes, even though he's on your scum list he's obviously a null read since when i confronted you about it before you said you had nothing on him and were just doing it because of timeater and you actually had no read on him.<br>\n<br>\nalso, even if he doesn't get back on int im for your lynch if it happends, TS is quite obviously anti you. its not like we would let him get away with saying \"look guys i wasn't on his wagon\" assuming you do flip town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nmaybe i am just too gullible but I kind of believe you. but at the same time you have been doing/saying some shady things. null leaning scum for now.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">nocase:</div> pretty interesting slot. first it was scum, then frustrated town, then almost obv town, and then the newest incarnation says some iffy things right away. we'll see what happends after some more posts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">don johnson:</div> I don't really like the way you operate but I don't think you are scum as of now. you come in and choose to openly sheep the top choice at the time, in fact you even said you didn't really think he was very scummy &lt;near the bottom of post 350: \"i never felt that strongly he was scum\"&gt;. agreed with some points on timeater and nintendo, but after whats happened since, im actually thinking timeater is just a townie who is unstable IRL. speaking of which <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: timeater</span>. honestly not sure what to make of you. you are definitely scum hunting but im not sure I care for your methods. it almost seems like you are policy lynching timeater. anyway, null leaning town<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">nintendo:</div> gotta say, even if you are right, your early defenses of me seem kinda shady. I now know I was wrong to vote for DH/ankmius/nocase the way i did...so you defending my reasoning just seems like you were trying to make them the badguy for an early mislynch and coming to the defense of, as dj put it, \"poor newbie ryu\". you even made a reference to a past game where DH did what he did and said that they were town. that sounds similar to ticks \"i was wrong, but my logic is sound\" argument before...and look what role he turned out to be. \"even RVS votes have reasons\"...really. random votes have reasons. sir, its random. the reasons are null and void. the \"reasons\" are practically there for comedic purposes a chunk of the time. I mean I was defending myself because, it was myself. but you defending me seems kind of sketchy.

What I'm actually far more concerned about is you. Yesterday, you sort of disregarded the possibility of multi-shot or one-shot Vig yesterday and now you've got a few more things added to the list. You haven't factored in that<br>\n<br>\n1. There could be an SK.<br>\n2. Both Mafia and Vig/SK could have targeted dj last night.<br>\n3. Vig/SK could've targeted DJ and Mafia targeted Zdenek.<br>\n4. Vig could be 2-Shot, like the Tracker and just didn't have a target they were confident in last night. (Couldn't be an SK, because they don't have such a problem)<br>\n5. Vig/SK could have the Odd Night or Non-Consecutive Night modifier, as seen below:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>wiki wrote:</cite>Modifiers which are explicitly Normal include:<br>\nEven/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Bulletproof, Compulsive, Macho, Weak, Backup (with or without primary role present) </div></blockquote><br>\nObviously can't be Even Night, since a kill didn't happen last night and did happen the first night.<br>\n<br>\nIt's entirely possible that one of your three assertions is correct, but by no means a guarantee. Right now I'm sort of torn because I feel like TS could be scum, but at the same time, I don't want to see another PR lynch today. Still, my reasons for suspicion:<br>\n<br>\n1. Call for a Vig claim without presenting all of the facts. If there is a Roleblocker and we still have a useful Vig that claims, he would become useless. The worst part is that he can just brush this off as being forgetful or not thinking about it and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.<br>\n2. Two protective roles seems really powerful, especially when one is semi-permanent. As explained earlier, this could have been exploited very much if it had been discovered and used.<br>\n3. Push for Zdenek (and myself to a lesser extent) as seemingly town above town could be seen as an attempt to buddy/protect scum buddy/implicate townie as scum.<br>\n4. Hammer on nintendoaddict yesterday after the certainty he presented that nintendo was town.<br>\n5. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3368562#p3368562\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> calls Maruchan near-confirmed town for his reponse to the Vig gambit, yet he went after Maruchan a few times after the gambit and even now has his vote on Maruchan.  <br>\n6. Seems kinda certain that dj must have been the Mafia target and that Zdenek wasn't. Granted, he was making a lot of assumptions, but that one doesn't sit right with me.<br>\n<br>\nAdmittedly this is WIFOM and circumstantial evidence at best. This is by no means a certainty, but we've got to consider the possibility carefully as time goes on. We really should've lynched TS yesterday. The fact that he asked for it first is in no means indication of him being town though, since scum could just as easily make the statement to look town. There's really just no good way of telling at this point.<br>\n<br>\nRegardless of whether or not he is town though, there's really no need for the Vig claim at this point. All of us unclaimed guys should keep quiet so that is there is a Vig, he can stay hidden. Even if he was roleblocked last night, I believe I've now created enough uncertainty that the Mafia can't even determine whether or not they actually successfully blocked anything. If there's a Serial Killer, he could just as easily be any of the claimed vanilla townies, so the narrowing down is useless.<br>\n<br>\nRight now I'd say our best bet is to continue on the hellhound wagon from yesterday, but I'll list everyone right now and my stance on them.<br>\n<br>\nZdenek: Seems townish, but he's still done nothing for the town of particular value. Nonetheless, he could be the Vig and so we can't lynch him yet. I don't generally endorse teamhunting, but I feel like if he or TS flipped scum, the other would be more likely to flip scum.<br>\nhellhound1: Still scummy, but he did place his vote on TS yesterday. If he flipped town, I'd have a stronger suspicion of TS.<br>\nTimeater: Not sure if VI or evil genius masquerading as VI.<br>\nhahonryuu: Seems town enough and a potential Vig. Can't and shouldn't lynch.<br>\nTwistedspoon: Seems scummy to me, but I am subject to bouts of paranoia.

I can see victory in my grasp and I'm staying the course.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>here today<br>\n<br>\nzdnek finds an interesting point. why does HL mention the possibility of zdnek being the vig if he is? why bring it up at all?</div></blockquote><br>\nThat's not even a remotely interesting point. What power role says \"well, that guy can't be the PR, cause it's me\"? Smartest move I could make was to vaguely pretend not to be the Vig, which was what I was doing.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>but the simple facts are that if ryu or zdnek doesn't cc then HL is probably the vig....<br>\nHL didn't explain his empking vig though which i thought would be important, claiming results andd reasoning when claiming. Nonetheless Empking's playstyle still made him a good vig target and HL is probably the vig if Ryu doesn't counterclaim..</div></blockquote><br>\nI completely explained it though, so nice work on reading. <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Also, his reasons for killing Empking look like scum trying to justify a kill rather than just taking out the person he is most suspicious of. </div></blockquote><br>\nNope. They really don't. Especially if you look at my suspicion list from Day 1. I had The Tick (lynched), don_johnson (promised more content Day 2, so I decided to wait), Timeater (stopped being a suspect abut 3/4 of the way through Day 1), and Empking (impossible to read). Now of those 4 peple, the only correct choice was Empking. It's a perfectly reasonable decision.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Also, this sort of reactive statement designed to cut off conversation is scum bread and butter<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite><br>\n. . . . because I can almost hear Zdenek calling us scum right now.<br>\n</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\nActually, that sort of statement is exactly how I play. I've got no problem stating what I think is going to happen and I revel in it coming to pass. I'd have been disappointed if you didn't respond, but the fact that you did so in such a weak manner saddens me. Extra points for not counter-claiming though. By not doing so though, you've only strengthened my resolve that TS is scum. If the final Mafioso was better hidden or you weren't the Roleblocker, you could totally have done that and try to get me mislynched.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hikari Link wrote:</cite>Oh no! I'm being tag-teamed by my scum reads. </div></blockquote><br>\nI just said you were probably the vig :/</div></blockquote><br>\nYeah, with as much uncertainty as possible. You also attempted to discredit me by making some poor arguments against me.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Hikari</div> is scum making shit up.</div></blockquote><br>\nOh I can't way to see your scummy ass hang.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hahonryuu wrote:</cite>fact of the matter is, you aren't CC him, and I'm not CC him...so the chances of him being vig/SK is pretty high. if he is, mafia or the real vig/SK will take care of him tonight. if he isn't we can always take care of him later. lets face it, telling the truth or lying, Link is dead. he has little to gain from a claim like this.<br>\n<br>\nso for now I'll go with it<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Zdenek</span></div></blockquote><br>\nThanks for taking the time to read the post where I asked for no support.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>My lynch would be profoundly stupid at this point.</div></blockquote><br>\nNope, cause you are the only one stopping me from ending the game tonight.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>TS is likely scum because LOL 2 docs</div></blockquote><br>\nBut he's not the Roleblocker.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>and Link's claim is not coming from town.</div></blockquote><br>\nPics or it didn't happen. You really did fuck up here. You had a much better shot at surviving and maybe even convincing me and others you were town if you weren't so busy trying to discredit me and instead worked on trying to prove yourself town and/or finding the \"real Roleblocker\". <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>If Link was town, considering that he's not voting TS, he'd be afraid of their being great scum power, and wouldn't have claimed now risking being role-blocked or killed.</div></blockquote><br>\nFalse story. The only reason I claimed is because of my level of certainty that you are the Roleblocker. What possible reason would I have as scum to claim Vig today or right now? Surely not to protect TS. If so, I wouldn't have put him at L-1 and I most certainly would not call him and you my 2 suspects. It's not like I was at L-1 and needed to claim to survive. I claim the moment I think that it's most beneficial to the town. Maruchan can vouch for that.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>He's scum. No doubt.</div></blockquote>And again we come to where you fucked up. Too much emphasis on trying to discredited the uncounter-claimed Vig and not enough emphasis on not doing dumb shit. Props to both you and TS. You played a pretty good Day 1. The Day 2 not so much and you fell apart today. Bu then I'm your opponent, so I really can't blame you for not being able to outdo me.<br>\n<br>\n@Town: If Zdenek and TS don't flip scum and I'm not dead tomorrow, then feel free to lynch me if you honestly believe I'm town. For today, humor me and I guarantee victory. What is the worst that can happen? We can mislynch a townie, but it's not gonna put us in MyLo if we do or anything. You give this a shot and we can end this right now and if not, then Zdenek is probably right and I'm scum that must be lynched tomorrow, right?

He's scum. No doubt.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\nI already explained this, but I'll do so again. I thought for certain that Zdenek was scu8m, based on his own actions. For starters, I didn't like where his votes had been for the previous days. Day 1 he didn't vote Tick and Day 2 he voted nintendoaddict. Then Day 3 he voted you, which seemed like bussing to me. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3389138#p3389138\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> was the last straw. It wasn't that he wanted to lynch me, it was the certainty with which he stated that we'd win if we did it, when if any two of those people weren't scum, we'd actually lose. He left no room for contingency or chance for any other scum, he just stated that doing that meant we would win. From there, as I stated before, he attempted to discredit me rather than convince me he was town. His Vig ploy earlier also seemed like he was setting up to claim Vig at some point to me, which I knew was impossible.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Also, his reasons for killing Empking look like scum trying to justify a kill rather than just taking out the person he is most suspicious of. <br>\nAlready explained this, but it was a perfectly legitimate reason. Of my four suspects from Day 1, he was the only one still living that I'd probably never get enough info on to confirm as scum or town, so I went with a Vig.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Also, this sort of reactive statement designed to cut off conversation is scum bread and butter<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Hikari wrote:</cite><br>\n. . . . because I can almost hear Zdenek calling us scum right now.<br>\n</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\nThat's just my style. I don't have a problem stating exactly what I think will happen. You'll notice I didn't say something like \"see, I told you\", I only responded normally like I do to everything.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite>Here's why I don't believe it by the way.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Link wrote:</cite><br>\nZdenek: Seems townish, but he's still done nothing for the town of particular value. Nonetheless, he could be the Vig and so we can't lynch him yet.<br>\n</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\nI'm fairly certain I already said that this is not an argument. I've literally already responded to all of these already, so why are you asking them again? The answers aren't changing because he flipped town because I didn't know he was at the time and the what I said then was based on what I thought at the time. When I still thought he could be town, there was no reason not to say that he could be the Vig if it meant that I might not be targeted by scum. It's why the statement was so vaguely worded. I called him townish rather than town because I was mildly suspicious, but I wasn't anywhere near sure.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite><br>\nzdenek, lets not split up our bandwaggons now. -.-<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHmmmm, I'll stick with Link for the time being.</div></blockquote>[/quote]<br>\nWhat's to say to that? He was as wrong as I was. Both of us suspected one another above all others and we were both wrong.<br>\n<br>\nRight now this is an extremely bad situation. There can't be more than 3 scum total, since 4 would mean we already lost. So far, the PRs we've seen flip are the White Mage and the 2-Sot Tracker, I believe. In addition, I'm the Odd Night Vig. As stated before, this leads me to believe that the TS claim is untrue. At this point, I have to be the Vig. There is nobody who can counter-claim me and an SK wouldn't have been roleblocked last night and could've easily targeted TS. I've got no problem with a TS lynch today, but the problem is tomorrow. We can't mislynch anymore, which is admittedly my fault, but it also means that we need to be very thorough in our selection. hellhound seems like the most likely option and I think it definitely had to be someone on the Zdenek wagon yesterday, which again points to him.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Twitedspoon</span><br>\n<br>\nFrom this point on, I probably won't be Night Killed, sinc I can't afford to misVig tomorrow night, I'd probably be roleblocked anyway, and I'm a perfect mislynch target. It's possible that could change if the town believes my claim though, but not a sure thing. I'm just saying this so that everyone understands that there is every reason for the Mafia not to kill me at night from this point on. I can understand if you want to lynch me because I got Zdenek killed, but I really did believe he was scum and I was fairly certain we had the game won. The fact of the matter is though, I must be the Vig because nobody else can be the Vig. And there must be a Vig or there would be no way of explaining the Night 1 kill of Empking and then no other kills. Well, other than a one-shot SK. But why would I claim as scum then? Thee was no reason for it. As I explained yesterday, my claim only made sense as town. As scum, the real Vig would counter-claim and I'd die along with TS or the SK would kill me at night. As SK, I'd draw unnecessary attention to myself and would be the guaranteed lynch after all scum are killed. These are the only 3 options, because we know for a fact that the Empking death came from somewhere. So in closing, I'm town and we need to lynch TS, but I really can't be sure what to do from there. I suppose hellhound is probably the way to go. Their conflict could have been mutual bussing, I suppose.", "time": "Thu Sep 01, 2011 6:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18764&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "18764"}

I'll do the math for you though, so that you can't just counter my argument with \"yes you can\".<br>\n<br>\n6 players left means: 4 town, 1 scum, and 1 SK or 4 Town and 2 scum or 3 town, 2 scum, and 1 SK, right? So with the first set up we have these options if you were town that were mislynched today:<br>\n<br>\n1. Scum kills town and I kill town. That leaves 1, 1, and 1, an automatic town loss, but then both myself and scum would lose or we'd be in a deadlock or town would win. Since killing one of us would cause the other to win, the townie would be best served to kill nobody. Lynching the townie means we'd kill one another at night and there would be no survivors. Killing each other means the town wins. There's no good way out of the cycle for scum or SK.<br>\n<br>\n2. Scum kills me tonight and I kill scum. Town win.<br>\n<br>\n3. Scum kills town and I kill scum. I'm lynched the next day and town wins.<br>\n<br>\n4. I kill town and scum kills me. I lose and town in LyLo.<br>\n<br>\n5. Scum and I target the same town or a Roleblocker exists and can target kill and roleblock. 2 townies, 1 scum, 1 SK left. from there:<br>\n<br>\na. Mislynch town. Leads to Scenario 1.<br>\n<br>\nb. Lynch scum. I win.<br>\n<br>\nc. Lynch me. I lose and so does town.<br>\n<br>\n6. Scum can kill and Roleblock and does so on me. I lose. 3 Town, 1 Scum.<br>\n<br>\nIn set up 2:<br>\n<br>\n1. Mislynch town today. We lose.<br>\n<br>\n2. Lynch scum today. Leads to MyLo again.<br>\n<br>\nIn set up 3:<br>\n<br>\n1. Lynch me. I lose. Scum kill town. Scum wins.<br>\n<br>\n2. Lynch Rolelocker. Leads to:<br>\n<br>\na. Scum and I kill different townies. Leads to situation 1.1.<br>\n<br>\nb. Scum and I target the same guy. Leads to 2 town, 1 scum, 1 SK. Leads to.<br>\n<br>\nI. Lynch me. Scum win.<br>\n<br>\nII. Lynch scum. I win.<br>\n<br>\nIII. Lynch town. Leads to stuation 1.1.<br>\n<br>\n3. Lynch non-Roleblocker scum. Leads to:<br>\n<br>\na. Scum kill me. I lose. Town in MyLo.<br>\n<br>\nb. Scum block me and kill town. This leads to:<br>\n<br>\nI. Lynch town. Becomes situation 1.1.<br>\n<br>\nII. Lynch scum. I win.<br>\n<br>\nIII. Lynch me.

Here's my reasoning:<br>\n<br>\nTimeater: Believes the TS claim. He probably won't be killed tonight.<br>\nMaruchan: A scum suspect of some. Good mislynch. If he died, it would be one less person to mislynch.<br>\nMe: Flipping Vig would essentially invalidate the TS calim, so it's not going to happen.<br>\nTS: Can't because he's the \"Doctor\". Also, he's scum, so it won't happen.<br>\n<br>\nhellhound is the only one I can see being killed without TS losing much. Of course, TS is likely to say that he protected Timeater, but I think if we can agree that hellhound should be the target, he'll have no choice. Of course, if nocase isn't the Roleblocker, he'll probably just claim to have been blocked.<br>\n<br>\nWhat does everyone who isn't nocase or TS think of this?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maruchan wrote:</cite>lynch me tomorrow.

But because you are a townie that will never vote for him, he as scum is invincible and cannot be lynched.", "time": "Fri Sep 02, 2011 6:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18764&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "18764"}

You aren't confirmed town technically, but you aren't scum either and even if you were, it wouldn't matter. If we lynch nocase and he's not scum, we lose. But he's probably scum, so we're fine there. And there's almost no chance you are scum and TS isn't. TS is scum. I can tell almost for certain based on our exchange today. I've dealt with scum before who have acted exactly like that in my native forum. So quick to discredit every word I said, to come up with wild and improbable scenarios, to nitpick every single  thing I say and twist it against me, to push and push to the edge of my patience, to speak as though he is the epitome of town and I am worse than Hitler. I've seen it before, just as fierce and it was from scum. Every time it was from scum.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Timeater wrote:</cite>And haven't you learned anything about me?

What I say and what I really think at any given time may be radically different.</div></blockquote><br>\nI realize these things, but you can also be quite stubborn on things and if I die, I'm not sure who else can talk you into the TS lynch. The fact is, the town absolutely needs you and everyone else united on a nocase and TS lynch t win and you are the wild card. Everyone else, I can see lynching TS, but if I'm not there to talk it through with you, I can't be anywhere near as sure. I mean, just look at how Maru acts with you. He'd never get you to vote TS. And hellhound isn't around nearly enough and I know far too little about him to trust him with the job. And so I need to try to make sure that even if I die tonight, you'll still lynch TS tomorrow.", "time": "Fri Sep 02, 2011 7:10 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18764&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "18764"}
