You do not need to unvote before you vote again, although it makes my job slightly easier.<br><br>3 - Once a player reaches a majority of all votes in play that person is lynched and twilight begins immediately. No votes or unvotes will be counted during twilight.<br><br>4 - The dead don't talk. Not even a \"bah\" post.<br><br>5 - There is no talking about this game outside of this thread while the game is ongoing. Period. Zero tollerance on this rule.<br><br>6 - Do not edit, delete, alter, or in any way change your posts. Breaking this rule leaves me free to practice my literary works of art on your so called posts.<br><br>7 - Players are expected to request prods on others that have failed to post for at least 48 hours. Any player to accumulate 3 prods without any sign of changing his or her ways will be replaced. If the entire thread drags on too long a deadline will be imposed accordingly.<br><br>8 - if you are going to be V/la for any reason please post in thread and send a PM to the mod as well. This ensures the mod is aware of your lack of activity. If the mod is unaware of the V/La for any reason it is considered the players fault and barring situational evidence any prods given in that time will remain.<br><br>9 - Night will last a maximum of 72 hours. All players are expected to complete their night actions in a timely fashion. Any player who expects to be V/la during a night phase should presend any and all actions to help speed up the game.<br><br>10 - Do not quote any PM's from the Mod unless otherwise specified by me. Paraphrasing is acceptable as long as it does not include any specifics people can draw conclusions from. If you are unsure if something is acceptable or not clear it with the mod before posting it.<br><br>11 - Unless otherwise specified, deadlines will result in a no lynch.<br><br>12 - This is my first game modding on this site. I may not be perfect but I strive to be. If you notice any errors or ommisions on my part, please notify me immediately via PM so my oversight can be rectified.<br><br>Town PM Example<br><br>    You are a Townie!<br><br>    You are a vanilla member of the town and win when all members of the mafia are eliminated."}

His main points is that the attention on himself is a little unwarranted, and he ends by asking people some questions about their votes/meta. Personally I think he keeps it a little too neutral in order to avoid having to give any actual thoughts on the players, fearing that multiple scumhunts will interfere with each other. I am ready to swing either way on him, and while I would like the quieter people to pipe up, I think its important to focus on one thing at a time. Ktyhklle notices that Tunnelsnakes is ready to continue scumhunting while under a wagon, but I think doing so at this point invites mafia to buddy with him, since he's waved town.

By law of effect, there's no need to hide anything unless you are making confscum accusations(which would offend scum), which is even more inconsistent with your vote hopping.

And why were you so concerned with serrapaladin's RVS vote on you?</div></blockquote><br><br>The general approach of trying to logically deduce partnerships based on actions was a stellar strategy in my last win, albeit simplified by Mafia dying at a rapid clip, so I'm aiming to do it again. I think it just has to do with how I deal with people in real life, my mind works in a much more scientific and analytical way than it does reading emotional nuances, which get completely garbled when you're playing by text. I feel much more comfortable dealing in data and statistics, who voted whom and when, how frequently is someone posting, how transparent are they with their reads. Things like that. Behavioral tells are my springboard point and serve as a way for everyone else to know where I'm at, and then from there I'm going to try and solve the puzzle with the analysis.<br><br>As for the inquiry about paladin, I asked the first time almost in jest with the whole \"lol that's so ironic, why would you vote the least headache-inducing player?\", and then inquired again once he maintained it and sided with Aunt Jemina's case. The way it makes sense to me, it was two separate incidents linked only by the fact it involved paladin wanting to have his vote on me.<br><br>---<br><br>I don't want to dismiss Kid A today, I think there's more to be learned if we let him stick around for another Day. The only opaque thing he's doing is vote hopping like the dickens, which means that information gained from analyzing those votes loses a lot of fidelity. He is offering up some reads though, and I think if he sticks around, he'll either be more informative a lynch if scum or his reads will clarify and his Town status will be more and more transparent."}

Not giving reads is totally scum motivated, and essentially saying \"wait til later\" is bullshit, reads are always evolving, and a large part of scumhunting is looking at how these reads change over time. If a player doesn't leave their reads behind, there is nothing to analyze, which is why giving reads is always a town move, even if you buy into the \"teh scumz will kill the town's townreads\" mentality. Then this on page 7 is just the icing on the cake:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5017874#p5017874\" class=\"postlink\">post 171</a>, Kid A wrote:</cite>a full view is when that other guy actually posts something</div></blockquote><br> Everyone else has chimed in and given plenty of content to analyze, but he is holding out for one person who hadn't even confirmed yet?

I would prefer to vote my top scumread and hope he flips scum and go from there. <br><br>In addition to Kid A, I don't like kthxbye either, and Human Destroyer is a slight scumread. TUNNELSNAKES is annoying but appears town. I also have townreads on yabbaguy, penguin_alien and serrapaladin. Everyone else falls into the murky shades of grey category."}

You might see that she let the Kid A bandwagon down, temporarily, since being over-ready to herd someone to lynch would have definitely hurt town. Aunt Jemima's playing like she's concerned about what we see her do, rather than what she actually does. Aunt Jemima's tracker claim is a weak fabrication, we all know that \"somebody\" visited serrapaladin, due to his death. Her claim as to knowing serra would be targeted is too close to WIFOM, and she only includes since she's trying to baby her image. My worry is that people will dimiss HD's \"forced\" claim, since he clearly  has a feel for the pulse of the game and wants to get things done. That said Jemima's atack on me came out before HD had properly sold his case on her to the town, so I think she is the scummier of the two of them.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aunt Jemima</span>"}

Aside from us obviously having someone lying about being a VT, that sounds about right for a normal set-up as long as the last scum isn't a PR.  But with 12 people to start instead of 13, I doubt the scum also gets two PRs, and if we had another PR they should have claimed, so why do you think there's too many VTs?  Normally I'd say that we might have a doctor since there was a scum RB, but as any doctor should have been on HD last night, I doubt it.<br><br>I'm not sure whether it makes sense for scum to advocate lynching N64Lord over Aunt Jemina post-HD cop claim.  It does give them a chance to set up HD, but that only works if they can RB him and prevent him getting another night's results; otherwise they have to kill him, and lynching N64 took out their RB.  Baby Spice and Mr_Ree and Kthxbye are in this category.  pappums rat was gung-ho on the Aunt Jemina lynch.  TUNNELSNAKES went back and forth.  I started out pro-N64 lynch then went toward Aunt Jemina but never got a vote down.<br><br>pappums rat, why did you think N64 saying whether he targeted serrapaladin would clear anything up?"}

Claiming whether or not he had in fact targeted serrapaladin as a town PR could have cleared up some of the questions people had at the time regarding Jemina's claim.<br><br>So Kthxbye and TUNNELSNAKES suspect me but aren't really giving reasons why I make sense as scum. If I had been scum I could have easily jumped on board the HD wagon which was being pushed by a few people and could have gotten our cop lynched instead of my own scumbuddy, thereby saving a NK for another target and eliminating the possibility of him targeting myself or N64Lord. I was also the first to suggest that Jemina was pulling a scum gambit to bus her buddy for near-confirmed status, which, once again would be going directly against the scumteam's interests. Calling me scum would mean that I would have been powerbussing both my partners right from the start of Day 2, leaving me to fend for myself up to LYLO. That's fucking dumb."}

I could probably go with TS/Prat if it came to deadline.  I'm still debating on whether or not to sacrifice myself for the greater good.  I still feel I can be useful but I can't feel good about walking into Lylo being a suspect.  I think I might be OK with a me lynch in this scenario.  I would much prefer pappums Rat or TS, don't get me wrong.<br><br>Best guess is scum will attempt to get Baby/Kthx/Prat into lylo.  Be wary of other combinations.<br><br>I was thinking about this today while driving, TS made a post right after Yabba died.  It said something like way to go scum, thanks for killing off a VT that was already suspected.  Kinda pinged me when I looked back on it.  I'll quote it when I get <br>online and post this.  It read as a self congratulatory post.  Combined with the massclaim (I really saw no reason for this other than to out a PR.*) I see the makings of a half decent case.  Plus I'm inclined to believe Penguin.  I still say the dude who seemed to get everything right, our resident Cop, deserves to have a post-mortem say in this.  He called P-Rat multiple times.  He also mentioned Kthx if it wasn't P-rat.  I'll admit that those are the reads I've been working with.  I still don't see what he saw in Jemina day 1.  I'll have to remember to ask in endgame, or the dead qt.  I was impressed, I really was reading her as town going into day 2. I wish he had made a case but, such is the nature of HD.  Just thought of something.  Somebody mentioned Jemina and TS as entertaining due to taking on a personality.'  Who was that?  Was it N64?  I'll have to check.<br><br>@Baby Spice:  you know someone else Jemina never went after?  Pretty much everyone still alive.  From her wording, I gather I was considered for a nightkill on night 1.  Something like 'i considered watching Serra or Ree because they seemed the most town'  Fit that into your reads if you have to.  I am a pretty good player though, you can Meta me if you like.  I still think I can be useful to you guys.  I have to wonder at why you thought scum would act as I have.  We both offered ourselves up as lynchable if needed.  We were both taking pretty much the exact same stance during the 3-way.  I even complemented your ability to sum up my stance into a more concise post.  Scum wouldn't argue for more dialogue.  Plain and simple.  They would want to avoid it, because that's how they get caught.  <br><br>I admit I still find myself suspicious of Kthx.  In retrospect, it did seem like he was rushing the lynches.  I also noticed he started leading during day 3.  There's nothing wrong with that per se but the fact he was basically leading people towards voting me put my back up.  That's why I made the vote me post.  My best method of scumhunting involves analyzing the cases of those voting me.   I feel Rat's case is the weakest.  He basically put my read on kthx and made him responsible for his read on me.  I can see him going after kthx after I flip.  Kthx and Spice seem to be trying to figure things out.  Penguin has some good theories.  I don't really want any of those three lynched.  That leaves me with TS and Rat.  I'd still like to hear more from both before day's end.<br><br>* objectively, I can see two sides to this."}

Information is more important than an early lynch, so I want to see which players will try to turn a hunch into a lynch. TUNNELSNAKES has the most town points from me, since he's trying to get things into gear, and even attracting attention to himself, allowing him to become the possible target of a bandwagon, and then flipping town by showing an interest in scumhunting while under a wagon. Being early, most of us haven't posted enough for me to mark them either way. Human Destroyer buddied before TUNNELSNAKES showed that he was not just safe randing, so I feel he's more like a sheep than anything, since he tried to move the game forward by sticking, even before anybody became ready to meta.  I applaud Bacde, and Jemima's decisions to entertain us by taking on a character.

I am the only one pushing for an N64 lynch over AJ at this point.  If I'm scum, I'm pushing for my RB to be lynched over the easy vote on just a goon.  That doesn't make sense.  Then again, if I were scum, I guess I could be going to set up an HD lynch the next day, but that also doesn't make sense as that would let HD get info that night vs lynching AJ and letting N64 block HD.

Claiming whether or not he had in fact targeted serrapaladin as a town PR could have cleared up some of the questions people had at the time regarding Jemina's claim.<br><br>So Kthxbye and TUNNELSNAKES suspect me but aren't really giving reasons why I make sense as scum. If I had been scum I could have easily jumped on board the HD wagon which was being pushed by a few people and could have gotten our cop lynched instead of my own scumbuddy, thereby saving a NK for another target and eliminating the possibility of him targeting myself or N64Lord. I was also the first to suggest that Jemina was pulling a scum gambit to bus her buddy for near-confirmed status, which, once again would be going directly against the scumteam's interests. Calling me scum would mean that I would have been powerbussing both my partners right from the start of Day 2, leaving me to fend for myself up to LYLO. That's fucking dumb.</div></blockquote>"}

I think it's a given that all of us who are still in the game are experienced enough to have planned out/suggested a target for N64Lord to claim to have jailkept that wasn't the forbidden self-targeting.  It just doesn't track to me that any surviving player so thoroughly misadvised him.  As such, I keep coming back to a 2 scum + traitor mechanic.<br><br>Say there is a traitor who by definition can't plot with the scum team.  Maybe if he's targeted for a NK he joins the scum team but until then is unknown to them.  That would be a reason to kill yabbaguy Night Two even though he was scummy--maybe N64Lord thought he would get a buddy.  That mechanic would mean that the traitor would know who the other scum were, but I'm not sure how that would affect his reaction to the AJ fake claim.  Would that situation look like AJ was bussing a goon buddy or getting town cred for bussing a PR buddy?<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Thor665</span><br><br>I want to kick around how a potential traitor would have interacted with the AJ-N64Lord bussing shenanigans."}

I'm the least experienced player left by minimum 2 years, and I'm not uninformed enough to try to claim to have self-targeted as a protective role, let alone JK.  (plus I'm now conf-town, so you know I'm sincere in that assessment)  And again, not overly experienced, but heaven knows that when I've been in scum QTs and kicked around fakeclaiming, choice of targets has always come up.

Which makes a traitor very likely to me.<br><br>It also explains the yabbaguy kill.  Yes, N64Lord was still able to block HD, which was why he left him alive for another night, plus the ambiguity of whether HD was bussing AJ.  But that gave him freedom to kill just about anyone.

I pretty much agree with everyone who wanted to know why people were town reading me.  (yabbaguy, I completely agree with everything you said, although I have played as town with Mr_Ree and Thor [first Newbie game] and as scum and town with Baby Spice) It made me really paranoid about everyone, because I know I wasn't playing a super-townie game.  And I'm glad Baby Spice hammered, because if she'd confirmed as town I'd have gone back to Thor.  It felt like TUNNELSNAKES was trying to set me up with their theory about who wouldn't have helped N64Lord pick a more reasonable JK target.  Which, I'm newer, but not that new.  I have played a couple Normal games here with Traitors, so it didn't seem all that unlikely to me, especially starting with 12 players instead of 13.<br><br>It's pretty funny that scum kept NKing people who would have supported non-scum lynches.

It revealed what Desty's power role was, and placed my scumbuddy in a position where their claim was favorable. Had they done the strategically-correct play of killing Desty and blocking someone else, and had Lordy not botched the claimed target on D3, then we would have been in a position to win. A 2 for 1 exchange is excellent for the town, but a 1 for 1 exchange would not have been as good.<br><br>Lordy's claim of being a jailkeeper was excellent. Lordy's claim of target come D3 was where he went wrong. Similarly, ratty's claim fit well, but the claim of having flavor was a mess-up.<br><br>My claim went exactly as I had planned it to, given the circumstances. I had no way of anticipating that my scumbuddies would mess things up as they did after that."}
