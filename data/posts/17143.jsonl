Three wonderful years is how long your beautiful city lived in paradise when the new king defeated the evil king in battle to win the throne. No more of those pesky evil guards that called themselves the \"Royal Mafia.\" They were finally gone for good. Unfortunately for all real life stories, this fairy tale had to come to an end.<br><br>One day the King was hanging out in his backyard, or well... the Garden of Good Wealth. He was sipping some wonderful Kool-Aid while enjoying \"Backstreet Boys\" on his CD player, the songs ringing through his ears and he couldn't resist the urge to dance. As he was dancing, a shadow made its way into his Garden, and carefully lifted out of it's pocket a small vial of some type of potion. As the King was totally oblivious to the shadow lurking behind him, it poured the vial into the King's drink that the King sat down on the table when he went to dance. When the King got back, he didn't even notice the difference as he gulped the drink down, thankful to finally have rest after such a long but nice dance.<br><br>Unfortuantely for him, it was his last rest. The king died almost immediately as the vial of poison sunk into his blood stream. Suddenly, the whole kingdom was thrown into chaos. After some investigation however, it became knowledge that the person(s) responsible for this had to have been close to the King, and had to have been Knight that sat at the Royal Roundtable.<br><br>Hello Knight. Good news is, you're still alive. Bad news is, if you don't catch the theives that did this, the kindgom will be handed over to them, and your family will live under the turmoil of the Royal Mafia once again. The worst news, is that the only viable suspects must be one of your own. There are 13 of you, and there's no telling which one, or how many joined together to try and take over this kingdom. It's up to you and your brothers to stop the evil ones... but the question is, who can you trust?</span></span></span><br><br><br><br>Mini 1147: Royal Mafia at the Roundtable!<br><br><br><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: End Gamed 2/13</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">1.

Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. <br>4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. If you cross 'the line' I'll step in. Said line will be judged by me.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death </span><br>5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Neil</span>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. The vote tags are also appropriate for voting.<br>5a) Broken bold tags won't count. Mispellings or shortened names are ok as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you're voting, it won't count. <br>6) Unvotes <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">are</span> necessary before placing a new vote. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting. <br>7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes - a majority. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. You may continue to post in the thread until I declare the lynch.<br>8) You may vote for a no lynch if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch. <br>9) Once you're dead, you are dead. Do not post in the thread until the game is over, not even a 'bah' post. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines </span><br>10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>11) Prods will be issued after 72 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod you I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too. I'm human and I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me. <br>11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement. <br>12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 2 weeks, except day 1 which will have a 3 week deadline. </span><br>14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch. No pluralities for lynching. <br>15) Nights will have a 48 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. The night scene may not exactly be up after 48 hours, but give or take an hour or 10 and it will be. <br>16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that, laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Other Information </span><br>17) <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">This is my color and font I will use for modly purposes. All other colors are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself, just don't post a rainbow.</span></span></span><br>18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. If you feel a vote count is needed, don't hesitate to ask for one, and I'll provide one at the next opportunity. <br>19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will end your existence. Yes that means modkill. Real, Epic modkill...<br>20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know. <br>21) <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Flavour in night/day write up's is just that; flavour.</span></span></span> <br>22) No cryptography.<br>23) Have fun!</div></div></div>"}

Look at the way it's worded.<br><br>The post itself is a contradiction.</div></blockquote><br><br>Well I don't think its distancing, because no one is ever going to buy an argument later in the game that 2 players aren't scum because they \"random\" voted each other. It could be scum partners just messing around in plain site, but I see no reason to suspect that given that town players also mess around with each other for various reasons in the RVS. So at best its null for now, but I'll be watching to see how they continue to interact with each other.<br><br>preview edit: thanks juls <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> &lt;3"}

As town, I think you are more likely to do less analysis of what YOU are saying and MORE analysis of what someone else is saying.  At the time I switched my vote, it was on Rhinox as a RV.  I felt at that point its better to take my vote off someone who has a good point and put it on someone who did something that looked suspicious.  Does it make Oso 100% scum? No, but its the best place to put my vote at this time.  And I still feel it is.  Look, I have played with Rhinox at least 2 times officially and even more in Marathon games.  He has been scum and town.  He is probably the one I have the best \"feel\" for.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Farside: Why single out TS?

But it has a subtle difference: while Erratus Apathos correctly pointed out that Prosaurus was more using his \"newb card\" to defend why he was not getting reads on players, ender241 instead claimed the \"newb card\" was being played in order to \"get out of situations where he is going to be voted.\"  I definitely do not get that impression from Prosaurus' post, and I think it is an overblown attack on the \"newb card.\"<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.)</span> I did not vote ender241 solely because I \u201cdisagree with him\u201d (as insinuated by Juls), but because I felt his attack stepped over the line of plausibility.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.)</span> As should be evident, I do not approve of people asking others to explain votes when they have purposefully withheld an explanation for their vote.<br><br>And that should answer everybody\u2019s questions.

I may have gone a bit overboard in trying to role-play Javert here, and I apologize if you have taken offense.  But it should be evident in retrospect that the main purpose of claiming now (instead of when I take my shot) is to proactively prevent lurking.  Any player who tries to get away with lurking is eligible to be Vigged on principle.  This should satisfy your \"defensible pro-town reason\" concern.<br><br>~<br><br>Now walking out the door."}

And then \"What \"definition\" forces my vote to be a joke or RVS vote?\" Seems to deny that he was serious, yet later he says it was attempting to move the game forward. Next he seems pretty eager to vote klazam, for something that a lot of people say(mostly random). It could be scum hopping off their buddy at first opportunity.<br>Farside: Why single out TS?

What is your read on that person and why?<br><br>I'm not liking the heat that Javert was receiving for not answering quesitons. That's a playstyle issue, not an alignment issue. Unforunatley, townies will jump all over people for this sort of thing all the time and it's easy for scum to hide among them. So, let's see; farside22 wasn't really voting Javert for not answering questions, so I'm not counting her. Twistedspoon has been active lurking for the most part and he voted Javert, so he might be scum. Prosaurus is very similar: he voted for Javert and he has been active lurking. ender241 voted Javert for not answering questions and Oso makes a compelling case for ender, but I don't think Oso is town and I'm not going to sheep his read whithout a strong town read on him. ender posted this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ender241 wrote:</cite>You have misinterpreted what i'm saying, i'm saying he's either doing one of three things.<br><br>1. He is scum and basically trying to make himself stay alive for ages.<br><br>2. He's just a normally townie who's got himself into a sticky situation.<br><br>3.

He's trying to scramble away from what he said before:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ender241 wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span> <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Javert</span> Start answering questions, i doubt your a DayVig.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>ender241 wrote:</cite>Basically your using \"Day-vig\" as your excuse to say what you want.</div></blockquote><br>Also, ender thinks there are three possibilities regarding Javert and only one of them invovles him being scum, why vote?

Ender's emotion is clearly not fake.<br><br>As for scum being more worried about a dayvig claim, that's exactly my point! Why would scum see a player claim dayvig, and decide that it would be a fantastic idea to get into a gigantic fight with that player? Ender is clearly not worried about that! Hence, towntell."}

And all the other speculating in every one of those posts is in itself a form of indirect role fishing, even 14 where he accuses someone else of role fishing then says \"what did you expect etc...\" it says A) he's already been thinking about what enders softclaim meant and pointed it out in thread and B) answering the \"What did you expect\" question just leads to more role speculation all around.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>Oso's slip on M=W is interesting, but given the soft claim I think I accept M=W explaination.

What gets me there is also what I think pinged Javert about farside.<br><br>@Rhinox, you have been around long enough to know better than that. You thinking works only if he is town (or 3rd party) and working by himself. He would be either true-claiming, and have no need to think that far ahead, or 3rd party in which he just picked a moderately rare claim (in my experience at least) that just happened to match another we have in the game.

Only if ender is 3rd party is any part (the part that has him not town and having to think solely on his own) of that reason valid.<br><br>You, Rhinox, are including in your thinking, a reason to help clear ender in your mind that really holds no validity....why?"}

Our two best, high probability lynches based solely on play, are claimed. Ender and TS.<br><br>A close second(third?) to those two would be Me=Wierd except I disagree with some of what has been directed at him. His asking about Javert's shot ability is absolutely not what he has been accused of:Role Fishing. Javert had already claimed so it is \"nails on chalkboard\" type of irritating when I see that in a post by someone (generic someone here) who I have a town read on. But since I can see some of the reasons why scum would be interested in that info, I haven't given him a full pass.<br><br>The current subject of interest (Klazam) is starting to look like a default lynch. But that is because of a lack of participation (from where I sit) followed by promises to get involved and halfhearted attempts (it looks like) to get involved rather than anything scummy he has done. He has made one of the better posts of the game from what I can see.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Klazam wrote:</cite>..<br>From my POV, it would benefit scum quite a bit if they knew whether Javert was a one shot dayvig or not. I didnt see a valid town reason to ask that question. Now, M=W's explanation involving a doctor seems quite contrived. If there was a doctor, He would know as much as the scum did.<br><br>If Javert wasnt a one shot dayvig, scum would want to kill him. There is no way for the scum to know right now. Therefore they would kill him, just to be safe. A rational doctor would see this and protect him (sadly, by me mentioning it, it wont happen, i'm sure.). In this, i do not see a town benefit to knowing that information. If Javert outs that he is a one shot vig, boom, the possible PR pool just was reduced by one.</div></blockquote><br>And that post is the primary reason why Me=Weird is still high on my suspect list. And I agree with many of the reads he gave in post before last.

I've quoted it before but I'll do the relevant part again.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Klazam wrote:</cite>..<br>From my POV, it would benefit scum quite a bit if they knew whether Javert was a one shot dayvig or not. I didnt see a valid town reason to ask that question. Now, M=W's explanation involving a doctor seems quite contrived. If there was a doctor, He would know as much as the scum did. <br>..</div></blockquote><br><br>To clarify. Yes, I did get what I would consider to be a \"town\" reaction to my strong vote post of M=W. He didn't try to counter attack me nor did he try to deflect. He calmly answered the reasoning set forth.<br><br>I said as much here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2946316#p2946316\" class=\"postlink\">Post-274</a> wrote:</cite>..<br>As I indicated(sort of) in my last post, I was more interested really in how he defended (his tone) rather than what he said in his defense, if that makes any sense.<br><br>He didn't react to my post or my vote of him in the way I would have expected to scum to act. The contradiction is there but he simply explained why it wasn't really a contradiction without getting overly-defensive.<br><br>The only real problem I have with it is that he specifically used \"1-Shot Cop\". That piece of information wasn't available to him when he asked Javert the question. <strike>But I can stretch that, without too much trouble, to being a player thinking a soft-claim is a cop claim and having that thinking confirmed. \"1-Shot Cop\" replaces \"Cop\" in his thinking.</strike></div></blockquote><br>The strike through part is the part I'm no longer using. I'm no longer willing to let my giving him the benefit of the doubt stretch quite that far.<br><br>As to what I would call the \"town\" reaction I got from him, that is what my gut is screaming at me. Head says that it is much more indicative of player's ability to react well under pressure than anything alignment based."}

He makes four bullet points for Dayvig + No Lynch, but the second one is the ONLY one that even tries to offer any advantage over the default Dayvig + Lynch. And even that one is rubbish when you consider the likelyhood of outing a FOURTH power role in a mini normal D1 is so slim that you could stick it on the cover of Cosmo and the anorexia rates in the US would skyrocket. Oso is smart, so I don't think he would post this if he was thinking about the situation rationally.<br><br>After thinking about it I actually find Oso scummier than either Klazam or TS, although I'm still willing to lynch either of those two if necessary.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Klazam</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Oso</span>"}

That is why it seems to be wishy-washy but isn't. This is the same type of reasoning (in addition to other things) many gave in their reason to believe Javert without too much trouble. In Javert's case, his ability to day-kill was provable where we could see it. In the case of TS and Ender, it isn't as cut and dried.<br><br>Make no mistake, had Javert reneged or waffled on his promise to kill today, many would have been voting his lynch.<br><br>The same for TS and Ender. I can take their claim at face value for the time being, but still be suspicious of them and voice misgivings about them when asked questions like \"Top 3 scum reads please.\" Ender is proven to have been telling the truth. Unfortunately, he is dead now. My type of thinking in regards to claims, especially D1, is give the player a chance to prove them unless there is some overriding reason not to.<br><br>Both Ender's and TS's play, didn't warrant much trust. That is why they had to claim. I'm fairly certain that had either one claimed VT, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now as the one who claimed VT first, would have been lynched based on their play. That is why they didn't become 'obvtown' in my mind, or even cross from probable scum into neutral/null. They went into \"wait and see.\" Don't vote, don't attack but certainly don't lie or try and gloss over what you are thinking of them when asked.<br><br>Hopefully, that will clear up my thinking on this. Without the PR claim, Ender would have been lynched. Same with TS if he had not claimed PR. The only thing that kept me from pushing Ender was his claim. The only thing that prevented me from actually voting TS was caution to not let scum end the day unexpectedly and his claim.<br><br>Being willing to vote/push/lynch in spite of the claims would not have been in the best interest of town at best, as we can see from ender's flip it can bite town in the ass. Outright scummy at worst.<br><br>[p-edit]<br>farside, hopefully the above will answer your question. If not, ask again and I would point to the partial disclaimer I put  in that quote in regards to TS: Twistedspoon- I believe his claim{<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I'll add my own disclaimer here:FOR NOW</span>} The part of that in brackets wasn't in Klazam's original post, I added that to show conditional agreement with the read."}

I compared the style to fate in jest, but the difference is, fate uses the over the top emphasis in directly questioning his suspect. EA on the other hand is using the over the top emphasis to try to convince the rest of us. In other words, he's not using it to try to figure out who's scum, he's using it to try to push a lynch through. Its a subtle difference, and makes it potentially scummy. But I don't think its enough to even consider EA as a lynch candidate today. He's generally been saying stuff I agree with, or at least don't outright disagree with.<br><br>I really don't have a good suspect right now. Below are some of my gut instincts:<br><br>Juls and farside have been underwhelming so far for the most part. When I read their posts, I don't see much \"trying to find scum\", but rather a lot of \"commenting on whats going on\". Like the above quote by farside - it is not a direct question or accusation. It says nothing about what she thinks about the question or what it says about my or EA's alignment. I know thats just one small example, but thats the sort of vibe I'm getting from both Juls and Farside. My gut is telling me one or both of them could be scum hanging back just cruising under the radar.

He accomplished three things with his Javert vote, and those things were VOTE PARK, VOTE PARK, AND VOTE PARK. He was vote parking on Maxous earlier too, and he's already looking like he's vote parking on NE.

He attacks ender for unvoting, but then immediately tacks on a comment that distances himself from it. It serves no protown purpose. So why did he post it? Because he doesn't want to get into an argument.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedscum wrote:</cite>Why would I want to attack javert?</div></blockquote><br>Because you were voting him? That's usually what townies do to the people they vote. Are you admitting your vote on Javert was bullshit?

The argument is, if scum force a mislynch today, then we would be in perpetual mylo for the rest of the game. This is IMO short sighted.<br><br>If TS is scum and this is a gambit, then TS has a 50% chance of not only getting lynched anyways, but also pretty much clearing a townie if his gambit fails (not a pro-town townie either, forcing a suboptimal nk). And a second scum could be lynched the second day. Even if his gambit succeeds, there is a 100% chance of lynching scum the next day.<br><br>Consider no gambit: there is some non-zero percentage that no scum will die in 2 days - that is to say, we're not guaranteed to even lynch a single scum over the next 2 days.<br><br>Actually, maybe it'll make more sense if I just give you the numbers...<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: numbers, numbers, numbers</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">1) If this is TS scum pulling a gambit, then...<br><br>Chance of lynching exactly 0 scum in 2 days: 0% (100% chance of lynching at least 1 scum in 2 days)<br>Chance of lynching exactly 1 scum in 2 days: 83% (lynching scum today random town lynch tomorrow OR town today 100% scum lynch tomorrow)<br>Chance of lynching exactly 2 scum in 2 days: 17% (assuming random lynch tomorrow of living players 6 town 2 scum)<br><br>2) If TS is scum and he would have say claimed to be roleblocked, then...<br><br>Chance of lynching exaxtly 0 scum in 2 days: 44% (assuming random lynching)<br>Chance of lynching exactly 1 scum in 2 days: 46% (assuming random lynching)<br>Chance of lynching exactly 2 scum in 2 days: 10% (assuming random lynching)<br><br>So, I know we're not random lynching, but gambiting is clearly a bad play here for scum if we were. But based on factors we don't yet know, we may be more or less likely than random to hit scum.<br><br>3) Lets suppose TS is scum and scum decided overnight that TS was going to be lynched regardless today...<br><br>Chance of lynching exactly 0 scum in 2 days: 0% (100% chance of lynching scum today)<br>Chance of lynching exactly 1 scum in 2 days: 67% (100% chance of lynching scum today and random 67% chance of lynching town tomorrow)<br>Chance of lynching exactly 2 scum in 2 days: 33% (100% chance of lynching scum today and random 33% chance of lynching scum tomorrow)<br><br>OK, so if scum assumed that TS-scum was 100% going to be lynched today without gambitting, than they improved themselves a little bit having TS claim he had a guilty. But just as we're not random lynching, there was not a 100% chance that TS was going to be lynched today. So the actual odds for no gambit are somewhere in between 2) and 3).<br><br>4) Also consider, if scum were 100% sure that TS were going to be lynched regardless, then they lose some of the benefit, because then they wouldn't be able to assume NE vs. TS would be a 50/50 - they would have to also assume that the town would be suspicious of the guilty result and be somewhat higher than 50% more likely to lynch TS vs. NE. Worst case, the scum could assume the gambit completely fails and TS is lynched with 100% certainty today, which means these numbers would look exactly the same as 3) anyways.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TL;DR: So, let me tie all this together. Over the next 2 days, here are the range of probabilities for lynching exactly 0, 1, or 2 scum for gambit or no gambit and assuming TS scum.</span><br><br>Gambit:<br>0 scum: 0%<br>1 scum: 67% to 83%<br>2 scum: 17% to 33%<br><br>No gambit (claim to be RBed):<br>0 scum: 0% to 44%<br>1 scum: 46% to 67%<br>2 scum: 10% to 33%<br><br>When I look at these numbers, they tell me the same conclusion I already stated. If TS were scum, there is no benefit to claiming a guilty. Furthermore, its wifom proof. Lets suppose scum figured all this out and did it anyways knowing we'd lynch town today. We still 100% lynch scum tomorrow. Look at the numbers above: its a 67-83% chance by the end of the day tomorrow we're going to be in mylo anyways. I'm not saying that makes it ok to lynch town first - I want that 17-33% chance of lynching 2 scum - just that pointing out we will be in mylo if we lynch town first isn't a strong point in favor of TS-scum doing this gambit because the odds favor us being in mylo even if we hit scum first anyways.</div></div></div><br><br>OK, so now for the real tl;dr: I still stand by the fact that scum-TS and the scum team don't benefit from having TS claim a guilty on NE-town today. (small benefit under some assumption, huge misplay under others). Therefore, I believe the more likely scenario is that TS is telling the truth and NE is scum. If I'm being duped, I'm still happy to take the 1 for 1 because if this is a gambit we're likely to end up in mylo after 2 more lynches anyways even if scum is lynched today (regardless of who the scum is). Compared to had we not had a guilty today, under random lynching assumptions we'd have been even more likely to be in mylo or worse after 2 lynches (we would probably be stuck no lynching tomorrow to get to full lylo, due to the misvig - another reason why this would not be an optimal gambit for scum to try).<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>Thinking about all this, it makes me more suspicious that javert could be scum. IMO, he really used his daykill in an antitown way - first claiming on D1, and then killing a claimed PR. It basically turns the game back into the old style 12p mini's which were scum favored, but even more scum favored with the scum daykill considering that javert could eliminate a very pro-town player or PR. Then it would make sense that town has the masons and 2 cops and scum with no RB - frankly, that would make the game seem pretty balanced. Swingy as hell, but balanced. I'm basically just throwing this out here now and tucking it under my tin-foil hat. But this is one theory that doesn't really take a huge stretch to believe.<br><br>Or, maybe I'm just upset because, if javert is town and still had his daykill today, we'd be able to use his daykill first on the one of TS or NE who we most think is scum, and mop up the other with the lynch if we're wrong (or lynch scum if the daykill hits scum).<br><br>NE-Javert-...Farside/duplicity? scum team?"}

The awful reasoning MW gave for his vote that you sheeped? Does anybody have any reason to think I'm scum besides Twistedscum's result? You might want to push people to give their resons so you can find the scum that are on my wagon. It's going to be hell to figure that out without more detailed explanations.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>These posts also clearly show I did not think of TS as obvscum at the end of the day as NE is now claiming. Thats a clear misrep on his part with the only purpose to try to discredit me. Makes me even more confident my vote is in the right spot.</div></blockquote><br>I wasn't misrepping you. I was pointing out that you were very sure that TS was scum, even to the point that you didn't care about his claim, and now you're very sure that he is town based solely on his claim despite the evidence that he is faking it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>ummm...the same way he didn't get lynched yesterday maybe...?</div></blockquote><br>This is an awful answer. The situations are completely different. A one-shot cop claim isn't going to buy him a free night like it bought him yesterday. You're not really considering the importance of this question. Look at TS's play today. He claims a guilty on me, waffles on it by suggesting that there might be a framer or he might be insane despite the fact that there is no evidence of either of these things, and does nothing for the rest of the day but push for my lynch. These facts suggest a guilty gambit. We have to consider what other strategy he could pursue as scum. If there are no sensible alternative, then we must seriously consider the idea that he is gambiting. We haven't even scratched the surface of the first step there so now we're just rushing to lynch the guilty target.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>I want to revisit why it doesn't make sense for TS scum to try this gambit. The argument is, if scum force a mislynch today, then we would be in perpetual mylo for the rest of the game. This is IMO short sighted.<br><br>If TS is scum and this is a gambit, then TS has a 50% chance of not only getting lynched anyways, but also pretty much clearing a townie if his gambit fails (not a pro-town townie either, forcing a suboptimal nk). And a second scum could be lynched the second day. Even if his gambit succeeds, there is a 100% chance of lynching scum the next day.</div></blockquote><br>The fact that you say TS has a 50% chance of getting lynched after I flip town tells me that you're not prepared for when I flip town. It suggests that his strategy of hinting that his \"investigation\" might not be accurate is working. We need to discuss this fully instead of jumping to the conclusion that I must be scum.<br><br>Your suggestion that I will be nightkilled after TS is lynched is WIFOM. Maxous's and Duplicity's idea that this is a bus is proof of that. You can't assume that scum can kill me when leaving me alive could cause the town to think that I'm scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>OK, so now for the real tl;dr: I still stand by the fact that scum-TS and the scum team don't benefit from having TS claim a guilty on NE-town today. (small benefit under some assumption, huge misplay under others). Therefore, I believe the more likely scenario is that TS is telling the truth and NE is scum. If I'm being duped, I'm still happy to take the 1 for 1 because if this is a gambit we're likely to end up in mylo after 2 more lynches anyways even if scum is lynched today (regardless of who the scum is). Compared to had we not had a guilty today, under random lynching assumptions we'd have been even more likely to be in mylo or worse after 2 lynches (we would probably be stuck no lynching tomorrow to get to full lylo, due to the misvig - another reason why this would not be an optimal gambit for scum to try).</div></blockquote><br>How can you be happy with lynching me when you have no plan or even basic discussion for when I flip town?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>Ok.

After instantly beleiving TS about the guilty.<br><br>- I pointed out that I was sceptical about this change of mind about beleiving TS and she responded by saying it was because she suspected TS yesterday and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2988712#p2988712\" class=\"postlink\">called myself and TS a scum team together</a>. Seems like deflecting. Also if she suspected TS yesterday to the point where she did'nt really beleive his claim, then I am again confused about instantly voting NE.<br><br>- She also took TS' response to NE of \"so unless you can prove that the mafioso have a framer or I am an insane cop without knowing so then you're mafioso\" out of context. She claimed TS was doubting his insanity but he was'nt. He was basically saying to NE \"you are mafia\"<br><br>- <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3004723#p3004723\" class=\"postlink\">This last post is the most interesting.</a> She claims she is having a hard time beleiving there is two one-shot cops. So why did she beleive it in the first place when she voted NE?<br><br> - She also claims that \"I would think TS scum would be smart enough to get an innocent on another player then bussing and leaving no outs.\"<br> Then why argue that TS was scum in the first place? Or am I misunderstanding something about this?<br><br> - Lastly, point of interest : Farside and NE were on the same bandwagon 4 times in this game - (Ender241, Twistedspoon, Me=Weird, Twistedspoon.)<br><br>In conclusion: I think she saw the guilty on NE and instantly voted to be seen on the lynch. Then she seen an opportunity to turn around the bandwagon on TS when EA and NE reacted by pointing the finger at TS.<br>If she was as spectical of TS as she claims she was then she would of reacted like Erratus did. If she beleived that TS was genuine about his guilty on NE because he suspected NE all Day 1 then I don't see why she would change her mind like she did.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Farside22</span>"}

Javert nk doesn't make much sense IMO, he wasn't doing a lot of scumhunting thus shouldn't have been seen as a threat unless he was on the right track and scum were worried he might play a more active role. Its also possible that scum felt he was too unlynchable and confirmed town, would implicate TS, or his flip wouldn't provide a lot of info, but IME those have become outdated reasons for scum kills. New meta shifts let towns who have the balls learn from night kills. Javert was basically VT in role, and with me preparing to look into him today was far from confirmed town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod, any chance you could update the first post with current players and who they replaced? I'm having trouble keeping track. It was quilford who replaced klazam, yes?</span> *checks* yeah it was, but it would still be nice to have that info in the OP.<br><br>Quilford is actually confirmed town, yet scum choose to kill javert over quilford, who is not only confirmed town but also an upgrade to the klazam slot? Yeah, doesn't make a lot of sense to me at all. Quilford, your suspicions from yesterday are probably wrong, otherwise you'd probably be dead right now.<br><br>Not to pat myself on the back, but I take a lot of credit for getting NE lynched and not allowing TS to be lynched. I bring this up, because scum would see that I'm persuasive in this town, and if my suspicions were on the right track, I'd be a legitimate choice for a nk. Scum don't like influential townies who are on the right track.<br><br>So, my theory is, scum figured Kill javert, maybe he was on the right track, maybe it would implicate TS, maybe with Javert dead, rhinox would focus on his #2 suspect farside. Quilford should have been the obvious nk choice for being 100% confirmed town, but he was obviously going to help mislynch farside, so he gets left alive. All this is wifoming myself into believing farside is town.<br><br>We have 2 scum left, and they are 1 of EA(Locke right?)/Maxous, and 1 of Prosaurus/Duplicity IMO. I think the VCA will support this once I present it. Its pretty obvious Quilford would be dead if farside were scum if nothing else.

To me, that looks like it could be when the flip was switched and he decided to bus. On the other hand, the VCA above shows that when EA switched, the wagons were tied, and he made NE the leading wagon. That was also before I came back from Easter and started really pushing for NE to be lynched.<br><br>When I look back at EA day 1, I see he did a little pushing at NE and voted for a few posts before moving on. The style was consistent with his play up to that point: vote ender, question a few posts, move on vote klazam, left it there a few posts (no follow up with klazam vote, hmmm), move on to prosaurus, question a few posts, move on to NE, question a few posts, move on to TS. This is where the playstyle changed, and EA aggressively pursued TS's lynch, and then back to aggressively pursuing klazam this time, then aggressively pursuing Oso.<br><br>Couple interesting snippits from D1:<br><blockquote><div><cite>EA wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TS wrote:</cite>indeed, NE has gone under the radar for too long<br><br>I'm fine with this wagon.

Look at his posts between his Javert vote and his unvote. He doesn't attack Javert, he doesn't question Javert, he doesn't push the Javert wagon, he's doesn't do a single damn thing to Javert. He accomplished three things with his Javert vote, and those things were VOTE PARK, VOTE PARK, AND VOTE PARK. He was vote parking on Maxous earlier too, and he's already looking like he's vote parking on NE. I suggest we park a noose around Twistedscum's neck.</div></blockquote><br>Chainsaw?<br><blockquote><div><cite>EA wrote:</cite>I concur, vig already Javert.<br><br>FWIW I support vigging Klazam or Twistedspoon and am <span class=\"noboldsig\">against vigging</span> Ender, Prosaurus, MeWeird, <span class=\"noboldsig\">NEvil</span>, or farside (or me obv obv)</div></blockquote><br>Thats a pretty good place to stick in a scum partner.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>Oh, come on, EA! Do you really want to nit pick over something like this? I posted on Friday, wasn't even on the site on Saturday, and posted again on Sunday, so to me at the time, it was one day. What difference does it make that it was technically two days? That's still suspiciously premature to vote for lurking. We clearly didn't have a lurking problem at the time. He even said that he just picked me because I was the lowest on the activity overview. That's not scumhunting. He used a technicallity that doesn't even remotely prove the case he was making in order to excuse his vote.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>I believe Juls mason claim. I've had a town read on her for a while and that would explain my odd feelings about Klazam. I'm really rolling my eyes at her vote on me, though.

I think she's overestimating how often I should be posting because this is has been a very active game. I've certainly posted my fair share of content, IMO.</div></blockquote><br>These are town reactions to being attacked.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Are you a moron, or have you never heard of having a gut town read on somebody who's done scummy things?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Are you just twisting everything so it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span> be scummy, or are you an idiot?

An Oso lynch wasn't completely ruled out, his top choice. Were EA here today, my top question would be why he didn't think an NE or Oso lynch was possible. Or why he hammered without letting M=W claim? - EA clearly didn't want M=W lynched, so a claim may have shifted the wagon quickly onto his top scum choice (Oso) if he's town, but it also could have shifted onto scum (NE). The point here is that there was still essentially a full day left before deadline, he didn't need to hammer when he did especially without giving M=W the 22 hours to claim. I think he could have been banking on being able to get away with hammering M=W before claim to prevent the wagon from quickshifting to his scum partner if people believed M=W's claim.<br><blockquote><div><cite>EA wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>@EA, I don't think Oso is gonna swing today. I think we should re-evaluate him tomorrow. Who is your second choice?</div></blockquote>Twistedspoon is. I'd also live with a lynch of Rhinox, farside, or Maxous even though those are null reads atm. I definitely don't want to lynch MeWeird, NEvil, Prosaurus, Javert, Quilford or you.</div></blockquote><br>Interesting post to keep in mind for later if EA/Locke is determined to be scum. I'd put 1 scum partner in the \"live with a lynch\" category, and 1 in the \"don't want to lynch\" category.<br><br>I would hope to be able to clearly conclude that EA/Duplicity is not an acceptable pairing for remaing 2 scum partners, given EA's assault on Oso. I'd consider EA/Prosaurus, EA/Maxous, EA/Farside as likely pairings should EA be scum, roughly in that order of likliness. But EA/Maxous might not seem that likely given Locke coming out today - not the time to bus. And if prosaurus really did do a town slip, then that EA/Prosaurus is out. And I almost don't even consider EA/Farside likely at all due to leaning town on farside for WIFOM reasons. So POE might actually be ruling EA/Locke out completely. That would simplifiy the rest of the game a lot, with Maxous/Duplicity jumping to the top of the most likely scum pairing list. They'll be the next 2 on my list to analyze.</div></div></div><br><br>I had initially meant to include analysis of Maxous, Prosaurus, and Duplicity/OS in this post, but its taking a bit too long both in time and words. I also need to look at Javert's suspicions, and do a farside iso to make sure I'm not wifoming myself out of a scum lynch. All this will be done before I place a vote today, but this should start off explaining my thinking for my earlier posts so far this day. You guys can at least get a head start on reading the EA part rather than me dumping the entire wall on you at once <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}

Between the previous quote and this point, he questions other players why they think NE is scum (especially TS) but I can't see much critical reading of NE at all. He responds to NE but he doesn't question him, and he still doesn't seem to make any effort to read NE when he considers him the second-best available lynch candidate after Me=Weird.<br><br>The response to the guilty claim is very non-committal on NE's alignment and buys NE some time:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>Let Neccessary Evil respond at least. <br>Those votes are too quick.<br><br>Apart from that, not much to discuss.The town decides to lynch NE or not at this stage. Discussing other suspects would be pointless until that is decided.</div></blockquote><br><br>The next post he segues into casting doubt on both Farside and Rhinox regardless of NE's alignment:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>Neccessary Evil calling Twistedspoon a liar makes things easier.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>And, yeah, I agree with Maxous that the speed of my wagon is highly suspect.</div></blockquote><br>how is it suspect when I have a guilty result  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"> <br></div></blockquote><br>I'll explain. There are two scenarios. <br>NE is town, NE is mafia.<br><br>Farside and Rhinox voted without any consideration for the possibility that NE would either be framed or was a miller. They did'nt care.<br>If NE is town it could be that they blindly followed a cop result to bandwagon for a easy lynch on town.<br>If NE is mafia it could be that they know he is mafia and decided to vote straight away to cover themselves and be on the lynch.<br><br>Either way it is suspect. <br>I would include Quilford as well but he is clear due to the mason claim.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>we've already lost one one-shot cop and we can't afford to lose another<br></div></blockquote><br>But you already used your ability :p<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite> And, yeah, I agree with Maxous that the speed of my wagon is highly suspect.</div></blockquote><br>Anybody in particular?<br>Also :  Are you confident Twistedspoon is lying about this? What do you think about the possibilty of a mafia framer?<br><br>@Farside and Rhinox: Why did the two of you instantly beleive the result from Twistedspoon? As far as I remember he was on both of your suspect lists.</div></blockquote><br><br>The questions here do not focus on determining NE's alignment; instead they revolve around who's suspect out of those who voted him, and what other potential explanations there could be for the guilty result. His attitude seems to be that both TS and NE are town, which I find to be an unlikely attitude for a townie to take in this situation, mainly due to the lack of consideration that one/both could be scum.<br><br>ISO 40 is a strange one that I can't quite fathom out. Maxous basically outlines why it's incredibly unlikely that TS is mafia; but then doesn't take the logical step that NE is likely mafia. He does state that it's plausible they could both be mafia, but again there's a lack of thrust here. Honestly, I would expect a buddy to cast more doubt on TS than Maxous is doing here, although TS is at L-2, so the motivation of trying to buy towncred by arguing that TS is town could apply.<br><br>In 41 we finally get an indication that he doesn't actually believe this framer theory:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite> point. <br>At Maxous and anyone else in the game. Have you ever seen a person claim cop and question it? </div></blockquote><br>Yes.<br> And by \"question it\" you mean wondering if there is a framer? How can a cop know for sure?<br>Even if you are a cop the only people that know for sure are mafia. There is usually a possibility that your results can be manipulated, unless the set-up states otherwise.<br>The reason I have'nt voted NE is in case there is a framer. With TS voting NE yesterday it is feasible the mafia could accurately guess who TS would investigate.<br>That being said I currently don't think so, but the possibility is worth exploring.<br>[/quote]<br><br>So the underlying implication is that he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span> think NE is scum. So where's the analysis? He says he's rereading, but there are no results. This is compounded by the response to NE in ISO 43 (bolded for emphasis):<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>There's no reason for him to think that there is a framer, or for anybody else to think that. Cop sanity is guaranteed in normals. TS was expressing doubt in his guilty result to give him an out. When I flip town, he'll insist that there is a framer or something that altered his result. He knows he'll be lynched if he doesn't give himself some kind of out.<br></div></blockquote><br>He did'nt express doubt about the result.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>Do you have any reason to think there is a framer? Does anybody? How do you suggest we explore this possibility?<br></div></blockquote><br>Well I don't have a reason to but there was no point in rushing into a lynch without exploring the possibility. We're not short on time.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The only way to explore the possibiltiy is seeing if there is enough reasonable doubt about yourself being mafia</span></div></blockquote><br><br>And there's my biggest problem of all. For the entirety of the game, there's barely a shred of evidence that Maxous has read NE's posts and tried to assess his alignment. The first post I quoted is the only time he really indicates that he's assessed NE at all, and even then his conclusion doesn't quite match his stated findings. Now we get to this situation where he explicitly states that the only way to assess the existence of a framer is to see if there is 'reasonable doubt' about NE being scum. Why is there no evidence of this? Ever since the guilty, Maxous has repeatedly stated the possibility of a framer, but not only does he apparently never believe one existed, he also gives no indication of trying to assess NE's alignment based on his posts, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">which he declares is the only way to explore his theory.</span><br><br>Finally, after again questioning someone else (Duplicity) about their NE read without giving his own opinion, he moves on to voting NE, still with no indication of whether he's ever read NE's posts and decided how likely his framer theory is."}

Either way, you've got to be thinking that any scumteam would have at least a couple of PRs to counteract those. I'd expect a Godfather with the two cops, so what else is there if not a blocker? If there was a Framer they just would have made NE show up as innocent.

Null here, could be town wondering about treating players differently, could be scum trying to tie Ender to NE.<br><br>ISO 22 - Questions NE about voting based on 'thin reasoning' because lots of other people have been doing it. I find this one scummy. You don't stop scumhunting just because several people are doing the same scummy thing. Also says she doesn't like NE's case; doesn't state whether she thinks this is scummy or not.<br><br>ISO 23 - asks NE about his switch to Ender and asks why he is scummier than Oso. Again lacks any strong scum/town lean. <br><br>ISO 28 - some ISOs here. It gets a little confusing with the Me=Weird ISO. Farside states she agrees with his points on NE, but then seems to indicate that the main point she agrees with is a stretch, THEN she says she thinks she has found a town-tell on M=W:<br><br>[quote=Farside]<br>I like your points on NE especially this:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> First, he says he thinks the votes on ender are \"ridiculous\", but later on(when there's a wagon) he votes ender for including possibilities of javert being town, which as I have said multiple times, even though there are more possibilities of him being town, doesn't mean he is. The one where he's scum could still be more probable.</div></blockquote><br><br>There is some back and forth between NE and MW that I need to read NE before I decide on a few things here:<br><br>And I see that the point is a stretch at best as the only thing NE stated was during the rVS stage here:<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2930039#p2930039\" class=\"postlink\">here</a><br>I found something in MW that I believe means he is town. I'm going to hold this one close to the chest.[/quote]<br><br>Following this there's an admission that she has a 'meh read' on NE. Seems to focus on him providing reasons: good for EA, bad for his other suspects. Again not a lot of follow-through here; from the tone I'd guess that Farside is reading NE on the scummy side, but there's an odd lack of thrust. This is also evident in the M=W questioning above; this may just be because of the way Farside's putting the post together; it looks like she's reading and commenting as she goes, so there's some disconnection in her thinking which doesn't read right.<br><br>ISO 48: near deadline, Farside takes a look at the 3 main wagons. I'll quote all of this because it's useful to note how she decided on her vote:<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>I'm reevaluating the main 3 that people are talking about.<br><br>Oso - I would not lynch Oso. Although I found EA's point interesting it does not outway the scum hunting, questioning and POV's that oso has displayed today. He's evulated many people in the game and brought up cases that ring town to me.<br><br>NE: I don't care much for NE's reason's for finding MW scummy. Their weak tells (on is a stregth at best). He has found TS scummy most of the game and he defended his reasoning for his vote on ender well. However I see no strong scum reads coming from him. <br>MW - I have many issues with MW recently. He has called Oso town most of the day but when EA brings up a point he states the follow:<br><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Maxous, can you please consolidate why you think I'm scum into one post. Thanks.<br>I can see Oso as an alternate lynch, seeing as how EA made a good point about believing the claims and still suspecting them.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>He also barely mentions Klaz all day but has no problem jumping on the BW here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Hm. I don't entirely approve of the ender kill.<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2944367#p2944367\" class=\"postlink\">Post #244:</a> Klazam attacked me and prosaurus for \"role-fishing\". Scum often look for townies doing common \"scumtells\" that are so widely known, scum don't actually do anymore. And thus useless as scum-tells.<br>This, combined with not providing much reasoning for his votes, lots of short, content sparse posts and scum vibes, makes me think he's scum. He seems like the most likely of my scumspects to get lynched, and I don't like wasting my vote, so<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote: Klazam</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Also he made a case on NE <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2940096#p2940096\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> but NE never stated it was rediculous and when he had stated something about Ender it was during the RVS discussion.<br>Finally he is attack on Pro looks scummy as I feel Pro is newb asking question and trying to figure things out but he spins it more into something scummy.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Me=Weird</span><br><br>In short I find MW and NE scummy for different reasons. I find MW's post more scummy as I see him pushing on easy lynches and following BW without much reason.</div></blockquote><br><br>I detect a difference in tone between the NE and M=W sections of this post. There's a lot more attacking thrust towards M=W's slot. She states some negative points against NE, but they are very much diminished in contrast to M=W's vote on Klazam, and by slotting in her conclusion on NE in with M=W, she makes her points against NE read very much as null while M=W is super-scummy, even though two of the stated problems with NE's play (weak reasoning and lack of strong scumreads) are on a par with most of what she brings up against M=W. This is reminiscent of several of her other posts relating to NE in the game: potentially negative connotations but without the accompanying aggression I'd expect from Farside on a scumread. This also makes Farside's mystery towntell on M=W look very dubious.<br><br>ISO 54: Farside votes NE after TS's guilty.<br><br>ISO 55: Farside does an about-turn and spots a 'slip' from TS. I can see this going either way. TS's reaction is pretty dubious for someone who definitely has a guilty. The choice of language ('I think') is indicative of caution and I can see why Farside-town, who suspected TS after his D1 claim, would be all over this. On the flip side, the instant vote for NE and then the change in direction once TS says something suspect could definitely be scum who thought they had to bus their partner until they saw a good opportunity to make TS look scummy. <br><br>ISO 67: This one is interesting because Farside has suggested TS and NE are scum together and this is a gambit. The timing of this is key - NE is definitely looking like the lynch at this stage, and sure enough, the very next post NE hammers. The reason I find this scummy is that Farside has been very sure of TS-scum since his 'slip', but when the lynch turns back towards NE, she throws out this little bit of doubt and starts sounding a lot more confused than she did. I can empathise with the confusion, but the timing is scummy.<br><br>Summary: Farside's attitude to NE seems somewhat non-committal and similarly uncritical to Maxous. The reasons behind the choice of M=W over NE are probably the scummiest point for me; in that post it really feels like she's trumping up the case against M=W to justify the vote, whilst downplaying NE's scumminess to imply that M=W is the obvious choice. I do see the aggressive scumhunting I'd expect from Farside on other slots, and potentially she has just been unfortunate in her reads (e.g. her suspicion of Klazam is entirely justified based on his play, only to be shot down by Juls' mason claim), but the timing of certain posts and the difference in attitude towards NE and other players puts her as a likely NE buddy for me. I still have Maxous ahead, because there's just no evidence of him even considering NE as scum, even in situations where he should be, whereas Farside does make enquiries and probe at NE in a manner that suggests she could be trying to figure out alignment; there's just not quite the follow-through I'd expect, which is what makes me doubt the authenticity. <br><br>One thing I really do want to know:<br><br>Farside: what was your town-tell on M=W on D1, and what happened to it?<br><br>And on that note, I'm going to be V/LA for a week from tomorrow as I'm on holiday, so I won't be online at all during that time. I'll check back in a few hours to see if there are any responses and decide where to put my vote."}

I'm Van...\"<br><br>He couldn't say another word as his vocal chords were cut short by the tightening of the rope. Within the next few seconds, the life drained from his face and he finally gave himself over to death, having no fight left in him. The group, yelling in victory ran into his room and started searching for the poison. They searched his old cabinets, under his TV stand, on top of his dresser, even in his.. pokemon pillow sheets? That's okay, we don't judge. Finally, they searched the one last place they could think of... the air conditioning vent. They unscrewed it, looking in and...<br><br>nothing.

Doesn't really look like a bus, but I'm reconsidering this in the context of the unvote fairly soon (post 3) and the later insistence that Oso is town.<br><br>3: sets up a choice between Prosaurus, TS and Ender, based on the heat Javert was getting for not answering questions. I'm going to quote part of this one because it's telling how he builds the case and then draws a conclusion.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>I'm not liking the heat that Javert was receiving for not answering quesitons. That's a playstyle issue, not an alignment issue. Unforunatley, townies will jump all over people for this sort of thing all the time and it's easy for scum to hide among them. So, let's see; farside22 wasn't really voting Javert for not answering questions, so I'm not counting her. Twistedspoon has been active lurking for the most part and he voted Javert, so he might be scum. Prosaurus is very similar: he voted for Javert and he has been active lurking. ender241 voted Javert for not answering questions and Oso makes a compelling case for ender, but I don't think Oso is town and I'm not going to sheep his read whithout a strong town read on him. ender posted this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ender241 wrote:</cite>You have misinterpreted what i'm saying, i'm saying he's either doing one of three things.<br><br>1. He is scum and basically trying to make himself stay alive for ages.<br><br>2. He's just a normally townie who's got himself into a sticky situation.<br><br>3. He's a DayVig and just a total dick who can't be assed posting and is just being a total dick about the whole game.<br><br>Thats what i'm trying to say, i don't want dicks in the game.</div></blockquote><br>This looks like a scummy reaction to Oso's vote. He's trying to scramble away from what he said before:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ender241 wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span> <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Javert</span> Start answering questions, i doubt your a DayVig.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>ender241 wrote:</cite>Basically your using \"Day-vig\" as your excuse to say what you want.</div></blockquote><br>Also, ender thinks there are three possibilities regarding Javert and only one of them invovles him being scum, why vote? Between the vote and his posting, his behavior does not suggest the other two possibilities. Then he unvotes and votes me for lurking for a whole day (oh, for shame!). That's rather suspicious.<br><br>It's hard to pick between Twistedspoon, Prosaurus, and ender, but ender is just enough ahead that he deserves my vote.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ender241</span></div></blockquote><br><br>So TS and Prosaurus he basically has only two points against: the objection to Javert's attitude, and active lurking. In contrast, he clearly builds a case on Ender based on a couple of additional points, so why is he only 'just enough ahead'? The phrasing implies a more equal level of scumminess than the post actually indicates, so I'm wondering whether he's making an effort to look like he suspects TS or Prosaurus more than he actually does. This makes me more inclined to believe that at least one of TS and Prosaurus is scum.<br><br>4: features a clarification to Prosaurus that active lurking means he has been posting but not contributing. Gives me pause for thought about coaching.<br><br>5: says Javert should 'shoot whoever he wants' rather than letting it be decided by vote. Good way to distance yourself from any decision-making to avoid implication; bear in mind that Ender is the vote leader at this stage and Javert is personally voting Ender, so this doesn't really tell us too much else other than NE probably wasn't particularly worried about scum getting vigged.<br><br>6: now 'Oso is looking more town by the post'. NE's focus has not really been on Oso since post 3, and there's not much clarification of this townread, although the implication is that Oso's case on Ender is pro-town. There's also what is basically an OMGUS reaction to TS's vote based on NE being 'under the radar', as we can see here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>indeed, NE has gone under the radar for too long<br><br>I'm fine with this wagon. My vote on Javert is utterly redundant anyways now that his wagon is gone and he's claimed :/<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: NE</span></div></blockquote><br>Twistedspoon is still active lurking for the most part and he's now sheeping Me=Weird's terrible vote on bad reasoning. I'm not \"under the radar\" just because I don't post as much as some people.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Twistedspoon</span></div></blockquote><br><br>There's a slightly hostile tone to this response that makes me think that NE is a little too angry at TS for sheeping M=W's vote; potential here for a buddy getting annoyed that TS has decided to hop on his wagon based on what he perceives to be a weak case. <br><br>7: Very interesting snippet here on the vig:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>Really the best way to play a vig is to kill problem players like VIs, lurkers, etc. It sounds like that's what Javert is planning on doing anyway.</div></blockquote><br><br>So we can tell two things from this: <br>1. NE's not overly concerned about any of the VIs/lurkers dying.<br>2. NE's perception is that Javert is going to kill someone who he considers a VI/lurker.<br><br>Players NE has stated are 'active lurking' at this point: Prosaurus, Twistedspoon. The only other player he's discussed lurking in relation to is himself, although Klazam is obviously a major absentee at this stage and would be a prime lurker vig target. NE hasn't actually stated he thinks anyone is a VI at this stage, so again this may be as simple as him thinking Javert is going to shoot Ender/Klazam. I still count this as a slight point in favour of Prosaurus and TS being town, given that he'd have to agree with a choice of shot on either of those given his repeated accusations of active lurking.<br><br>8: tells Prosaurus that Klazam's appearance at an opportune moment is a null-tell. Why warn someone off suspecting a player who has done nothing all game? Possible coaching again. <br><br>Farside also challenges NE about Pro, and NE responds by saying that neither TS nor Pro are scumhunting, but TS is far worse. He even goes so far as to call him 'obvscum' here. Pro looks like a more plausible buddy than TS here. <br><br>9: Response to TS's claim. Worth quoting:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>I won't have time to write a full post until tomorrow, so just a couple of thoughts:<br>a) Javert needs to post ASAP.<br>-and-<br>b) TS is just dripping with scum, but his claim fits with his speculation about a one-shot themed game and it looks like we're going to give him at least a night anyway. I wouldn't loose any sleep if he was killed/lynched, but if the rest of you are moving on, I'm fine with that.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Twistedspoon</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Definitely going with the town on this one. Perceives that people might be buying TS's claim and openly admits that he'll give him a chance if everyone else is. The thing that irks me about this is he's unusually eager to drop his number one suspect, which makes me suspect TS. However, this probably does help NE to appear pro-town, so it cuts both ways.<br><br>10: Putting up a huge red flag on this one:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>@EA: I'm surprised that you were grilling Klazam over lurking after the last game the three of us were in (it's completed, so no worries). At least he posted that he was V/LA this time. Why are you attacking him over it now?</div></blockquote><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> What are you talking about? Klazam didn't lurk in Mini 1133 at all. He had 59 posts which is pretty damn good considering he was only alive for roughly nine RL days. For comparison this game has been active for roughly eight RL days and he's made ten posts. Half of which are worthless saporovirusy fluff.</div></blockquote><br>Well, I disagree with you about the other game and your standard for lurking is odd. But that's neither here nor there. I looked at his ISO and you do have a point about him. I was going to say that ten posts in eight days can hardly be described as lurking, but as you pointed out, a lot of those posts don't contribute much. I get the feeling that something is up with him, but I can't really put my finger on it yet. <span class=\"noboldsig\">It was definitely odd to me that he was soft with TS before his claim.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Bolded for emphasis. This absolutely screams of subtly trying to tie Klazam to TS, and there's only one reason NE would do that. I feel very much more inclined to believe TS is scum after this. <br><br>At the end of this post, NE also sets up a Prosaurus-M=W dichotomy by saying that he thinks only one of them is scum. Vote count context: Prosaurus is the vote leader with 2 votes, with 5 other players on 1. That means that this has a hint of NE covering his back with Pro; he doesn't seem to be looking at him critically and really has just commented on his active lurking and lack of contributions rather than trying to prod him into anything. <br><br>12: NE follows up by making a case and voting for M=W. He doesn't appear to have looked at Prosaurus here; he just concludes that he doesn't think Prosaurus is scum because he believes that M=W is. At this stage, it looks a bit more like NE is just trying to set up mislynches; he pushes the idea that M=W and Pro aren't buddies, and he knows M=W will flip town, opening him up to fake reconsidering his reads D2 and change his attitude to Pro. That said, the lack of analysis of Pro's posts still concerns me slightly.<br><br>13: mostly a long rant against M=W that I won't go into for obvious reasons. There is an interesting note at the bottom that he's read EA's case on Oso and doesn't really agree with it (although it's not 'awful' either). He also restates his town read on Oso after the early part of the game. The vote context here is that M=W has switched his vote to Oso and EA is repeatedly shouting 'Vote Oso' at everyone. There's not really much danger of Oso getting lynched, though - M=W now has 4 votes and EA isn't garnering much Oso support. I'm inclined to think this is more likely just NE being consistent with his Oso 'townread' than it is defence from a buddy.<br><br>16: TS has just claimed his guilty, so NE naturally immediately votes for him. He also agrees with Maxous about his wagon being too fast. For the record, these votes, in order, are: Twistedspoon, Quilford, Farside, Rhinox. Of the wagoners, we have a confirmed townie and a flipped townie, so the only person left that NE could be pointing the finger at here is Farside. Obviously we have to take everything from here on with a grain of salt, but this makes me feel better about Farside-town. <br><br>The rest: from here on it's basically just an effort to make TS look bad and asking how he could survive without claiming a guilty. He also makes some attempts to implicate Rhinox based on him believing TS despite previously thinking he was scum. I think this probably lends weight to the gambit theory; if TS gets lynched in this situation, NE's not only going to get lynched the next day himself, but he's also cleared Rhinox because of this push. Bear in mind that Quilford and Javert are both already practically confirmed town at this stage, and NE pushing on Rhinox doesn't make much sense unless he knows there's something to link him to. There's absolutely no way Rhinox would get lynched at that stage, and if NE knows TS is town, then all he's doing is giving town a boost by going after Rhinox so strongly as to clear him when TS gets lynched. That would leave NE + scumbuddy against three fairly obv-town players with NE guaranteed to get lynched the next day.</div></div></div><br><br>In conclusion, I feel a lot worse about TS now than I did before this ISO, as there are definite attempts to link more than one player to him in ways that really don't look like scum on town, and not great about Prosaurus either, as there's just so little evidence of NE actually reading his slot other than to do some coaching, although the attempt to set up the M=W/Prosaurus choice does give me a town vibe. The Oso attitude is kind of strange; he seems to go from a pretty strong scumread on Oso to pretty much refusing to consider he could be anything other than town. I don't think it's particularly reminiscent of a buddy, though. There's not a whole lot to go on with Farside, which does give me pause based on NE's meta (I'll go into this in a bit) but the attempt to point the finger at people on NE's quick wagon makes me doubt that connection too. <br><br>Quilford: how do you think the events of Open 292, particularly the cop claim, affected NE's approach to this game? Which interactions of his do you think match his play with Crazy there?"}

It's the main thing in your favour for being town. You asked why you would have done certain things as scum. I told you. If you want to play that game, everything is WIFOM. There are reasons that scum can do just about everything. For instance, I just finished a game in which one of the scum had a daykill and shot his buddy on D1, then rode that through 9 days to win the game without doing any scumhunting, all whilst faking a post restriction. It was an incredibly risky play that I've never seen before and all but one or two of the players had him down as confirmed town for the entirety of the game, so it ended up working out perfectly. In this situation, I think you and NE bussing is a hell of a lot more plausible than that. So you're wasting your time with the 'why would I do this as scum?' arguments because I've considered that, and I still am. <br><br>So, to clarify: I suspect you because your thought process doesn't read as genuine to me and prior to the claim, several points from NE's ISO stand out to me as the actions of a buddy, particularly that quote about Klazam.

The two don't fit. The thing is, you didn't do what I would expect from a townie. I was reading back what I missed while I was V/LA and I noticed that Farside claimed. That was after I had already seen Quilford's claim list. You had the reverse experience: you were obviously here when Farside claimed, and you've admitted that you thought Farside had at least 'softclaimed' on D3 when you saw Quilford's list. Know what the first thing I'd do after having that thought is? Check Farside's ISO to make sure I was right. Then I might think about waiting to catch Farside in a lie, once I was sure that I had the claim right (Farside is pretty experienced and I think this would have been kind of pointless, but that's besides the point here). You did nothing of the sort. This does not indicate an inquisitive town thought process. It indicates scum who already knew what everyone's alignment was and had little interest in checking up on a claim already made. <br><br>So you get why I find you scummy now?<br><br>Farside: honestly, I suspect TS a lot more having reviewed NE's ISO, which is why I didn't really cover it at the time. I would have to say Duplicity's slot makes most sense as a buddy for me, particularly the Oso part. Read the post where he puts TS at effective L-1 (ISO 33). The tone is almost 'hey, you're not doing anything, I've got no choice but to call you scum'. I find Prosaurus' dearth of scumhunting to be scummier, but I'm having a hard time telling if he's just a newbie or he's playing the newbie card. Regardless, he seems like a less likely buddy."}

Hmmmmm...<br>3) If they are both scum, maybe they'd do that because they know it's uncommon and won't be suspected.</div></blockquote><br><br>Points out that the claimed vig has been absent for a prolonged period of time, which pings my scumdar as throwing dirt on an easily provable claim:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>Eh.

Like, he had a whole list of reasons why TS was scum in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2985997#p2985997\" class=\"postlink\">iso 50</a>, and then they all went away simply because maxous pointed out the timing of TS soft claim and all of a sudden EA was finding scummy comments from NE that he wasn't pointing out before. To me, that looks like it could be when the flip was switched and he decided to bus. On the other hand, the VCA above shows that when EA switched, the wagons were tied, and he made NE the leading wagon. That was also before I came back from Easter and started really pushing for NE to be lynched.<br><br>When I look back at EA day 1, I see he did a little pushing at NE and voted for a few posts before moving on. The style was consistent with his play up to that point: vote ender, question a few posts, move on vote klazam, left it there a few posts (no follow up with klazam vote, hmmm), move on to prosaurus, question a few posts, move on to NE, question a few posts, move on to TS. This is where the playstyle changed, and EA aggressively pursued TS's lynch, and then back to aggressively pursuing klazam this time, then aggressively pursuing Oso.<br><br>Couple interesting snippits from D1:<br><blockquote><div><cite>EA wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TS wrote:</cite>indeed, NE has gone under the radar for too long<br><br>I'm fine with this wagon. My vote on Javert is utterly redundant anyways now that his wagon is gone and he's claimed :/<br><br>VOTE: NE</div></blockquote>Oh yeah, Twistedspoon is totally scum. Look at his posts between his Javert vote and his unvote. He doesn't attack Javert, he doesn't question Javert, he doesn't push the Javert wagon, he's doesn't do a single damn thing to Javert. He accomplished three things with his Javert vote, and those things were VOTE PARK, VOTE PARK, AND VOTE PARK. He was vote parking on Maxous earlier too, and he's already looking like he's vote parking on NE. I suggest we park a noose around Twistedscum's neck.</div></blockquote><br>Chainsaw?<br><blockquote><div><cite>EA wrote:</cite>I concur, vig already Javert.<br><br>FWIW I support vigging Klazam or Twistedspoon and am <span class=\"noboldsig\">against vigging</span> Ender, Prosaurus, MeWeird, <span class=\"noboldsig\">NEvil</span>, or farside (or me obv obv)</div></blockquote><br>Thats a pretty good place to stick in a scum partner.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>Oh, come on, EA! Do you really want to nit pick over something like this? I posted on Friday, wasn't even on the site on Saturday, and posted again on Sunday, so to me at the time, it was one day. What difference does it make that it was technically two days? That's still suspiciously premature to vote for lurking. We clearly didn't have a lurking problem at the time. He even said that he just picked me because I was the lowest on the activity overview. That's not scumhunting. He used a technicallity that doesn't even remotely prove the case he was making in order to excuse his vote.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite>I believe Juls mason claim. I've had a town read on her for a while and that would explain my odd feelings about Klazam. I'm really rolling my eyes at her vote on me, though.

I think she's overestimating how often I should be posting because this is has been a very active game. I've certainly posted my fair share of content, IMO.</div></blockquote><br>These are town reactions to being attacked.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Are you a moron, or have you never heard of having a gut town read on somebody who's done scummy things?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Me=Weird wrote:</cite>Are you just twisting everything so it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span> be scummy, or are you an idiot?

An Oso lynch wasn't completely ruled out, his top choice. Were EA here today, my top question would be why he didn't think an NE or Oso lynch was possible. Or why he hammered without letting M=W claim? - EA clearly didn't want M=W lynched, so a claim may have shifted the wagon quickly onto his top scum choice (Oso) if he's town, but it also could have shifted onto scum (NE). The point here is that there was still essentially a full day left before deadline, he didn't need to hammer when he did especially without giving M=W the 22 hours to claim. I think he could have been banking on being able to get away with hammering M=W before claim to prevent the wagon from quickshifting to his scum partner if people believed M=W's claim.<br><blockquote><div><cite>EA wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>@EA, I don't think Oso is gonna swing today. I think we should re-evaluate him tomorrow. Who is your second choice?</div></blockquote>Twistedspoon is. I'd also live with a lynch of Rhinox, farside, or Maxous even though those are null reads atm. I definitely don't want to lynch MeWeird, NEvil, Prosaurus, Javert, Quilford or you.</div></blockquote><br>Interesting post to keep in mind for later if EA/Locke is determined to be scum. I'd put 1 scum partner in the \"live with a lynch\" category, and 1 in the \"don't want to lynch\" category.<br><br>I would hope to be able to clearly conclude that EA/Duplicity is not an acceptable pairing for remaing 2 scum partners, given EA's assault on Oso. I'd consider EA/Prosaurus, EA/Maxous, EA/Farside as likely pairings should EA be scum, roughly in that order of likliness. But EA/Maxous might not seem that likely given Locke coming out today - not the time to bus. And if prosaurus really did do a town slip, then that EA/Prosaurus is out. And I almost don't even consider EA/Farside likely at all due to leaning town on farside for WIFOM reasons. So POE might actually be ruling EA/Locke out completely. That would simplifiy the rest of the game a lot, with Maxous/Duplicity jumping to the top of the most likely scum pairing list. They'll be the next 2 on my list to analyze.</div></div></div><br><br>I had initially meant to include analysis of Maxous, Prosaurus, and Duplicity/OS in this post, but its taking a bit too long both in time and words. I also need to look at Javert's suspicions, and do a farside iso to make sure I'm not wifoming myself out of a scum lynch.

It's just personally frustrating for me because I've done a lot of reading back and analysing in this game to try to work out the scumteam and a confirmed townie has decided I'm scum based on reasons that are pretty much nothing to do with my play. Anyway, here are some reasons not to lynch me:<br><br>For you, if the question is whether I'm TS's buddy or not, I think it's quite clear from my play yesterday that I was dubious of TS and his claim. I asked you why you thought they weren't bussing on D1, and my questions to both Maxous and TS himself about the NE situation were also motivated by some doubts about TS's claim. I think my play today is even more obviously not that of a buddy and I think if I was TS's buddy and we'd gone to the trouble of setting up the NE/TS bus to buy him towncred, I wouldn't then come out and repeatedly cast doubt on that claim as that would be massively counter-productive. However, none of this is relevant to Quilford, as he believes TS is obv-town.<br><br>So, my question to Quilford is this: does ANYONE make sense as my buddy? Put it all together. I've just pointed out why TS/me doesn't make sense. Farside/me obviously doesn't make sense (which apparently you have forgotten as quickly as you realised). Do you think Prosaurus has been bussing this slot all game? Do you think EA was telling everyone to lynch his partner over and over again? It doesn't make sense for any of them.<br><br>TS: look, anyone killing Rhinox 'makes some sense'. Rhinox was actually reading and analysing the game properly. Now half the players can't even be bothered to do that. That alone is a good enough reason to kill him. So if you really are actually town, please stop talking nonsense and start helping to find scum."}

As I pointed out previously, he never goes after NE like he actually thinks he's scum. He just parks a vote on him and then proceeds to put no effort into making a case or questioning him. EA, on the other hand, was screaming that TS was scum. Look how he reacts when TS doesn't even know where his vote is. EA repeatedly gives reasons why TS is scum and pushes on him hard, and actually starts the wagon himself. TS's NE vote is basically a knee-jerk reaction to M=W's case. There's nothing there that indicates TS's NE vote wasn't a bus. Sure, I'm biased, but EA on TS really doesn't look like a bus to me.<br><br>I have to agree with Duplicity on Prosaurus. I would have expected scum to take the easy route and just vote for me, or at least maintained the suspicion at the same level.

I've been rereading D1 and I really don't get the feeling either Farside or Oso is scum with TS. Prosaurus is awful, but there's just such a lack of scum intent. I'm going to pull up some quotes and see what I can make of it. I'll have loads of time tomorrow evening so I'll have something extensive up then, if not before.<br><br>To answer the question of why I think TS wouldn't want Farside lynched instead of him; because it was apparent that Farside and I weren't scum together. That would leave TS as massive favourite to be lynched because Quilford is confirmed town and Duplicity and Prosaurus were pretty much town leans from everyone at that stage. TS's lynch leaves more doubt in the minds of town.<br><br>Farside: you seem to be fixated with the fact that I thought Oso was the most likely TS-buddy based on interactions, which is a fair assessment, and separate from the one that Duplicity's play has been pretty pro-town, and continued to be pro-town throughout the events of yesterday. You know as well as I do that reads can change, and you're familiar enough with me to know that I don't spell everything out for everyone all the time. So yeah, my read changed. It's fairly obvious even from the first post that the TS-Oso/Dup theory is not based on reviewing who's had the scummiest play, as I indicate by calling Prosaurus scummier. I was not sure who could be scum with TS. I admitted I wasn't sure who could be scum with TS. I'm still not certain who's scum with TS even now we know he's scum. I responded to Duplicity's pro-town play by having a town read on them. It really is as simple as that.<br><br>As for posts where I exhibit doubt of TS, the quote in ISO 9 is the obvious one. There are also questions in ISO 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 that indicate I'm dubious of how NE-TS played out and that I'm not at all convinced of the claim or the role given the setup. I didn't focus on it as much as Maxous because I thought Maxous was a pretty good bet for scum, and, as I've said before, I agreed with Rhinox that TS-scum was something we could deal with in LyLo if it got that far.<br><br>Answer me this: why would scum-Locke decide to go all-out bussing TS when the confirmed townie was convinced that TS was town?"}

He doesn't consider TS's 'fluff' to be a scumtell, which suggests that he's simply not very good at reading the game critically, but this suggestion that he's too new to understand half of what's going on comes back to ping my scumdar later.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>TS: What is your view of Oso compared to the other game you two were in?<br></div></blockquote><br>in our last game Oso was town. He seemed town from day 1 and considered all eventualities and possibilities with many of his speculative posts and only when our town read on him began to falter, or when we ran out of viable players for the lynch did we end up lynching oso (we had a claimed watcher and a confirmed townie in myself, so oso became the lynch)<br><br>this is why it didn't surprise me that he included a counter-argument in his reasoning. Oso is just the player to counter the arguments of his critics before they state them I would guess. Of course it could be seen as scummy by some players, as Rhinox interpreted it as. But to me it's just reminiscent of town oso from our last game. As such, i have a town read on oso. But bear in mind it is a volatile read and is subject to change as we're only 4 pages in. The more pages we go through the more accurate our reads should get.<br><br>I hope that answers your question.</div></blockquote><br><br>TS comes across as way too eager to please here and puts far too much effort in stating what is essentially a null-to-town tell with a caveat so that he can change his mind.

This is the second time that Farside pressures TS and then does not back it up with anything; it's more like a warning than substantive pressure to me, which is scummy.

I get cognitive dissonance from the last line; how can he not like Ender's play but not have an opinion on it at the same time? I'm just not buying that he has no opinion at all here.

Your case on Me=Weird doesn't make sense to me either.<br><br>I know some scum will gambit to look town. It's possible ender is scum with a gambit because he's at L-2 that he's hoping for someone to vote so as scum that he could hammer to neuter the claimed vig.

What is with the hmmm on TS then dropping it?</div></blockquote><br><br>The last line from Farside is the first in the line of posts I spotted from her questioning people on a change of attitude towards TS. This becomes a recurring trend throughout D1 and I got the vibe that she was trying to make a point of people having inconsistent attitudes towards TS. Again, this is something that I consider a town-tell on the face of it, but more scummy given the lack of apparent connection between what I believe to be a scumread on TS and her opinion of these other players.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>..<br>i can see a theme in this game, that everything is one-shot :/</div></blockquote><br><br>Where did you get that idea from?

One-shot cop.</div></blockquote><br>I would say I don't know what to think of that except I do. I think it smells. If scum, he only has to sell one innocent that can easily be killed later.

Points to scum or, oddly enough, town protecting a power role.<br><br>But the way he has been playing: Vote hopping. Very little reasoning or thinking at all, behind his votes. He's mainly been reacting rather than acting.....<br><br>If I can fit his play into his role, then I will unvote but that is going to take a re-read that I'll do during the day or after work.</div></blockquote><br><br>First part from Oso is town points in my book. Several players skip over TS saying this, but Oso calls him out on this and it gives me an impression of genuine suspicion as to where he got this information. Granted, this could come from scum wondering what the hell TS is talking about, but I just find bringing it up alone to be pro-town.<br><br>Second part is not so good as we get a stack more fence-sitting. So Ender could be telling the truth or fake-claiming. Congratulations for stating the obvious and contributing absolutely nothing conclusive at all to the discussion in the same post, Oso. Yeah, maybe this is town just trying to make up their mind, but given that it's not the first or last time in which Oso provides relatively detailed comment with no conclusion, standing back and waiting as other people take stances wins quite a few scumpoints from me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I suggest we park a noose around Twistedscum's neck.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed.<br><br>---<br>@Maxous: PATIENCE! lets take care of obv scum twistedspoon first, then we can work out which one of {<strike>Javert</strike>, Oso, farside22, Me=Weird, Necessary Evil} were scum on the easy to wagon ender.

This post makes me realise that never have I given a player so much towncred despite the fact (or maybe because) they've done so many anti-town things. Let's break this down:<br><br>1. Prosaurus defends TS by <span style=\"font-style: italic\">saying they've been about equally useless.</span> This is the kind of comment that makes me wonder why someone would play mafia. The only reason he gets townpoints for this is because he's basically saying he's as good a vig target as TS, and that's somewhat diminished with TS flipping RB.<br>2. So Prosaurus has no real scumhunting or scumreads for pages on end and now he's identified a whole scumteam? What I don't like about this is that instead of focusing on the point Rhinox makes (which is a good one about an easy wagon), he decides that Rhinox is now scummy with two other people. <br>3.

He was vote parking on Maxous earlier too, and he's already looking like he's vote parking on NE. I suggest we park a noose around Twistedscum's neck.</div></blockquote><br>Why would I want to attack javert? Maxous was an RVs vote; better than voting for the mod like some of you guys thought it'd be clever to do  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> <br>vote parking on NE?

He also seems dubious about NE's 'good game' comment, but isn't really committal about whether he finds it scummy. Important distinction here, as his vote is parked on NE without any scumhunting, but he casts doubt on multiple other players (including Javert with the possibility of a scum dayvig!!). Calls Oso's points 'goodposting'. +1 to Oso. TS clearly thinks the best way to play scum is to bus your buddies, or at least appear mildly antagonistic to them throughout the game. I don't think he says one complimentary thing about NE's play the entire game. Complimenting Oso's play seems out of character if Oso is TS's buddy.<br><br>The other thing to take away from this is that TS still casts some doubt on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the other player who claimed 1-shot cop.</span> This does lend weight to the theory that TS is an awful scum player. Getting Ender lynched or killed was never going to make people view TS as townier, and he should have known it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>Pro - newb town - ugh so many things I want to say and put my IC hat on about.<br><br>First voting even anyone for any reason is good.

First of all, Farside continues that trend I stated earlier about pointing out things people have done in relation to TS; here, it's Rhinox singling out TS over EA. This is where I start to get the impression that Farside is trying to tie people to TS; the problem is, I can't tell whether she's doing it from a town or scum perspective. The subsequent vote on TS certainly suggests that it's from a town perspective; the problem is that TS is being truly awful. His contributions are repeatedly vote-worthy, and Farside states as much. If it was more of a marginal situation and Farside was picking out TS, I'd be leaning strong town here. The fact is that TS is scumming up the thread with most of his reactions and is not doing any scumhunting on his number one scumread, which diminishes the power of this vote to give me a townread. I'm still giving Farside some towncred for this, though; the fact is that she's pushing on the mafia roleblocker on D1 with a vig kill around, and she even advocates Oso to vote him in her next post. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>EBWOP: Forgot. @Farside, I'll take at look at TS. I haven't paid any attention to him so far this game.</div></blockquote><br><br>Mild townpoints for Oso. Not paying attention to TS is scummy. Admitting you haven't paid attention to TS draws other people's attention to the fact that you're ignoring a scummy player, and with a vig kill around that's a doubly risky thing to do.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>@TA. You can consider yourself at L-1 if you wish. I'd vote if we didn't have the question of Javert right now.<br><br>(As an aside, I checked.

Bogus reason. NE maybe wasn't posting as much as others (he[NE] even indicates as much)  but his posts generally have content in them. They aren't fluff posts and he isn't posting just to keep his name active in the thread.<br>4)We are 12 pages and 10 days into the game and you have done absolutely nothing other than just stay active.

He declares intent to put him at L-1 with a post that basically grudgingly admits that everyone has been right about all the terrible things in TS's play. I read it again and again and it just sounds more like a coaching post. All four of these things indicate what TS would need to do in order to move himself back out of the scum category, and frankly, when reading this, it's hard to imagine just why Oso would have missed all of this. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>..<br>There is something off between Rhinox, Erratus and Ender. Having a CC for Ender means his period of grace is over.<br>Unvote<br>vote:Ender241<br>..<br></div></blockquote><br>Not that I disagree completely, I had and have some reservations about Ender BUT, how do you figure that TS's role is a direct counter-claim to Ender? I mean, they are identical but if the post of TS's you pointed out is a correct assumption based on what TS already knew about the set-up(his role). Having 2:1-Shot Cops isn't a real stretch.<br><br>I'd like more input on how Ender is automatically more scummy than TS because if you disregard their claims, both don't look very good but TS wins in the \"scummiest\" category hands down.<br><br>Point being, if you give TS a pass based on role alone, then you pretty much have to do the same with ender.

Or do you have references you can use to at least give us an idea of why you think the interactions between the three are off.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think I'm leaning town on this post because Oso basically points out to Maxous that if he's going to suspect either of the cop claims, it should be TS, not Ender, given that TS is far scummier.

The last couple of lines ping my scumdar again, though. It's such a cop-out '1 of these 3 are scum' type comment that makes absolutely no commitment whatsoever to who might be lying, and I've seen these many times from scum as an excuse for a contribution that involves no analytical effort.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Klazam wrote:</cite>Javert: Fair enough. <br><br>Let me be on record saying that i believe all three claims (D-Vig, and cops) that has been made today. <br><br>Also: <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote vote Prosaurus</span> I no longer feel sure that M=W is scum.

If Farside is scum, she'd know TS was bluffing, and making statements like this would lead to the finger being pointed at TS as soon as Ender flipped. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>EA: Why are you ignoring Klaz who is pretty much doing next to nothing when it comes his reasoning?

His reason's for voting for Pro was for role fishing but he doesn't say anything about TS who was doing the same thing.

So now this is where I'm getting a bad vibe. The only reason that makes sense is if Farside thinks Klazam has a reason to treat those two players differently. Either she thinks he's over-focused on Pro because they're buddies, or he's ignoring TS because they're buddies. There's no exploration of either here. Then we move on to Oso, where again there's an implication that Oso's read on TS changed because he was getting wagoned. You can't downgrade TS to second suspect and then continue to push on people for their attitude towards him. That's the kind of thing you do after a flip, not before. The attitude reeks of knowing TS is scum already. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>farside wrote:</cite>..<br>@Oso: I can ask you the same.

This attitude makes sense as town; if you're going to give one a chance to prove themselves, you do it for both. The problem is, it's a really easy out as scum.

I don't entirely approve of the ender kill.<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2944367#p2944367\" class=\"postlink\">Post #244:</a> Klazam attacked me and prosaurus for \"role-fishing\". Scum often look for townies doing common \"scumtells\" that are so widely known, scum don't actually do anymore. And thus useless as scum-tells.<br>This, combined with not providing much reasoning for his votes, lots of short, content sparse posts and scum vibes, makes me think he's scum. He seems like the most likely of my scumspects to get lynched, and I don't like wasting my vote, so<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote: Klazam</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Also he made a case on NE <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2940096#p2940096\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> but NE never stated it was rediculous and when he had stated something about Ender it was during the RVS discussion.<br>Finally he is attack on Pro looks scummy as I feel Pro is newb asking question and trying to figure things out but he spins it more into something scummy.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Me=Weird</span><br><br>In short I find MW and NE scummy for different reasons. I find MW's post more scummy as I see him pushing on easy lynches and following BW without much reason.</div></blockquote><br><br>Farside's choice of vote at the end of the day. You can see my thoughts on this in a previous ISO; the quick version is that Farside overplays the NE suspicion in the summary, which doesn't match the content of the post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>prosaurus and Oso are wildcards for me today. I'll give them a pass<br>The masons are forever unlynchable until proven otherwise<br>Javert gets a pass for the unlikelihood of a scum day vig in a mini normal. However I want to see him post again<br>NE and MW are the only remainders that i don't have town reads on. I'll live with one of their lynches today. I might later switch to him if his lynch becomes more feasible, but I'll stick with NE for the timebeing</div></blockquote><br><br>Not sure what TS means by 'wildcards' here, but it sure as hell pings my scumdar that he decides to excuse both of them based on nothing at all. -1 to both.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>NE wrote:</cite>I don't expect everybody to understand why I suspect MW.

It was quite obviously D1 analysis and the conclusions are based on what I saw from D1. I believe that was clear, and I believe it answers a lot of your queries in itself. I'd rather not rehash the whole issue of changing my mind, so I'll just say this: if I see something in my rereads that makes me change my opinion of a slot, I'm going to be honest about it. Now, the more specific points:<br><br>On Prosaurus: I did not realise just how much Prosaurus completely avoided TS until I read back. You can see even from the posts I quoted that while there's plenty of focus on TS from other members of the town, Pro is not addressing him in the slightest. If you read it in its entirety it's even more stark. One of the main purposes of reading back is to review posts in the light of flips. So yeah, it makes me more uncertain about Pro's slot, because TS was really scumming up the thread and Pro was just ignoring it. I also don't remember saying that their avoidance made them almost certainly not partners, so I'm not sure why this is your starting point anyway.<br><br>On Farside: yep, I believed that TS was not so bad at mafia that he would fail to hammer even after being directly told earlier in the day how many votes it was to lynch, and with a votecount on the same page. My instinct when I came back and saw the hammer was that it was for show because it was so unnecessarily clunky and stupid in a situation where he had no need to do it. The logical progression of that is a TS-FS team, and that's what I was thinking when I started the day. Reading D1 again, I found Farside's approach to TS to be more pro-town than either of the other slots, a view which was reflected in my analysis. <br><br>On Oso:<br><br>1. I'm saying that Oso acted like he would still be willing to lynch one of the claimed 1-shot cops when he was stalling his M=W vote. Then one of them was killed and he came out vehemently against the idea of lynching TS. He gave no indication that he strongly believed both were town; I think the closest he got was saying he 'hoped' that both were telling the truth. So why did this change with Ender's flip? I've made the point once, but I'll say it again: Oso should have voted M=W when his vote was 'pending'. His reaction to the kill of insisting that TS should not be lynched doesn't match with his attitude prior to the kill. Therefore I think he was stalling for time when he was 'pending' his vote and he never genuinely believed that the cop claims should be left alive; he just wanted to wait and see how it panned out so that he wasn't seen to be coming out too strongly in TS's favour if TS got vigged. To put it briefly; Oso pretends that his attitude after the kill is consistent with his attitude before, and it's not. That's scummy.<br><br>2. My stance is that your slot is a lot more likely to be scum than I thought at the start of the day. The NE interactions redeem it somewhat, but the TS interactions are all kinds of scummy. That clear enough for you?<br><br>Will work on D2 tonight and tomorrow, if I don't get it done tonight."}

Either way, you've got to be thinking that any scumteam would have at least a couple of PRs to counteract those. I'd expect a Godfather with the two cops, so what else is there if not a blocker?

I would disagree with you believing his push on TS yesterday was big. He had limited options towards who he could push against due to players suspecting Pros/Myself and you to a degree minimally.

Am I always explicit about everything I'm thinking? Sometimes I like to see what people say without spelling out what I'm looking for. The point to post 9 is that quote was scummy. I read it and I thought 'wow, TS sure looks like he knows Javert is vig and he's doing a terrible job at hiding it'. <br><br>I have already explained why I didn't focus on TS, but apparently I have to say it again. First, I was pretty confident that Maxous was scum. Second, I was swayed by this from Rhinox:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>Why are we even talking about TS today? We shouldm't even be considering lynching him today. If he's still alive in LyLo, then we can argue whether or not he's scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>So yeah, I went after TS D4 instead of D3. I had a good case on Maxous on D3 and at that stage, the TS-NE situation was still buying TS enough towncred for me to second-guess my suspicions enough. That's why Rhinox's point hit home with me. <br><br>As for my vote...if you're town and you're seriously pushing that then I have no words to adequately express my frustration. I pushed TS about that statement because the way he tried to pretend he didn't remember was incredibly scummy. If you don't believe that then you need to read the game better. The more I read of his play, the more I thought he was scum and the less I believed that his 'guilty' was legit. So when he came out pretending that he was trying to pull some kind of gambit with you with a thought process that was quite clearly a lie, yeah, it pushed me over the edge into voting him. So it wasn't a weak reason, and I was quite obviously already leaning towards voting TS from what I'd found from NE's ISO and my previous concerns. Do I have to state every single reason for voting someone in a single post? No. You're capable of reading my play and realising that not only did I have multiple reasons to suspect TS, but my reason for voting him <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in that post</span> is also much stronger than you're suggesting, so calling this vote weak is utter nonsense. <br><br>I could go back to why I didn't bring up the points against TS the day before, but it's not obvious by now then I'm just going to walk away from this game because I really can't deal with any more frustration.<br><br>Finally, I didn't vote for you yesterday. I was still second-guessing myself about TS, largely because Quilford was so mindlessly insisting that TS was town every time I brought up why he was scummy. <br><br>Duplicity: guess what? I don't know who's scum. If you've got a much higher level of certainty about that than me then you're either seeing something I'm not, or you're scum. So if you're forcing me to draw a conclusion, I believe the D1 analysis leads you to be scum. But no, I'm not by any means certain in that. If I was picking whose play is just straight-up scummiest on the face of it without factoring in connections, I'd say Prosaurus. I am most confident in Farside being town. That's all based on the D1 play. Is that clear enough for you, or are you expecting me to definitively know who's scum?<br><br>If I hear this 'why didn't you mention it earlier?' argument once more, I am going to break my computer. First off, I was a replacement in this game anyway, so I was always catching up. Secondly, you don't always spot things the first time through. Sometimes it takes reading it in the right context to notice something at all. Thirdly, Twistedspoon didn't flip until yesterday. So yeah, I didn't go back through the game checking all the connections between every player who hadn't yet flipped. Fourthly, I'm very clear about what I find scummy in Oso's attitude, and it's that he states refusal to lynch the claims but adopts this attitude more strongly <span style=\"font-style: italic\">once one of the two is already dead</span>. It doesn't make sense. Finally,  yes, I have not bothered to make a case on myself by reading back EA's interactions with TS. Do you want me to do that? Do you think it would be useful? No, that would be stupid. As is bringing it up. <br><br>Prosaurus: you're killing me.<br><br>There are so many more things I want to say but I don't think it would be productive to express my anger more vehemently. So I'll say this. Two of you are town. That means you really have no excuse to bring up points like 'why didn't you mention this earlier?' and continuously misrep my posts and arguments. You're so certain that I'm scum? Vote for me. At least then I won't have to spend hours reviewing the rest of the game just for people to misrepresent my points and claim that I'm not being conclusive enough.<br><br>I'll be back when I've calmed down."}

The entire point of doing an anaylsis is to gain a better view of the occurances of the game leading towards an increased likelihood to make a decision. Your post where you state your thoughts about the anaylsis had near-none of this.

I don't expect you to attempt to create a case against yourself over EA's reactions to TS either however you're strongly attempting to push the point Oso suspected TS at point 1, but not at point 2 while ignoring the same actions were shared by nearly the entire room with notable players include doing so including EA, Juls and Maxous.<br><br>Pros, again I urge you to provide more content, I have a good feeling I know where you're standing right now in the game however the lack of content you're providing in this game is immensely frustrating - I'm not asking you to replace out because it would be fruitless this late in the game however re-read the game and state what your scum-read on LL is based around with the exception of process of elimination."}

I'm just getting very frustrated with the state of this game and the fact that I really don't believe I'm a plausible buddy for TS, nor do I think my play has been anti-town. Prosaurus is not helping either. Anyway, I'll try to tone it down.<br><br>Duplicity: I don't believe in bringing my personal schedule into things, so suffice it to say that I wasn't around the weekend before or the day of the flip, and I also had another game in day that I needed to catch up on because of that absence when I did have some time to get online. So yes, I came back, read the 'hammer' and thought 'there's no way TS can be THAT bad, surely Farside is scum'. I didn't have the time to put into more detailed analysis of Farside-TS connections at that stage. <br><br>So as for things not being brought up earlier: flips change context. Yes, by the end of yesterday I was confident that TS was scum. That doesn't mean I read through the game in detail looking for connections to his slot prior to that.<br><br>I understand that Oso bought TS's '1-shot theme'. Here's my issue. Oso has a scumlist of M=W, Ender and TS. He claims that he is categorically against lynching Ender and TS, with a justification that I have no problem with and yes, is why EA also bought TS's claim. My problem is that M=W is his number one suspect with two players that he has said he doesn't want to lynch, so there's no need to stall his vote. In fact, if he wants to make sure that neither claim gets lynched, he should be pushing M=W's wagon and arguing more strongly that killing the claims is a bad idea (which he doesn't do, when Javert still has his shot). The stall before the vigging followed by the vote after does not sit right with me. Perhaps the timing is just unfortunate on his part. I just don't like the way he's cagey about it until after Javert has used his shot, and the response to Ender's death doesn't look like a logical thought progression. He does admit that he is modifying his voting reasons because there's obviously not an Ender-M=W connection.<br><br>Farside: by the time I actually got the chance to read the game, NE had already flipped scum. The first thing I did was to look over the immediate reactions to the guilty result and see who pinged my scumdar. Maxous' stall looked like he didn't really believe that NE was town; he was very much just buying some time. The rest of Maxous' response to the day bore out my scum-read. He claimed he was leaning NE-scum for most of the day, but there was no indication of that in his posts at all. It was very much fence-sitting and waiting to see which way the town would go. He does argue that TS is likely town at L-2 but that's very much again an absence of scumhunting in favour of discrediting the lynch. If TS had been lynched before Maxous then I might well be here arguing why Maxous is scum with the both of them now.<br><br>As for answering a question without having all the information in front of me, I must have done that hundreds of times playing mafia. I'm not even sure what question you're referring to here. I've never seen a player who's 100% aware of every post made in the thread and all the possible connections between players at one time. You yourself have admitted you tend to tunnel on suspects at times. So I answer questions when I don't know everything there is to know because otherwise this game would be an endless sequence of players stalling because they're not 100% informed. If I have a read, I state it. I don't let a read stop me from reading back and confirming or changing what I think. <br><br>Going to look again at the 'guilty' situation and see if I can get some clarity."}

Given that he already pulled one ridiculous gambit, I'm unconvinced that this is an honest mistake.

If Oso makes a more forceful argument for not shooting either of the claims, then he's a) dissuading Javert from shooting Ender, who scum-Oso would know is a 1-shot cop; and b) making himself the target of more suspicion if Javert were to shoot TS. I guess what I'm trying to say is it looks too safe. He doesn't want to commit to a course of action, which, given the threat of an imminent kill, I think is a scum mindset."}

States a town read on both Farside and Rhinox. <br><br>602 - Duplicity's (Regfan) catch-up. Leans town on NE due to interactions, strongly believes that TS is scum. <br><br>Analysis:<br> <br>Farside. The early vote looks like a bus but then the about-turn onto TS's wagon looks more genuine and is based on strong reasoning. I also maintain that scum can't be sure that there isn't another town PR they need to block, so changing her mind and voting for the blocker is significant to me. NE also suggests Farside is a little scummy here which slightly reinforces my townread, as does TS very simply stating a townread - this is incompatible with the way TS has senselessly bussed NE all game long. Once again, I find myself saying that if it's a bus, it's definitely the most pro-town looking reaction of the three. <br><br>Duplicity. Unfortunately, the replacement means that Dup completely misses the early part of the day and so we do not get to see their response until a couple of days after the claim. The catch-up also comes at a point where voting would not be a good idea, so the scumread on TS gives me a slight town lean, but I can't draw much more from this. <br><br>Prosaurus. I'm battling with two instincts here. One is that unless TS decided to do this on a whim without telling his buddies, Prosaurus would almost certainly have been told by NE and TS that this was going to happen, and that he should pick a side and react accordingly. His bizarre response of basically still focusing on EA is not what I would expect from someone who had been told 'you need to bus tomorrow'. His question about two scumteams also doesn't do NE and TS any favours if he is buddies with them. The contrast is that his reaction is not at all pro-town. He fence-sits, he advocates caution instead of providing analytical content, he suggest a mild scum lean on NE but no more than that, which is weird in a 50-50 situation, and he still tries to tie EA to NE instead of focusing on the matter at hand. The other thing that gives me pause about excusing him for his reaction is that we're willing to write him off as bad town. So why do we think he'd have to be good scum? Part of me thinks NE and TS could have said 'we're faking a guilty tomorrow' and he has absolutely no idea what to do about it. He can't fake suspecting his buddies at all. He certainly can't scumhunt, so I'm less inclined to believe he's town just because he doesn't exhibit anything that scum would do in this situation, because he also hasn't been doing things we'd expect town to do. They might even have said 'continue to play as you're playing' because it had enough people believing he was town as it was. This is yet another case of Prosaurus not fitting the profile of expected scum reaction but still somehow managing to play as anti-town as possible.<br><br>Short version for Duplicity: Prosaurus is scum."}

First, Farside. This comes right at the end of D3 as NE is about to be lynched:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>Here's my problem. TS's claim comes after Jav's claim (the one shot isn't there but again one shot day vig is pretty normal) and right as ender starts to claim. <br>I also have a hard time believing in 2 one shot cops. I never have seen it and unless scum have a RB and GF or some power roles to off set that I have more trouble believing it.<br>He now has a guilty on NE (who he suspected most of day 1). Framer for scum? It's possible but I don't like TS's actions. Dup brings up a possible bus. <br>I could see this as TS trying to earn town cred by bussing his scum buddy. Then having to explain why he is still alive as the days go on put him into a trap. I don't know I would think TS scum would be smart enough to get an innocent on another player then bussing and leaving no outs.<br>It just doesn't make sense.<br>Call me paranoid in small part to a current game.<br><br>Welcome LL you would know what game that is in reference to.</div></blockquote><br><br>This undermines the whole point of having NE and TS bus in the first place. As a parting shot before the lynch, it damages any towncred TS might have built up from it. This is particularly pertinent given that the likes of Quilford and Rhinox were insistent that TS was town.<br><br>Next up, Duplicity on D3 after Rhinox reacts angrily to the idea that TS might be scum:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TwistedSpoon wrote:</cite> small question, but how does another power role claiming mean that you'll finally believe me? </div></blockquote><br>It does in fact the opposite, if there's another power-role claim I would believe your claim less, however if there were no other power-role claims I would have to rethink my overview on the game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite> Anybody who thinks TS is scum better have a damn good reason other than a baseless accusation that they were bussing. Come up with a reasonable explaination for why the hell they would do that? </div></blockquote><br>I'm not saying that I fully believe he bussed, becuase G and I are still considering everything we've read but I will say there is definte advantages towards bussing. It's not a \"baseless accustation\".<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Here are reasons why bussing woiuld be advantagous for TwistedSpoon:</span><br>1. Throughout day one there was a high amount of suspicion cast towards TwistedSpoon meaning the likelyhood that he were to be lynched on day two were massive. If he facts a guilty on his partner one of the two following situations occur:<br>1a. Twisted gets lynched NE looks town in comparison and thus can breeze throughout the rest of the game.<br>1b. NE gets lynched and town believe Twisted to be legitimate as proven via your own words.<br><br>2. Bussing a vanilla mafia means that mafia keep their power-roles while allowing themselves to get onto the NE lynch quite early making them all look good in future days.<br><br>3. NE was already highly suspected, therefore guiltiing him just moves the chances that he were to get lynched at some point in the game from highly likely to certain.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, not seeing why scum would waste any towncred that TS had built up by giving good reasons why he could still be scum with NE. It's not like people are pushing for a TS lynch; at this stage Maxous is voting for Farside, Rhinox is adamant that TS is town and no-one else has given any indication that they think TS is likely scum. So I'm finding it hard to believe that either Farside or Dup are scum with TS and NE because they both undermine the point of pulling the guilty gambit. Leaning very strongly towards Prosaurus-scum right now. More to come in the next 24 hours."}

This means the entire point of the buss would be to attain town-cred and that would be the only reason to do it, if this was the reason why did Pros refrain from voting himself.

We'll come back to this later.<br><br>The next quote is probably going to be dismissed as WIFOM, but I think it's worth bringing up:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite> if another power-role were to claim during the mass-claim it would shed some light onto the likelyhood of TS's legitimacy.</div></blockquote><br>small question, but how does another power role claiming mean that you'll finally believe me?<br><br>However, I do agree that both scum must have been on the NE wagon for NE to self hammer, otherwise NE would have let his partner hammer to gain townie cred<blockquote><div><cite>Locke Lamora wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Maxous</span><br></div></blockquote><br>so why maxous?<br><br>as for massclaim, I'm fine with it, but I don't think It's really my choice since I've already claimed :/<br><br>Massclaim seems a good idea since if we lynch town today, we're in MyLo tommorow. Remember that</div></blockquote><br><br>So TS suggests that both scum were on the NE wagon. One of those was obviously him. For the record, the others were Rhinox, Erratus Apathos, Quilford, Maxous and NE himself. So I personally know for a fact that TS was lying here (disregarding the fact that NE himself was on the wagon). The rest of you can make your own mind up.<br><br>TS with a minor comment about Farside here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>Ugh, nyan cat :/<br></div></blockquote><br>:3<br><br>yeah, Farside would be a fair lynch but massclaim would be nice too</div></blockquote><br><br>TS has basically been pushing suspicion on Pro based on the daytalk comment for most of the day so this little indication that he'd be willing to lynch Farside sends me in circles. On one hand it looks like he's setting himself up to switch to a Farside lynch if necessary, but on the other this is very reminiscent of his attitude towards NE; basically saying that he'd back the lynch but with absolutely no scumhunting behind it.<br><br>A complaint from TS here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Regfan wrote:</cite>I don't think they'd have expected people would discuss or believe the likelyhood of a buss, thus them doing it is optimal. </div></blockquote><br>but you're doing it now, no :/</div></blockquote><br><br>This one reads as though TS is annoyed that his bus has not worked because some people still think he's scum. Townpoints to Duplicity.<br><br>Here's where it starts to get interesting with TS and Pro:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>Err... Why am I so scummy for think scum have daytalk?</div></blockquote><br>cause it could have been a slip since scum don't usually have dayttalk and there was no reason to think they did :/<br><br>eh, or maybe you're just misinformed.</div></blockquote><br><br>TS suddenly does an about-turn on his suspicion by throwing in that 'misinformed' comment here. This completely undermines the push that TS made on Pro in the first place and makes it look very fake.<br><br>Couple of interesting things here from Duplicity:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite>Prosaurus is town, towny town town. In this instance him thinking scum have daytalk is more likely a townslip than a scumslip. Standard site practice from what I've observed in my short time here is that scum typically do not have daytalk, therefore I assume it as the default for this game which means Prosaurus is likely to be mistaken about scum having daytalk and therefore town, this is in addition to all the other reasons to think he's town which have been discussed already. He is town.<br><br>There are a few reasons to think Twisted might have been bussing NE, I still think that the setup seems to be fairly broken if there's really a town 1-shot dayvig, two masons, AND two 1-shot cops and I can explain the numbers regarding why if there's questions. There's him being locked in a claim, there's the towncred that would come from that bus. But at the same time, I look at his day 1 interactions with NE and it doesn't really look like they were bussing to me. I'd file him as possible but unlikely scum at this point.<br><br>haven't really caught up on thread, was leaning town on rhinox, scum on farside, unsure on maxous, and had some bad doubts about EA. If farside is scum I don't think she's scum with twistedspoon, though.<br><br>-gorilla</div></blockquote><br><br>First of all, I think the insistence that Prosaurus is town is outlined in a manner that suggests a townie mentality. It seems like a legitimate, honest analysis of what Pro's mindset could have been when making that comment. Secondly, we again return to spoiling the whole point of TS bussing NE. It's not as strong here, but this is just continuing to wipe out all the towncred TS built up despite Quilford's refusal to consider he could be anything other than town being the perfect excuse to ease off on TS.<br><br>More TS 'reads':<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>I was a bit surprised he was'nt roleblocked though.</div></blockquote><br>so was I tbh<br>maybe they puposely ddn't roleblock me for this exact reason; so that you'd think this way<br><br>other than that I have no idea unless mafia don't have a roleblocker or the mafia roleblocker was roleblocked by a town roleblocker or something...  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>@Twistedspoon and Prosaurus: Number one suspect for mafia please. ^_^</div></blockquote><br>tbh, I really don't know :/<br>I spent much of my time tunneling on NE that i'm outdated slightly with the rest.<br>Farside would be a reasonable lynch I guess. It looked as she was trying to protect NE in D2. :/</div></blockquote><br><br>You can tell this is like pulling teeth. Now he's moved off Prosaurus completely; he doesn't even mention the daytalk thing. He cites his Farside suspicion again and actually gives a reason this time. He's definitely edging towards what he thinks is the most likely lynch here; townpoints for Farside, scum for Prosaurus.<br><br>TS steps it up by voting:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>His play is lackluster to say the least. </div></blockquote><br>How can you say my play is bad after I investigated one of the mafioso?<br><br>Clearly that's bad for you.<br><br>Gentlemen, methinks we have our second scum<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Farside</span></div></blockquote><br><br>This is an awful, awful reason for a vote and is not actually based on Farside being scummy at all. This is the third vote on the wagon and looks like a scummy hop with any justification TS can think of. <br><br>Next up, TS defends Maxous:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>Maxous is prob-town to myself<br><br>course at times like this I wish I had another investigation<br><br>@Quilly: any news from yourself? I want to hear from our confirmed townie</div></blockquote><br><br>Not sure why TS would be firmly on the side of Maxous-town unless he thought he already had a mislynch lined up in Farside as well. There were ample opportunities to back the Maxous wagon and none of his play would really have prevented him from doing so.<br><br>Some Farside-TS interactions:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>Questions to Rhinox:<br><br>What changed your mind from this post<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>I'm just slightly reluctant though.

I don't care what your claim is now. This post is scummy as hell. You're scum and I want you lynched regardless of your claim.</div></blockquote><br><br>and this thought <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>ugh, I need to reread and figure out who my suspects are. Someone asked for a top 3, I don't have that right now. I'm not going to just throw names out as suspects without good reasons.<br><br>I was REALLY hoping Javert was gambiting, and we'd have an alive, confirmed town ender right now based on his reaction to being fake day-killed. As it stands, unless all of our PRs are now outed and scum have a RB and a GF, I'm suspicious of 2 1-shot cops in addition to a day vig. Think about it, if they aren't forced to claim D1, typical scenario would be they could claim results tomorrow, and they'd be 4 confirmed town. If the day vig is also town, they could take out a guilty result on D2, or the scummiest player without ending the day and progressing to night. That seems like a lot of power and a lot of cleared players potentially by day 2.</div></blockquote><br><br>To day 2 believe TS and pushing for NE?<br><br>Maxous: I just reread TS in iso.

Why is he mafia?</div></blockquote><br>well it was mostly a pressure vote. Saying so would kinda defeat the purpose of it though. That and I haven't seen to much towness from him<br></div></blockquote><br><br>After with some questions but no real push he states the following<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>I am convinced by the breadcrumb<br>Oso is still a null read to me though<br><br>NE is already my vote, so I'm cool with keeping it on him (for now at least)<br><br>I was slightly surprised when you claimed masons though.

I might later switch to him if his lynch becomes more feasible, but I'll stick with NE for the timebeing</div></blockquote><br><br>None of this = a case. I never see a reason from TS on why he found NE scum. Rereading him I'm starting to believe scum bussing his scum buddy for town credit more and more.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Twistedspoon</span><br><br>I believe looking at Maxous/Rhinox one of them to be scum with TS.</div></blockquote><br><br>This push on TS comes while Farside is still the leading wagon, so I can see it being for distancing purposes. However, the question to Rhinox looks like inquisitive behaviour from a townie, and Farside's points on TS are all good ones. They'd certainly only serve to reinforce anyone's scum-read on TS, and at this stage of the wagon Farside-scum would know that any distancing is going to be taken with a grain of salt anyway.<br><br>Following on from that vote is this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite>So I did some meta research on TS because I find his play the most scummy. I had to wonder if he was a VI or scum.<br>I noticed in his early games, which to say the least fit confusion and some seriously bad plays to later as he has played games he made cases and looked into things. So I don't believe TS is a VI reading his games.<br>TS: Please explain why you never made a case against NE, when I see clearly in your later games that you have made cases on people, prodded people and made points that a severely lacking in this game.</div></blockquote><br><br>Farside further piles the pressure on TS by providing meta evidence; something that again is based on solid reasoning and just makes TS look scummier.<br><br>Prosaurus posts his PoE reasoning:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>@TS<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">farside22</span><br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Maxous</span></strike> Not as scummy.<br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Twistedspoon</span></strike> Started NE wagon.<br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Duplicity</span></strike> Null, not as scummy as FS<br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Locke Lamora</span></strike> On NE wagon.<br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Quilford</span></strike> Confirmed.<br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Prosaurus</span></strike> That's me.<br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rhinox</span></strike> NE wagon.<br><br>I'd rather you asked my opinions on certain posts, or that kind of thing.

The indication that Pro is incapable of providing his analysis in a situation like this is also increasingly grating on my nerves as I read through. I'm buying the newbie thing less and less and getting the impression that he's just not able to fake scumhunting.<br><br>Another TS-Farside interaction to look at:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>farside22 wrote:</cite> I'm pretty certain TS is scum. He's gone too and posting elsewhere. <br></div></blockquote><br>that's because I'm in other games, obv<br><br>if the only thing you have is that you don't like my vote on you and that I'm posting elsewhere then I'm still very much liking your lynch<br>also, I'm dead in my other mini normal so should have more time for this one. Quilly knows that already though.<br><br>Still liking my farside vote. Other players might be easier to lynch, but I don't think they're the scum. Farside lynch&gt;lynch&gt;no lynch</div></blockquote><br><br>TS seems to be making the point that he's not going for the easy lynch, but Farside has been the leading wagon for much of the day so this strikes me as something of an odd point to make. <br><br>And now we have what may be the scummiest vote in the entire game:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>Since nothing's happening, I'd like to vote Farside.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: farside22</span><br>That's L-1 incase no one's noticed.</div></blockquote><br><br>I mean, really. Nothing's happening so he puts Farside at L-1? This comes after his masterful piece of PoE reasoning that I quoted above. <br><br>Duplicity states their reads near the end of the day:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Maxous wrote:</cite>@Duplicity: Have you explained why I am mafia? I don't remember it.</div></blockquote><br>It's predominanly PoE combined with the fact that you were both G and I's biggest FoS when reading through the thread.<br><br>I'm going to step in here. I'm starting to get town-farside vibes. Rhinox is town. Pros is town. Quildford is town. Locke is likely town. We're lynching Twisted or Maxous today. End of, so I suggest someone moves their vote.</div></blockquote><br><br>Setting up the Maxous-Twisted choice and ruling out Farside-scum seems like a pro-town move here. Would have been much easier to leave the Farside option open rather than argue against it.<br><br>Prosaurus makes his choice:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>@Duplicity If we're lynching either of those two, I say Max. TS got scum lynched, and I don't see why he'd bus(That is scum lynching scum right?).</div></blockquote><br><br>Prosaurus playing the newbie card again here and choosing Max over TS. Nothing too much of note in isolation, but will become relevant later on.<br><br>Duplicity again defends Farside, this time in more detail:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TwistedSpoon wrote:</cite> what has caused to to change you mind so late? </div></blockquote><br>Sure, the recent town-tells I've gotten from farside include:<br>1. Her agreement in the fact that you're mafia, which is something I'm having difficulty shacking, ie. I don't think she'd buss you in this position.<br>2. Her lack of fight in preventing her lynch in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3040970#p3040970\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> post reads as a town-tell, given the situation at the moment.<br>3. I read meta-research like the one shes done in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3032281#p3032281\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> post as a town-tell.<br><blockquote><div><cite>TwistedSpoon wrote:</cite> Also, can I ask you how would scumflips from Maxous or Farside change your reads. </div></blockquote><br>1. Farside scum-flip would lead me to re-read the entire game for a reassesment.<br>2. Maxous scum-flip would lead me to instant vote you tommorow.<br><blockquote><div><cite>TwistedSpoon wrote:</cite> actually, you've changed you maxous read too it seems from my quotes above. what has caused this? </div></blockquote><br>As I previously stated it's mostly PoE related.<br><blockquote><div><cite>TwistedSpoon wrote:</cite> I'll try and get some reads up </div></blockquote><br>Yes. Please. Do. This.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, this is pro-town, solid reasoning and seems genuine.<br><br>interesting post from TS here stating multiple reads:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>hmm your farside town tells do seem somewhat genuine...<br><br>I'm having difficult imaginging Rhinox scum<br>and Unless prosaurus pulled of a very clever newb-town bluff with the daytalk thing, i don't see him flipping scu<br>Quilly is confirmed town<br>Locke is behaving townie enough, I have a better town read on him that I did EA. The slot is probably town. scum wouldn't tunnel as blantantly as EA did anyways I don't think<br>Which leaves me with Duplicity, Farside and Maxous. i remember Juls suspected maxous D1. without going into too much wifom, this could affect my read.<br><br>does anyone object if I try some VCA?</div></blockquote><br><br>Apparently he buys Duplicity's towntells, but not enough to unvote Farside. The Prosaurus daytalk saga takes another twist as he suggests it is very much unlikely that Prosaurus is scum unless his daytalk slip was a 'clever newb-town bluff'. What? Earlier in the day TS was pushing Pro-scum because he thought he might have slipped about daytalk. Now he doesn't think he's scum unless it was a clever, deliberately planned gambit? The fact that TS feels the need to qualify this read with something that isn't true in the first place really pings my scumdar. He has an opportunity to clear Pro based on what others have said about the daytalk comment but he puts in a bizarre caveat that he doesn't even believe.</div></div></div><br><br>On to Day 4:<br><br>TS opens out the day by returning to his Prosaurus suspicion:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite>Rhinox dying over Quilford increases my FoS towards Twistedspoon for the sole purpose of Quilfords strong defence of Twistedspoon, given how yesterday played out I see Rhinox reconisdering his reads entirely because they all were based around Maxous-scum whereas Quilford seemed to believe that Twisted was town regardless of anyone elses allignment or flip.</div></blockquote><br>but why Rhinox? Surely this could apply to anyone but Quilford? I don't really see what you're saying here. anyone but a quilford kill made me scummy? Surely even If I were scum I'd have still killed quilly as he is unlynchable. Please explain<br><br>anyways, the last point I would like to raise is my suspicion of prosaurus. I entirely expected quilly to die tonight, however I think Prosaurus is the player who, due to the least experience, would most likely leave a confirmed townie alive. I don't know, but I'll tell you I'll never forgive you all if prosaurus turns out to be scum after all this time, especially after his daytalk slip which could either be a genuine slip or a scum newb-town gambit<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@mod</span>: was Locke still V/LA during the night phase?</div></blockquote><br><br>What's getting me about this is that by this point, nobody wants to lynch Prosaurus. Quilford clearly doesn't, Duplicity has a strong townread on him and Farside and myself are both leaning town on Pro at this point. So why is TS coming out and making a point of his Prosaurus suspicion when he said he doesn't see him flipping scum as recently as the end of D3? I think he's making a point because he's distancing again. TS-scum is apparently obsessed with this as a scum tactic, and there's absolutely no logical reason for him to push a Prosaurus lynch as a mislynch. It would be much more sensible to push a Farside or me lynch because he'd actually get some traction with those. This looks to me like he's very blatantly trying to say 'hey guys, I suspect Prosaurus!'. There's only one reason to do that. <br><br>Couple more nonsense posts about Prosaurus which reinforce my above point. TS actually manages to change his line of attack during these:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Locke Lamora wrote:</cite> Unless you think the scumteam are both inexperienced, in which case you're pointing the finger at yourself.</div></blockquote><br> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I'm an IC <br><br>srsly though, I can't explain why quilly wasn't killed. However I'm still suspicious of prosaurus for that day-talk thing. You've sorta proved my point in a way that everyone but prosaurus is experienced, and so I wouldn't be surprised if they instructed prosaurus to do that daytalk slip thing to look more like newb town who don't understand how scum play and cannot possibly be scum</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>okay...<br>maybe I hadn't thought of the doctor-Quilford thing<br><br>anyways, I'd still like to bring up the Prosaurus-daytalk evidence again.

Someone. <br><br>Duplicity: apparently I have to point this out again. All game we've been saying 'why would Prosaurus-scum do that?' and that we don't see scum motivation from Prosaurus. If he's playing badly, why is the assumption that he's playing badly as town? It's one thing to say 'hey Prosaurus, we're bussing tomorrow'. It's a completely different thing for Prosaurus, who has never played scum before, to actually know what to do in that situation. For some reason we're willing to put his bad play down to clueless town, but we're expecting a higher level of play from Prosaurus if he were to be scum. <br><br>Farside: not only was Prosaurus posting more in that newbie game, he was trying to prod other people into contributing. In this game, the longer it's gone on, the less he's been able to muster an opinion. In the other game he was far more proactive, he actually bothered to comment on the events of the game and he even questioned other players. Here he's been passive to the extreme. <br><br>As for your TS point: what's the reason for the weak push if Prosaurus is town? I've already pointed out how nobody wanted to lynch Pro. Given the state of the game, it makes no sense to keep pushing a line of reasoning that even TS has previously abandoned because it's quite obviously nonsense. <br><br>I really don't know what to think any more. The vast majority of today's action has been me doing all the work reading back and people have just been responding to say why other people can't be scum. Frankly, it's maddening, and I think if anyone was actually analysing the game with any level of objectivity, it would be quite obvious I'm the least likely to be buddies with TS. What are the reasons to lynch me? PoE based on flawed, inconsistent reasoning? The fact that I pushed harder on TS on D4 rather than D3? EA's NE points are the only half-decent thing I've seen brought up against this slot for weeks, and they're completely outweighed by the fact that EA attacked the scum roleblocker with a vig shot in play. As for my play, I don't think I've ever worked this hard as town. I pushed a lynch on TS when a confirmed townie didn't want to lynch him, I've been working hard to figure this game out ever since I got in it and I've put more effort into this situation than all three of you put together. So I'm town, we're screwed and I really hope that EA comes back when it's over to help me rant some more about this game."}

We've had a strong town-read on Pros throughout a large portion of the game, indendant of Twistedspoon.

People keep saying 'I've had a townread on X for ages'. That's not a reason in itself. You had a town read on me earlier in the game, and now you don't. Quilford had a townread on TS for virtually the entire time he was in the game, and it was dead wrong. It's as though people are refusing to consider Pro as scum just because they didn't think he was scum earlier in the game. Why don't people think he's scum? Because he's played cluelessly, he's not manipulative, he doesn't look as though he has any scum motivation. Because he says things that you think scum would never say. Because he doesn't do what you'd expect scum to do e.g. bus NE or TS on D2. All of these things are based on one idea: that Pro would actually know how to play scum. And the more I read the game, the more I wonder why Prosaurus can't just be clueless scum. <br><br>I acknowledged that Gorilla had put forward some reasoning that actually makes a case. I believe we covered some of this previously in the game when Rhinox brought it up. I see where he's coming from with NE. I really don't buy that EA continuing to push on TS after everyone else has jumped off is a scumtell. EA's not stupid. If he was scum with 'inside information', he's not going to keep pushing on his buddy when he has a great opportunity to unvote. EA pushed that wagon, and he pushed it hard. What Gorilla's essentially saying here is that he treated NE and TS completely differently; that he made a weak vote on NE and backed down quickly, but led the TS wagon and refused to unvote even when everyone else was backing off. So I don't see how both things are compatible with Gorilla's idea of scum interactions. It seems to me he's having it both ways.<br><br>There's also one point that I highly disagree with in his analysis of D2; the idea that scum would know they'd 'look good' regardless of which wagon they backed. Bussing NE was worthless on D2. Once a cop claims a guilty on someone, you don't get towncred for being on that wagon. The very fact that he wants to lynch me is proof that an NE vote on D2 would be completely redundant for the sake of bussing. TS was the only one who got any towncred from being on that wagon, and several players were still seriously considering him as scum after his flip. As for not directly arguing with EA...I can't even begin to describe how contradictory this is to the idea that scum came out of the gate planning to bus.<br><br>What about my question to Farside? Why did TS start D4 by going back on himself and saying 'hey guys, Prosaurus might still have slipped' when it was obvious that no-one was going to lynch him based on that? What's the motivation for doing that if Prosaurus is town?"}

If it's only one of them it's good for scum because then a townie will be lynched if they're caught.</div></blockquote><br><br>So now he goes from not having any thoughts on the NK from actually using it to point at me and Farside.<br><br>Another post that reinforces my Duplicity read:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite>Unfortunatly I don't have the time needed to fully go into the case at the current moment however I will briefly go into what I came across in my re-read and what I discussed with G.  There was an incident about half way through day one that everyone has seemed to have forgotten.<br><br>This incident involved EA believing that Farside was editing and manipulating her posts and occured in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2934156#p2934156\" class=\"postlink\">Post #147</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2934198#p2934198\" class=\"postlink\">Post #149</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2934202#p2934202\" class=\"postlink\">Post #150</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2934764#p2934764\" class=\"postlink\">Post #156</a>. I don't see EA screenshotting his partners posts and stating it openely in the thread with knowledge that it could potentially lead towards Farsides mod-kill and a major inconvienance towards his scum-team. This means I don't see any possible way that Farside can be scum with LL. Considering that the only thing G and I both agree upon is our solid town read on Prosarus this means that Twistedspoon absouletly has to be mafia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: Twistedspoon </span><br><br>I'm incredibly comfortable with this vote, excluding the fact that he's essentially confirmed mafia via PoE (Process of Elimination) he is also attempting to skeet his way through this day without actually attempting to do any scumhunting. He himself has stated that he believes Pros is mafia, quite strongly actually however has not once attempted to convince anyone of this nor has he attempted to state alternate reads he has or what he believes of the fact that Farside wasn't actually lynched yesterday.<br><br>I believe LL has gone into his linkages and connection with NE enough that I need-not go into it myself but this is all going to come down to whether or not Quilford is willing to reconsider his incorrect read of Twistedspoon or not. If this lynch does go ahead, without meaning to sound arrogant I believe our slot is likely to bite the night-kill tonight meaning I would rather we not rush through this day until I can have another conversation with G about who we believe the other mafia is - He has a strong FoS towards LL however has been unable to explain it to me without pointing to a awkward bit of interaction from NE to EA on day one which is close to meaningless as it could have just been a subtle attempt at buddying.</div></blockquote><br><br>The ruling out of the me-Farside team looks as though Duplicity is thinking about connections and possibilities in a very pro-town manner, particularly as it leads directly to a TS vote. I do now note that the 'awkward bit of interaction' is the crux of the case Gorilla made on me, which is amusing in a slightly distressing kind of way.<br><br>That read is reinforced with this response to Quilford:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite>The vote count if anything points towards Farside and my slot rather than LL's so can you explain how that VCA leads you to believe that LL is scum. This  honestly is looking like you attempting to avoid posting reasoning or logic behind your gut-read on LL while also avoiding explaining your town-read on Twisted in greater depth.<br><br>There's no way I can stand back and observe a lynch on anyone other than Twistedspoon occur without you changing my mind in regards to Twisted or presenting a case that I find reasonable towards LL/Farside since I don't see any legitimate way that Pros is scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Duplicity actually tells Quilford that his VCA is wrong and points away from me and towards himself and Farside. Again, it wool have been very easy to go down the path of letting Quilford push my lynch. <br><br>I return to Prosaurus here with some (gasp) actual reads:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>My reads...<br>Dup - Town, given me no reason to suspect him.<br>LL - Scum, read carried over from EA, posted some stuff recently I believe.<br>FS - Scummy, PoE and stuff, think I posted stuff recently as well.<br>TS - Scummy, I reckon he coulda bussed and he seemed to not do much D1 if I remember, he didn't D2 either, but I can at least partly understand that.<br><br>Will look for my recent reads.</div></blockquote><br><br>The one that really bothers me here is that Prosaurus now thinks that TS 'coulda bussed'. If you recall (or even bothered to read) my D3 analysis, Prosaurus explicitly said that he didn't see why TS would bus and strongly implied he didn't think he was scum. Now, with no apparent indication of why, he thinks TS might have been bussing. Is it a coincidence now that half the town want to lynch TS? I think not. It's also posts like these that make me think Pro is playing the lazy newb card a little too strong. Read his recently completed newbie. He goes through post by post at times and comments on things by post number. Here it's 'I think he posted stuff recently'. I think he's deliberately trying to look as though he doesn't know what's going on.<br><br>This one confounds me a little:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>You know what I don't like? TS pushing the least experienced player (Me) to vote LL. If I did that and LL wasn't scum then wouldn't scum quickhammer and town loses? He seems bored, like he just wants the game to hurry up and end. Actually, I don't think LL and TS are both scum, because either scum is voting LL or LL is scum. Does that mean FS is scum with one of those two?</div></blockquote><br><br>This is...actually kinda accurate. I think that's the first time I've read one of Pro's posts and thought that. Prosaurus is obviously feeling pressurised by TS here, and he doesn't like it. The fact that he says it gives me a gut town read. On the flip side, he also states that he doesn't think TS and I are scum together, an opinion that has conveniently disappeared again today.<br><br>Prosaurus challenges again for scummiest post of the game:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prosaurus wrote:</cite>I agree that TS hasn't done much in this game, but neither have I. I'd rather play it safe and lynch FS...</div></blockquote><br><br>So TS has been as useless as Pro, which is an excuse to give him a pass? It's almost as though he's trying to use the towncred he's bought by being spectacularly useless to extend to TS. The 'play it safe' part really bothers me here; it's just opening himself up for an easy wagon hop when he's actually shown no conviction over FS being scum at all - let's not forget that one of the two main points of his case was 'stuff'. Now today he has completely dropped FS, despite the fact that he doesn't seem to understand the implications of TS's 'hammer' and whether it was fake or not, and gone back to me, when he ruled me out just yesterday based on me vs TS.<br><br>And that's about it. If you don't believe me by now, there's not much else I can do. I'll continue to fight my corner until deadline, so if anyone has any more questions etc., fire away."}

From what I remember, I think he did some fairly typical newbie things and I didn't read too much into them as an indicator of his play here. As his game running alongside this was still going for the vast majority of this game, I didn't know his alignment and I also couldn't comment on it anyway even once he flipped. Once the game ended and I could actually use it for context, I looked back at it to see how his play compared, and that was when I noticed big differences, like the post-by-post comments and the effort to actually get the rest of the town to contribute. <br><br>That partly answers the other part of your question. The rest is the fact that lately I've been thinking about scum agendas and the absence of scum intent in actions and the way players direct their suspicions and interact with the town. I've been thinking about this a lot since the /in-vitational where I had to choose between Poro and MoI; Poro played one of the most anti-town games I've seen in a while, while MoI did all the things you'd think town should do. At the end of the day, though, Poro was just a bit clueless; there was actually that point where he completely mixed up who'd replaced who and forgot that I'd been in the game the whole time. He didn't do much pro-town, but there was no evidence of him having a hidden agenda either. <br><br>That was how I was reading Prosaurus here; he has not done a whole lot of pro-town things, but he wasn't doing things that indicated he had hidden motivation behind them either. For example, he didn't seem to be targeting the wagons that benefitted scum most, or bussing when the time was right to buy towncred. There were also moments like not going after me when he had the chance yesterday that seemed very unlike scum; Quilford wanted me lynched, and it would have been easy for Pro to back my wagon because it was actually consistent with his suspicions. Once I read his meta from the game he was playing at the same time here, read his approach and interactions here, and thought more about Pro's mindset as first-time scum, suddenly 'that doesn't make sense as scum' wasn't as much of an excuse any more. If you contextualise it as first-time scum being unsure and playing everything unnecessarily safe, and even being encouraged to do so by his teammates (which is a frustratingly effective strategy for newbie scum), it fits perfectly.

Your reasons were why repeat what others say.<br>scum game lots of details. You posted thoughts on certain post and voted at the time based on those reads.<br>Looking at your game here looks more like the town link you gave me. <br><br>Is there a reason you jump into a game as a replacement and don't really review or why you do review?

What about my other point? Why were you far more active in reading back and commenting on specific posts in the other game, whereas here you have been very passive for quite some time?<br><br>Farside: honestly, I find it can make it difficult to get into a game if you go ahead and try to reread everything in every context when you start, particularly if you replace in a decent amount of time into the game. It's not really something I normally focus on particularly strongly anyway, and I think there are very few players out there who regularly offer a balanced view on the game. Most people have their favourite wagons and particular targets, and I don't see anything wrong with it as a way of playing the game as long as everyone's getting scrutinised one way or another.<br><br>I do find myself more inclined to initial major rereads as scum too; in that scum game I linked, PoE and my predecessor's play had basically made the slot pretty obv-scum. I tried to do a major reread to at least make people have some questions about it.  In another, I replaced into a newbie in endgame as scum and basically used masses of content to sway people off my slot and onto a newb player. As town, I feel less inclined to do that when I replace in. I tend to reread crucial situations and latch on to scummy things I find; hence the Maxous suspicion when I got into the game."}

Too big a risk for scum that early in that game. A true cop would have been targeted by an RB or killed. Even if the killer ended up eating a lynch, if there were a watcher or tracker in the game, still an even trade for scum. Scum can't trade one for one with town but losing a goon in exchange for the cop is something I wouldn't even think about seriously as the likelihood is high that the Tracker or the Watcher is going to have to out themselves in order to get you a lynch esp. if the person making the kill has played at least semi-decently. Even if it costs a goon, the possibility of outright eliminating one PR (a dangerous one at that) and outing a second is too good to pass up despite the risk, in my opinion. You do have the possibility of a Doc save, Watch/Track combo that outs the killer but that brings me to my next...<br><br>The possibility of confirming a Doc/Jail Keeper/Town RB type role(s). You may end up with a No-Kill Night 1 but then you have confirmed a town role that can interfere with your kills. The involuntary no-kill N1 may not be optimal but it comes with a bit more knowledge about town power as compensation.<br><br>To answer your question, in your shoes I would have considered the following as optimal: Claim to have been blocked. You were a scum RB so there is a possibility that later in the game a town PR (this is generic here, not specific to this game) would have had a 'no result' night based on your actions and would have had to confirm that during claim. Puts a town point in your column because now you have a townie also saying they were blocked.<br><br>Next: Sell an innocent. I know I stated I had that problem with Ender's claim (and by association, yours) but there is absolutely no way (like the option above) that it can be proved as false at the time you give the result other than by a player convincing the majority that their gut feeling is accurate.  It was more along the lines of 'be on the lookout'....<br><br>So that you were alive, unblocked and had a guilty result set off all sorts of flags for me. I was on my way out then (I asked for replacement early D2) so I dummied up and didn't say this then <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> I wasn't comfortable posting at all once I knew I was going to replace out.<br><br>But it was interesting to read this (I kept up about once a week) and is one of the better games I been involved in (no matter how briefly) in a while. Thanks to all for that."}

I really hate playing town.<br><br>Duplicity: don't worry about it. It was one of those situations where it's really hard to comprehend why you're getting suspected, but when you think about it, there were valid reasons for everyone to say that. I felt like I'd put up a compelling case on TS in a situation where scum had no reason to do so and so it was personally frustrating for me to find myself as a top suspect when no-one had argued that lynch as forcefully as I had, and I didn't really think I'd done anything scummy either (other than perhaps being too honest about how often my mind changed!). At the end of the day, I kept going round in circles after finding new reasons why you all weren't scum, so I can't blame you for suspecting me."}
