Some of them are so important they're listed here as well, because redundancy is your friend.<br>\n2. Play to win. Most players want to win legitimately, don't ruin their enjoyment by playing against your wincon.<br>\n3. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this thread, don't do it.<br>\n4. Do not quote anywhere any PMs between you and me (including role PMs), or anything else that originated outside of the game thread. This includes PM timestamps and anything else which games the system. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that.<br>\n6. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. I make and edit posts using the <span style=\"color:darkred;font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">ooc</span> tag, please do not use it.<br>\n7. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread or QTs I provide you until I have announced that the game is over.<br>\n8. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n10. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule. It's up to my discretion whether I think you pretended to break or rule or not, so if you're not sure, ask first.<br>\n11. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil. I will have very little tolerance if someone complains about the way you're talking to them.<br>\n12. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n13. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be updated here as well as posted in thread.<br>\n14. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n15. If I happen to not be online but you know the game is over (for example, if scum get a quicklynch in during LyLo), please let me post the final scene before revealing the ending or otherwise discussing the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Voting Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>\n4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Activity Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Prod system: Players who have not posted for 72 hours will be prodded; players who do not post within 36 hours of a prod will be replaced. If you were to be prodded twice over a game Day or thrice over the whole game, you may be replaced at my discretion. If you have declared V/LA, you may be exempted from prods during that time at my discretion.<br>\n2. In the event replacements are necessary, the deadline may be extended at my discretion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Deadlines</div></div><br>\n1. Day will have a deadline of fourteen real life days. <br>\n2. Night will have a deadline of three real life days.<br>\n3. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Game Setup</div></div><br>\nThis game has been approved for normalcy and balance.

His probes are on the mark and he has got some good reactions (JJ pg 1, GF pg 2-3 and bjc pg 3+ - with stabs at myself and Rob W to boot), and has followed up with reasonable insights.

{"number": 179, "id": "5630080", "user": "Lootifer", "user_id": "22968", "content": "Oooh such fun! I see its my turn to stand in front of the GreyICE firing squad.<br>\n<br>\nWell best I start with the promised content before JJ and Grey explode with an overload of group-think (and to be fair I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">did</div> promise material):<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5622814#p5622814\" class=\"postlink\">My problem with Kaboom</a> is primarily due to his suspicion of GF, which is based on my town-read of GF. As a fellow newbie I have gone through his (GF's) exact thought process every time pressure has come on (in fact one such example happened not 5 minutes ago): the temptation to roll over and say \"fuck it\" (see: 36) is a strong one, and him doing so struck me as a genuine, rather than fabricated, reaction. As such Kabooms case, which is fairly elaborate, stood out as odd. The merits of Kaboom vs. GF in my mind were further emphasised by two experienced players coming out and reading town on GF -  I am assuming there's at least <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> genuine town-aligned advice in there.<br>\n<br>\nNext I have a confession: I didn't (at the time) have anything meaningful on FoD. I had a gut feel, and it was to do with \"sheeping\" - I immediately associated sheeping with scum. I have since come to realise that sheeping isn't necessarily scummy behavior, and when you just roll out with it openly you can hardly use that as an argument for scummyness (WIFOM).<br>\n<br>\nSince then I have been getting a gut read building on FoD, but nothing I feel is worth reporting on. And in case you hadn't realised by now I am not very assertive with my early reads: this is an intended passive style, not everyone suits the \"YOU'RE SCUM, DIE MOTHER FUCKER\" style of play.<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least bjc. I am reading him as scum, but unfortunately I think it's 80% to do with being influenced by the cases put forth by other people and 20% my own thought. I kind of see what other people are seeing in his posts, but I am having to admit to myself that I didn't see it first pass. Though 171 is useful: To me that is a good counter example of what I mean as a fabricated example of rolling over and saying \"fuck it\" (cf. GF's genuine version).<br>\n<br>\nNow moving on:<br>\n<br>\nRegarding JJ I really don't feel the need to revise my wariness of him. He posts a lot, and he doesn't seem to have made any scum-slips. But does that really make him Mr Town 2014? I wouldn't have thought so. If anyone deserves a prize for being Mr Town 2014 its you. You have been incessant in your proverbial knives to throats.<br>\n<br>\nSo overall my current status: I would be ok with a lynch on bjc, though i'd be opposed to cutting short the time we have available for further scum-hunting by lynching him immediately. I'd like to see some pressure on Kaboom. I'd oppose lynches on GreyICE and GF, and likely oppose a lynch on JJ (certainly D1 anyway). Anything else isn't worth the paper its written on (apart from my aforementioned dislike/suspicion of Rob W, but as you rightly point out it doesn't look like we'll see him again - if he does come back I would, obviously, like to get some answers).<br>\n<br>\n@ JJ: I don't like to throw out confident town/scum assertions on D1. To me D1 is simply hoping for scum slips and/or using your experience to read players you've played with before. Being analytical and tentative is all I have on D1 since I lack the ability to contribute in other ways.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kaboooooom</span>", "time": "Wed Jan 22, 2014 10:38 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=36986&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "36986"}

Question mark if bjc were to flip town.<br>\n- FoD is not as null, but because he's presumably an alt or experienced with Mafia elsewhere he doesn't have anything I can reference (his one finished game was lol).

As a fellow newbie I have gone through his (GF's) exact thought process every time pressure has come on (in fact one such example happened not 5 minutes ago): the temptation to roll over and say \"fuck it\" (see: 36) is a strong one, and him doing so struck me as a genuine, rather than fabricated, reaction. As such Kabooms case, which is fairly elaborate, stood out as odd. The merits of Kaboom vs. GF in my mind were further emphasised by two experienced players coming out and reading town on GF -  I am assuming there's at least <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> genuine town-aligned advice in there.<br>\n<br>\nNext I have a confession: I didn't (at the time) have anything meaningful on FoD. I had a gut feel, and it was to do with \"sheeping\" - I immediately associated sheeping with scum. I have since come to realise that sheeping isn't necessarily scummy behavior, and when you just roll out with it openly you can hardly use that as an argument for scummyness (WIFOM).<br>\n<br>\nSince then I have been getting a gut read building on FoD, but nothing I feel is worth reporting on. And in case you hadn't realised by now I am not very assertive with my early reads: this is an intended passive style, not everyone suits the \"YOU'RE SCUM, DIE MOTHER FUCKER\" style of play.<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least bjc. I am reading him as scum, but unfortunately I think it's 80% to do with being influenced by the cases put forth by other people and 20% my own thought. I kind of see what other people are seeing in his posts, but I am having to admit to myself that I didn't see it first pass. Though 171 is useful: To me that is a good counter example of what I mean as a fabricated example of rolling over and saying \"fuck it\" (cf. GF's genuine version).<br>\n<br>\nNow moving on:<br>\n<br>\nRegarding JJ I really don't feel the need to revise my wariness of him. He posts a lot, and he doesn't seem to have made any scum-slips. But does that really make him Mr Town 2014? I wouldn't have thought so. If anyone deserves a prize for being Mr Town 2014 its you. You have been incessant in your proverbial knives to throats.<br>\n<br>\nSo overall my current status: I would be ok with a lynch on bjc, though i'd be opposed to cutting short the time we have available for further scum-hunting by lynching him immediately. I'd like to see some pressure on Kaboom. I'd oppose lynches on GreyICE and GF, and likely oppose a lynch on JJ (certainly D1 anyway). Anything else isn't worth the paper its written on (apart from my aforementioned dislike/suspicion of Rob W, but as you rightly point out it doesn't look like we'll see him again - if he does come back I would, obviously, like to get some answers).<br>\n<br>\n@ JJ: I don't like to throw out confident town/scum assertions on D1. To me D1 is simply hoping for scum slips and/or using your experience to read players you've played with before. Being analytical and tentative is all I have on D1 since I lack the ability to contribute in other ways.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kaboooooom</span></div></blockquote>\n\nlurking- check!<br>\n<br>\ntrying to blend- check!<br>\n<br>\ntrying to be friendly- check!<br>\n<br>\ndiverting attention- check!<br>\n<br>\nah!!

Question mark if bjc were to flip town.<br>\n- FoD is not as null, but because he's presumably an alt or experienced with Mafia elsewhere he doesn't have anything I can reference (his one finished game was lol). So similarly I am tying his alignment to bjc's.<br>\n<br>\nIf I were a betting man i'd say town, obviously because I think bjc is scum.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also a lot of people flying below the radar right now, and I suspect not all of them have been suddenly overwhelmed with work.

You want him lynched, you should have good reasons and tell me why. I'm pretty sure you'll agree that looking through anyone's iso, you can find a lot of things that are off or scummy. When I ask you for reasons, I'm not going to be satisfied with \"lol look through his iso fuckwit idiot\" (not sure what more you called me, but those are what stuck with me). In fact I'm going to assume the wagon is full of crap. I had two people refer me to iso's (of different players) for reasons and not a single iso was enough to convince even a single person on the bjc wagon had a reason to. So when you say \"look through his iso\" I'm going to assume even more that you're full of shit. Add to that your shitty attitude and yes, I'm going to be weary of the bjc wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI also dislike the current trend of people being called sheeping when they follow someone's else reasoning. When did this trend start? <br>\n<br>\nAlso, this is not a game with solo star players, stop acting like god's gift to mafiascum and get real. Now, onto that post of yours.<br>\n<br>\nI like you finally giving your reasons. All in all, I like this post, aside from the last line, but that's your attitude shining through again. I hate to say it, but I guess I was wrong about you. I think you're town. I'm willing to hammer bjc as my lynch candidates aren't going anywhere.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nQuick rundown, scum is lootifer and kaboom. Third one, I don't really know. That player with the fuck the police nickname. I keep forgetting he's in the game (him and that meme guy's name, need to keep looking it up). Is he lurking? Has he posted anything substantial?

There are two wagons that have a threat of getting up on day 1. One of them was scum, the other of them was RobW - me. I understand I have the advantage of knowing Rob's alignment is town. <br>\n<br>\nSo here's what happened. bjc is getting strung up, scum are attempting to divert to a mislynch on a lurker. Looking at the wagon above, FoD has already townflipped, I have a big town read on greyice and JJCool.

This makes no sense as scum. Scum want RobW to stay so that he remains a useless slot and provides fodder to push the lynch to. If someone replaces in and starts providing useful content, then they have no alternative lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThis makes Lootifer town in my book.<br>\n<br>\nSo this wagon has 4/5 as people I think are very likely to be town. This at least puts Natishira in good company.<br>\n<br>\nMy wagon has 1 person I (now) think is town, Goodfather. It also has bjc. The other two are kabooom and Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore kaboom and Slandaar are both good options for scum.<br>\n<br>\nOf the people off the wagon - <br>\n<br>\nMy Milked Eek defended bjc balls out, which is bad. <br>\nBut he didn't actually try to redirect the wagon anywhere. He voted GreyICE - a wagon that was never going to get up - and did very little other than proclaim how much he thought bjc was town. I don't want to get too WIFOM-y, but I have a gut read that this isn't how scum plays here. If MME were scum, all he would have achieved was link himself with his scummate without actually doing anything effective to help him. A much more likely play is the one that I think happened - push the wagon off scum and onto a lurker. <br>\nI'm unconvinced that MME is a scum mate of bjc.<br>\n<br>\nRobW is me.<br>\n<br>\nphokdapolees hasn't given me anything to talk about. He was straddling between the two big wagons, eventually voted bjc at a point where he could have not.

There are two wagons that have a threat of getting up on day 1.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> One of them was scum *and here*</div>, the other of them was RobW - me. I understand I have the advantage of knowing Rob's alignment is town. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So here's what happened. bjc is getting strung up, scum are attempting to divert to a mislynch on a lurker.*and finally here*</div> Looking at the wagon above, FoD has already townflipped, I have a big town read on greyice and JJCool.

Not guaranteed a read on any replacement but surely we'd have more information than status quo.</div></blockquote>\n\nHe directly asks for a replacement on the guy that the scum are trying to divert a lynch TO. This makes no sense as scum. Scum want RobW to stay so that he remains a useless slot and provides fodder to push the lynch to. If someone replaces in and starts providing useful content, then they have no alternative lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThis makes Lootifer town in my book.<br>\n<br>\nSo this wagon has 4/5 as people I think are very likely to be town. This at least puts Natishira in good company.<br>\n<br>\nMy wagon has 1 person I (now) think is town, Goodfather. It also has bjc. The other two are kabooom and Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore kaboom and Slandaar are both good options for scum.<br>\n<br>\nOf the people off the wagon - <br>\n<br>\nMy Milked Eek defended bjc balls out, which is bad. <br>\nBut he didn't actually try to redirect the wagon anywhere. He voted GreyICE - a wagon that was never going to get up - and did very little other than proclaim how much he thought bjc was town. I don't want to get too WIFOM-y, but I have a gut read that this isn't how scum plays here. If MME were scum, all he would have achieved was link himself with his scummate without actually doing anything effective to help him. A much more likely play is the one that I think happened - push the wagon off scum and onto a lurker. <br>\nI'm unconvinced that MME is a scum mate of bjc.<br>\n<br>\nRobW is me.<br>\n<br>\nphokdapolees hasn't given me anything to talk about. He was straddling between the two big wagons, eventually voted bjc at a point where he could have not. It guts to me as town, but his position is questionable.<br>\n<br>\nand PeregrineV was deciding whether or not he wanted to be on the bjc wagon.

A string of one liners and simple votes isn't much to glean information from.<br>\n<br>\nI had a somewhat decent town read on nat and then zekrom, well I don't know what the hell he is doing. He's posting a lot and saying little. His questions and remarks are confusing and/or useless and seems to me to look active. On natirasha, I find <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5625651#p5625651\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> to be a minor flag. He did answer to that already. His iso is also a bit barren. I'm not that comfortable with a zekrom lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nAs for lootifer, I really don't like how he handled the wagon on bjc. I asked for reasons and he directed me to fucking nowhere. He said to read two iso's, in which I couldn't find anything serious enough to be honest, to find his reasons. If I had to pick someone out of the bjc wagon who looks like he was bussing, it would have to be lootifer. <br>\n<br>\nAnd per, well, I really like the reasons greyice mentioned (lol), although I don't like how grey assumes per would be able to fabricate a fake claim and thus auto-assumes a VT claim would be enough to clear him. I don't think it's enough to deter me from thinking he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nI don't remember anything per and phok have done in this game before rereading. Out of these two, per is most likely scum because I couldn't remember him _at all_.

I thought your reaction to the analysis was questionable, and looked self-defensive rather than anything else. But when I thought about it, I realised that at least you were posting content, and it can be easy to be distracted by the people who are actually saying things (especially when you disagree with them). Instead, there was a huge chunk of the playing group who were simply not saying anything at all. So rather than nitpick through your posts, I tried to change my efforts to focus on getting more material to analyse from the other guys.<br>\n<br>\nAnd you are actually doing SOMETHING to find scum. I'm not saying it's good, but it's something. You're engaging with the game and showing evidence that you're looking at it and caring about different people and their reactions.<br>\n<br>\nYou also had your softclaim thing on kabooom. I hate softclaims. I don't think they're scummy or townie - just obfuscating and awful. If I were scum, I'd kill you. if you're a town power role, this is a bad, bad thing. If you're a vanilla townie, then it's okish, but it also means we've given no scrutiny to kaboom at all off your random gut feeling dressed up as something more. That's gross, and fundamentally unhelpful. So if you're town and doing this, it's just bad either way.<br>\n<br>\nIf your softclaim whatever is true, though, and you and kabooom are town, then that does affect my perceptions of the wagon from yesterday in a difficult way. It would mean that bjc was probably the only scum on the RobW wagon, and it makes me wonder where the others are. Which makes me more likely to think of Peregrine and MME as scum. <br>\n<br>\nIn terms of actual scumminess coming from you -<br>\nI get the impression that you're voting Lootifer over me because he's an easier target. I could list all the times you talked about things I've done as scummy, including nonsense like putting dead players in my scum-&gt;town list or saying 'town in my book' instead of town. I literally can't think of any reason why I'd be more likely to do that as scum than town. It feels like you've been picking at me all day to see if you can get any traction, and after getting little-&gt;none you've switched onto an easier target. Then there's the technical aspect that I've gone on about before. It just feels wrong to now push on him.<br>\n<br>\nI also found your listing PeregrineV as your third highest scum read hugely surprising, given at least one of the other two was me and I've pushed PV since the start of the day. Then completely backing off that scum read after his claim. <br>\n<br>\nSo yes. My feelings on you are nuanced. I could see you as a town who I fundamentally disagree with on playstyle, theory and reads. I could see you as scum. But there are better lynches at this point for sure.", "time": "Thu Feb 13, 2014 2:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=36986&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "36986"}

As a fellow newbie I have gone through his (GF's) exact thought process every time pressure has come on (in fact one such example happened not 5 minutes ago): the temptation to roll over and say \"fuck it\" (see: 36) is a strong one, and him doing so struck me as a genuine, rather than fabricated, reaction. As such Kabooms case, which is fairly elaborate, stood out as odd. The merits of Kaboom vs. GF in my mind were further emphasised by two experienced players coming out and reading town on GF -  I am assuming there's at least <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> genuine town-aligned advice in there.<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least bjc. I am reading him as scum, but unfortunately I think it's 80% to do with being influenced by the cases put forth by other people and 20% my own thought. I kind of see what other people are seeing in his posts, but I am having to admit to myself that I didn't see it first pass. Though 171 is useful: To me that is a good counter example of what I mean as a fabricated example of rolling over and saying \"fuck it\" (cf. GF's genuine version).<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nSo overall my current status: I would be ok with a lynch on bjc, though i'd be opposed to cutting short the time we have available for further scum-hunting by lynching him immediately. I'd like to see some pressure on Kaboom. I'd oppose lynches on GreyICE and GF, and likely oppose a lynch on JJ (certainly D1 anyway). Anything else isn't worth the paper its written on (apart from my aforementioned dislike/suspicion of Rob W, but as you rightly point out it doesn't look like we'll see him again - if he does come back I would, obviously, like to get some answers).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kaboooooom</span></div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nIt's really two separate actions.
