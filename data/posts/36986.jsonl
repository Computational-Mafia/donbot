Some of them are so important they're listed here as well, because redundancy is your friend.<br>2. Play to win. Most players want to win legitimately, don't ruin their enjoyment by playing against your wincon.<br>3. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this thread, don't do it.<br>4. Do not quote anywhere any PMs between you and me (including role PMs), or anything else that originated outside of the game thread. This includes PM timestamps and anything else which games the system. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that.<br>6. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. I make and edit posts using the <span style=\"color:darkred; font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">ooc</span> tag, please do not use it.<br>7. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread or QTs I provide you until I have announced that the game is over.<br>8. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>10. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule. It's up to my discretion whether I think you pretended to break or rule or not, so if you're not sure, ask first.<br>11. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil. I will have very little tolerance if someone complains about the way you're talking to them.<br>12. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>13. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be updated here as well as posted in thread.<br>14. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>15. If I happen to not be online but you know the game is over (for example, if scum get a quicklynch in during LyLo), please let me post the final scene before revealing the ending or otherwise discussing the game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Voting Rules</span></span><br>1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Activity Rules</span></span><br>1. Prod system: Players who have not posted for 72 hours will be prodded; players who do not post within 36 hours of a prod will be replaced. If you were to be prodded twice over a game Day or thrice over the whole game, you may be replaced at my discretion. If you have declared V/LA, you may be exempted from prods during that time at my discretion.<br>2. In the event replacements are necessary, the deadline may be extended at my discretion.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Deadlines</span></span><br>1. Day will have a deadline of fourteen real life days. <br>2. Night will have a deadline of three real life days.<br>3. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Game Setup</span></span><br>This game has been approved for normalcy and balance. Normal game rules can be found <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">here.</a><br><br>It is guaranteed that at least 1 person will receive the following Vanilla Townie role PM:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Hello, (name)!

If anything the first days lynch sets the pace for the rest of the game. So, we need to be careful with who we lynch today. If you all truly think i am scum, then keep your votes as they are. Frankly, I welcome the pressure. The problem is it'll only take a few more people to jump on my lynch-wagon and then dp1 ends 13 days early with a town lynch... that is an inauspicious start to a game...</div></blockquote><br><br>So martyr complex, crappy theorycrafting, threatening the town, and promising content in the future?<br><br>Does this...

I see its my turn to stand in front of the GreyICE firing squad.<br><br>Well best I start with the promised content before JJ and Grey explode with an overload of group-think (and to be fair I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> promise material):<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5622814#p5622814\" class=\"postlink\">My problem with Kaboom</a> is primarily due to his suspicion of GF, which is based on my town-read of GF. As a fellow newbie I have gone through his (GF's) exact thought process every time pressure has come on (in fact one such example happened not 5 minutes ago): the temptation to roll over and say \"fuck it\" (see: 36) is a strong one, and him doing so struck me as a genuine, rather than fabricated, reaction. As such Kabooms case, which is fairly elaborate, stood out as odd. The merits of Kaboom vs. GF in my mind were further emphasised by two experienced players coming out and reading town on GF -  I am assuming there's at least <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> genuine town-aligned advice in there.<br><br>Next I have a confession: I didn't (at the time) have anything meaningful on FoD. I had a gut feel, and it was to do with \"sheeping\" - I immediately associated sheeping with scum. I have since come to realise that sheeping isn't necessarily scummy behavior, and when you just roll out with it openly you can hardly use that as an argument for scummyness (WIFOM).<br><br>Since then I have been getting a gut read building on FoD, but nothing I feel is worth reporting on. And in case you hadn't realised by now I am not very assertive with my early reads: this is an intended passive style, not everyone suits the \"YOU'RE SCUM, DIE MOTHER FUCKER\" style of play.<br><br>Last but not least bjc. I am reading him as scum, but unfortunately I think it's 80% to do with being influenced by the cases put forth by other people and 20% my own thought. I kind of see what other people are seeing in his posts, but I am having to admit to myself that I didn't see it first pass. Though 171 is useful: To me that is a good counter example of what I mean as a fabricated example of rolling over and saying \"fuck it\" (cf. GF's genuine version).<br><br>Now moving on:<br><br>Regarding JJ I really don't feel the need to revise my wariness of him. He posts a lot, and he doesn't seem to have made any scum-slips. But does that really make him Mr Town 2014? I wouldn't have thought so. If anyone deserves a prize for being Mr Town 2014 its you. You have been incessant in your proverbial knives to throats.<br><br>So overall my current status: I would be ok with a lynch on bjc, though i'd be opposed to cutting short the time we have available for further scum-hunting by lynching him immediately. I'd like to see some pressure on Kaboom. I'd oppose lynches on GreyICE and GF, and likely oppose a lynch on JJ (certainly D1 anyway). Anything else isn't worth the paper its written on (apart from my aforementioned dislike/suspicion of Rob W, but as you rightly point out it doesn't look like we'll see him again - if he does come back I would, obviously, like to get some answers).<br><br>@ JJ: I don't like to throw out confident town/scum assertions on D1. To me D1 is simply hoping for scum slips and/or using your experience to read players you've played with before. Being analytical and tentative is all I have on D1 since I lack the ability to contribute in other ways.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kaboooooom</span>"}

At no point of your post did you even mention PeregrineV, and suddenly you pop in a vote from nowhere on a random player with no mention, or any logical link from what led you to vote PeregrineV.<br><br>Bad.

I see its my turn to stand in front of the GreyICE firing squad.<br><br>Well best I start with the promised content before JJ and Grey explode with an overload of group-think (and to be fair I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> promise material):<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5622814#p5622814\" class=\"postlink\">My problem with Kaboom</a> is primarily due to his suspicion of GF, which is based on my town-read of GF. As a fellow newbie I have gone through his (GF's) exact thought process every time pressure has come on (in fact one such example happened not 5 minutes ago): the temptation to roll over and say \"fuck it\" (see: 36) is a strong one, and him doing so struck me as a genuine, rather than fabricated, reaction. As such Kabooms case, which is fairly elaborate, stood out as odd. The merits of Kaboom vs. GF in my mind were further emphasised by two experienced players coming out and reading town on GF -  I am assuming there's at least <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> genuine town-aligned advice in there.<br><br>Next I have a confession: I didn't (at the time) have anything meaningful on FoD. I had a gut feel, and it was to do with \"sheeping\" - I immediately associated sheeping with scum. I have since come to realise that sheeping isn't necessarily scummy behavior, and when you just roll out with it openly you can hardly use that as an argument for scummyness (WIFOM).<br><br>Since then I have been getting a gut read building on FoD, but nothing I feel is worth reporting on. And in case you hadn't realised by now I am not very assertive with my early reads: this is an intended passive style, not everyone suits the \"YOU'RE SCUM, DIE MOTHER FUCKER\" style of play.<br><br>Last but not least bjc. I am reading him as scum, but unfortunately I think it's 80% to do with being influenced by the cases put forth by other people and 20% my own thought. I kind of see what other people are seeing in his posts, but I am having to admit to myself that I didn't see it first pass. Though 171 is useful: To me that is a good counter example of what I mean as a fabricated example of rolling over and saying \"fuck it\" (cf. GF's genuine version).<br><br>Now moving on:<br><br>Regarding JJ I really don't feel the need to revise my wariness of him. He posts a lot, and he doesn't seem to have made any scum-slips. But does that really make him Mr Town 2014? I wouldn't have thought so. If anyone deserves a prize for being Mr Town 2014 its you. You have been incessant in your proverbial knives to throats.<br><br>So overall my current status: I would be ok with a lynch on bjc, though i'd be opposed to cutting short the time we have available for further scum-hunting by lynching him immediately. I'd like to see some pressure on Kaboom. I'd oppose lynches on GreyICE and GF, and likely oppose a lynch on JJ (certainly D1 anyway). Anything else isn't worth the paper its written on (apart from my aforementioned dislike/suspicion of Rob W, but as you rightly point out it doesn't look like we'll see him again - if he does come back I would, obviously, like to get some answers).<br><br>@ JJ: I don't like to throw out confident town/scum assertions on D1. To me D1 is simply hoping for scum slips and/or using your experience to read players you've played with before. Being analytical and tentative is all I have on D1 since I lack the ability to contribute in other ways.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kaboooooom</span></div></blockquote><br><br>lurking- check!<br><br>trying to blend- check!<br><br>trying to be friendly- check!<br><br>diverting attention- check!<br><br>ah!!

You want him lynched, you should have good reasons and tell me why. I'm pretty sure you'll agree that looking through anyone's iso, you can find a lot of things that are off or scummy. When I ask you for reasons, I'm not going to be satisfied with \"lol look through his iso fuckwit idiot\" (not sure what more you called me, but those are what stuck with me). In fact I'm going to assume the wagon is full of crap. I had two people refer me to iso's (of different players) for reasons and not a single iso was enough to convince even a single person on the bjc wagon had a reason to. So when you say \"look through his iso\" I'm going to assume even more that you're full of shit. Add to that your shitty attitude and yes, I'm going to be weary of the bjc wagon.<br><br>I also dislike the current trend of people being called sheeping when they follow someone's else reasoning. When did this trend start? <br><br>Also, this is not a game with solo star players, stop acting like god's gift to mafiascum and get real. Now, onto that post of yours.<br><br>I like you finally giving your reasons. All in all, I like this post, aside from the last line, but that's your attitude shining through again. I hate to say it, but I guess I was wrong about you. I think you're town. I'm willing to hammer bjc as my lynch candidates aren't going anywhere.<br><br><br>Quick rundown, scum is lootifer and kaboom. Third one, I don't really know. That player with the fuck the police nickname. I keep forgetting he's in the game (him and that meme guy's name, need to keep looking it up). Is he lurking? Has he posted anything substantial? I'm being 100% serious that I'm calling the police dude scum just because I forgot his name.<br><br>More when I'm not so tired. ._."}

I could post a case on everyone based on an iso and so could you. I'm sure that you agree that you can find scummy things in every player's iso if you look at them. So answering \"read his iso\" is telling me nothing. I wanted to see your reasons, see if they're valid, see if you're really behind the bjc wagon or just hopping along (like lootifer (is he that meme avatar guy?)). Telling me your reasons wasn't only to convince me to go along with the wagon, it was telling me about you as well. And until you provided reasons to lynch bjc, I refused to take a stance on bjc.

I don't want to get too WIFOM-y, but I have a gut read that this isn't how scum plays here. If MME were scum, all he would have achieved was link himself with his scummate without actually doing anything effective to help him.

I don't feel he interacted much with BJC, but BJC's major crime was not interacting much with people.  At all.  Just these walls of posts, which Renault's first post reminded me of (note: it's a neutral post.  It's entirely possible Renault prepared it before he got his role PM, and thus would be made without even his role information to inform him, a truly neutral reading).  That being said, Renault has followed that up by being pretty kickass.  My reading on Natirasha was never better than null, but her admitting that her vote on BJC was a YOLOVOTE does win some town points (why do that on a buddy?

I don't want you to take that personally (seriously!), it's that they're usually prepared prior to having any involvement with the game, and often prior to even receiving your role PM.  They're often highly misleading - scum who replace in can have an awesome post, but be unable to follow up their suspicions properly because of the knowledge of their buddies - but the strength of that awesome post can carry them quite far.  Frankly I consider them a mild scum tell - they're a way to look useful without particularly saying much, more or less recapping a day I've already read.  That being said, it's a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">mild</span> scumtell, and your play has been otherwise great (and, as I said, I have no particular scum feelings about Rob - any bad feelings are more his play than his alignment)."}

I thought your reaction to the analysis was questionable, and looked self-defensive rather than anything else. But when I thought about it, I realised that at least you were posting content, and it can be easy to be distracted by the people who are actually saying things (especially when you disagree with them). Instead, there was a huge chunk of the playing group who were simply not saying anything at all. So rather than nitpick through your posts, I tried to change my efforts to focus on getting more material to analyse from the other guys.<br><br>And you are actually doing SOMETHING to find scum. I'm not saying it's good, but it's something. You're engaging with the game and showing evidence that you're looking at it and caring about different people and their reactions.<br><br>You also had your softclaim thing on kabooom. I hate softclaims. I don't think they're scummy or townie - just obfuscating and awful. If I were scum, I'd kill you. if you're a town power role, this is a bad, bad thing. If you're a vanilla townie, then it's okish, but it also means we've given no scrutiny to kaboom at all off your random gut feeling dressed up as something more. That's gross, and fundamentally unhelpful. So if you're town and doing this, it's just bad either way.<br><br>If your softclaim whatever is true, though, and you and kabooom are town, then that does affect my perceptions of the wagon from yesterday in a difficult way. It would mean that bjc was probably the only scum on the RobW wagon, and it makes me wonder where the others are. Which makes me more likely to think of Peregrine and MME as scum. <br><br>In terms of actual scumminess coming from you -<br>I get the impression that you're voting Lootifer over me because he's an easier target. I could list all the times you talked about things I've done as scummy, including nonsense like putting dead players in my scum-&gt;town list or saying 'town in my book' instead of town. I literally can't think of any reason why I'd be more likely to do that as scum than town. It feels like you've been picking at me all day to see if you can get any traction, and after getting little-&gt;none you've switched onto an easier target. Then there's the technical aspect that I've gone on about before. It just feels wrong to now push on him.<br><br>I also found your listing PeregrineV as your third highest scum read hugely surprising, given at least one of the other two was me and I've pushed PV since the start of the day.

If it works (and bjc certainly seemed to think there was a chance it would) you save your scumbuddy.  You get a lynch on RobW, you can night kill someone who was pushing BJC, you have the town better in hand.  Day 1 scum lynch, makes everything harder.  You're down a scum, your buddy could be someone like Phok or Loot who you have no confidence in, you're on the edge.  And if it doesn't work?  \"Only town would defend scum that hard!  Even though I wasn't really defending him, I was just attacking GreyICE!  Which served to take the focus away from bjc's play entirely, which hopefully would cause the town to move, and I can say that I never really read him.\"<br><br>As for your posting patterns being coincidence?  Really?  You really think anyone wants you alive in LyLo?  Anyone at all?  <br><br>Nah.  You're better off dead a hell of a long way before LyLo."}

I hated his play day 1.  PV claimed VT in a \"oh well, if you lynch me you lynch me, I understand my play isn't great\" way.  That feels more town.  Lootifier, otoh, lurks when pressured, and generally produces more noise than content (this post is an excellent example of a noise post: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5632384#p5632384\">viewtopic.php?p=5632384#p5632384</a><!-- l -->).

Nice try, though.<br><br>I'm just confused about your reaction to the claim. It sounds that you don't really believe the claim. I'm not sure, your wording is _really_ vague. However, prior to the claim you said<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5678567#p5678567\" class=\"postlink\">post 597</a>, The Goodfather wrote:</cite>i'm still prepared to personally hammer if his post/claim makes no sense.

As a fellow newbie I have gone through his (GF's) exact thought process every time pressure has come on (in fact one such example happened not 5 minutes ago): the temptation to roll over and say \"fuck it\" (see: 36) is a strong one, and him doing so struck me as a genuine, rather than fabricated, reaction. As such Kabooms case, which is fairly elaborate, stood out as odd. The merits of Kaboom vs. GF in my mind were further emphasised by two experienced players coming out and reading town on GF -  I am assuming there's at least <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> genuine town-aligned advice in there.<br><br>...<br><br>Last but not least bjc. I am reading him as scum, but unfortunately I think it's 80% to do with being influenced by the cases put forth by other people and 20% my own thought. I kind of see what other people are seeing in his posts, but I am having to admit to myself that I didn't see it first pass. Though 171 is useful: To me that is a good counter example of what I mean as a fabricated example of rolling over and saying \"fuck it\" (cf. GF's genuine version).<br><br>...<br><br>So overall my current status: I would be ok with a lynch on bjc, though i'd be opposed to cutting short the time we have available for further scum-hunting by lynching him immediately. I'd like to see some pressure on Kaboom. I'd oppose lynches on GreyICE and GF, and likely oppose a lynch on JJ (certainly D1 anyway).
